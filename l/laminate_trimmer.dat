25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, Variable speed Routers, <b>Laminate</b> <b>Trimmer,</b> CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have variable speed controls and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|E

25|$|Related to the router is a smaller, lighter version {{designed}} specifically for <b>trimming</b> <b>laminates.</b> It {{can be used for}} smaller general routing work. For example, with an appropriate jig it can be used for recessing door hinges and recessing lock faceplates. Even rotary tools can be used as routers when the right bits and accessories (such as a plastic router base) are attached.|$|R
50|$|Self or wood edge plastic {{laminate}} countertops {{are also very}} popular for those who chose to have few or no surface seams. In this style, the top shop uses substrate for the countertop out of MDF, or particle board and then glue sheets of laminate to the substrate using Contact Cement. The <b>laminate</b> is then <b>trimmed</b> using a router. This method can't reproduce the curved contours of post-formed countertopping but {{can be made to}} easily conform to a much-wider range of floor plans with fewer seams.|$|R
50|$|Some woodworkers keep a chamfer or roundover bit {{permanently}} {{installed in a}} small <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer,</b> since these operations are so frequently performed on many projects. This frees their main router (or router table) to do other types of work without having to constantly change between bits.|$|E
50|$|Laminate {{trimmers}} {{have evolved}} {{to the point where}} they are essentially fully functional miniature routers. Apart from trimming and flushing, they can be used for jointing, rounding edges, chamfering, routing grooves and dados, dovetails, even mortise and tenons. A modern <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer</b> can perform almost any task that a larger handheld router can do, with the caveat that the smaller machine may be limited in the size of bit that can physically fit within its collet and the base plate. Larger bits, e.g. those that fit a 1/2-inch collet or those with larger blade diameters than the laminate trimmer's smaller baseplate hole, cannot be used at all. The reduced power of a <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer</b> (3/4 to 1 hp, as opposed to a typical router's 1-3 hp) may also make it unsuitable for heavy-duty router work.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer</b> {{is a small}} {{version of}} a wood router, {{normally}} used to trim laminate such as Formica. It generally has a 1/4-inch collet. Typical laminate trimmers spin their bits at up to 30,000 RPM. Some models provide variable speed control. Manufacturers of note include Dewalt, Ryobi, Porter Cable, Ridgid, Makita and RotoZip (Bosch) ...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of {{the damage}} induced by {{machining}} of fibre-reinforced composites is usually performed by measuring surface roughness. Contact-based surface profilometers are the most used equipment in industry; however, {{it has been found}} that there are performance limitations which may result when used to measure machined heterogeneous composite surfaces. In this research, surface roughness is characterised using a commercial non-contact optical method, and compared with a conventional stylus profilometer. Unidirectional and multidirectional carbon fibre <b>laminates</b> were edge <b>trimmed</b> and slot milled. The variation in surface roughness was compared using different tool types, fibre orientations and cutting parameters. Surface damage and cutting mechanisms were assessed by using scanning electron microscope images, and the suitability of roughness parameters were also analysed including: Sa, Skewness and Kurtosis. Using the optical system allowed accurate roughness calculation of individual plies on a multidirectional laminate with different fibre orientations. The research has also shown that the optical system, including the use of areal roughness parameters, can increase the accuracy of roughness measurement for machined fibrous composite surfaces and is less sensitive to measurement position than the stylus...|$|R
40|$|Carbon fiber-reinforced {{plastics}} (CFRP) {{have seen}} {{a significant increase in}} use over the years thanks to their specific properties. Despite continuous improvements in the production methods of <b>laminated</b> parts, a <b>trimming</b> operation is still necessary to achieve the functional dimensions required by engineering specifications. Laminates made of carbon fibers are very abrasive and cause rapid tool wear, and require high cutting temperatures. This creates damage to the epoxy matrix, whose glass-transition temperature is often recognized to be about 180 °C. This study aims to highlight the influence of the cutting temperature generated by tool wear on the surface finish and mechanical properties obtained from tensile tests. Trimming operations were performed on a quasi-isotropic 24 -ply carbon/epoxy laminate, of 3. 6 mm thickness, with a 6 flutes diamond-coated (CVD) cutter. The test specimens of 6 mm and 12 mm wide were obtained by trimming. The reduced width of the coupons allowed amplification of the effect of defects on the measured properties by increasing the proportion of coupon cross-section occupied by the defects. A new tool and a tool in an advanced state of wear were used to generate different cutting temperatures. Results showed a cutting temperature of 300 °C for the new tool and 475 °C for the worn tool. The analysis revealed that the specimens machined with the new tool have no thermal damage and the cut is clean. The plies oriented at − 45 ° presented the worst surface finish according to the failure mode of the fiber. For the worn tool, the surface was degraded and the matrix was carbonized. After cutting, observations showed a degraded resin spread on the machined surface, which reduced the surface roughness and hid the cutting defects. In support of these observations, the tensile tests showed no variation of the mechanical properties for the 12 mm-wide specimens, but did show a 10 % loss in mechanical properties for the 6 mm-wide specimens. These results suggest that the thermal defects caused by tool wear affect tensile properties, but only from a certain coupon width below which the machining defects increase their influence on the properties...|$|R
50|$|Laminate {{trimmers}} evolved, {{as their}} name suggests, as a specialized tool {{for that particular}} trade. Veneers are typically cut oversize before being laminated to their wooden substrates. A <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer</b> equipped with a bearing-guided flush trimming bit {{can be used to}} cut the veneer to its final size. The bearing guides the bit around the outside edge of the wood substrate, making a clean cut exactly along the edge. Laminate trimmers excel at this task due to their light weight and one-handed operation.|$|E
5000|$|High {{pressure}} laminates or (HPL) {{are made}} from resin and paper components under high pressure; in contrast, ordinary wood does not sustain such pressures, and can be crushed to less than half its natural thickness in a hand operated arbor press. The high pressure squeezes the HPL to such a solid density that it becomes highly resistant to damage simply because any utensil or tool striking the HPL {{will not have a}} force greater than the force used to form the HPL itself. In effect, the HPL has been dented in advance. HPL can be decorated in any pattern and is applied using contact cement and pressed in place using a [...] "J-roller." [...] It is cut slightly larger than the panel on which it is to be installed and trimmed using a router-like <b>laminate</b> <b>trimmer</b> along the edge. It may also be filed to obtain the final edge. While HPL became prevalent in the twentieth century, since the 1970s the trend has been away from HPL in favor of wood.|$|E
