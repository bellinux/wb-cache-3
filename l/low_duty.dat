500|$|The Act next {{establishes}} a uniform duty towards all lawful visitors, thus abolishing {{the distinction between}} contractors, invitees and licensees. Section 2 provides that the occupier extend a [...] "common duty of care" [...] to all lawful visitors, although it keeps the <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> of care towards unlawful visitors such as trespassers. This duty is described as [...] "a duty to take such care as in all {{the circumstances of the}} case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the occupier to be there". The Act allows the occupier to set limits on where the visitor is allowed to go or how long they are allowed to be there, an extension of the common law judgment made by Scrutton LJ in The Calgarth , when he said that [...] "when you invite a person into your house to use the staircase, you do not invite him to slide down the bannisters, you invite him to use the staircase in the ordinary way in which it is used".|$|E

Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce {{friction and}} tool wear.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of InGaN/GaN LEDs degradation under dc and pulsed current conditions. The analysis {{was carried out by}} means of current-voltage and optical power measurements, scanning electron microscopy and EDS maps. Identified degradation modes were leakage and generation/recombination current increase, series resistance increase and output power decrease, related to the high temperatures reached by the devices during stress. Failure analysis revealed degradation of anode contacts and Ti-W reflector, which can be related to the measured series resistance increase. Comparison between dc and pulsed stress carried out with the same average current indicated that pulsed driving does not imply an acceleration in the degradation rate, except for the <b>lowest</b> <b>duty</b> cycles...|$|R

50|$|The main {{drawback}} of {{this device}} is that, {{as a result}} of the variation in the frequency of the oscillating voltage supply, only a very small fraction of the ions leaving the source are captured in phase-stable orbits of maximum radius and energy with the result that the output beam current has a <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> cycle, and the average beam current is only a small fraction of the instantaneous beam current. Thus the machine produces high energy ions, though with comparatively low intensity.|$|E
50|$|In beacon-enabled networks, {{the special}} network nodes called zigbee Routers {{transmit}} periodic beacons to confirm their presence to other network nodes. Nodes may sleep between beacons, thus lowering their duty cycle and extending their battery life.

30|$|It is {{more likely}} that RTAs can affect the order of {{international}} trade flows as they are signed {{to pave the way for}} trade between member countries, but their actual impact on trade flows remains controversial. Estimates in studies are highly variable, demonstrating a lack of robustness (Cipollina and Salvatici 2010; Ghosh and Yamarik 2004; Head and Mayer 2014). Several studies talked about trade diversion, i.e., when two countries gain from their bilateral trade agreement, third country will be affected negatively due to losing market share in member countries. For example, some authors find that RTAs generate large trade flows between members, albeit often at the expense of third countries (e.g., Caliendo and Parro 2015; Egger and Larch 2011; Egger and Wamser 2013; Fugazza and Nicita 2013; Grant and Lambert 2008). The impact of RTAs on trade flows tends to be lower than often expected due to large number of goods subject to <b>low</b> <b>duties</b> (Carpenter and Lendle 2011).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his {{appointment}} as secretary of state for war to succeed Abel Servien, forced out by court intrigue, he was 47 years old. From 1640 Sublet de Noyers and his rival Léon Bouthillier, comte de Chavigny, secretary of state for foreign affairs, were the closest political collaborators with Louis XIII and Richelieu, between whom Sublet de Noyers transmitted confidential information, interpreting the one to the other. As the minister responsible for carrying on the all but constant state of war from 1636 to 1643, war with Spain, peasant revolts in the provinces, the opening stages of the Fronde, Sublet de Noyers assumed a prominent position in the Conseil. The King, who considered him at first merely one of Richelieu's [...] "lost souls", warmed to him by degrees, won over by his austere piety and his service to the party of the Dévots; eventually Louis entrusted him with even the <b>low</b> <b>duties</b> of evicting from court the Cardinal's enemies, like Cinq-Mars.|$|R
50|$|Pulses {{produced}} by this method have average power levels {{on the order}} of several tens of microwatts. The peak power during the pulses can be many orders of magnitude higher due to the <b>low</b> <b>duty</b> cycle of mostly >1%, which is dependent on the repetition rate of the laser source. The maximum bandwidth of the resulting THz pulse is primarily limited by the duration of the laser pulse, while the frequency position of the maximum of the Fourier spectrum is determined by the carrier lifetime of the semiconductor.|$|E

The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo.

One of the fastest rates of industrialisation occurred in the late 20th century across four countries known as the Asian tigers (Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), thanks to the existence of stable governments and well structured societies, strategic locations, heavy foreign investments, a low cost skilled and motivated workforce, a competitive exchange rate, and <b>low</b> custom <b>duties.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ellis Henry Roberts’ Government Revenue, Especially the American System. An Argument for Industrial Freedom vindicates {{the policy}} of favoring {{developing}} domestic commerce over foreign commerce which protectionism does best. Roberts was {{also a member of}} the American Protective Tariff League. He stated that the tariff has been one of the main reasons why our production has been augmented. When we have had <b>low</b> <b>duties</b> something equivalent to free trade our, industries were battered and depressed, but they have thrived when protectionism was the policy. He saw the precious home market as for the home trade which was monumental, and were it to invite foreign commerce the home market would be sacrificed, and national sovereignty will be in peril. Thus, for strategic purposes the government should favor producers rather than those that exploit trade in all laws that it makes. Roberts considered the most benevolent act of good will that any people can perform to the public welfare is to not engage in what favors foreign commerce what trade likes most but to foster the diversity of employments , produce. He also thought that the legislator who seeks to have his nation engage in commerce without developing a diversity of employments acts like a person making the gravest of mistakes.|$|R
