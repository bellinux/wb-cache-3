5|$|Little {{is known}} of Maya merchants, {{although}} they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, {{it is known that}} at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> trading expeditions. The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> trading that was the preserve of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Long</b> <b>distance</b> {{trade routes}} were {{developed}} in the Chalcolithic Period.

5|$|One of {{the vital}} {{instruments}} which facilitated <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> trade was portage and the domestication of beasts of burden. Organized caravans, visible by the 2nd millennium BCE, could carry goods across a large distance as fodder was mostly available along the way. The domestication of camels allowed Arabian nomads {{to control the}} <b>long</b> <b>distance</b> trade in spices and silk from the Far East to the Arabian Peninsula. Caravans were useful in long-distance trade largely for carrying luxury goods, the transportation of cheaper goods across large distances was not profitable for caravan operators. With productive developments in iron and bronze technologies, newer trade routes– dispensing innovations of civilizations– began to rise.|$|E

Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies. An Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.|$|E
