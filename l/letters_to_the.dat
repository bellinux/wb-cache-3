5|$|In {{one of the}} Marcinkus's <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian envoy, Bronius Balutis, {{he notes}} that he shot down his first German bomber, a Dornier Do 17 in March. Marcinkus also wrote that he was {{gathering}} skills and knowledge {{in order to make}} a contribution towards liberating Lithuania and restoring its independence.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus now sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Senate denouncing Elagabalus as the False Antoninus and {{claiming}} he was insane. Both consuls and other high-ranking members of Rome's leadership condemned Elagabalus, and the Senate subsequently {{declared war on}} both Elagabalus and Julia Maesa.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{both sides}} {{unleashed}} diplomatic offensives. The Knights dispatched <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarchs of Europe, preaching their usual crusade against the heathens; Władysław countered {{with his own}} <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarchs, accusing the Order of planning to conquer the whole world. Such appeals successfully recruited many foreign knights to each side. Wenceslas IV of Bohemia signed a defensive treaty with the Poles against the Teutonic Order; his brother, Sigismund of Luxembourg, allied himself with the Order and declared war against Poland on 12 July, though his Hungarian vassals refused his call to arms.|$|E

5|$|Andrew sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holy See, {{describing}} his cousin as an immoral tyrant. He wanted to replace Sigismund with Stephen {{with the assistance}} of the pope, England and Poland, but they received no support. Pope Clement VIII invited him to Rome, but he refused. At the pope's request, Sigismund Báthory allowed Andrew's mother and Stephen's wife, along with their children, to move to Poland. Zamoyski, who strongly opposed Sigismund Báthory's anti-Ottoman policy, supported Andrew and Stephen.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte {{rejected}} this support: {{the party}} of independence sought to establish a constitutional monarchy headed by Charlotte, but she preferred to retain the power of an absolutist monarchy. Consequently, she denounced the letter and organized the detention of Diego Paroissien. Paroissien, who had several <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> criollos, was charged with high treason. Castelli was his lawyer.|$|E

5|$|Cuthbert died on 26 October 760, and {{was later}} {{considered}} a saint with a feast day of 26 October. He was buried in his church of St. John, {{and was the first}} Archbishop of Canterbury that was not buried in St Augustine's Abbey. His <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon missionaries on the European continent show him to have been highly educated.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Middle Kingdom, greater {{standardization}} of the epistolary formula can be seen, {{for example in}} a series of model letters taken from dispatches sent to the Semna fortress of Nubia during the reign of Amenemhat III (r. 1860–1814 BC). Epistles were also written during all three dynasties of the New Kingdom. While <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dead had been written since the Old Kingdom, the writing of petition letters in epistolary form to deities began in the Ramesside Period, becoming very popular during the Persian and Ptolemaic periods.|$|E

He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, the Al Khalifas {{used the}} same tactic when the British tried to {{overpower}} Bahrain. Writing <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persians and Ottomans, Al Khalifas agreed to place Bahrain under the latter's protection in March due to offering better conditions. Eventually the Government of British India overpowered Bahrain when the Persians refused to protect it. Colonel Pelly signed a new treaty with Al Khalifas placing Bahrain under British rule and protection.|$|E
5|$|John Sigismund {{showed a}} {{particular}} interest in religious matters and initiated several debates among the representatives of diverse theological schools. The first debate was held between Lutheran and Calvinist priests in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) in January 1560. A {{year and a half}} later, John Sigismund sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> University of Wittenberg and other theological centers in Germany to seek advice on the main points of the two Protestant schools of thought.|$|E

5|$|Plans for {{combined}} operations {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols were again {{made for the}} following winter offensives, in 1301 and 1302. But in mid-1301 the island of Ruad was attacked by the Egyptian Mamluks. After a lengthy siege, the island surrendered in 1302 or 1303. The Mamluks slaughtered many of the inhabitants, and captured the surviving Templars {{to send them to}} prison in Cairo. In late 1301, Ghazan sent <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pope asking him to send troops, priests, and peasants, to make the Holy Land a Frank state again.|$|E
5|$|The accords {{had been}} {{negotiated}} by United States National Security Advisor Kissinger and North Vietnamese politburo member Lê Đức Thọ. South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu {{was not involved}} in the final negotiations, and publicly criticized the proposed agreement. However, anti-war pressures within the United States forced Nixon and Kissinger to pressure Thieu to sign the agreement and enable the withdrawal of American forces. In multiple <b>letters</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South Vietnamese president, Nixon had promised that the United States would defend Thieu's government, should the North Vietnamese violate the accords.|$|E
