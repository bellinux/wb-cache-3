25|$|This ad-hoc {{system was}} {{particularly}} popular with networks that were built {{on top of}} FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively <b>large</b> <b>file</b> transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.|$|E
25|$|Unbeknown to Hardy, however, his {{correspondence}} with Lord French had been intercepted by Collins's operatives, who compiled a <b>large</b> <b>file</b> on Hardy's life. Hardy and Parker left for Ireland in September 1920 {{and stayed in}} the Phoenix Park Hotel in Dublin, close to the British Military General Headquarters. Through Collins, a meeting between Hardy and Arthur Griffith, the Sinn Féin leader, was arranged. Hardy attempted to gain information about Collins and Robert Brennan {{with the intention of}} luring the former to his capture or death. Griffith, however, had filled the room with journalists from respected English, Spanish, Italian, Irish, French and U.S. newspapers who, on Griffith's instructions, posed as the inner circle of Sinn Féin in an attempt to force Hardy's self-exposure. The Irish journalists present were permitted to ask questions (as their accents would not betray the facade). Hardy gave a detailed, if largely fictitious, account of his life.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so I kiss your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a <b>large</b> <b>file</b> on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
50|$|Some text editors can edit unusually <b>large</b> <b>files</b> such as {{log files}} or an entire {{database}} {{placed in a}} single file. Simpler text editors may just read files into the computer's main memory. With <b>larger</b> <b>files,</b> {{this may be a}} slow process, and the entire file may not fit. Some text editors do not let the user start editing until this read-in is complete. Editing performance also often suffers in nonspecialized editors, with the editor taking seconds or even minutes to respond to keystrokes or navigation commands. By only storing the visible portion of <b>large</b> <b>files</b> in memory, editing performance improves.|$|R

2500|$|Direct {{download}} [...] {{sites are}} web locations that index links to locations where files {{can be directly}} downloaded to the user's computer; many such sites link to free file hosting services, for the hosting of materials.

2500|$|The {{size and}} color quality of {{animated}} GIF files can vary significantly {{depending on the}} application used to create them. [...] Strategies for minimizing file size include using a common global color table for all frames (rather than a complete local color table for each frame) and minimizing the number of pixels covered in successive frames (so that only the pixels that change from one frame to the next {{are included in the}} latter frame). [...] Simply packing a series of independent frame images into a composite animation tends to yield <b>large</b> <b>file</b> sizes.|$|E
2500|$|Wubi {{creates the}} root.disk file using Microsoft's {{proprietary}} NTFS file system while running under the MS Windows OS and then while the Ubuntu OS is running it accesses that file using an alternative file system driver. [...] The {{differences between the}} Microsoft and Linux implementations of NTFS could technically result in corruption of the root.disk file that affects the NTFS filesystem {{in such a way}} that it could even prevent Windows from booting. Running chkdsk /r from MS Windows to fix the damaged NTFS file system and then shutting down Windows cleanly may fix any corruptions (this may take a significant amount of time to run as root.disk is a <b>large</b> <b>file).</b>|$|E

2500|$|At {{this time}} also Clark {{was close to}} James McAuley, founder of the {{conservative}} literary-political magazine Quadrant. McAuley persuaded {{him to become a}} member of Quadrant 's initial editorial advisory board. Clark was, however, never fully identified with political conservatism. In 1954 he was {{one of a group of}} intellectuals who publicly criticised the position of the Menzies government on the war in French Indo-China, and as a result was attacked as communist fellow-travellers in the House of Representatives by the outspoken right-wing parliamentarian Bill Wentworth. As a result, he was placed under surveillance by Australia's domestic intelligence organisation, ASIO, who over the years compiled a <b>large</b> <b>file</b> of trivia and gossip about him, without ever discovering anything in his activities that posed a risk to [...] "national security".|$|E
2500|$|... {{a typical}} 7,200-rpm desktop HDD has a {{sustained}} [...] "disk-to-buffer" [...] {{data transfer rate}} up to 1,030Mbit/s. This rate depends on the track location; the rate is higher for data on the outer tracks (where there are more data sectors per rotation) and lower toward the inner tracks (where there are fewer data sectors per rotation); and is generally somewhat higher for 10,000-rpm drives. A current widely used standard for the [...] "buffer-to-computer" [...] interface is 3.0Gbit/s SATA, which can send about 300 megabyte/s (10-bit encoding) from the buffer to the computer, and thus is still comfortably ahead of today's disk-to-buffer transfer rates. Data transfer rate (read/write) can be measured by writing a <b>large</b> <b>file</b> to disk using special file generator tools, then reading back the file. Transfer rate can be influenced by file system fragmentation and {{the layout of the}} files.|$|E
2500|$|ZFS also {{includes}} a mechanism for snapshots and replication, including snapshot cloning; the former is described by the FreeBSD documentation {{as one of its}} [...] "most powerful features", having features that [...] "even other file systems with snapshot functionality lack". Very large numbers of snapshots can be taken, without degrading performance, allowing snapshots to be used prior to risky system operations and software changes, or an entire production ("live") file system to be fully snapshotted several times an hour, in order to mitigate data loss due to user error or malicious activity. Snapshots can be rolled back [...] "live" [...] or the file system at previous points in time viewed, even on very <b>large</b> <b>file</b> systems, leading to [...] "tremendous" [...] savings in comparison to formal backup and restore processes, or cloned [...] "on the spot" [...] to form new independent file systems.|$|E
