2500|$|The Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis), {{also known}} as the <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal,</b> is a dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Islands. [...] Fossil {{evidence}} reveals that Laysan ducks once lived across the entire archipelago, but today survive only on Laysan Island. The duck has evolved several behavioral traits linked to the absence of ground-based predators in its habitat; these include freezing or running to escape danger rather than flying, which made the duck vulnerable to hunting by humans, and the pigs, rats and mongooses they brought with them to Hawaii. By 1860, the ducks had disappeared from everywhere except Laysan Island. The introduction of rabbits brought the bird to the brink of extinction in 1912 with twelve surviving individuals. Rabbits were eradicated from the island in 1923 and numbers of Laysan ducks began to rise, reaching 500 by the 1950s. In an effort to ensure the long-term future of this duck, 42 birds were translocated to Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in 2002. These thrived in their new surroundings, and another group were later relocated to Kure Atoll.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> (Anas laysanensis) is an {{endangered}} dabbling duck endemic to the Hawaiian Archipelago but currently restricted {{to a single}} breeding population on Laysan Island. We studied its diet using fecal analysis and behavioral observations. <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> fecal samples (N= 118) contained prey items in 15 primary prey categories {{with a mean of}} 2. 9 (range 0 - 7) taxa per sample. Sixty-two of these fecal samples were quantified with 2, 270 prey items identified (mean items per sample 37; range 0 - 205). Based on fecal analysis and behavioral observations, we learned that the <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> is not strictly a macroinsectivore as previously reported, but consumed seeds, succulent leaves, and algae, in addition to adult and larval diptera, ants, lepidoptera, coleoptera, and Artemia. We compared abundance of invertebrates from two terrestrial foraging substrates, soil and standing vegetation, to the abundance of invertebrate prey items counted in fecal samples collected from these habitats for the same period. In the soil substrate, <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> selected two of the most abundant invertebrates, lepidoptera larvae and coleoptera. In the standing vegetation, <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> selected the most abundant taxa: coleoptera. Amphipods were consumed in proportion to their abundance, and small gastropods (Tornatellides sp.), isopods, and arachnids were avoided or were identified in fecal matter in disproportion to their abundance in the foraging habitat. We compared fecal composition of samples collected in aquatic and terrestrial habitats and detected significant differences in samples’ species compositions. The conservation implications of the adult Laysan teal’s diet are positive, since results indicate that the <b>Laysan</b> <b>teal</b> are opportunistic insectivores, and exhibit dietary flexibility that includes seeds and other food. Dietary flexibility improves the possibility of successfully reestablishing populations on other predator-free islands...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas laysanensis is {{endemic to}} the Hawaiian Islands, {{where it has}} been {{restricted}} to Laysan Island over the last 150 years. Individuals of this endangered species have recently been translocated to the two largest islands that comprise Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, {{to reduce the risk of}} the <b>Laysan</b> <b>Teal</b> becoming extinct. Post-release monitoring with the aid of radio-telemetry was conducted to determine the success of the reintroduction attempt during October 2004 – 2007. The population was found to have increased after three breeding seasons, from forty-two founders sourced directly from Laysan, to a population of ≥ 192 post-fledglings juveniles and adults. Many island ecosystems have undergone catastrophic species losses, largely due to the effects of introduced species. Fortunately, an “insurance policy ” is being implemented for one member of the world’s rapidly disappearing island birds. Hawaii has lost at least seven of its 10 known endemic waterfowl species since humans colonised the islands, and the remaining three specie...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Laysan</b> <b>Teal</b> Anas laysanensis is an {{endangered}} anatid of the Hawaiian Islands, currently restricted to an emergent atoll, Laysan Island. Laysan Island lacks terrestrial mammalian predators, which permits {{the examination of}} mortality rates and causes without the anthropogenic effects of introduced predators. Mass and morphometrics were measured during the colour-marking of 297 <b>Laysan</b> <b>Teal</b> between 1998 and 2001. Intensive mark-resighting and recovery methods were used to estimate adult and juvenile mortality. One hundred and nineteen carcasses were collected on Laysan between 1998 and 2003, and systematic gross and microscopic examinations were undertaken on 63 of these. Causes of mortality were categorised as trauma, emaciation, miscellaneous or undetermined. Annual adult mortality rates were low, 0. 05 – 0. 10 (s. e. < 0. 01), but duckling mortality was much higher, varying from approximately 0. 7 - 0. 9 during 1998 – 2000 and 2003. Body condition of both sexes deteriorates during the breeding season, and most adult mortality (88 %) occurred during or post-breeding (May–October). Cause of mortality was determined via necropsy in 22 ducks. Of three adults, one died from bacterial infections, one was egg bound, and one died from botulism concomitant with nematode infestation. Fourteen ducklings died from acute trauma, four from emaciation sometimes associated with nematode infection, and one from bacterial pneumonia. Trauma is {{a significant factor in}} Laysan duckling mortalities, and elucidating the cause of and preventing such trauma may allow for management measures to enhance duckling survivability. High duckling mortality rates and emaciation also indicate that habitat on Laysan Island may have limited capacity to support broods...|$|E
