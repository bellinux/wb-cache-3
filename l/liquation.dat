50|$|Waste {{products}} can be reused to produce new <b>liquation</b> cakes {{to try and}} minimise loss of metals, especially silver. The waste products are mostly {{in the form of}} <b>liquation</b> thorns from the <b>liquation</b> and the drying process but there are also some slags produced.|$|E
50|$|This {{is often}} {{regarded}} {{as the beginning of}} <b>liquation,</b> but evidence suggests <b>liquation</b> may have existed in smaller-scale use centuries earlier. The sophisticated nature of the 15th century <b>liquation</b> plants with custom-made furnaces would be surprising for a new technology. There was also a far simpler but more labour-intensive version of the method brought to Japan by the Portuguese in 1591; this is possibly the remnants of an earlier European method.|$|E
50|$|The ‘exhausted <b>liquation</b> cakes’ {{which still}} contain some lead and silver are ‘dried’ {{in a special}} furnace which is heated to a higher {{temperature}} under oxidising conditions. This is essentially just another stage of <b>liquation</b> {{and most of the}} remaining lead is expelled and oxidised to form <b>liquation</b> thorns, though some remains as lead metal. The copper can then be refined to remove other impurities and produce copper metal.|$|E
50|$|Some suggest <b>liquation</b> existed even earlier. Babylonian {{texts from}} Mari mention that ‘mountain copper’ was ‘washed’ to produce ‘washed copper’ and that lead was used with silver to produce ‘washed silver’. Some say this shows <b>liquation</b> was {{being carried out}} in the Near East as early as the second {{millennium}} BC. Crucially, however, these texts do not specifically mention lead being used with copper to produce silver, as would be expected for <b>liquation.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Liquation</b> {{is first}} {{documented}} in {{the archives of the}} municipal foundry in Nuremberg in 1453. Nuremberg was one of Germany’s main centres of metal refining and fabrication, and was a leader in metallurgical techniques. Five <b>liquation</b> plants soon sprang up around the city, and within 15 years had spread throughout Germany, Poland and the Italian Alps.|$|E
50|$|Against {{the idea}} that this process was used {{significantly}} before it became widespread in the mid-15th century, {{is the fact that it}} had to be done on a large-scale to be financially viable. There is no evidence of large-scale <b>liquation</b> before Nuremberg. Also, efficient <b>liquation</b> requires an extremely skilled practitioner. Anyone with that much skill is unlikely to spend much time on something unprofitable.|$|E
50|$|Agricola {{discusses}} {{various types}} of copper produced from the <b>liquation</b> process; {{one of these is}} caldarium or ‘cauldron copper’ which contains a high level of lead and was used to make medieval cauldrons. Analysis of 13th century cauldrons shows that they are made out of copper with a low level of silver and high levels of lead which would match that produced by <b>liquation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Liquation</b> {{requires}} that the silver-rich copper first be melted with approximately three times its weight in lead, as silver has a greater affinity with lead, most of the silver would end up within this rather than the copper. If the copper is assayed and found to contain too little silver for <b>liquation</b> to be financially viable (around 0.31% is the minimum required [...] ) it is melted and allowed to settle so {{that much of the}} silver sinks towards the bottom. The ‘tops’ are then drawn off and used to produce copper while the silver-rich ‘bottoms’ are used in the <b>liquation</b> process. The copper-lead alloy created can be tapped off and cast into large plano-convex ingots known as ‘liquation cakes’. As the metals cool and solidify the copper and the silver-containing lead separate as they are immiscible with each other.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-15th century silver {{began to}} be {{extracted}} from copper ores in massive quantities using the <b>liquation</b> process creating a boost to the mining and metallurgy industries of Central Europe.|$|E

50|$|John U. Nef, {{an expert}} on Renaissance economics, {{described}} <b>liquation</b> as ‘even {{more important than the}} invention of the printing press’ for the development of industry during this period. It increased production of silver on a massive scale. Between 1460 and 1530, the output of silver increased as much as fivefold in central Europe. This had a secondary effect of lowering the costs of producing copper at a time when its demand had increased due {{to the needs of the}} brassmaking industry, and the use of copper on ships and roofs. Lead production also received a boost, indeed the lack of lead available held the <b>liquation</b> process back until a large lead-bearing seam was discovered at Tarnowitz in Poland.|$|E
50|$|The 16th century {{process of}} {{separating}} copper and silver using <b>liquation,</b> described by Georg Agricola in his 1556 treatise De re metallica, remained almost unchanged until the 19th century {{when it was}} replaced by cheaper and more efficient processes such as sulphatization and eventually electrolytic methods.|$|E
50|$|The {{first known}} use of <b>Liquation</b> {{on a large}} scale was in Germany in the mid-15th century.

50|$|<b>Liquation</b> is a {{metallurgical}} {{method for}} separating metals from an ore or alloy.

50|$|<b>Liquation</b> {{triggered}} {{an increase}} in mining operations, and {{a new class of}} wealthy merchants clamoured to participate. Some of the wealthiest merchants in Europe invested in mining, including the French Royal Banker Jacques Coeur and the powerful Medici family of Florence. However, most of the funds came from merchants in neighbouring towns. For example, the burghers of Nuremberg funded mines in the mountains of Bohemia and the Harz.|$|E
50|$|The cakes are heated in a <b>liquation</b> furnace, usually {{four or five}} at once, to a {{temperature}} above the melting point of lead (327°C), but below that of copper (1084 °C), so that the silver-rich lead melts and flows away. As the melting point of lead is so low a high temperature furnace is not required {{and it can be}} fuelled with wood. It is important that this takes place in a reducing atmosphere, i.e.one with little oxygen, to avoid the lead oxidising, the cakes are therefore well covered by charcoal and little air is allowed into the furnace. It is impossible to stop some of the lead oxidising however and this drops down and forms spiky projections known as ‘liquation thorns’ in the channel underneath the hearth. The older and relatively simple method of cupellation can then be used to separate the silver from the lead. If the lead is assayed and found not to contain enough silver to make the cupellation process worthwhile it is reused in <b>liquation</b> cakes until it has sufficient silver.|$|E
50|$|Under the Hai-Fuki-Ho method, silver-containing copper ore {{would be}} cast-smelted with copper, then allowed to dry. The {{silver in the}} copper ore would bind to the lead, {{creating}} a single mixture. This mixture would then be heated so that the lead melted and separated out of the copper, taking the bonded silver with it. The silver-rich lead would then be treated with an oxidizing airflow to separate the silver. This was akin to a <b>liquation</b> method.|$|E
50|$|The BRM lead {{refinery}} at Northfleet in England {{uses the}} Parkes process followed by <b>liquation</b> and a vacuum induction retort to recover precious metals. The product {{of this process}} is a feed for the BBOC consisting of a mixture of lead, silver (60-75%), zinc (2-3%) and copper (2-3%), with trace amounts of gold. Prior {{to the development of the}} BBOC, BRM used cupellation in a 15 tonne (“t”) reverberatory cupellation furnace to recover the precious metals from this mixture. Three of these furnaces were used to produce 450 t of silver per year.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scarcity}} of silver peaked in the mid-15th century throughout Europe. Silver mines started to slump in output during the 14th century, {{partly due to}} the economic toll of the Black Death, as well as an inability to access and mine silver at greater depths due to an inability to prevent the mines from flooding.This issue not only affected silver mines, but also copper mines where copper was also used as a currency in some places for lesser values. Additionally, the process of <b>liquation</b> had not yet been developed, and so ores containing silver, such as the silver-rich copper of Central Europe, could not be refined into usable silver.|$|E
50|$|The size {{of these}} cakes has {{remained}} consistent from when Agricola wrote {{of them in}} 1556 to the 19th century when the process became obsolete. They were usually between 2 ½ to 3 ½ inches (6.4 to 8.9 cm) thick, about 2 feet (0.61m) in diameter and weighed from 225 to 375 lbs (102 kg to 170 kg). This consistency is not without reason as {{the size of the}} cakes is very important to the smooth running of the <b>liquation</b> process. If the cakes are too small, the product would not be worth the time and costs spent on the process, if they are too large then the copper would begin to melt before the maximum amount of lead has drained away.|$|E
5000|$|The Bullion Famine led to {{the need}} for an {{alternate}} way of acquiring silver. In 1448, new silver mines at Schneeberg, Saxony and Schwaz, Tyrol were explored to fulfill the skyrocketing demand for silver. In 1451, a new process known as <b>liquation</b> was discovered with allowed the silver-rich copper of Central Europe to be separated into silver and copper, and by the late 1450s, Martin Claus of Gotha found {{a solution to the problem}} of flooding silver mines in Saxony. The old mines quickly re-opened, and new discoveries were made in the Harz Mountains (the Erzgebirge). Old silver mines including those in Kutná Hora, Freiberg, and Rammelsberg resumed full-scale operation. The boom of silver-copper mining started in the 1460s and peaked in 1540 in Central Europe.|$|E

Highly fluid alloys are suitable for penetrating deep into narrow gaps and for brazing tight joints with narrow tolerances but are not suitable for filling larger gaps.

However, despite a significant occurrence of <b>liquation</b> in the alloy, no heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking was observed. The study showed that the manufacturing of crack-free welds by linear friction welding is not due to preclusion of grain boundary <b>liquation,</b> as has been commonly assumed and reported. Instead, resistance to cracking can be related to the counter-crack-formation effect of the imposed compressive stress during linear friction welding and strain-induced rapid solidification.

Inconel 738 (IN 738), like other precipitation-hardened nickel-base superalloys that contain {{a substantial amount}} of Al and Ti, is very difficult to weld due to its high susceptibility to heat-affected zone (HAZ) cracking during conventional fusion welding processes. The cause of this cracking, which is usually intergranular in nature, has been attributed to the <b>liquation</b> of various phases in the alloy, subsequent wetting of the grain boundaries by the liquid and decohesion across one of the solid-liquid interfaces due to on-cooling tensile stresses. In the present work, crack-free welding of the alloy was obtained by linear friction welding (LFW), notwithstanding the high susceptibility of the material to HAZ cracking. Gleeble thermomechanical simulation of the LFW process was carefully performed to study the microstructural response of IN 738 to the welding thermal cycle. Correlation between the simulated microstructure and that of the weldments was obtained, in that, a significant grain boundary <b>liquation</b> was observed in both the simulated specimens and actual weldments due to non-equilibrium reaction of second phase particles, including the strengthening gamma prime phase. These results show that in contrast to the general assumption of LFW being an exclusively solid-state joining process, intergranular <b>liquation</b> is possible during LFW.

40|$|Fusion welding of nickel-base {{superalloys}} {{is often}} associated with fusion zone solidification cracking and/or <b>liquation</b> induced heat affected zone (HAZ) cracking. As an alternative joining technology, linear friction welding (LFW) was used in the current study to join the nickel-base superalloy, WASPALOY. Under the experimental conditions used in the present investigation, the temperature data recorded by inserting thermocouples at different locations from the weld interface indicated that the temperature in the weld area reached up to 1280 0 C, which is at least 50 0 C below the melting point of the bulk alloy. However, this temperature is well above the <b>liquation</b> temperature of the low melting point components in the alloy (1245 0 C). As a result, <b>liquation</b> may occur in linear friction welded (LFWed) WASPALOY. The occurrence of <b>liquation</b> and/or microcracking was investigated using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) X-ray mapping. The high pressure applied during the oscillation and forge phases of the LFW process and the resulting 3 ̆b 3 grain refinement contributed in preventing <b>liquation</b> and microcracking in the weldments.
