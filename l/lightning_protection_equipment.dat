40|$|Installing surge {{protection}} devices for a low-voltage system {{is important to}} ensure the survival of electric or electronic devices and systems. If {{surge protection}} devices (SPD) are installed without consideration {{of the concept of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> zones, the <b>equipment</b> to be protected might be damaged despite the correct energy coordination of SPDs. This damage is induced by the reflection phenomena on the cable connecting an external SPD and the load protected. These reflection phenomena depend on the characteristics of the output of the external SPD, the input of the loads, and the cables between the load and the external SPD. Therefore, the SPD has an effective protection distance under the condition of the specific load and the specific voltage protection level of SPD. In this paper, PSCAD/EMTDC software is used to simulate the residual voltage characteristics of SPD Entering the low-voltage device. And by applying a certain voltage level, the effective protection distances of SPD were analyzed according to the each load and length of connecting cable, and th...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} to study the hazardous environment created in the neighborhoods {{in the event of}} a lightning strike to the Telecommunication tower. This thesis provides comprehensive analysis on the lightning scenarios in 18 communication and broadcasting towers situated in similar and different isokeraunic contours in Sri Lanka. The results and observation show that most of the damages reported due to the indirect lightning flashes, power line surges and step voltage in the event of lightning strike to the tower. The property damages such as patches and cracks developed in their walls and floors, the damages to electrical and electronic equipment such as electrical switch gears, bulbs, socket outlets, televisions, and radios also reported. The personal injuries were in the form of temporary paralysis due to step potential or electric shock. In one case, the victims were sleeping on floor in his home which is located around 40 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. In another case the victims were sitting on the chair with legs on the ground in his home which is located around 30 m away from the tower and also the altitude is low with compared to the tower ground level. The descriptions indicate that they have been subjected to step potential. The above scenarios with related to the lightning strikes to telecommunication tower going to explain with the geographical arrangement of tower surround, Earth resistance values measured, tower grounding arrangement, power line <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> system and the commercial power distribution to the area by Earth resistance tester, technical theories and simulation software. The outcome also shows that equipotential bonding of the grounding system, a distributed grounding network including a ring conductor and a suitable system of surge protective devices to radio base stations and neighborhood homes play a much vital role in <b>lightning</b> <b>protection</b> of <b>equipment</b> and safety of neighborhood people compared to the effects of simply achieving a low grounding resistance. However, in the absence of such integrated, distributed and equipotentialized grounding system, a high value of ground resistance will sharply increase the possibility of accidents and damag...|$|R
