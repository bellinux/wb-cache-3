40|$|Abstract. With {{the growing}} {{adoption}} of service-oriented computing, locating services becomes increasingly commonplace.

Although all these systems perform the same function, they do it in <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways.</b> Finding commonalities <b>of</b> and differences between these systems can be hard {{due to the lack of}} criteria to compare and classify various discovery schemes. This paper identifies the processes of registration and look-up as a distinguishing feature of the various discovery systems. It describes the possible types of processes, shows how they are distributed across the lifecycles of the involved entities and classifies existing service discovery systems according to these criteria. Some hints are given on how the process-based view can help guide the selection of a particular discovery style for a problem at hand. ...|$|R
40|$|Convolutional {{networks}} {{almost always}} incorporate {{some form of}} spatial pooling, and very often it is alpha times alpha max-pooling with alpha= 2. Max-pooling act on the hidden layers of the network, reducing their size by an integer multiplicative factor alpha. The amazing by-product of discarding 75 % of your data is that you build into the network a degree of invariance with respect to translations and elastic distortions. However, if you simply alternate convolutional layers with max-pooling layers, performance is limited due to the rapid reduction in spatial size, and the disjoint nature of the pooling regions. We have formulated a fractional version of max-pooling where alpha is allowed to take non-integer values. Our version of max-pooling is stochastic as there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> constructing suitable pooling regions. We find that our form of fractional max-pooling reduces overfitting {{on a variety of}} datasets: for instance, we improve on the state-of-the art for CIFAR- 100 without even using dropout...|$|R

In this dissertation I {{have tried to}} explain different environmental and behaviour factors associated with self-rated depression based on the theoretical framework of "Triangle of human ecology". This explains state of health based on behaviour, environment and population factors. The study aims to identify possible geographic patterns of depression {{and the distribution of}} other area variables like temperature, education level, urbanity etc. since these factors may have an indirect effect on depression. I also look at individual-based associations between the outcome variable, depression (HADS-D score, based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and associative variables (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity etc.) by using logistic regression analysis. It is not possible to say anything about causal relationships since this requires information about the temporal ordering between the variables. The empirical data is obtained from HUNT 3 (Health study in Nord-Trøndelag) from 2006 - 2008, Metorologisk institutt and various statistics from SSB (Norwegian Statistics). The analysis show a positive association between HADS-D above 8 and being male, high age, CAGE-score above 2, neurotic personality, difficulties in childhood and self-reported imminent mortal danger the last 12 months. There is however a negative association between HADS-D above 8 and alcohol consumption, having a job, participation in music/theatre and outdoor activity, social support both on personal and neighbourhood level, exercise, extroversion, high temperature and life satisfaction. For people having a job being male, having high age, having high demands at work and short education seems to be positively associated with HADS-D score above 8, while high social support and high control seems to be negatively associated with HADS-D above 8. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> to {{find the}} natural {{frequencies}} of a rotating system. One {{of the most effective}} methods which is used because of its precision and correctness is the application of the transfer matrix. By use of this method the entire continuous system is subdivided and the corresponding differential equation can be stated in matrix form. So to analyze shaft that is this paper issue the rotor is divided as several elements along the shaft which each one has its own mass and moment of inertia, which this work would create possibility of defining the named matrix. By Choosing more elements number, the size of matrix would become larger and as a result more accurate answers would be earned. In this paper the dynamics of a rotor-bearing system is analyzed, considering the gyroscopic effect. To increase the accuracy of modeling the thickness of the disk and bearings is also taken into account which would cause more complicated matrix to be solved. Entering these parameters to our modeling would change the results completely that these differences are shown in the results. As said upper, to define transfer matrix to reach the natural frequencies of probed system, introducing some elements {{would be one of the}} requirements. For the boundary condition of these elements, bearings at the end of the shaft are modeled as equivalent spring and dampers for the discretized system. Also, continuous model is used for the shaft in the system. By above considerations and using transfer matrix, exact results are taken from the calculations. Results Show that, by increasing thickness of the bearing the amplitude of vibration would decrease, but obviously the stiffness of the shaft and the natural frequencies of the system would accompany growth. Consequently it is easily understood that ignoring the influences of bearing and disk thicknesses would results not real answers...|$|R
