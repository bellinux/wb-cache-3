5|$|Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at {{a casino}} to acquire {{information}} about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly {{in league with}} Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS <b>locator</b> card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the <b>locator</b> card.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the idea}} behind the B-TSCD scheme is to apply the temporal property, spatial property, and consistent property of attacked <b>locators</b> to detect all attacked <b>locators.</b> The sensor first applies both temporal and spatial properties to detect some attacked <b>locators.</b> If two or more attacked <b>locators</b> are successfully detected, the sensor can identify other attacked <b>locators</b> based on their consistency.

3000|$|The paper [...] "A Novel secure {{localization}} {{approach in}} wireless sensor networks" [...] proposes three attack-resistant localization schemes, the basic Temporal Spatial Consistent-based Detection (TSCD), an enhanced TSCD, and a mobility-aided TSCD. The {{idea behind the}} basic TSCD scheme is to adopt the temporal and spatial properties of <b>locators</b> to detect some attacked <b>locators</b> firstly and then utilize the consistent property of the detected attacked <b>locators</b> to identify other attacked <b>locators.</b>|$|R
5|$|Proposed further {{upgrades}} included integrated combat {{search and}} rescue <b>locator</b> systems and improved early warning and anti-jam self-protection systems, and the Air Force recognized that the A-10's engine power was sub-optimal and had been planning to replace them with more powerful engines since at least 2001 at an estimated cost of $2 billion.|$|E
5|$|A call to {{increase}} the battery life of ULBs was once again made after the unsuccessful initial search in 2009 for the flight recorders on Air France Flight 447, which were not located until 2011. A formal recommendation that the ULB design be upgraded to offer a longer battery life or to make the recorders ejectable had {{been included in the}} final report of the board of inquiry into the loss of South African Airways Flight 295 over the Indian Ocean in 1987; however, the ICAO did not make such a recommendation until 2014, with implementation by 2018. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued new regulations requiring that the transmitting time of ULBs fitted to aircraft flight recorders be increased from 30 to 90 days. The agency proposed a new underwater <b>locator</b> beacon with a greater transmitting range to be fitted to aircraft flying over oceans. In June 2015, Dukane, a manufacturer of underwater <b>locator</b> beacons, began selling beacons with a 90-day battery life.|$|E
5|$|After the {{establishment}} of the JACC, a search of the ocean surface by aircraft continued until 28 April. An acoustic underwater search for underwater <b>locator</b> beacons attached to the aircraft's flight recorders ended 14 April, followed by a sonar survey of the seafloor near an area where acoustic detections were made. The sonar survey finished on 28 May and found nil debris from the aircraft.|$|E
30|$|In the B-TSCD scheme, if {{the sensor}} fails to detect {{at least two}} {{attacked}} <b>locators</b> based on the detection schemes D 1 and D 2, it cannot use the detection scheme D 4. It then conducts the localization using the remaining <b>locators.</b> However, there may still exist some attacked <b>locators</b> undetected, leading to {{the deterioration of the}} localization. The enhanced TSCD secure localization (E-TSCD) scheme is based on the observation that if the sensor cannot use the detection schemes D 1 and D 2 to detect two attacked <b>locators,</b> the sensor most likely has more legitimate neighboring <b>locators</b> than undetected attacked ones. Therefore, if the sensor has detected fewer than two attacked <b>locators,</b> it can further use the detection scheme D 3 to detect other attacked ones.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{describe}} the main differences between European Portuguese (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP) concerning the form and the use of anaphoric temporal <b>locators.</b> I concentrate on two types of locators: <b>locators</b> with demonstratives (Section 3) and <b>locators</b> with vague time expressions (Section 4). With respect to the former type, I propose that the opposition between <b>locators</b> headed by an explicit operator and <b>locators</b> headed by an implicit operation interacts with deixis and anaphora dependencies. As for the latter type, I restrict myself to the presentation of lexical and semantic differences between the two varieties...|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{summarize}} {{the characteristics of}} a WSN as four secure properties when it is under a distance-consistent spoofing attack: the temporal property of the <b>locators,</b> the spatial property of the <b>locators,</b> the consistent property of the legitimate <b>locators,</b> and the consistent property of the attacked <b>locators.</b> The detection schemes are therefore proposed based on the corresponding properties. Though the detection schemes based on the temporal and spatial properties have been used in [20] and the detection scheme based on the consistent property of legitimate <b>locators</b> has been used in [9], we jointly use these properties to defend against the distance-consistent spoofing attack.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the next}} {{three and a half}} years, as the World Wide Web's core {{technologies}} of HTML, HTTP, and web browsers developed, a need to distinguish a string that provided an address for a resource from a string that merely named a resource emerged. Although not yet formally defined, the term Uniform Resource <b>Locator</b> came to represent the former, and the more contentious Uniform Resource Name came to represent the latter.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the Uniform Resource <b>Locator</b> (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to 2012, under chief Tim Dolan, {{the crime}} rate {{steadily}} dropped, and the police benefited from new video and gunfire <b>locator</b> resources, although Dolan was criticized for expensive city settlements for police misconduct. While violent crime dropped (from 6,374 in 2006 to 3,720 in 2011), homicides rose by 105% and rape was at the highest rate among large cities. U.S. News & World Report said in 2011 that Minneapolis tied with Cleveland, Ohio as the 10th most dangerous city in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Back in Azerbaijan, Bond {{discloses}} to M that Elektra {{may not be}} {{as innocent}} as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the <b>locator</b> card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.|$|E
3000|$|The {{procedure}} of the E-TSCD {{is shown in}} Algorithm 2. The sensor firstly uses the schemes D 1 and D 2 to detect attacked <b>locators.</b> If the number of detected attacked <b>locators</b> is over two, the detection scheme D 4 is used to detect other attacked locators; otherwise, the sensor uses the detection scheme D 3 to eliminate other attacked <b>locators.</b> At the end, the MLE localization based on the remaining <b>locators</b> is used to obtain the location result. Note {{that we do not}} use those attacked <b>locators</b> detected from the detection scheme D 3 as a priori for conducting the detection scheme D 4.

5|$|Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar {{factory in}} the Caspian Sea, which is then {{attacked}} by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was {{in exchange for the}} use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus. Bond then receives a signal from the <b>locator</b> card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.|$|E
5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan.

The two witness Renard stealing the GPS <b>locator</b> card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own oil pipeline. Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.|$|E
