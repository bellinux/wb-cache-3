5000|$|Many {{different}} techniques exist. The {{most common}} is the simple interrupted stitch; {{it is indeed}} the simplest to perform and is called [...] "interrupted" [...] because the suture thread is cut between each individual stitch. The vertical and horizontal mattress stitch are also interrupted but are more complex and specialized for everting the skin and distributing tension. The running or continuous stitch is quicker but risks failing if the suture is cut in just one place; the continuous <b>locking</b> <b>stitch</b> {{is in some ways}} a more secure version. The chest drain stitch and corner stitch are variations of the horizontal mattress.|$|E
30|$|In {{attempts}} to decrease adhesion formation, several authors have evaluated different techniques of performing cesareans. In a chart review, a technique described at Misgav Ladach Hospital in Israel {{was associated with}} less intra-abdominal adhesions than the standard technique [12]. This non-conventional technique involves a transverse incision higher than the Pfannenstiel incision, and blunt separation of the rectus muscles, opening of the peritoneum {{as well as the}} uterine incision. The uterus is then closed with a one-layer continuous <b>locking</b> <b>stitch.</b> The visceral and parietal peritoneal layers are left unsutured. Whether, this technique is indeed associated with less adhesion formation remains unclear. In fact, two reports might contradict their assumption [13, 14]. Blumenfeld et al. reported that single layer closure of the hysterotomy incision was associated with more bladder adhesions at the time of repeat CS than double-layer closure [13]. There is also evidence that that non-closure of the peritoneum after cesarean section is associated with more adhesion formation compared to closure [14].|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of applying Krackow locking stitches in the endoscopic-assisted repair of acute Achilles tendon rupture and the possible complications encountered. Type of study: Anatomic study. Methods: Twelve Achilles tendons in six cadavers were cut at 6 cm from its insertion and endoscopic-assisted repair of Achilles tendon was performed. These legs were then cut open in midline to study (i) the locking stitches formed and (ii) {{the relation of the}} sural nerve to the locking stitches. Result: With endoscopic-assisted technique, Krackow-type locking stitches can be formed in eight legs. In four legs, the stitches fell into the ruptured gap and lie deep to the tendon. The tendon rupture end was grasped by the suture rather than forming a Krackow-type <b>locking</b> <b>stitch</b> when the suture was tightened. There was no sural nerve laceration noted. However, in two legs, the sural nerves were found trapped in the sutures at around the proximal portal. Conclusions: Krackow locking stitches can be formed by the minimally invasive technique. However, there are risks of stitches falling into the ruptured gap and lie deep to the tendon and risk of sural nerve entrapment at the proximal medial portal. The original technique is not suitable for clinical application. Modification of the technique by grasping the tendon end with Allis tissue forceps before passing the suture may prevent the suture from falling into the ruptured tendon gap. © 2009 European Foot and Ankle Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

30|$|For {{the needs}} of the present study, all {{patients}} with an acute (<[*] 10  days) ATR that was operatively treated in our institute with a percutaneous suture using the Dresden instrument over a 7 -year period (10 / 2003 – 10 / 2010) were included and retrospectively evaluated. All the patients gave their informed consent prior to inclusion in the study; the local ethics committee approved the study (EA 2 / 095 / 11). An electronic ICD- 9 search was conducted and the identified patients were contacted by telephone or by mail to invite them for a follow-up examination. Overall, 153 patients were identified and contacted. In total, 118 patients (follow-up rate: 77.1 %) agreed {{to take part in the}} study. The median patient age of the included patients was 42  years (range 24 – 73  years). The majority of the patients were men (n[*]=[*] 102; 84.3 % male). The mean follow-up was 33.45  months (range 12 – 82  months; SD 21.67). In most cases (89.2 %), the ATR happened due to sports-related injuries. The Achilles tendon rupture was located on the left in 53.7 % and on the right side in 46.3 %. Indications for percutaneous suture were type 2 a and 3 a ruptures (according to the Amlang classification) that were no older than 10  days, with sonographically incomplete adaptation of the ruptured ends of the tendon in 20 ° plantar flexion [16]. Percutaneous suture was not performed for older or open ruptures, or in re-rupture cases. The detailed surgical technique employed has been described elsewhere [17]. Briefly, a 2 -cm skin incision was made about 5  cm proximal to the rupture site. The Dresden instrument was inserted subfascially while ensuring that the underlying paratenon remained intact. Both instruments were advanced until they were as close to the tendon insertion as possible, with one lying medial and one lateral to the distal tendon stump. Two straight needles armed with resorbable PDS II No. 1 (Ethicon®, Johnson & Johnson) were pierced through the skin–instrument–tendon–instrument–skin. The instruments were then pulled back so that the sutures were diverted through the proximal incision, and the pull-out strength of the sutures was tested thoroughly. The repair was completed with a Krackow <b>locking</b> <b>stitch</b> in the proximal tendon stump, while the ATR was secured in an overtightened manner. Postoperatively, the foot was placed in a walker in the 30 ° equinus position for a period of 6  weeks with partial weight-bearing. After the sixth week, the heel height was reduced 10 ° per week and weight-bearing was increased as tolerated. From the ninth postoperative week, the patients were allowed to walk in a normal shoe. A standardized physiotherapeutic regimen was handed out to each patient and consisted of functional muscle training, proprioceptive training, and stretching exercises, while scar tissue massage was started from the third postoperative week. The following data were included in the analysis: subjective pain intensity and subjective functional limitation were measured on a 10 -point visual analogue scale (VAS); the Hannover score [18]; the Achilles tendon total rupture score (ATRS) [19]; the AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score; and the Tegner activity score for assessing the pre-injury and postoperative levels of sporting activity. Peri- and postoperative complications were evaluated. Moreover, the maximum calf circumference (MCC) at a level of 15  cm distally to the medial knee joint line and the ankle range of motion (ROM) of both the injured and the contralateral sides were documented, and the Matles test was carried out in order to examine tendon lengthening. A single trained person performed all measurements with an intraobserver variability of less than 5 %. Finally, we also examined the effect of the time point of surgery after trauma.|$|E

5000|$|Most modern sewing {{machines}} have this function built in, but many older machines do not, and straight stitch machines cannot sew a zigzag stitch with which buttonholes are constructed. A buttonholer attachment can create buttonholes from any sewing machine {{capable of making}} a <b>lock</b> <b>stitch.</b> (That is not to say, however, that some industrial buttonhole machines cannot employ a chain stitch, especially to create the purl when making keyhole buttonholes).|$|R
5000|$|A {{stitching}} awl {{is a tool}} {{with which}} holes can be punctured {{in a variety of}} materials, or existing holes can be enlarged. It is also used for sewing heavy materials, such as leather or canvas. It is a thin, tapered metal shaft, coming to a sharp point, either straight or slightly bent. These shafts are often in the form of interchangeable needles. They usually have an eye piercing at the pointed end to aid in drawing thread through holes for the purpose of manual lockstitch sewing, in which case it is also called a sewing awl. Stitching awls are frequently used by shoe repairers and other leatherworkers. Sewing awls are used to make <b>lock</b> <b>stitches.</b> The needle, with the thread in the eye is pushed through the material. The thread is then pulled through the eye to extend it. As the needle is pushed through the material, the extra thread from the first stitch is then threaded through the loops of successive <b>stitches</b> creating a <b>lock</b> <b>stitch.</b> The action is likened to that of a [...] "miniature sewing machine". Styles may vary, as they are adapted to specific trades, such as making shoes or saddles. They are also used in the printing trades to aid in setting movable type and in bookbinding.|$|R

He presented it to the Goodyear Company in 1885. He followed this in 1891 with a straight-needle machine delivered a year later. Around 1895 he developed the Brooklyn-based Dancel Machine Company. Just prior to his death he created a machine which performed all of the aforementioned functions plus stitched the in-sole, all caught with one stroke of the needle.|$|R
30|$|In {{previous}} studies by Rengasamy and Samuel (2011) on needle thread tension for lock-stitch 301, four tension peaks have been signified {{by measuring the}} online tension of stitch formation.

Especially in stitch tightening; the last step of the stitch formation produces highest tension peak also apply an extension to the sewing thread (Weimer & Mitschang 2001; Rengasamy & Samuel 2011). Thread tension was identified {{as one of the}} important parameters which influence the quality of the seam in garment construction. Krishnan and Kumar (2010) have attempted developing reliable tension measuring devices to measure on-line tension of the running thread. Ferreira et al.

Methods:Twenty tendons from the infraspinatus muscle of sheep were randomly divided into two groups: LDT, on which the <b>locked</b> double-tie <b>stitch</b> was performed; and MA, with the modified Mason-Allen stitch. The evaluation was performed in the mechanics laboratory, using a standard test machine with unidirectional traction, constant velocity of 20 mm per second and a 500 N load cell, without force cycling.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous rupture of the {{extensor}} pollicis longus (EPL) tendon {{has been}} reported after trauma, rheumatoid arthritis and sports. Rupture may also occur {{as a consequence of}} the use of anabolic steroids for recreational purposes, or systemic steroids for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions. CASE REPORT: We present a case report of a woman affected with a spontaneous EPL tendon rupture resulted 14 months after a corticosteroid injection for flexor tenosynovitis, "trigger finger," of the thumb. The edges of the tendon were debrided and sutured using figure of eight stitch and a running <b>locked</b> <b>stitch.</b> In addition multiple specimens were sent to Pathology. DISCUSSION: Duplay in 1876 described spontaneous rupture as a problem of mechanical and pressure phenomena. Another cause of EPL rupture is related to the development and persistence of inflammatory processes seen in patients with medical illnesses such as rheumatoid arthritis. There have been no reports in the literature to date of spontaneous EPL tendon rupture in the late period after steroid injection. Tendon ruptures in the hand usually occur one or two weeks after a corticosteroid injection, and the affected tendons are usually in neighbouring areas...|$|R

5000|$|William Jones {{started making}} sewing {{machines}} in 1859 and in 1860 formed {{a partnership with}} Thomas Chadwick. As Chadwick & Jones they manufactured sewing machines at Ashton-under-Lyne until 1863. Their machines used designs from Howe and Wilson produced under licence. Thomas Chadwick later joined Bradbury & Co. William Jones opened a factory in Guide Bridge, Manchester in 1869. In 1893 a Jones advertising sheet claimed that this factory was the [...] "Largest Factory in England Exclusively Making First Class Sewing Machines". The firm was renamed as the Jones Sewing Machine Co. Ltd and was later acquired by Brother Industries of Japan, in 1968. The Jones name still appeared on the machines till the late 1980s. The Jones patent for his popular Serpent Neck model appeared in 1879. These were manufactured until 1909.The machines pictured employ a transverse boat shuttle mechanism forming a <b>lock</b> <b>stitch.</b> The CS Family model was produced for many years.

50|$|Performance surf boards were {{traditionally}} {{made from}} laminated layers over foam cores.

40|$|The {{requirements}} on aircraft engine design have increased rapidly {{over the last}} decades. Future aircrafts engines {{are expected to be}} more efficient with lower operation costs and without compromising safety. Concerning the complex requirements for fan systems or fan containments, composite materials are able to fully avail their high potential with regard to a significant weight reduction and an increased efficiency by using their high specific strength and stiffness. However, the insufficient delamination behaviour of 2 D-reinforced composites is often opposed to a broad application in impact resistant lightweight structures. In this respect, through thickness reinforcements, e. g. by stitching, are expected to be a very promising way to optimise 2 D textile reinforced materials. An experimental investigation approach for 3 D reinforced materials under impact loading conditions is presented in this article, which includes the description of the testing procedure as well as the tested material configurations and the experimental results. The focus of the experimental investigation was set on the examination of damage due to delamination failure depending on various stitching configurations using a multi-layered weft knitted fabrics (MKF). Concerning the implementation of the 3 D-reinforcement by stitching with the double <b>locked</b> <b>stitch</b> technology, two different stitching thread materials, glass and aramid, were used. In order to compare the stitching configuration effects, different stitch lengths and stitch distances have been investigated as well as unstitched specimens. The laminate specimen plates were subjected to sub-critical impact velocities at an impact-bending-test device. The gained information has been used for numerical investigations to evaluate possibilities of simulating delamination damage in 3 D-reinforced structures by the FEM...|$|R

'This simplified the construction of the machine by getting rid of the reciprocation motion of the ordinary shuttle, and contributed to make a light tool silent running machine, eminently adapted to domestic use.|$|R
50|$|His {{sewing machine}} used the chain stitch method, {{in which the}} machine uses a single thread to make simple {{stitches}} in the fabric. A stitching awl would pierce the material and a forked point rod would carry the thread through the hole {{where it would be}} hooked underneath and moved to the next stitching place, where the cycle would be repeated, <b>locking</b> the <b>stitch.</b> Saint's machine was designed to aid the manufacture of various leather goods, including saddles and bridles, but it was also capable of working with canvas, and was used for sewing ship sails. Although his machine was very advanced for the era, the concept would need steady improvement over the coming decades before it could become a practical proposition. In 1874, a sewing machine manufacturer, William Newton Wilson, found Saint's drawings in the London Patent Office, made adjustments to the looper, and built a working machine, currently owned by the London Science Museum.|$|R
