25|$|The Dalai Lama had {{a strong}} {{following}} as many people from Tibet <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> their leader from not just a political point of view but, also from a spiritual prospective. After the Dalai Lama's government fled to Dharamsala, India, during the 1959 Tibetan Rebellion, it established a rival government-in-exile. Afterwards, the Central People's Government in Beijing renounced the agreement and began implementation of the halted social and political reforms. During the Great Leap Forward, between 200,000 and 1,000,000 Tibetans died, and approximately 6,000 monasteries were destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, thus {{the vast majority of}} historic Tibetan architecture was destroyed. In 1962 China and India fought a brief war over the disputed South Tibet and Aksai Chin regions. Although China won the war, Chinese troops withdrew north of the McMahon Line, effectively ceding South Tibet to India.|$|E
60|$|Sogrange <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{though he}} were some strange creature.|$|E
60|$|Elsie <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he stood, gravely quiet, {{studying}} her.|$|E
60|$|Ann {{was still}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{if he had}} {{undergone}} a change into something new and strange.|$|R
60|$|Cranley half {{turned and}} threw a quick <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> rapid and timid as the glance of a hare in its form.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} quite still, hearing, but washed all wan {{and without}} feeling. She waited, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> {{if he were}} some curious, not-understandable creature.|$|R
60|$|Courthon <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{he might}} look at an impertinent lackey.|$|E
60|$|Tony <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{though he}} {{scarcely}} recognized him, and smiled.|$|E
60|$|Bradley <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> {{though he}} were {{claiming}} to be a Ghost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mayn't I {{come down}} with you?" [...] added Sam, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{if he wanted to}} make the most of every moment of that presence.|$|R
6000|$|With {{her eyes}} <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{in a new}} light she slowly shook her head. Then she declared: [...] "You never can live it down." ...|$|R
60|$|Ellen {{could not}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he loomed over her. She felt a wild tumult in her heart. All that crowded {{to her lips}} for {{utterance}} was false.|$|R
60|$|Pasa <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{a mother}} {{looks at a}} beloved but capricious babe.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a great lady {{would look}} at a presuming servant.|$|E
60|$|The woman <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> one {{seeking to}} {{understand}} some creature {{of an alien}} world.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. DEARTH (the {{only one}} who is undaunted). A second chance! (She is <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her husband. They all <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{if he had been}} a leader once.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm not {{drinking}} brandy,' she replied, and she sprinkled {{the last}} drops of her liqueur over his face. He gave an odd squeal. She sat <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> if indifferent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Such a nice-looking young man, too, who'd 'ave thought it!" [...] whispered one of {{the many}} heads that were thrust out at the carriage-windows to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he passed.|$|R
60|$|They {{left the}} room together. She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> they descended the stairs, almost tremulously.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> at one who {{had spoken}} irreverently. Her eyes were full of wonder.|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> {{though she}} chose to think his {{question}} facetious, and did not reply.|$|E
60|$|But {{she did not}} hear. She lay, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> <b>at</b> {{something}} she could never understand, never: as a child <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> a grown-up person, without hope of understanding, only submitting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What a good fellow you are, Clennam!' exclaimed the other, {{stopping}} to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> if with irrepressible admiration. 'What a capital fellow! You {{have never been}} disappointed. That's easy to see.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{a minute}} or more she stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he sat with his eyes fixed upon the picture, and while she looked an {{expression}} of pity stole across her sweet pale face.|$|R
60|$|The old man <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{though he}} doubted whether or no he were being laughed at.|$|E
60|$|I <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he {{lay there}} under the holly-tree, his face all dreamy and boyish, very unusual.|$|E
60|$|The Captain <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> if he {{were half}} {{inclined}} to unburden his mind of a capital joke.|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't really <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as,</b> you know, {{absolutely}} good or bad. I {{think that he}} is constantly walking a line of ambiguity within himself and uncertainty within himself that defines the way he acts." ...|$|R
6000|$|His father rose {{a little}} higher still, and <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> though curious {{to know if he}} were quite {{resolved}} and earnest, dropped gently down again, and said in the calmest voice--eating his nuts meanwhile, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ever thought}} him such a treasure!" [...] said Gillian; [...] "and now <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he {{stands by the}} side of a real gentleman, how he stares and trembles as if he were distraught." ...|$|R
60|$|Rosa <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> if {{she would}} have liked him to be the {{recipient}} of a thousand dedications.|$|E
60|$|Gride <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{if he were}} petrified with astonishment, but did not speak; perhaps {{lacking the}} power.|$|E
60|$|A startled look {{came into}} the big brown eyes. She <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a babe might, striving to comprehend.|$|E
60|$|In one and {{one-half}} hours I pulled him {{close to the}} boat, and we all saw him. But I {{did not get a}} good <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he wove to and fro behind the boat.|$|R
60|$|The fingers {{which he}} {{released}} fell nervelessly to her side. She stood <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> if {{confronted with a}} sudden nightmare. It was as if this new-found life were being slowly drained from her veins.|$|R
60|$|And {{then he saw}} her <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>as</b> if, seeing {{into the}} {{recesses}} of his soul, she had made some ghastly discovery. The look was so mournful, so uncannily intent that {{he turned away from}} it.|$|R
