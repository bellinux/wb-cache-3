The <b>lexicographer</b> Samuel Johnson lived at Gough Square off Fleet Street between 1748 and 1759; the building has survived into the 21st century. The cartographer John Senex owned a map store, The Sign of the Globe, on Fleet Street between 1725 and his death in 1736. Wynkyn de Worde was buried in St. Bride's Church in 1535, as was poet Richard Lovelace in 1657, while Samuel Pepys was baptised there in 1633.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} to compile a Bengali {{encyclopedia}} was undertaken by Felix Carey (1786–1822), who {{was the son of}} Reverend William Carey (1761–1834) of Serampore and the first <b>lexicographer</b> of the Burmese language. In 1819, he began the translation of the fifth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, naming it Vidyarthabali. From October 1819 till November 1820 the book was printed by Felix Carey every month in 48-page installments. Thus completed, the first part of Vidyarthabali was compiled into the 638-page Vyabachchedvidya, the first book on anatomy and surgery in Bengali. Work on the second part, Smritishastra, which was largely on jurisprudence, then began. But, Carey died after only two 40-page installments were printed in February and March 1821.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the design of a}} computational system for the development and maintenance of inflected lexica, developed as part of the Open Source Lexical Information Network (OLSIN). The system is built as a tool for <b>lexicographers,</b> and is flexible enough for the <b>lexicographers</b> to deal with any irregularities in the language, and transparent enough for the <b>lexicographers</b> to understand the rules used for the automatically generated inflections. It furthermore allows <b>lexicographers</b> to create and modify paradigm rules by themselves, making it easy to implement the system for any language, including less-resources languages. Apart from the system itself, this {{article describes}} some of the challenges and obstacles the design of such a system has to face, and the solutions adopted for them in the OSLIN framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{creation}} of target language equivalents in bilingual dictionaries {{have always been}} a challenge to both <b>lexicographers</b> and terminologists. <b>Lexicographers,</b> terminologists, subject specialists and linguists face a challenging task of supplying term equivalents for foreign interna-tional languages. The lack of a sufficient technical vocabulary in the African languages poses chal-lenges to <b>lexicographers</b> and terminologists when supplying technical equivalents. They often regard transliteration as the quickest lexicographical and terminological procedure without taking the practical demands of users into account. This impedes the optimal retrieval of semantic infor-mation by the target users of dictionaries. This article discusses possible reasons why translitera-tion should not be regarded as the first but the last resort in lexicography and terminology. It pro-poses different lexicographical and terminological procedures <b>lexicographers</b> and terminologists can use to supply accurate and appropriate translation equivalents without making excessive use of transliteration. In this way a scientific language will develop which could assist users to com-municate successfully in the mother tongue...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a new method of constructing Korean-Chinese verb patterns from existing patterns. A verb pattern is a subcategorization frame of a predicate extended by translation information. Korean-Chinese verb patterns are invaluable linguistic resources that only used for Korean-Chinese transfer {{but also for}} Korean parsing. Usually a verb pattern has been either hand-coded by expert <b>lexicographers</b> or extracted automatically from bilingual corpus. In the first case, the dependence on the linguistic intuition of <b>lexicographers</b> {{may lead to the}} incompleteness and the inconsistency of a dictionary. In the second case, extracted patterns can be domain-dependent. In this paper, we present a method to construct Korean-Chinese verb patterns semiautomatically from existing Korean-Chinese verb patterns that are manually written by <b>lexicographers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, in {{the field}} of bilingual lexicography, the main task for <b>lexicographers</b> is to provide lexical {{equivalents}} in bilingual dictionaries by all possible means. And accordingly, how to provide appropriate or satisfying translation equivalents in bilingual dictionaries is always the centre of attention in bilingual metalexicography. However, the history of bilingual lexicography shows that it has never been an easy task, because of linguistic and cultural anisomorphism. The usual compromise made by most <b>lexicographers</b> is to introduce partial or explanatory equivalents. This recourse means that most bilingual <b>lexicographers,</b> unfortunately, more than often, fail {{to meet the needs of}} foreign language learners. Certain misconceptions about the translation equivalents emerge among the language learners, which explains the awkward situation that besets bilingual <b>lexicographers.</b> The present contribution aims at perceiving lexicographical translation as a dynamic process by which an adequate semantic system in the target language would be set up to serve as a functionally equivalent defining system. By doing this, bilingual <b>lexicographers</b> should establish a powerful target language semantic network, in which lexicographical sections like verbal illustrations, usage notes and etymologies, etc. would be considered together with the translation equivalents as an integrated whole. This is an attempt to describe the essential features of lexicographical translation and its multi-disciplinary theoretical basis, in the hope that future practice in bilingual lexicography might be improved...|$|R
