40|$|AbstractAnterior–posterior (A/P) limb {{patterning}} in vertebrates {{is determined}} by the counteraction between the Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and the Gli 3 transcription factor. Shh exerts its effect on Gli 3 by regulating the full-length Gli 3 protein processing to generate a Gli 3 repressor gradient along the A/P axis of the limb. However, {{it is not clear whether}} the full-length Gli 3 is an activator in vivo and plays any role in the limb patterning. Here we show that mouse limbs expressing only a Gli 3 repressor form exhibit mild polysyndactyly and a partial <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> identity, while limbs expressing only a full-length Gli 3 protein display severe polysyndactyly and a complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> identity. Interestingly, when the full-length Gli 3 and the repressor are equally expressed in the limb, the digit patterning is overall normal except for an extra anterior digit. Furthermore, in the presence of one Gli 3 wild type allele, a Gli 3 mutant allele that expresses only the full-length form can rescue the Shh mutant digit phenotype to a great extent. The full-length Gli 3 protein can also activate Shh target gene expression without Shh. Thus, our data indicate that the full-length Gli 3 protein is an activator in vivo and that the ratio of the Gli 3 activator to repressor, but neither the Gli 3 repressor gradient nor the Gli 3 activator/repressor ratio gradient, determines limb digit patterning...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> is a {{widespread}} evolutionary trend in tetrapods which occurs in nearly every major clade. Alberch and Gale showed that {{the order in which}} digits are evolutionarily lost in salamanders versus frogs corresponds to the order in which they develop in each group, providing a classic example of developmental constraint. However, what actually drives the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> in salamanders has remained unclear. Alberch and Gale suggested that <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> might be associated with paedomorphosis or with reduced body size. We test these hypotheses by combining morphometric and phylogenetic information for 98 species of salamanders. We find that digit loss is associated with both paedomorphosis and reduction in body size. However, these trends are surprisingly contradictory, in that paedomorphosis is significantly associ-ated with an increase in body size in salamanders. Thus, much <b>of</b> the extreme <b>digit</b> reduction is found in the smaller species within paedomorphic clades that have, on average, unusually large body size. Our results show that the consequences of changes in body size on morphology are highly context dependent. We also show (possibly for the first time) a significant association between paedomorphosis and increased body size, rather than the expected association with reduced body size...|$|R

It is ascribed to ciliary dysfunction and characterized by malformation of the face, oral cavity, and digits.

40|$|SMAD 4 is an {{essential}} mediator of canonical TGFbeta/BMP signal transduction and we inactivated Smad 4 in mouse limb buds from early stages onward to study its functions in the mesenchyme. While this Smad 4 inactivation did not alter the early Sox 9 distribution, prefiguring the chondrogenic primordia of the stylopod and zeugopod, it disrupted formation of all Sox 9 -positive digit ray primordia. Specific inactivation of Smad 4 during handplate development pointed to its differential requirement for posterior and anterior digit ray primordia. At the cellular level, Smad 4 deficiency blocked the aggregation of Sox 9 -positive progenitors, thereby preventing chondrogenic differentiation as revealed by absence of collagen type II. The progressive loss of SOX 9 due to disrupting digit ray primordia and chondrogenesis was paralleled by alterations in genes marking other lineages. This pointed to a general loss of tissue organization and diversion of mutant cells toward non-specific connective tissue. Conditional inactivation of Bmp 2 and Bmp 4 indicated that the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> ray primordia and increase in connective tissue were predominantly a consequence of disrupting SMAD 4 -mediated BMP signal transduction. In summary, our analysis reveals that SMAD 4 is required to initiate: (1) formation of the Sox 9 -positive digit ray primordia; and (2) aggregation and chondrogenic differentiation of all limb skeletal elements...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{family of}} GLI {{proteins}} (GLI 1 – 3) comprises the intracellular mediators of the hedgehog pathway, which regulates {{a myriad of}} developmental processes, {{one of which is}} limb development. Whereas GLI 1 and GLI 2 seem to be dispensable during limb development, GLI 3 is especially crucial since all GLI 3 -associated human congenital diseases comprise limb malformations. Furthermore, Gli 3 −/− mouse embryos exhibit pronounced polydactyly in conjunction with a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> identities. Here we examined how the quantity of GLI 3 contributes to its function by using different Gli 3 mutants in order to vary overall GLI 3 levels. In addition, we made use of the Gli 3 Δ 699 allele, which encodes a C-terminally truncated version of GLI 3, thus mimicking the processed GLI 3 isoform (GLI 3 R). The Gli 3 Δ 699 mutant made it feasible to analyze isoform-specific contributions of GLI 3 within the context of anteroposterior patterning of the limb bud. We revealed a so far unappreciated variation in the quantitative demand for GLI 3 within different phases and aspects of distal limb formation. In addition, our analyses provide evidence that unprocessed full-length GLI 3 is dispensable for anteroposterior patterning of the limb bud. Instead, digit identities are most likely defined by GLI 3 repressor activity alone. Furthermore, we present evidence that the anteroposterior grading of GLI 3 activity by the action of SHH is supported by a prototype patterning, which regulates Gli 3 independently from SHH...|$|E
40|$|The anterior-posterior {{patterning}} of the vertebrate limb bud requires closely coordinated signaling interactions, including Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) -mediated counteraction of the Gli 3 {{transcription factor}} in the distal and posterior mesenchyme of the limb bud. Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), an intracellular negative regulator of Shh signaling via Gli 2 and Gli 3, is implicated in early development of the mouse limb bud. However, how Sufu {{is involved in the}} genetic regulation of limb bud patterning still remains elusive. In this study, we show that the conditional deletion of Sufu in the mesenchyme of the early limb bud results in polydactyly with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> identity and supernumerary bones in the wrist and the ankle. These pattern alterations are associated with anterior expansion of HoxD genes located at the 5 ' end of the cluster. By focusing on gene expression analysis of Shh/Gremlin 1 /Fgf signaling critical for the establishment and maintenance of anterior-posterior patterning, we show that early response to loss of Sufu involves anterior prolongation of Fgf 4 and Fgf 8 expression in the apical ectodermal ridge at E 10. 5. We also reveal the anterior activation of Shh-dependent posterior markers Ptc 1, Gli 1 and Gremlin in limb buds lacking Sufu. Furthermore, we find that loss of Sufu leads to attenuated levels of repressor Gli 2 and repressor Gli 3 in the early limb bud. Moreover, expression of Hand 2 is activated in the entire limb bud at the early outgrowth stage in the mutant lacking Sufu. Thus, we provide evidence that Sufu is involved in the genetic network that restricts the posterior expression of Gli 2 / 3 /Hand 2 and Gremlin/Fgf in limb bud patterning...|$|E

40|$|Pacifier use is {{associated}} with a decreased risk of SIDS [1], and is widely believed to suppress digit sucking in infants, but little is known of the relative prevalence and physiological effects of these two forms of non-nutritive sucking (NNS) during early infancy. Methods. Overnight polygraphic recordings of sleep state, respiration, ECG, oxygen saturation and infrared video were made of 10 mother infant pairs (5 routine bedsharers, 5 room-sharers) on two consecutive nights, at monthly intervals from 2 to 5 months of age in a sleep laboratory. Each month, mother baby pairs were randomized to 1 night bed-sharing then 1 room-sharing, or vice versa. ‘Episodes’ of pacifier, own digit and mother’s digit sucking (> 1 minute) wereidentified and compared with 2 statematched control periods, before and after each such episode [2]. Results: Full recordings, on 74 nights (749 hours), showed 329 episodes of NNS on 54 nights. During episodes, median oxygen saturation was higher (p= 0. 0037), desaturations were fewer (p= 0. 030), and interquartile range of respiratory rate was greater (p= 0. 0007). Median respiratory rate was slightly, but not significantly, lower. Median and interquartile range of heart rate were not significantly different during episodes. The effect of sucking upon median oxygen saturation depended on the type of sucking involved, with mothers’ digit sucking being associated with the greatest increase in median oxygen saturation. Mean durations of infant movements and noises were reduced during sucking episodes, particularly during mothers’ digit sucking.

40|$|The genetic {{mechanisms}} that regulate the complex morphogenesis of generating cartilage elements in correct positions with precise shapes during organogenesis, fundamental issues in developmental biology, {{are still not}} well understood. By focusing on the developing mouse limb, we confirm the importance of transcription factors encoded by the Sall gene family in proper limb morphogenesis, and further show that they have overlapping activities in regulating regional morphogenesis in the autopod. Sall 1 /Sall 3 double null mutants exhibit a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> 1 {{as well as a}} loss or fusion of digit 2 and digit 3, metacarpals and carpals in the autopod. We show that Sall activity affects different pathways, including the Shh signaling pathway, as well as the Hox network. Shh signaling in the mesenchyme is partially impaired in the Sall mutant limbs. Additionally, our data suggest an antagonism between Sall 1 -Sall 3 and Hoxa 13 -Hoxd 13. We demonstrate that expression of Epha 3 and Epha 4 is downregulated in the Sall 1 /Sall 3 double null mutants, and, conversely, is upregulated in Hoxa 13 and Hoxd 13 mutants. Moreover, the expression of Sall 1 and Sall 3 is upregulated in Hoxa 13 and Hoxd 13 mutants. Furthermore, by using DNA-binding assays, we show that Sall and Hox compete for a target sequence in the Epha 4 upstream region. In conjunction with the Shh pathway, the antagonistic interaction between Hoxa 13 -Hoxd 13 and Sall 1 -Sall 3 in the developing limb may contribute to the fine-tuning of local Hox activity that leads to proper morphogenesis of each cartilage element of the vertebrate autopod...|$|E
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIBackground: The {{homology}} of the digits in {{the bird}} wing is a high-profile controversy in developmental and evolutionary biology. The embryonic {{position of the}} digits cartilages {{with respect to the}} primary axis (ulnare and ulna) corresponds to 2, 3, 4, but comparative-evolutionary morphology supports 1, 2, 3. A homeotic frameshift of digit identity in evolution could explain how cells in embryonic positions 2, 3, 4 began developing morphologies 1, 2, 3. Another alternative is that no re-patterning of cell fates occurred, and the primary axis shifted its position by some other mechanism. In the wing, only the anterior digit lacks expression of HoxD 10 and HoxD 12, resembling digit 1 of other limbs, as predicted by 1, 2, 3. However, upon <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> 1 in evolution, the most anterior digit 2 could have lost their expression, deceitfully resembling a digit 1. To test this notion, we observed HoxD 10 and HoxD 12 in a limb where digit 2 is the most anterior digit: The rabbit foot. We also explored whether early inhibition of Shh signalling in the embryonic wing bud induces an experimental homeotic frameshift, or an experimental axis shift. We tested these hypotheses using DiI injections to study the fate of cells in these experimental wings. Results: We found strong transcription of HoxD 10 and HoxD 12 was present in the most anterior digit 2 of the rabbit foot. Thus, we found no evidence to question the use of HoxD expression as support for 1, 2, 3. When Shh signalling in early wing buds is inhibited, our fate maps demonstrate that an experimental homeotic frameshift is induced. Conclusion: Along with comparative morphology, HoxD expression provides strong support for 1, 2, 3 identity of wing digits. As an explanation for the offset 2, 3, 4 embryological position, the homeotic frameshift hypothesis is consistent with known mechanisms of limb development, and further proven to be experimentally possible. In contrast, the underlying mechanisms and experimental plausibility of an axis shift remain unclear. This work was funded by a Fondecyt grant 1120424 (Government of Chile) to AOV...|$|E

Our analysis reveals an unexpected alternating anterior-posterior sequence <b>of</b> normal mammalian <b>digit</b> formation.

40|$|Abstract Background The Australian scincid clade Lerista {{provides}} {{perhaps the}} best available model for studying limb reduction in squamates (lizards and snakes), comprising more than 75 species displaying a remarkable variety <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> configurations, from pentadactyl to entirely limbless conditions. We investigated the pattern and rate of limb reduction and loss in Lerista, employing a comprehensive phylogeny inferred from nucleotide sequences for a nuclear intron and six mitochondrial genes. Results The inferred phylogeny reveals extraordinary evolutionary mutability of limb morphology in Lerista. Ancestral state reconstructions indicate at least ten independent reductions in the number <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> from a pentadactyl condition, with a further seven reductions proceeding independently from a tetradactyl condition derived from one of these reductions. Four independent <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> all <b>digits</b> are inferred, three from pentadactyl or tetradactyl conditions. These conclusions are not substantially affected by uncertainty in assumed rates of character state transition or the phylogeny. An estimated age of 13. 4 million years for Lerista entails that limb reduction has occurred not only repeatedly, but also very rapidly. At the highest rate, complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> from a pentadactyl condition is estimated to have occurred within 3. 6 million years. Conclusion The exceptionally high frequency and rate of limb reduction inferred for Lerista emphasise the potential for rapid and substantial alteration of body form in squamates. An absence of compelling evidence for reversals <b>of</b> <b>digit</b> <b>loss</b> contrasts with a recent proposal that digits have been regained in some species of the gymnophthalmid clade Bachia, possibly reflecting an influence of differing environmental and genetic contexts {{on the evolution of}} limb morphology in these clades. Future study of the genetic, developmental, and ecological bases of limb reduction and loss in Lerista promises the elucidation of not only this phenomenon in squamates, but also the dramatic evolutionary transformations of body form that have produced the extraordinary diversity of multicellular organisms. </p...|$|R
40|$|The major locus for {{dominant}} preaxial polydactyly {{in humans}} has been mapped to 7 q 36.

40|$|The {{vertebrate}} hedgehog receptor patched 1 (Ptc 1) {{is crucial}} for negative regulation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway during anterior-posterior patterning of the limb. We have conditionally inactivated Ptc 1 in the mesenchyme of the mouse limb using Prx 1 -Cre. This results in constitutive activation of hedgehog (Hh) signalling {{during the early stages}} of limb budding. Our data suggest that variations in the timing and efficiency of Cre-mediated excision result in differential forelimb and hindlimb phenotypes. Hindlimbs display polydactyly (gain <b>of</b> <b>digits)</b> and a molecular profile similar to the Gli 3 mutant extra-toes. Strikingly, forelimbs are predominantly oligodactylous (displaying a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits),</b> with a symmetrical, mirror-image molecular profile that is consistent with re-specification of the anterior forelimb to a posterior identity. Our data suggest that this is related to very early inactivation of Ptc 1 in the forelimb perturbing the gene regulatory networks responsible for both the pre-patterning and the subsequent patterning stages of limb development.

40|$|Abstract Background Axolotls {{have the}} unique ability, among vertebrates, to {{perfectly}} regenerate complex body parts, such as limbs, after amputation. In addition, axolotls pattern developing and regenerating autopods from the anterior to posterior axis instead of posterior to anterior like all tetrapods studied to date. Sonic hedgehog {{is important in}} establishing this anterior-posterior axis of limbs in all tetrapods including axolotls. Interestingly, its expression is conserved (to the posterior side of limb buds and blastemas) in axolotl limbs as in other tetrapods. It {{has been suggested that}} BMP- 2 may be the secondary mediator of sonic hedgehog, although there is mounting evidence to the contrary in mice. Since BMP- 2 expression is on the anterior portion of developing and regenerating limbs prior to digit patterning, opposite to the expression of sonic hedgehog, we examined whether BMP- 2 expression was dependent on sonic hedgehog signaling and whether it affects patterning of the autopod during regeneration. Results The expression of BMP- 2 and SOX- 9 in developing and regenerating axolotl limbs corresponded to the first digits forming in the anterior portion of the autopods. The inhibition of sonic hedgehog signaling with cyclopamine caused hypomorphic limbs (during development and regeneration) but did not affect the expression of BMP- 2 and SOX- 9. Overexpression of BMP- 2 in regenerating limbs caused a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits.</b> Overexpression <b>of</b> Noggin (BMP inhibitor) in regenerating limbs also resulted in a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits.</b> Histological analysis indicated that the loss due to BMP- 2 overexpression was the result of increased cell condensation and apoptosis while the loss caused by Noggin was due to a decrease in cell division. Conclusion The expression of BMP- 2 and its target SOX- 9 was independent of sonic hedgehog signaling in developing and regenerating limbs. Their expression correlated with chondrogenesis and the appearance of skeletal elements has described in other tetrapods. Overexpression of BMP- 2 did not cause the formation <b>of</b> extra <b>digits,</b> which is consistent with the hypothesis {{that it is not the}} secondary signal of sonic hedgehog. However, it did cause the formation of hypomorphic limbs as a result of increased cellular condensation and apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that BMP- 2 does not have a direct role in patterning regenerating limbs but may be important to trigger condensation prior to ossification and to mediate apoptosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} two term {{recurrence}} relation satisfied by the incomplete gamma function is asymptotically stable {{in at least one}} direction, for an imaginary second argument there can be a considerable <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> correct <b>digits</b> before stability sets in. We present an approach to compute the recurrence relation to full precision, also for small values of the arguments, when the first argument is negative and the second one is purely imaginary. A detailed analysis shows that this approach works well for all values considered. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Lx in SHR. Lx rat manifests in homozygotes as hindlimb preaxial polydactyly. We {{showed that}} a 2, 964 -bp {{deletion}} in Plzf (Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) intron 2 is the only candidate for Lx. The deletion removes the most deeply conserved CNE with putative regulatory influence on Plzf expression. Using in situ hybridization we found reduced expression pattern of Plzf in Lx/Lx limb and anterior expansion of expression domains of Plzf targets Hoxd 10 - 13 genes and Bmp 2, {{in the absence of}} ectopic Shh expression. Rat hd manifests in homozygotes as reduction or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>digits</b> II and III on both hind and forelimb and impairment of spermatogenesis leading to male infertility. We showed that hd mutation is caused by an insertion of an endogenous retrovirus into intron 10 of the Cntrob gene resulting in the translation of a truncated protein. In situ hybridization showed that expression of cartilage condensation marker Sox 9, and Bmp receptor Bmpr 1 b is absent from the distal parts <b>of</b> the <b>digit</b> condensations II and III. Studying spermatogenesis we showed that centrobin (protein of Cntrob) localizes to the centrosome, manchette, and the marginal ring of the spermatid acroplaxome. Mutant spermatids show a disruption of head-tail coupling apparatus leading to spermatid decapitation. We demonstrated distinct [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how {{to compute the}} correlation function by using the tensor renormalization group for 2 D Ising model. From the correlation function around the critical temperature, we extract the correlation length and the spontaneous magnetization and then determine some critical exponents. Attractive feature of our method to extract the critical exponents is that numerical derivative, that causes a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> significant <b>digits,</b> and additional simulation parameters, that demand more computational cost and complicated analysis, are not required. On the other hand, our approach requires an additional treatment of impurity tensors, but the additional cost is still tolerable...|$|R
