5000|$|Because of {{the runway}} limitations, Qantas {{purchased}} two short-bodied [...] "Special Performance" [...] 747SP for flights between Wellington and Australia {{during the first half}} of the 1980s. Air New Zealand operated DC-8s from Wellington on trans-Tasman routes, but when the planes were retired in 1981 none of its other planes were capable of operating international flights from Wellington - Air New Zealand's DC-10s required extra runway length, and twinjet planes were not yet ETOPS-certified. The 747SP addressed this gap in the market, with Air New Zealand (after turning down an offer to purchase the type) code-sharing with Qantas. Special markings on the runway assisted Qantas pilots where to touch down and to abort and go round to attempt a landing again. The SP service to Wellington continued until 1985 when Qantas and later Air New Zealand took delivery of the more capable and economical Boeing 767-200ER type.During this time Pan American Airways took an interest in the operation of SPs into the capital and proposed a possible <b>long-range</b> <b>service</b> to the US via Hawaii.

40|$|Abstract. Microstructural {{design of}} a new {{generation}} of 9 %Cr steels for fossil power plants is considered. It was shown that microstructural stability of 9 %Cr steels impairs their creep resistance. Two types of restoration processes can occur in the heat resistance steels under creep conditions: (i) normal grain growth and (ii) dynamic recovery. The first process associates with the migration of high-angle boundaries (HAGB) of blocks of tempered martensite lath structure (TMLS). However, their migration is negligible even during creep deformation. Boundaries of packets and prior austenite boundaries (PAB) are effectively pinned by precipitations of M 23 C 6 and Laves phase Fe 2 (W,N). The second process consists of transformation of lath boundaries to subboundaries and their subsequent migration (subgrain coarsening) under creep. Under aging the migration of low-angle boundaries (LAGB) is retarded by uniformly distributed nanoscale M(C,N) dispersoids and particles of M 23 C 6 precipitated on these boundaries under tempering. Under creep the dissolution of M 23 C 6 carbides located along LAGBs and coagulation of uniformly distributed M(C,N) carbonitrides facilitates LAGB migration. It was shown that the normal grain growth is not important for deterioration of creep strength. Conversion of the lath boundaries into subgrain boundaries strongly decreases creep rate. In contrast, continuous subgrain coarsening is the main process restricting the ability of the 9 %Cr steel for <b>long-range</b> <b>service</b> under creep conditions. Tertiary creep is attained due to the occurrence of subgrain coarsening...|$|E

5000|$|The {{adoption}} of rolled iron armor in 1865 and sandwich armor in 1870 gave ships {{a chance to}} withstand fire from larger guns. Both these protective schemes used wood as an important component, which made them extremely heavy and limited speed, the key factor in a cruiser's ability to perform its duties satisfactorily.

Several Calcuttas were used on shorter routes, and were instrumental in permitting <b>long-range</b> airline <b>services</b> between outposts of the British Empire. Shorts followed the production of four Calcuttas with the larger Kent, following with a series of still larger aircraft designs such as the Short Empire, the first of which was launched on 2 July 1936.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the great}} {{diffusion}} of advanced devices, such as smart-phones, {{has shown that}} there is a growing trend to rely on new technologies to generate and/or support progress; the society is clearly ready to trust on next-generation communication systems to face today’s concerns on economic and social fields. The reason for this sociological change is represented {{by the fact that the}} technologies have been open to all users, even if the latter do not necessarily have a specific knowledge in this field, and therefore the introduction of new user-friendly applications has now appeared as a business opportunity and a key factor to increase the general cohesion among all citizens. Within the actors of this technological evolution, wireless machine-to-machine (M 2 M) networks are becoming of great importance. These wireless networks are made up of interconnected low-power devices that are able to provide a great variety of services with little or even no user intervention. Examples of these services can be fleet management, fire detection, utilities consumption (water and energy distribution, etc.) or patients monitoring. However, since any arising technology goes together with its security threats, which have to be faced, further studies are necessary to secure wireless M 2 M technology. In this context, main threats are those related to attacks to the services availability and to the privacy of both the subscribers’ and the services providers’ data. Taking into account the often limited resources of the M 2 M devices at the hardware level, ensuring the availability and privacy requirements in the range of M 2 M applications while minimizing the waste of valuable resources is even more challenging. Based on the above facts, this Ph. D. thesis is aimed at providing efficient security solutions for wireless M 2 M networks that effectively reduce energy consumption of the network while not affecting the overall security services of the system. With this goal, we first propose a coherent taxonomy of M 2 M network that allows us to identify which security topics deserve special attention and which entities or specific services are particularly threatened. Second, we define an efficient, secure-data aggregation scheme that is able to increase the network lifetime by optimizing the energy consumption of the devices. Third, we propose a novel physical authenticator or frame checker that minimizes the communication costs in wireless channels and that successfully faces exhaustion attacks. Fourth, we study specific aspects of typical key management schemes to provide a novel protocol which ensures the distribution of secret keys for all the cryptographic methods used in this system. Fifth, we describe the collaboration with the WAVE 2 M community in order to define a proper frame format actually able to support the necessary security services, including the ones that we have already proposed; WAVE 2 M was funded to promote the global use of an emerging wireless communication technology for ultra-low and <b>long-range</b> <b>services.</b> And finally sixth, we provide with an accurate analysis of privacy solutions that actually fit M 2 M-networks services’ requirements. All the analyses along this thesis are corroborated by simulations that confirm significant improvements in terms of efficiency while supporting the necessary security requirements for M 2 M networks.
