40|$|If {{there is}} one {{principle}} of Establishment Clause jurisprudence that has enjoyed the unanimous support {{of all of the}} Justices of the Supreme Court over the last half century, it is that all religions are afforded equal status under the Constitution. With his dissenting opinion in the 2005 Ten Commandments cases, however, Justice Scalia has upset that consensus. According to Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s dissent, the Establishment Clause affords greater protection to the believers of some religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam) than others (Hinduism, Buddhism, no religion, everything else). Turning traditional constitutional law on its head, Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s approach treats the Establishment Clause in the context of governmental religious expression neither as a mandate for equality, nor as a vehicle for protection of the minority against the tyranny of the majority, but rather as a mechanism for protecting the majority from the inconvenience of having to respect the rights of the minority. And not just that: on Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s view, it appears that the Establishment Clause affords greater protection only to the majority religious outlook (Judeo-Christianity) that was prevalent {{at the time of the}} framing. If ever the tables are turned, and the practitioners of other religions (or of no religion) achieve majority status in some communities, the Establishment Clause will not extend the same rights and powers to them that it extends to the adherents of Judeo-Christianity. To Justice Scalia, biblical monotheism is and always shall be the preferred religion of the American Constitution. This Article critiques Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s theory on three principal grounds. First, it argues that Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning is based on a misguided conception of inclusiveness and of minority rights, wrongly suggesting that an equality norm that protects approximately eighty-five percent of Americans, at the expense of the other fifteen percent, is somehow constitutionally acceptable. Second, it argues that Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s defense of his rule on the ground of a perceived need for doctrinal consistency rings hollow, both because his own rule manifestly does not achieve the consistency that he seeks, and because it is misguided to insist, in the name of consistency, that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s traditional mandate of neutrality in religious matters is somehow discredited by the Court 2 ̆ 7 s pragmatic refusal to immediately extend it to the full extent of its <b>logical</b> <b>reach.</b> Finally, this Article argues that Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s rule cannot be defended on originalist grounds, because although it aligns almost perfectly with the political preferences of the religious right, it is both theoretically bankrupt and demonstrably not mandated by, nor even supported by, the historical evidence of the original meaning of the First Amendment on which it is purportedly based. In that respect, Justice Scalia 2 ̆ 7 s dissent stands as a stark example of the inability of originalism to produce in practice - even when practiced by its most able disciples - a genuine apolitical constitutionalism...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{subject of}} the study was {{hardware}} implementations of fuzzy controllers as CMOS analog devices on the base of implementation of fuzzy inference rules as multi-valued logic functions using summing amplifiers as building blocks. Earlier a functional completeness of summing amplifier with saturation in an arbitrary-valued logic was proven that gave a theoretical background for analog implementation of fuzzy controllers. In previous works it was suggested to put into accordance to input and output linguistic variables of a controller description logical values of some multi-valued variables and instead of fuzzification and defuzzification procedures to apply piecewise-linear approximation between variable logical levels. In the case when derived logical levels were not evenly distributed in the range of an analog signal change it was suggested {{to increase the number of}} <b>logical</b> levels to <b>reach</b> even distribution. Such approach leaded to decreasing controller accuracy. This paper suggested instead of increasing logical levels to use special devices transforming analog input variables into multi-valued variables with even distribution of logical levels and output multi-valued variables into analog view. For these devices the names fuzzifier and defuzzifier were kept. The paper illustrated a design example for real industrial fuzzy controller and provided SPICE simulation results of its functioning...|$|R

In that earlier time, however, educators' emphasis was on producing more scientists and engineers. Today we recognize that all Americans need a good science background.

The honors program at UMCP was established to foster broad-based undergraduate courses that utilize innovative teaching techniques to provide exemplary education to a select group of students.

40|$|Older {{lattice work}} {{exploring}} the Higgs mass triviality bound is briefly reviewed. It {{indicates that a}} strongly interacting scalar sector in the minimal standard model cannot exist; {{on the other hand}} low energy QCD phenomenology might be interpreted as an indication that it could. We attack this puzzle using the 1 /N expansion and discover a simple criterion for selecting a lattice action that is more likely to produce a heavy Higgs particle. Depending on the precise form of the limitation put on the cutoff effects, our large N calculations, when combined with old numerical data, suggest that the Higgs mass bound might be around 750 GeV, which is higher than the ∼ 650 GeV previously obtained. Preliminary numerical work indicates that an increase of at least 19 % takes place at N = 4 on the F 4 lattice when the old simple action is replaced with a new action (still containing only nearest neighbor interactions) if one uses the lattice spacing as the physical cutoff for both actions. It appears that, while a QCD like theory could produce MH/F ∼ 6, a meaningful “minimal elementary Higgs ” theory cannot have MH/F ∼> 3. Still, even at 750 GeV, the Higgs particle is so wide (∼ 290 GeV), that one cannot argue any more that the scalar sector is weakly coupled. OVERVIEW. The aim of this section is to communicate the logical framework of “triviality ” in as precise a fashion as possible and restrict the presentation of details to only the most important numbers.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that humans have played {{a big role in}} many past major accidents in escalating a chain of events into a full-fledged disaster. However, it needs to be recognised that the human operational barrier element can affect the risk level both positively and negatively. Understanding the human performance in a post- initiating event scenario and how this can be included in risk assessment is therefore important. In this thesis, we are attempting to understand the role of human reliability assessment (HRA) in reducing the uncertainties introduced due to human operational element and the effectiveness of current risk assessment tools in capturing human performance within the scope of the new risk concept. This thesis also tries to discuss and present a way in which digitization can help to improve the current risk analysis method incorporating HRA. Study of investigation reports, literature review, interviews and discussion with industrial experts and reviewing the case study in the Petro-HRA guidelines are used throughout the research process of this report to <b>reach</b> <b>logical</b> conclusions. The first chapter defines the objective, motivation and scope of the thesis. In the second chapter, we conduct a literature review of the current and the new risk concept, human reliability assessment techniques used across the industries and conduct interviews of industrial specialists from the oil and gas sector. These insights help us to understand the current HRA’s developmental stage in Norway, its perceived limitations and background. In the third chapter, various investigation reports have been reviewed to understand the role and cause of human performance in the past accidents. Also, various risk indicators have been discussed for their ability to capture human performance. The fourth chapter reviews current risk assessment practices for their applicability, methodology and weaknesses with respect to HRA requirements. The fifth chapter proceeds towards understanding the HRA integration with quantitative risk assessment (QRA), practical limitations, data requirements, modelling Human Failure Events (HFEs) and uncertainties in HRA guidelines. These have helped us to find out gaps and areas in the Petro-HRA guidelines, which require improvement or further research. The sixth chapter introduces the digitisation in oil and gas sector. Here, we present a digital solution encompassing a Multiplier Model as a solution to the highlighted gaps along with its associated assumptions, simplifications and challenges. Finally, the thesis ends on chapter seven by suggesting a few other alternate directions of research which were identified during the study as holding some potential for improving the HRA framework further...|$|R

ABSTRACT:The third edition of the SA Road Traffic Signs Manual (SARTSM) has been in use since 1993. It constitutes a complete technical revision of the Manual in use earlier and provides guidelines for most situations to be encountered in the road signage environment. Due to the extensive expansion and upgrading of the facilities at the Johannesburg International Airport (JIA) {{and in particular the}} construction of the multi-storey parkade, changes had been made to the distribution roads within the Airport precinct. Road signage issues represented {{a large portion of the}} complaints received by Airport management in the past. The changes to the road system presented the opportunity to reconsider the way in which motorist guidance was given. JIA is an exceedingly large trip generator. At the moment, it is estimated that these trips amount to more than 30000 vehicles daily. The planning for the airport is being done for some 20 million PAX annually by the year 2010. This would result in at least 50000 vehicle trips daily. Due to the extremely congested landside area the task of the motorist is equally difficult, especially so for the non-regular visitor to JIA. The brief given to Africon was to develop a signage system that would be user-friendlier and fit the proposed new usage pattern of the facilities available to the motorist. The signage plan provided for the motorist to be led through a number of successive decisions to reach his destination. Guidance towards available parking has been achieved through the linking of variable message signs (both rotating vane and LED display types) to a parking management system implemented in all the parking areas, thus providing dynamically changing information. Other frequently used or future facilities were included in the signage plan in such a way that the most <b>logical</b> routes to <b>reach</b> them were identified. This took cognisance of the need to balance the usage of the two approach roads (also in terms of road signage utilization) as far as possible. This signage plan had been developed against the background of the guidelines contained in SARTSM. A number of principles in SARTSM were utilised in an unconventional way. Differently coloured background insert panels were used to provide a means whereby different routes could be colour-coded, for example. The colours so used are also not regular road signage colours, but were chosen to partly co-incide with a colour convention that has been utilised within the terminal buildings for some time already. With the cooperation of the signage manufacturer, it was even possible to provide these non-traditional colours in fully retro-reflective sheeting, thus ensuring that the signs look the same by night as by day. It is concluded that the signage plan was successfully implemented in a very complicated environment, because it adhered strictly to certain important principles whilst it interpreted the SARTSM in an innovative way where possible.

40|$|Proefskrif (DPhil) [...] PU vir CHO, 1985 INTRODUCTION - Sport {{plays an}} {{important}} role in modern society. Developments in the fields of science and technology influence sport. A modern society without sport is inconceivable. Sports coaching can make an important contribution to the meaningful progress of sport because it is an important component of the development of an participation in sport. Participation and achievement in sport in South Africa are at present being adversely influenced by certain restraining factors. Coaching, as an important component of sport, is also adversely affected. RESTRICTIONS IN SOUTH AFRICAN SPORT - A certain number of restrictions are being encountered in the following areas: - It is doubtful whether the full sporting potential of the South African population, regarding the quality and quantity of participation, has been fully developed. Effective guidance must contribute in such a way that the involvement of a large number of sports producers and participants as well as the financial expenditure on sport is justified. - Research on sports coaching in South Africa does not comply with the necessary requirements that would enable effective sports training and coaching. - Ignorance regarding sports coaching has already caused much damage to sport and sports coaching. - The provision of sports coaching to the heterogeneous South African population has up to now been inadequate and a major part of the population has been deprived of essential guidance and services. - Because South Africa does not have an effective infrastructure for sports coaching, participants, coaches and coaching have all been adversely affected. - The characteristics of sport are not adequately emphasised in coaching: Consequently the value of sport, especially regarding participation at top level (both amateur and professional) has been distorted. - Sports coaches in South Africa experience problems with job security and continuity. Because success is only measured in terms of performance, and performance is subjected to fluctuation, coaching as a career is presented in a poor light. Promising coaches often disappear from the coaching scene because insufficient provision is made for job security, continuity and possibilities in South African Sport. Because winning has been over emphasised at the expense of a long term policy for coaching, the quality of sport, especially on the general participation level has incurred incalculable damage. As opposed to other fields of human endeavour in society, sport occupies a relatively low position on the list of priorities. This necessitates a professional approach so that the limited means and man power may be employed effectively. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY - The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether the professionalisation of coaching will lead to greater participation and better performances and to determine to what extent professionalisation in coaching is extant and what measures can be taken to develop and enhance it. The following points are important regarding the professionalisation of coaching - the control and co-ordination of coaching; - the training of coaches; - the various organisations responsible for coaching, as well as the levels of participation; - the position of the coach regarding job opportunities, job security, remuneration and recognition in the community as well as establishing professional status for the coach; - the economic implications of sports coaching; - the publication and distribution of research results so - that these can be practically implemented. In this connection sport science and coaching in South Africa and leading overseas sporting countries were investigated. The data obtained was evaluated in order to determine to what extent it• would influence the presentation of a• training, administrative and organisational model for sports coaching practice in South Africa. METHOD OF THE STUDY - Most of the information regarding the situation abroad was obtained by means of personal interviews. For this purpose ten different leading sporting countries• have been visited. a) The Middle East, Israel b) The American Continent, Canada, The United States of America c) The British Isles, England d) Western Europe, Belgium, The Federal Republic of West Germany, France, The Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland. Relevant information contained in available literature regarding the above-mentioned countries was also used. Information regarding other overseas countries was obtained from literature available and from correspondence. This was applicable to: a) East European countries, The German Democratic Republic, The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics b) Australasia, Australia. Crucial and key information regarding the position of sports coaching in South Africa and the information that could be identified from the reports of the HSRC sports research (1982) was evaluated to determine its usefulness in <b>reaching</b> <b>logical</b> conclusions and workable proposals that could eminate from these findings. Much information was gleaned from the themes that eventually formed the basis of the HSRC research study. The necessary information concerning the situation of sports science and the professionalisation of coaching in the Republic of South Africa, unavailable in the HSRC reports was acquired by means of questionnaires, personal interviews and available literature. THE CHARACTERISTICS OF SPORT - The essential characteristics of sport were examined to determine in what light sport, in a professionalised coaching practice, should be presented. The following matters were identified: - Sport is based on the kinetic function of the human being and finds its destination in the social function. - Being an activity in its own right, sport has its own structure and value and the development thereof is possible and essential. -In the process of the development of sport, professional sport has come to the fore as a normal historical process. - Professional sport also embodies the essential characteristics of sport. - Play and competition (achievement) are both components of sport. Competition in sport increases performance. - The rules of sport do not necessarily comply with the accepted ethical norms of everyday life. - Sport strives after fairness. - Sport demands preparation and effort. - Sport must be constructive and worthy of mankind. - Sport is essential and consequently coaches are indispensable. SPORT IN SOCIETY - The following factors concerning the place of sport in society must be considered: - Sport is an integral part of society. - The need for sport in the community will probably increase. - An indisputable link exists between sport and culture. - Sport enriches human culture. - Sport as a form of culture must always be regarded as such in any evaluation and priority rating. - Sport is viewed differently in different societies. - Sport changes as the structures of society fluctuate. - Sport entails financial implications and involves many people in its presentation. The science of sport, the coach, sports coaching and the participant, as key concepts have been defined. IMPLICATIONS OF PROFESSIONALISATION FOR COACHING - The implications of professionalisation in coaching have been investigated. Certain aspects in this regard have been singled out. Professions are acknowledged in society because of the particular knowledge the participants have. People practising professions are committed to render services to the community. Professions were established because of the need for specialized services in the community. Professional conduct as implied in the usual professions means that a person must act according to the norms and standards of his profession in a responsible and judicious manner. He must do this according to the demands made on him by his profession. - Professionalism in sport generally means that a participant directly or indirectly receives financial or material benefits by practising sport. - Financial gain serves as motivation for better performances, but is not the only manner of motivation. - The emphasis that is placed on success and performance together with the financial implications involved, leads to a distortion of sports values and also causes a dilemma for the coach. Professionalisation may also mean that sportsmen strive for the improvement of achievements and that they can learn from one another. - In this study the concept "professionalisation" has the same meaning as that of occupations. This does not only mean that coaching is undertaken for remuneration (although this can be the result of professionalisation), but with the professionalisation of coaching an attempt is made to enhance the esteem of coaching as a career on both part-time and full-time levels. Furthermore it means that certain norms and standards as applied to relevant aspects such as control, training, coaching opportunities, job protection and security must be determined and maintained. Very little of the original meaning of amateurism has been retained because sportsmen cannot perform at top level without some assistance, financially or otherwise. The commercialisation of sport has meant that money has become available for sport. Amateur sportsmen also benefit from this. In a professionalized coaching system attention must be paid to the following aspects: - Coaching is a necessity in the present day society. - In sports coaching two distinct sections, a general and specific section can be distinguished. - The sports coach must take into consideration a variety of aspects that are important in coaching. - A number of coaching principles must be kept in mind by the coach. These include methodological and biomechanical principles. The coach must possess particular qualities, be adequately trained and an acceptable vocational milieu must be established for him. Factors that can adversely influence his productivity must be eliminated. The provision of sports coaching must. be subjected to specific principles. The coach also must direct his coaching according to certain principles. During the study, matters indicative of a professionalised coaching approach were examined. In this respect sports science, the control and co-ordination of coaching, the training of coaches, coaching opportunities, the financing of coaching and the distribution of relevant information received attention. CONCLUSION - The following aspects can be emphasized: - Sports research is undertaken to lesser or greater degree in different overseas sporting countries. Physiological research in sport dominates other aspects. Sports research is also undertaken in South Africa, but exhibits deficiencies in certain areas. - The countries involved in this study have a central governing body that controls and co-ordinates coaching, while sporting bodies make a special contribution. South Africa, however, does not have an equivalent central governing body at its disposal. - In various countries the training of coaches has to a large extent been organised and developed to a high level of efficiency. Provision has been made for formal and informal training. Training is undertaken on a fulltime and part-time basis. Formal and non-formal training are undertaken in South Africa, but are not up to standard. - In certain overseas countries special practice and training opportunities and facilities for sportsmen at school level and post-school level, are available. Opportunities for intensive training and coaching in South Africa are almost non-existent. - The career possibilities and job security of overseas coaches are far better than that of their South African counterparts. In different countries many coaches are involved in coaching, whilst a shortage of trained coaches is experienced in South Africa. - Coaching is in most countries to a large extent financed by the state, although sufficient funds are not always available. - Information concerning sport is made available to coaches in various ways but is not always effective. - Demographic variables in South Africa and the heterogenity of the South African population present particular problems that up to now have not received sufficient attention. PROPOSALS - In order to realise the advantages that the professionalisation of coaching can offer, certain matters must receive attention. Eminating from the study it is obvious that the following proposals are accountable. A central -governing body must control and co-ordinate coaching at a national level. The distinctiveness of different types of sport as well as their structures must at all times be taken into account. A constitution for such a body has been presented. The training of coaches must be done in a scientific manner. Provision must be made for both formal and informal training. Training consists of two components, namely, general training and specific training. General training can be offered simultaneously to coaches of different types of sport. Sport institutions at South African universities must present this type of training. Specific coaching must be the responsibility of coaching committees of national sporting bodies. Different levels of training are possible, namely, a preparatory level, levels one to three and a level for professional coaches for those coaches who render services to sport on a fulltime and part-time basis. Adequate training opportunities must be created for sportsmen. Coaching at school level must receive special attention. Both participation and performance-are important. A scheme to identify a talent for sport must be initiated. Information derived from anthropometry, physiology, psychology and sociology must be used for this purpose. Special coaching opportunities must also be provided for at a post-school level. This must comply with the heterogeneous nature of the South African population. Demographic variables must also be taken into account. Adequate career opportunities and job security must be provided to ensure that the most capable persons are available for coaching; provision must be made for both full-time and part-time coaches. Their needs must be considered and their responsibilities must be stipulated. Research in sport must be undertaken in an orderly and scientific manner. Research needs must be identified so that research will benefit sports coaching. Coaching must be financed in a realistic manner. In addition to financial support by the authorities, funds must be generated by other means. These funds can be obtained from sponsors, affiliation fees, registration fees and course fees. Information to coaches must be made available effectively. For this purpose a South African coaching magazine, informative brochures, the media and symposia must be utilized. Doctora...|$|R
