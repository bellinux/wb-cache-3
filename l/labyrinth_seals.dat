50|$|Many {{gas turbine}} engines, having high {{rotational}} speeds, use <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> {{due to their}} lack of friction and long life. Because liquid-filled <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> still generate heat due to the viscosity of the seal oil, and because seal oil can contaminate the process fluids, modern high-performance gas turbines use dry gas seals which use spring-loaded rings with an inert gas in between {{the faces of the}} rings to provide the seal. This creates even lower friction and provides a fluid-free seal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> on {{rotating}} shafts provide non-contact sealing {{action by}} controlling {{the passage of}} fluid {{through a variety of}} chambers by centrifugal motion, {{as well as by the}} formation of controlled fluid vortices. At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages. Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion. This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> are non-contact, they do not wear out.|$|E

Detailed results comparing the rotordynamic coefficients and leakage parameters of a slanted-tooth see-through <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> and a straight-tooth see-through <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> are presented. The straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> used in this research was originally tested by Arthur Picardo. The slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was designed and fabricated to be identical to the straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> in terms of pitch, depth, {{and the number of}} teeth. The angle of inclination of the teeth in the slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> was chosen to be 65 ? from the normal axis. The seals were tested at an inlet pressure of 70 bar-a (1015 psi-a), pressure ratios of 0. 4, 0. 5, and 0. 6, rotor speeds of 10, 200, 15, 350, and 20, 200 rpm, and a radial clearance of 0. 2 mm (8 mils). The experiments were carried out at zero, medium, and high inlet preswirl ratios. The experimental results show only minute differences in the rotordynamic coefficients between the two seals. But, the slanted-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> leaked approximately 10 % less than the straight-tooth <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal.</b> A study of prediction versus experimental data was done.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a force induced by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> on the {{stability}} of rotor systems and the factors of the seal which affect the stability are investigated. In the analysis, {{it is assumed that}} the fluid in the seal is steady and that the rotor is set vertically {{in order to avoid the}} effects of gravity force. The force induced by the seal is expressed in terms proportional to the velocity and displacement of the rotor and is deduced to that expression for the oil film force in journal bearings. That force is taken into account in the equations of motion; then the stability of the system is discussed by energy concept. The force induced by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> always makes the rotor system unstable, and the tendency is marked when seal leakages are small. The resonance point of the rotor system is also affected by the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> (the resonance point of the rotor system is removed by the seal leakages).

5000|$|The {{turbine blades}} expanded, however, {{contacting}} the honeycomb <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> {{and allowing the}} metal to scrape together when the engine overheated, with zero core rotation. When the engine is shut down at altitude, the core begins to cool, and the stator, including the static interstage static seal (ISS), contracts {{at a faster rate}} than the adjacent rotating parts in both the radial and axial direction because of its smaller thermal time constant. The relative rate of cooling of the stator and rotor results in an alignment of the rotating-seal knife edges aft of the normal operating groove in the static seal. If the clearances are tight enough and the relative cooling rates are right, contact can occur between the static and rotating seal elements. The resulting stiction can temporarily prevent the rotor from turning when only the force of ram air is applied to the core. Air turbine starter (ATS) torque has been shown adequate to overcome this restriction. Thus, when the engine cooled, the assembly did not match anymore, and the blades could not rotate freely. The crew ended the descent when they had reached 230 kn but neither engine core (N2) ever indicated any rotation during the entire descent. Since they were too high for an APU start, the ram air turbine (known as an [...] "air-driven generator" [...] on Bombardier products) was deployed to provide electric power for the aircraft, and the crew donned oxygen masks, as the cabin slowly depressurized due to loss of pressurization air from the engines.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Centrifugal compressors are increasingly required to operate in higher pressure, higher speed, and large fluid density. In these conditions, compressors are susceptible to rotordynamic instabilities. To avoid this situation, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> have been modified by (a) using swirl brakes, and (b) using shunt injection. In some cases, <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> have been replaced entirely by honeycomb seals. In shunt injection, the gas is taken from the diff-user or discharge volute, and injected into an upstream cavity of the labyrinth seal. The injection can be radial or against rotation. Even though <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection have successfully been used since 1970 s, this thesis contains the first measured rotordynamic data for <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection. A comparison has been made between <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals,</b> with and without swirl brakes, labyrinth seal with shunt injection (radial and against rotation), and a honeycomb seal. The leakage comparison demonstrates that the honeycomb seal has the best flow control, and the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> with shunt injection the worst. For low and medium running speed, and most conditions, the labyrinth seal with injection against rotation has the best rotordynamic stability followed in order by the honeycomb seal, radial shunt injection, and the labyrinth seal with and without swirl brakes. When running speed increases, the effective damping decreases for the labyrinth seal with injection against rotation. For high speed and high pressure ratio across the seal, the honeycomb seals have better rotordynamic performance. In centrifugal compressors, the selection of the seal should be cautiously analyzed. Seals with shunt injection against rotation will have a better performance due to possibility of a higher pressure injection ratio. On the other hand, honeycomb seals will have a better stability control due to the higher density of the fluid...|$|E

Five basic geometrical parameters of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> were taken into account: the angles of the seal’s two fins, and the fin width, height and pitch. Other parameters were constrained, including the clearance over the fins. The CFD calculations were carried out using the ANSYS-CFX commercial code.

The present investigation numerically explored the effect of damage and wear of the <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> on the turbomachinery flow and temperature fields. Specifically, this work investigated: (1) the effect of rubgroove downstream wall angle on seal leakage, (2) the effect of tooth bending damage on the leakage, (3) the effect of tooth "????????mushrooming"???????? damage on seal leakage, and (4) the effect of rub-groove axial position and wall angle on gas turbine ingress heating. To facilitate grid generation, an unstructured grid generator named OpenCFD was also developed. The grid generator is written in C++ and generates hybrid grids consisting primarily of Cartesian cells. This investigation of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> damage and wear was conducted using the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) to simulate the flows.

The mechanical and thermal interaction of the leakage flow and the rotor/stator has strong influences {{on the performance of}} <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals.</b> In previous numerical studies, such fluid–structure interaction (FSI) effects are usually treated by decoupling the fluid and solid fields. However, fully coupled FSI modeling is indeed required due to the tightly coupled physics. This thesis aims at investigating various mechanical and thermal FSI effects in <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> by means of numerical simulations. In particular, an implicit partitioned approach is applied to study the rotor vibration induced by fluid forces, the fluid–solid heat transfer, and the impact of centrifugal growth. The results show that, periodic oscillations of the rotor can be induced by fluid forces, and the amplitude is linearly dependent on the pressure ratio and mass flow. In the study of thermal and centrifugal effects, the difference between FSI and CFD simulations is discussed in depth, which provides guidelines on the choice of models for future research. Moreover, the influences of various operating conditions on the seal performance are thoroughly investigated in terms of primary dimensionless numbers. Finally, the heat transfer across the fluid–rotor/stator interfaces is discussed in detail. By introducing fully coupled FSI simulations, the current research of <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seals</b> is enriched in respect of: 1) studying FSI effects that are beyond the scope of individual CFD/CSM simulations; 2) reducing potential errors introduced by single field approximations; 3) obtaining additional information and more accurate predictions of fluid and solid fields...|$|E

In this research, innovative stator patterns, able to reduce the seal leakage mass flow rate, have been investigated. The identification of innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed by using numerical CFD analyses. The selection of the innovative lining pattern cell shapes has been performed among all numerical solutions investigated. The most promising solutions have been then experimentally verified. Firstly, a dedicated work has been accomplished, to verify whether ANSYS CFX code was capable of predicting <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal</b> performances adequately in terms of mass flow leakage. Then, a dedicated simplified model has been developed, in order to explore the performances of new designs with a reasonable computational cost. An extended CFD analysis, on the honeycomb stepped <b>labyrinth</b> <b>seal,</b> has been performed, in order to investigate the stator part geometrical parameters affecting the discharge coefficient. A one-at-a-time approach has been employed, to investigate: cell wall thickness, cell depth, cell diameter and fin tip thickness.
