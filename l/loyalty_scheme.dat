With {{an investment in}} excess of 30 million GBP, the Boots Advantage Card, launched in 1997, is the largest smart card retail loyalty card scheme in the world, and the third-largest retail <b>loyalty</b> <b>scheme</b> in the UK in terms of cards issued. The Advantage scheme has 16.4 million cardholders using the card online and in store and at 3rd party retailers. [...] The scheme gives a cardholder four points for every pound spent in a Boots store under normal shopping circumstances. [...] Most stores have kiosks {{which can be used}} in conjunction with the cards for [...] "exclusive offers" [...] which are printed on vouchers and can be used at the till. [...] These vouchers enable money off specific purchases, extra points for specific purchases, or money off or extra points when spending has reached an amount specified on the voucher, or other offers such as double points on either everything of specific products. [...] For example, a customer may get a voucher which provides 250 extra points when they have spent £50 in one transaction. [...] Points equal pence in store, and can be spent at any time and on anything in store, providing the card has enough points to cover the entire cost of the merchandise. The kiosk system was replaced with the Boots App in 2014, where customers can automatically load offers on to their Advantage Card straight from their smartphone.|$|E

To reach this aim the study focuses on the impact of <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes</b> on repeat patronage. This paper aims to contribute to the existing literature on repeat patronage and factors that lead to customer loyalty. A wide body of existing literature focuses on large super markets or airlines that have <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes</b> like plastic cards (to get discounts on purchases) by which customer data with the use of CRM tools to meet specific needs and wants. The aim of this paper is to attempt to understand how <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes</b> in this industry differ in terms of its implementation and usage, and how loyally is developed. To address this purpose two research questions were approached to each the consumers and retailers. What extent do <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes</b> build repeat patronage?

40|$|The UK's leading {{coalition}} <b>loyalty</b> card <b>scheme</b> {{was launched}} {{at a time}} when questions were raised regarding the viability of such schemes. Two years into the scheme, it is now appropriate to review the scheme's relationship with its' customers and judge its' success in terms of its ability to influence card holders' behaviour. To meet the objectives a survey methodology was adopted, and a new questionnaire devised for administration to a sample of coalition <b>loyalty</b> card <b>scheme</b> cardholders. The survey achieved 153 responses from the scheme members. Findings from the study revealed that coalition <b>loyalty</b> card <b>scheme</b> holders' exhibit weak bonds between the card provider and its customers and that customers display signs of low commitment, low trust and low perceived relational benefits. There is a decisive lack of awareness of many sponsors and this confusion seemed to be leading to the use of coalition <b>loyalty</b> card <b>scheme</b> as a single-brand card. Although usage rates are on a par with other <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes,</b> a lack of involvement seems apparent; indicating that no considerable increase in share of customer had occurred. This is mainly down to poorly targeted communications and irrelevant reward offerings. Finally, there was little to suggest that coalition <b>loyalty</b> card <b>scheme</b> are currently having much influence over consumer behaviour, as the bonds between the two parties were not strong enough to encourage this. However, this does not indicate that the current market leader is currently unsuccessful, there is evidence to suggest consumers perceive real benefits in coalition schemes {{and that there is a}} willingness to alter their behaviour if the motivation is sufficient. Implications for future research include more specific investigations into the dynamic of the relationship between <b>loyalty</b> <b>schemes</b> and consumers and further research on coalition schemes per se...|$|R
