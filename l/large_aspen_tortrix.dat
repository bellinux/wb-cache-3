40|$|Tent {{caterpillar}} (Malacosoma disstria [H¸bner]) and <b>large</b> <b>aspen</b> <b>tortrix</b> (Choristoneura conflictana [Walker]) {{are native}} defoliators of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in the boreal forests of North America. Defoliation events can be sporadic and localized but {{there can be}} large scale outbreaks covering hundreds of square kilometers. Large outbreaks are thought to occur in 10 -year cycles and can last several years. Generally {{it is thought that}} defoliation events have short-term effects on aspen productivity but do not result in significant mortality, as aspen reflushes after these spring defoliation events. However, in combination with other stressors such as drought, it has been observed that aspen clones can be weakened and are more susceptible to stem dieback or even clone mortality. Over a period of 8 years we determined seasonal carbohydrate reserves of different tissues in aspen clones. Non-structural carbohydrate reserves were determined in twig, stem and root samples from 9 different clones. During the collection period some of the aspen clones were defoliated in 2000 and/or 2007. After defoliation, tissue carbohydrate reserves in stems and twigs recovered {{by the end of the}} same summer. In contrast, in roots, carbohydrates reserves (particularly starch) were still depressed the second summer after defoliation, relative to clones that were not defoliated. After only one defoliation event starch reserves in the roots were close to zero, suggesting that repeated defoliations could have significant impacts on the survival of aspen clones. The research indicates that root reserves are severely impacted by defoliation and that clones with already low carbohydrate reserves are likely at a higher risk of dieback and mortality and could function as a valuable indicator to assess risks of clonal dieback in aspen...|$|E

However, <b>large</b> <b>aspen</b> {{have largely been}} removed from managed forests, whereas regeneration and the long-term persistence of mature trees in protected areas are matters of concern. We recorded the numbers of mature (≥ 20 cm diameter) aspen in old-growth and managed forests in eastern Finland, based on a large-scale inventory (11400 ha, 36000 living and dead trees). In addition, saplings and small aspen trees were surveyed on thirty-six 1 ha sample plots. The average volumes of mature living and dead aspen were 4. 0 and 1. 3 m 3 /ha in continuous old-growth forests and 0. 2 and 0. 6 m 3 /ha in managed forests, respectively. These results indicate that <b>large</b> <b>aspen</b> trees in managed forests are {{a legacy of the}} past, when forest landscapes were less intensively managed.

50|$|Tree species {{succession}} {{may change}} tree species composition once the old-growth stage has been achieved.

However, in some forest ecosystems this can lead to decisions regarding the preservation of unique stands or attributes that will disappear over the next few decades because of natural succession processes.

30|$|This study {{characterized}} European aspen populations for {{the purposes}} of monitoring and management of boreal conservation areas. Our results suggest that if the number of sample plots is adequate, i.e. 10 or more using plot size 400 m 2, stand level inventory will provide accurate enough forest attributes estimates in conservation areas (minimum accuracy requirement of RMSE% is 20 %– 50 %). Even for the more ecologically valuable attributes, such as diameter distribution, spatial pattern and <b>large</b> <b>aspens,</b> the estimates are acceptable for conservation purposes. Between the three stands, the differences in accuracy were caused by the amount of aspen growing stocks, the sizes of the stands and small differences in the spatial patterns of trees. ALS-based auxiliary information might also be useful in guiding the inventory. However, there is still the major risk that relying on ALS may decrease accuracy. Completely remote sensing-based inventory applications for such detailed attributes obtainable for aspens must still await further development of sensors and algorithms, such as multispectral ALS or combination of ALS and hyper spectral data.|$|R
3000|$|With {{respect to}} aspen populations in {{conservation}} areas, the {{detailed information on}} diameter distribution (e.g., the number of <b>large</b> <b>aspens</b> and the shape of distribution) is also of primary interest because many aspen-associated species are highly specialised to specific tree properties (Kouki et al. 2004; Sahlin and Ranius 2009). While descending diameter distribution shapes are interpreted as indicators of uneven-aged stand structure and, thus, may reflect the continuity of aspen populations, bimodal distributions reveal the existence {{of more than one}} aspen layer, which is usually also strongly related to the stand age structure. Information on both of these distribution types can be utilised in the management of conservation areas, and without this information, the management lacks primary attributes characterising stands. Regarding our results on mimicking distribution types with 10 fixed-radius plots, the proportions of correctly described diameter distributions were about 65 % and 50 % when obtained for the descending and bimodal diameter distributions, respectively.

30|$|Several {{variables}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} aspens in stand-level forest inventories. First, the existence of aspen can be recorded. Secondly, detail on the amount and size of aspen trees is of interest; in stand-level inventories, they are usually described using basal area, mean diameter, and mean height (Koivuniemi and Korhonen 2006). Thirdly, from a biodiversity point of a view, information on size variation and spatial distribution is highly relevant (Kouki et al. 2004). The determination of spatial distribution requires that the trees are individually mapped, which is usually practically impossible to conduct in field surveys, except for research purposes. Correspondingly, the tree height distributions are usually not assessed due to the laborious field measurements, whereas diameter distributions can be obtained. With this information, some indicators of the naturalness of the forest structure, such as the shape of the diameter distribution, of the given aspen population can be assessed. Furthermore, it is easy to define the proportion of <b>large</b> <b>aspens</b> when their diameters at breast height (dbh) are, for instance, greater than 25 cm.|$|R

Forty-eight (48) sites dominated by quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) were evaluated in Oregon and Washington in 2010. Stand and site attributes, aspen regeneration, and damaging agents were recorded at representative plots.

40|$|Forest {{structural}} heterogeneity due to species composition, spatial {{relationships and}} tree size are widely studied patterns in forest systems, but their impacts on tree function {{are not as}} well documented. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine how stand composition, tree proximity relationships and tree size influence the leaf functional traits of aspen, an early successional species, and subalpine fir, a climax species. We measured foliar nutrients, nonstructural carbohydrates (aspen only), defense chemistry and xylem water potential of aspen and subalpine fir trees in three size classes growing in close proximity or independently from other trees under three stand conditions: aspen dominant, aspen-conifer mixed, and conifer dominant stands. Close proximity of subalpine fir to aspen reduced aspen’s storage of starch in foliar tissue by 17 % suggesting that competition between these species may have small effects on carbon metabolism in aspen leaves. Simple sugar (glucose + sucrose) concentrations in aspen leaves were slightly higher in <b>larger</b> <b>aspen</b> trees than smaller trees. However, no differences were found in stem water potential, foliar concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, or secondary defense chemicals of aspen or subalpine fir across the gradients of stand composition, tree proximity or tree size. These results suggest that mechanisms of coexistence allow both aspen and subalpine fir to maintain leaf function across a wide range of stand structural characteristics. For aspen, resource sharing through its clonal root system and high resource storage capacity may partially contribute to its functional stability in mixed aspen-conifer stands...|$|R

40|$|Conservation and {{restoration}} of quaking aspen {{in the western}} United States requires {{an understanding of how}} and when aspen clones became established, how clones adapt to environmental challenges, and how individual clones interact within stands. I used molecular tools to identify individual clones in a natural population of aspen in southern Utah and detected high and low levels of clonal diversity within stands. Stands with high clonal diversity were located in areas with a more frequent fire history, indicating that fires may have prepared sites for seed germination and establishment over time. Conversely, areas of low clonal diversity corresponded to areas with less frequent fire. The same molecular tools were then used to investigate clonal interactions/succession over relatively recent time. For this portion of the study I sampled small, medium, and <b>large</b> <b>aspen</b> ramets (stems) at 25 subplots within spatially separated one-hectare plots, and mapped the clonal identities.

In the final portion of the study, I again used molecular tools to identify aspen clones and investigated tradeoffs between growth and defense chemistry in mature, naturally-occurring trees. Growth was estimated using a ten-year basal area increment, and the percent dry weight of salicortin, tremulacin, and condensed tannins was measured in the same trees.

40|$|Increased {{interest}} in native woodlands has exposed gaps in {{our knowledge of}} our native species. Aspen (Populus tremula L.), one such species, is of considerable conservation value though has been subject to very little previous research. It is widely distributed in Scotland at low density occupying a marginalised niche. Aspen is dioecious but reproduces mainly by asexual means and recruitment is reputed to occur only very rarely. Low population density, a marginal niche and an inability to colonise new sites renders the Scottish aspen resource potentially vulnerable to genetic erosion from natural and anthropogenic disturbance potentially compromising its long term future. Intervention is clearly required. Successful conservation management requires {{a thorough understanding of}} genetic structure at the national, regional and stand scale. The genetic structure of the Scottish native aspen resource was therefore investigated at the national, regional and stand scales using selectively neutral molecular markers. Isozyme analysis was used to estimate genetic variation and investigate population structure and genetic differentiation in six Scottish aspen populations. Eight systems, yielding eleven putative loci, were employed in screening 275 aspen samples. Genetic variation was shown to be greater than mean values obtained for species sharing similar characteristics and comparable with the homologous species P. tremuloides (Pp= 54. 5, Hep= 0. 174, Ap= 2. 00. Aes= 0. 121) suggesting that no significant loss of genetic variation has occurred. Some inbreeding was detected (f= 0. 153) and attributed to assortive mating between a small subset of clones retaining sexual function. A small but significant amount of structuring was detected (q 0. 014) although UPMGA clustering of genetic identity (I) indicated little differentiation amongst populations providing little support of r a multiple origin hypothesis. It is concluded that the genetic structure in the present Scottish native aspen resource (SNAR) is little changed from the genetic structure in the SNAR when aspen ceased widespread flowering. The genetic structure of Tomnagowhan Wood, Strathspey, Scotland's <b>largest</b> <b>aspen</b> dominated woodland, was investigated using the same suite of markers. 186 aspen were samples, mapped and genotyped in an area of 4. 6 ha. Twenty one clones were identified using a combination of isozyme analysis and probability theory. Clonal diversity in <b>large</b> <b>aspen</b> stands would appear much greater than is often asserted. A wide variety of clone sizes and strategies were also uncovered and leaf flushing date was shown to be an efficient phenotypic clonal marker. Analysis of the distribution of DBH suggests that aspen ramets flow a 'window of opportunity' mode of regeneration with the last burst of regeneration occurring around World War II in Tomnagowhan. Genotypic diversity in the small relict island apsen population of Orkney was estimated using the same suite of markers. Fifteen aspen locations were sampled. Multi-locus genotyping, probability theory and local knowledge were used to identify 12 independent clones. A review of the literature and legislation on the "safe" minimum number of clones to use in plantations suggests that the twelve Orkney aspen clones are sufficient to be safely used in the expansion of native woodland in Orkney thus enabling only locally derived stock to be used. The findings of the three surveys are discussed within an ecological and historical context providing a basis for recommendations for the future management and genetic conservation of the Scottish native aspen resource including guidelines on the conservation of the existing resources, expansion of the resource, the production and deployment of aspen planting stock and strategic initiatives...|$|R

A negative relationship between the fungal diversity of logs and snags and the volume of fine woody debris was also related to silvicultural treatments, as fine woody debris increased with silvicultural intensity.
