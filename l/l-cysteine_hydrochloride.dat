5000|$|Chlorine dioxide is a {{water soluble}} {{chemical}} compound used as predominantly used in bleach. Bleaching agents make the flour appear whiter, {{as well as}} oxidize the surfaces of the flour grains {{to help with the}} development of gluten. Chlorine Dioxide can also be used as a dough conditioner which can help make the dough firm and decrease mixing time.  Using Chlorine Dioxide in baking can improve the texture, size and surface smoothness of bakery goods.(L-cysteine hydrochloride is a non-essential amino acid formed by the body and is used in the baking industry as a dough conditioner. This chemical compound breaks the bonds of gluten to lower the viscosity, which enhances the dough rising process during baking. This additive also helps to keep the doughs shape by preventing shrinkage during freezing. L-cysteine is a non-essential amino acid that the human body can obtain by converting the essential amino acid methionine.  It is commonly sold as a dough conditioner in the form of <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> In bread, flour and whole wheat flour, 90 p.p.m. of <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> is allowed for using in Canada.  In unstandardized bakery products, Good Manufacturing Practice is followed.  In baking, <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> acts by disrupting the gluten disulfide bonds, which reduces the viscosity of the dough and therefore makes it easier to work the dough and helps the dough to rise while giving it more elasticity.  In addition, L-cysteine keeps dough shape and prevents shrinkage during dough freezing.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A {{method is}} {{described}} for the presumptive identification of Legionellapneumophila by {{the formation of}} satellite colonies around filter paper discs impregnated with ferric pyrophosphate and <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> on a deficient basal medium. This technique simplifies the differentiation of picked colonies of L pneumophila from other organisms in mixed cultures from environmental and contaminated clinical samples. Several culture media {{have been developed for}} the cultivation of L pneumophila and with the addition of antibiotics to produce semiselective media, the isolation of L pneumophila from mixed cultures has been facilitated. ' Until now L pneumophila has been initially identified by colonial appearance, morphology when stained and failure to grow on non-specialised media such as blood agar. 5 A method has now been devised which simplifies the identification of isolates when dealing with large numbers of suspect colonies from mixed cultures.

40|$|Nonlinear optical single {{crystals}} of <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> monohydrate (LCB) {{were grown}} by slow evap-oration technique. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the crystal system {{and helped to}} determine lattice parameter values. Powder X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out and the diffraction patterns were indexed. The optical properties of the crystals were determined using UV-visible spectroscopy. Optical con-stants such as refractive index, extinction coefficient and electric susceptibility were determined from UV-visible spectroscopy. The Fourier transform infrared studies confirmed the various functional groups present in the grown crystal. The mechanical behaviour of the grown crystals was studied using Vicker's microhardness tester. The ther-mal analysis confirmed that the crystal was stable up to 108. 7 C. The dielectric constant and the dielectric loss measurements were carried out for different temperatures and frequencies. Second harmonic generation of LCB crystal was investigated by the Kurtz powder technique...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ascorbic acid and <b>L-Cysteine</b> <b>Hydrochloride</b> (Cys-HCl) on growth of Bifidobacterium bifidum BB 01 and BB 03 were studied by using MRS broth as the control, the {{concentrations}} of ascorbic acid and Cys-HCl were both of 0. 4, 0. 6, 0. 8, 1. 0 and 1. 2 g/L. The result showed as follows: ascorbic acid 0. 8 g/L or Cys-HCl 0. 6 g/L on growth of B. bifidum BB 01 and ascorbic acid 0. 4 g/L and Cys-HCl 0. 4 g/L on growth of B. bifidum BB 03 had significant influence (p< 0. 05), respectively. The OD 600 of B. bifidum BB 01 and B. bifidum BB 03 reached 1. 32, 1. 32, 1. 347 and 1. 296 at optimal concentration of ascorbic acid and Cys-HCl mentioned above, while the control only reached 1. 121 and 1. 213 respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{reducing}} agent (<b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> monohydrate), oxidising agents (ina­cti­va­ted dry yeast, L-tyrosine) and other two amino acids (L-threonine and L-tryptophan) on the rheological characteristics of wheat flour dough and its quality were studied. The addition of oxidising agents increases the values such as tenacity and decreases extensibility which were measured on the alveograph. From the consistograph values, weakening of the dough also decreases. While reducing agents increase the extensibility and weakening of the dough, they decrease its deformation energy. The addition of L-tryptophan caused a higher increase in tenacity of the dough {{but on the other}} hand a larger decrease in extensibility and deformation energy. L-tryptophan caused better stability of the dough. L-treonine was found to be an oxidising agent. The dough with L-threonine weakened rapidly and therefore fast preparation of the dough is necessary. It means that the time of mixing and dough proo­fing must be reduced...|$|E
40|$|Background: Members of {{the genus}} Scedosporium are {{emerging}} human pathogens, causing {{a wide range of}} infections. Their treatment means a challenge for clinicians, mostly because of the low susceptibility of these causative agents to conventional antifungal drugs. New alternative therapeutic approaches are required for better clinical outcomes. Cysteine and its derivatives alone or in combinations with antifungal drugs might have improved antifungal effects against Scedosporium species. Methods: The in vitro antifungal effects of two cysteine forms and three of their derivatives (i. e., D-cysteine, <b>L-cysteine,</b> L-cysteine-methyl ester <b>hydrochloride,</b> N- isobutyryl-D-cysteine, and N-isobutyryl-L-cysteine) were determined using the CLSI M 38 -A 2 broth microdilution method. The in vitro drug interactions between the most effective cysteine derivatives and some conventional antifungal drugs were also investigated using checkerboard assays in case of four clinical isolates. Results: L-cysteine-methyl ester hydrochloride proved to be the most effective among the investigated compounds. N-isobutyryl-L-cysteine exhibited antifungal activity against one Scedosporium aurantiacum strain only. D-cysteine, L-cysteine and N-isobutyryl-D-cysteine proved to be ineffective against Scedosporium spp. in the investigated concentration range. No significant differences were found in the susceptibilities between environmental and clinical isolates. L-cysteine-methyl ester hydrochloride could interact synergistically with amphotericin B, caspofungin, terbinafine and voriconazole. Antagonistic interactions were not observed between the investigated compounds. Conclusions: The present study provides an evidence for the in vitro antifungal activity of L-cysteinemethyl ester hydrochloride and the synergistic interactions between this cysteine derivative and conventional antifungal agents. Based on our results, L-cysteine-methyl ester hydrochloride in combination with antifungal drugs could be applicable in the treatment of human Scedosporium infections in the future. However, further studies are required to clarify the antifungal mechanism of L-cysteine-methyl ester hydrochloride and to investigate its activity in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Viscosities, {{refractive}} indices, and densities for {{aqueous solution}} of <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> monohydrate ([LCHCMH]) and D-sorbitol, and also densities (ρ), refractive indices (), excess molar volumes (), and change of refractive indices on mixing () for aqueous solution of glycerol have been measured at several mole fractions and temperatures (between [*]K and [*]K) at atmospheric pressure. The measurements {{were carried out}} using a vibrating-tube density meter for density, an Abbe refractometer for refractive index, and an Ubbelohde viscometer for viscosity. From these data for aqueous solution of glycerol, the excess molar volumes and the change of refractive indices on mixing were calculated and fitted to the Redlich-Kister polynomial equation. Also for aqueous solutions of [LCHCMH], glycerol, and D-sorbitol, the density and refractive indices were fitted with the experimental equations to estimate the adjustable parameters and relative deviations. It has been observed for aqueous solution of glycerol that the excess molar volumes and change of refractive indices on mixing increase and decrease with increasing temperature, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Background: Antimicrobial {{susceptibility}} testing (AST) of Clostridium difficile {{is increasingly}} important {{because of the}} rise in resistant strains. The standard medium for the AST of C. difficile is supplemented Brucella agar (sBA), but {{we found that the}} growth of C. difficile on sBA was not optimal. Because active growth is critical for reliable AST, we developed a new, modified C. difficile (mCD) agar. C. difficile grew better on mCD agar than on sBA. Methods: C. difficile isolates were collected from patients with healthcare-associated diar-rhea. sBA medium was prepared according to the CLSI guidelines. Homemade mCD agar containing taurocholate, <b>L-cysteine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> and 7 % horse blood was used. For 171 C. difficile isolates, we compared the agar dilution AST results from mCD agar with those from sBA. Results: No significant differences were observed in the 50 % minimal inhibitory concentra-tion (MIC 50) and 90 % minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC 90) of clindamycin (CLI), metro...|$|E
