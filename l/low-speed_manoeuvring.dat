40|$|With 900 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) {{required}} {{over the}} next decade (Newman et al., 2007) existing survey-style AUVs need improved utilization factors. Additional control devices to extend operational capability need consideration together with the interchange between AUV control approaches. This paper considers supplementary through-body tunnel thruster control during the transition from survey operation to <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring.</b> Modified manoeuvring equations permit investigation of energy level demands as a positively buoyant AUV is slowed down from cruising speed to maintaining a stationary position. A suitable model of the selected thruster device is proposed following a literature review of tunnel thruster performance...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the control design problem of {{positioning}} of over-actuated underwater vehicles. The proposed design {{is based on}} a control architecture with combined position and velocity loops and a control tuning method based on the decoupled models. We derive analytical tuning rules based on requirements of closed-loop stability, positioning performance, and the vehicle velocity dynamic characteristics. The vehicle modelling is considered from force to motion with appropriate simplifications related to <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> hydrodynamics and vehicle symmetry. The control design is considered together with a control allocation mapping. This approach makes the control tuning independent of the characteristics of the force actuators and provides the basis for control reconfiguration in the presence of actuator failure. We propose an anti-wind-up implementation of the controller, which ensures that the constraints related to actuation capacity are not violated. This approach simplifies the control allocation problem since the actuator constraints are mapped into generalised force constraints...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the control design problem of {{positioning}} of over-actuated marine vehicles with control allocation. The proposed design {{is based on}} a combined position and velocity loops in a multi-variable anti-windup implementation together with a control allocation mapping. The vehicle modelling is considered with appropriate simplifications related to <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> hydrodynamics and vehicle symmetry. The control design is considered together with a control allocation mapping. We derive analytical tuning rules based on requirements of closed-loop stability and performance. The anti- windup implementation of the controller is obtained by mapping the actuator-force constraint set into a constraint set for the generalized forces. This approach ensures that actuation capacity is not violated by constraining the generalized control forces; thus, the control allocation is simplified since it can be formulated as an unconstrained problem. The mapping can also be modified on-line based on actuator availability to provide actuator-failure accommodation. We provide a proof of the closed-loop stability and illustrate the performance using simulation scenarios for an open-frame underwater vehicle...|$|E
50|$|Modern cars {{do not use}} pure Ackermann steering, {{partly because}} it ignores {{important}} dynamic and compliant effects, but the principle is sound for <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b> Some racing cars use reverse Ackermann geometry {{to compensate for the}} large difference in slip angle between the inner and outer front tyres while cornering at high speed. The use of such geometry helps reduce tyre temperatures during high-speed cornering but compromises performance in <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvres.</b>|$|R
40|$|The use {{of large}} {{displacement}} yaw cueing {{is becoming more}} common {{as a part of}} the motion cueing in driving simulators. It is expected that driving behaviour, comfort and realism will be positively affected by adding a yaw table, especially during <b>low-speed</b> turning <b>manoeuvres.</b> We used TNO's advanced motion platform Desdemona to explore the effects of yaw motion during highway and urban turning manoeuvres: 14 participants drove the simulator with and without yaw motion. Questionnaires results showed that the simulation was rated as quite realistic. Effects of yaw motion on the subjective ratings were not found. In terms of driving behaviour, we found statistically significant effects of yaw motion in curve driving, especially in small-radius curves. With yaw motion present, driving behaviour became more cautious, and (compared against the literature) more realistic. This suggests that adding yaw motion to a driving simulator improves the external validity for <b>low-speed</b> corner driving <b>manoeuvres...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{definition}} of the severity or adversity of met-ocean conditions under which ships need to maintain manoeuvrability is a basis for formulating power and steering requirements for ships. Specification of such adverse weather conditions {{is one of the}} objectives of the SHOPERA (Energy Efficient Safe SHip OPERAtion) (2013 - 2016) project, funded by the European Commission in the frame of FP 7. Three distinct situations requiring different adverse weather criteria are considered in the project: manoeuvring in the open sea, manoeuvring in coastal waters and <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> in restricted areas. The {{purpose of the present study}} is twofold, first to investigate met-ocean climate associated with the three selected scenarios and specifying its main properties, second identifying critical met-ocean characteristics requiring sensitivity studies in numerical simulations and model tests. Both measured and hindcast data are used in the analysis. The North Atlantic deep water met-ocean environment and three coastal locations are considered. Seaway joint statistics for ship routes across the North Atlantic and in European coastal areas is supporting the investigations. It is shown that met-ocean conditions vary significantly in deep and coastal waters with regard to the likelihood of occurrence of sea states as well as their characteristics...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simulation model for estimating the global pack ice load and resulting motion of the vessel, including the load on the mooring system. The basis of the model is a system of ordinary differential equations describing the motion of the vessel resulting from ice load contributions. The problem is formulated as a two-dimensional <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> simulation with the ice represented as an external disturbance. Systematic model tests were conducted in the ice tank at the Institute for Marine Dynamics using a newly developed Planar Motion Mechanism (PMM). The purpose of the tests was to estimate the inertial and damping contributions of the ice. From these empirical data coefficients were determined to model the ice load on the vessel. These experiments covered parameters such as ice drift speed, amplitude and period of oscillation, ice thickness, floe size and concentration. Tests were also conducted in clear water to estimate the hydrodynamic components. In a parallel task, a numerical discrete element model, DECICE, was used to determine the ice loading functions without hull inertial and damping forces. The 2 -D version of the code was used and the simulations were run using the same parameters as the experimental model tests. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{address the}} {{kinematic}} variables control {{problem for the}} <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring</b> of a low cost and underactuated underwater vehicle. Control of underwater vehicles is not simple, mainly due to the non-linear and coupled character of system equations, {{the lack of a}} precise model of vehicle dynamics and parameters, as well as the appearance of internal and external perturbations. The proposed methodology is an approach included in the control areas of non-linear feedback linearization, model-based and uncertainties consideration, making use of a pioneering algorithm in underwater vehicles. It is based on the fusion of a sliding mode controller and an adaptive fuzzy system, including the advantages of both systems. The main advantage of this methodology is that it relaxes the required knowledge of vehicle model, reducing the cost of its design. The described controller is part of a modular and simple 2 D guidance and control architecture. The controller makes use of a semi-decoupled non-linear plant model of the Snorkel vehicle and it is compounded by three independent controllers, each one for the three controllable DOFs of the vehicle. The experimental results demonstrate the good performance of the proposed controller, within the constraints of the sensorial system and the uncertainty of vehicle theoretical models.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer effective nonlinear time-domain strip theory formulation for dynamic positioning (DP) and <b>low-speed</b> <b>manoeuvring.</b> Strip theory or 2 D potential theory, where {{the ship is}} divided in 20 to 30 cross sections, {{can be used to}} compute the potential coefficients (added mass and potential damping) and the exciting wave loads (Froude-Krylov and diffraction forces). Commercially available programs are ShipX (VERES) by Marintek (Fathi, 2004) and SEAWAY by Amarcon (Journ√©e & Adegeest, 2003), for instance. The proposed method can easily be extended to utilize other strip theory formulations or 3 -D potential programs like WAMIT (2004). The frequency dependent potential damping, which in classic theory results in a convolution integral not suited for real-time simulation, is compactly represented by using the state-space formulation of Kristiansen & Egeland (2003). The separation of the vessel model into a low-frequency model (represented by zerofrequency added mass and damping) and a wave-frequency model (represented by motion transfer functions or RAOs), which is commonly used for simulation, is hence made superfluous. Transformations of motions and coefficients between different coordinate systems and origins, i. e. data frame, hydrodynamic frame, body frame, inertial frame etc., are put into the rigid framework of Fossen (1994, 2002). The kinematic equations of motion are formulated in a compact nonlinear vector representation and the classical kinematic assumption that the Euler angles are small is removed. This is important for computation of accurate control forces at higher roll and pitch angles. The hydrodynamic forces in the steadily translating hydrodynamic reference frame (equilibrium axes) are, however, assumed tobe linear. Recipes for computation of retardation functions are presented and frequency dependent viscous damping is included. Emphasis is placed on numerical computations and representation of the data from VERES and SEAWAY in Matlab/Simulink. For this purpose a Simulink add-in to the Marine Systems Simulator (MSS) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology has been developed (Fossen et al., 2004) ...|$|E
