40|$|<b>Loss</b> of {{livestock}} <b>to</b> predators {{is the primary}} justification for predator control programs in Oregon. Magnitude of these losses in-fluences decisions regarding the intensity of control methods used and monies spent. Historically, loss estimates {{have been made by}} livestock growers {{at the end of the}} calendar year. Loss estimates have been chal-lenged by environmentalists and conservationists, who allege that the loss figures are inflated by growers to insure a continued high level of predator control. There was need, therefore, to obtain accurate estimates of <b>losses</b> {{of livestock}} <b>to</b> predators in Oregon. The 1975 Oregon Legislature recognized this need and appropriated funds to col-lect information on livestock <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> predation as part of a Predator Information and Education Program. This report presents the findings of a survey among sheep and cattle growers of <b>losses</b> of livestock <b>to</b> predators in Oregon. As with any animal damage situation, control efforts are best utilized when characteristics of the loss are known. For livestock <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> predators, these characteristics include: animals most vulnerable to predation; time of the year of <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> predation; the predator involved; and livestock management practices associated with lowered loss rates. This information will provide input for better management of livestock <b>to</b> reduce <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> predation. OBJECTIVES 1. To estimate and characterize losses suffered by sheep and cattle in Oregon to predators based on reports submitted by growers. 2. To validate the reliability of the reports, submitted by grow-ers, of livestock <b>losses</b> <b>to</b> predators. 3. To derive management recommendations for decreasing livestock losses based on information gathered in this survey...|$|R
