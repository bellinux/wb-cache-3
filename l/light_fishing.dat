40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the influence of food involvement as a means of understanding differences in fish consumption levels. This study presents the findings of an online survey of 899 Australian consumers which investigated drivers and barriers to fish consumption among regular, light and very <b>light</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. The findings reveal that higher food involvement leading to increased fish consumption is associated with reduced perceived risk, higher perceived hedonic and symbolic value, and increased product importance. Regular fish consumers are less likely to perceive risk with selecting fish and recognising if fish is fresh than <b>lighter</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. Moreover, regular fish consumers are more likely to perceive higher levels of hedonic value (liking fish and feeling satisfied after eating fish), higher symbolic value (the extent to which people consider eating fish says something about them as a person) and greater product importance (greater interest in food traceability and looking for authentic foods to cook) than <b>lighter</b> <b>fish</b> consumers. Based on these findings, recommendations for increasing food involvement as a means of stimulating seafood consumption through marketing interventions such as consumer information and education, promotional strategies and product development are provided...|$|R

50|$|In North America, {{coho salmon}} {{is a game}} fish in fresh and salt water from July to December, {{especially}} with <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> tackle. It {{is one of the}} most popular sport fish in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada. Its popularity is due in part to the reckless abandon which it frequently displays chasing bait and lure while in salt water, and the large number of coastal streams it ascends during its spawning runs. Its habit of schooling in relatively shallow water, and often near beaches, makes it accessible to anglers on the banks, as well as in boats.|$|E
50|$|Largemouth {{bass fishing}} {{can be good}} on Aquilla. The {{combination}} of stained water, localized cover, and <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> pressure means there are some big bass to catch {{but you have to}} work for them. Fish spinner baits, jig and pork combos, and plastic worms in and around cover. Tree lines, fencerows, and creek channels are good places to start. Crappie are usually found on submerged brushpiles and large isolated trees. Live minnows seem to be the preferred bait. Channel and blue catfish are caught drift fishing flats or on trotlines set around shallow, brushy areas. Shad, cutbait, or bloodbait will all work. White bass are caught trolling small tailspinners, jigs, and spoons across windy flats.|$|E
50|$|The Paiute trout {{require a}} habitat of clean, well-oxygenated, moving water with gravel bottoms and quiet pools near {{riparian}} zones. They reach maturity in 2 years, spawn during June and July with eggs hatching in 6-8 weeks and the fry {{emerging from the}} gravel in 2-3 weeks. The rate of growth depends on water temperature and food access, with the Silver King Creek Paiute having been measured at 13.5 inches. Predators include the water shrew and the dipper, a bird that can go underwater to feed. Humans impact the Paiute trout as the fish show a lack of wariness to anglers, possibly {{because of the high}} elevation environment and lack of predators. Serious population declines have occurred from moderate to <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> of the trout.|$|E

5000|$|The island {{attracted}} {{fishermen in}} the 1600s and 1700s, {{especially from the}} Finnish side of the nearby border. Attracted by the herring, fisherman came from Torneå and from Karlö in Ostrobothnia setting up two separate communities on the island with up to 200 people living there during the summer. A pole marker {{was set up in}} 1725, and ten years later made into a beacon (a painted marker that functions like a lighthouse but has no <b>light).</b> <b>Fishing</b> became very productive {{during the second half of}} the 18th century when ten percent of the catch used to be donated to the priest in Torneå. As result of the island's prosperity, in 1768, a chapel was established there on the orders of the magistrate of Torneå. With its tall spire, it became known as [...] "Skärgårdens domkyrka" [...] ("cathedral of the islands").|$|E
50|$|In 1953, {{the company}} {{successfully}} launched the 6108 series diesel engine and was renationalized into the fourth Mechanical Industry Bureau {{in the first}} Ministry of Machine-Building Industry. The same year, it was renamed Weifang Diesel Engine Works and started research, development and production of diesel engines. From 1955, the Czech 6160 diesel engine was successfully trial-manufactured and became the dominant engine model for China’s coastal fishing and inland shipping. Ten years later, Weichai was {{named one of the}} seventy “Daqing-Type” enterprises, a famous national denomination in terms of industrial production. In 1968, the 6200 marine diesel engine was developed and manufactured for <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels.In 1970, the National Defense Industry requested Weichai to develop and produce the 8V160 type tank engine. Weichai R&D team successfully developed an 800 hp tank engine and won, in 1978, the National Science Conference Prize. In 1984, the Austrian heavy-duty vehicle engine Steyr WD615 was introduced. WD615 passed the national-level project acceptance certification in 1989, establishing a new pattern of parallel development of both medium and high-speed diesel engines for the factory.|$|E
5000|$|Eastham is {{the birthplace}} of Freeman Hatch, who in 1853 set the world record for a single-hull wooden sailing vessel from San Francisco around Cape Horn to Boston aboard the clipper ship Northern <b>Light.</b> <b>Fishing</b> and {{especially}} farming were early industries in the town, and writers and artists also came to the town.

50|$|Bream are {{commonly}} caught around structures within an estuary, including fallen branches, piers, rock walls, bridge abutments and other man made structures {{as well as}} on mud and sand banks where shellfish and crustaceans dwell.Although bream are opportunistic feeders, they can often be very difficult to catch in areas subject to high fishing pressure. <b>Light</b> <b>fishing</b> lines and sinkers are used to avoid spooking the fish and, as with all fishing, live bait produces the best results. Various crustaceans such as nippers, prawns and crabs {{are commonly}} used alongside various species of beach and tube worm. Frozen and cut bait such as prawns, mussels, cockles and fish pieces are also effective. Rigs are usually kept simple and light, with running ball or bean sinkers used on a light line from two up to four kilograms in breaking strength tied to a size 6 - 1 hook. In fast flowing waters, heavier sinkers may be needed to keep the bait in the target area long enough to be noticed by a fish. Burley is often introduced into the water, with chopped pilchards or chicken pellets soaked in fish oil popular amongst anglers. In recent years, the use of lures and flies on southern black bream has been successfully developed, with the species known to attack both hard bodied minnow and spinnerbait type lures, as well as soft plastic lures and saltwater flies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> <b>fishing</b> has rapidly {{developed}} and widely {{spread all over}} Indonesia. In the past, lamps (kerosene-pressured lamp) was used in shallow coastal fishing using scoop net and hand line. Nowadays, fishing with lamp (electric lamp), is widely practices from the coastal fishery to offshore fisheries in combination for boat seine, lift net, purse seine etc. In the new millennium, there are two aspects development of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology, are how to increase the catch, {{but at the same}} time how to conserve the fish resources which is an implementation of sustainable fisheries. In Indonesia, research on the impact of <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> has been limited especially for purse seine and lift net (bagan). Bagan is a lift net formed of box-shaped net with fine mesh size of 0. 5 cm, operated with lamp for attracting pelagic species. The purpose of this paper is to review of some research on <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> in Wallacea Area in Indonesia in relation to the impact on sustainable fisheries with special reference to purse seine and lift net. These two fishing gears have different characteristic in relation to the fish species. In the respect of first of maturity of fish, purse seine is friendly for big eye scad but did not friendly for sardine and Indian mackerel. On the other hand, purse seine produces low by catch and discarded catch. The other fishing gear, lift net of bagan rambo (large typed lift-net), generate negative impact which catch higher number of immature fish such as Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) and Russel scad (Decapterus ruselly) and this gear needs high energy consumption for fish lamp. According to the biological aspect bagan rambo was, however environmentally friendly for ancovy (Stolephorus insularis) big eye scad and big size pelagic fish with less amount of discarded catch. It is very important that fishing regulation which is declared in the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Fisheries (CCRF) is to reduce catching the juvenile fish. Therefore, an environmentally friendly <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> technology should be considered in the near future. To establish the environmentally friendly technology of lift net (bagan), better management of fishing unit, fishing ground and the fishing season should be taken in the first priority. Meanwhile, necessary other factors are strongly considered such as improving mesh selectivity of fishing gear and increase of awareness of fishermen to be more responsibl...|$|E
40|$|The use of lamp for {{attracting}} {{and catching}} {{fish and other}} aquatic animals has rapidly developed and widely spread all over in Indonesia In {{the beginning of the}} history of <b>light</b> <b>fishing,</b> the lamp was used in the shallow coastal fishing ground, with the limited number of lamp for the beach seine, scoop net and hand line, by using the torch or kerosene lamp. According to the introduction of the electric lamps, the <b>light</b> <b>fishing</b> has been expanded to the oflshore fisheries to the large-scale commercial level for the boat seine, purse seine, Bagan (platform lift-net), by using electric lamps such as incandescent lamp, fluorescent lamp, and mercury lamp. As the typical characteristics of the tropical fisheries in Indonesia, there are many types of fishing gear for a certain target species, and variety of catch species for a certain type of gear, for identifying the multi-species and multi-gear fisheries. South Sulawesi is one of the regions in Indonesia with the intensive fishing activities with light, with the specialized development of Bagan Rambo (Large scale lift-net operated from the platform raft) in Barru regency, and the purse seine in Jeneponto regency.
