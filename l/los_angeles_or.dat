5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} {{version of}} Wheel premiered on September 19, 1983, {{preceded by a}} series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS-TV in Columbus, Ohio. From its debut, the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart. The show came from humble beginnings: King World chairmen Roger, Michael, and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show, and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York, <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles,</b> <b>or</b> Chicago, Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days. Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning, but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it, and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households. Soon,Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest-rated syndicated show, and {{at the beginning of the}} 1984–85 season, Griffin followed up on the show's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy!, hosted by Alex Trebek. The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy! siphoned ratings from the period's three longest-running and most popular game shows, Tic-Tac-Dough, The Joker's Wild, and Family Feud, to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986. At this point, Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history, and at the peak of the show's popularity, over 40 million people were watching five nights per week. The series, along with companion series Jeopardy!, remained the most-watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011. The program has become America's longest-running syndicated game show and its second-longest in either network or syndication, second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972. The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans, and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{profitability}} of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death revealed a team close to bankruptcy, which surprised many observers. His son, Miami attorney Hugh Culverhouse, Jr., practically forced the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which {{cast doubt on the}} future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to Baltimore, as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time. After Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore and Georgia Frontiere moved the Rams to St. Louis, there was talk of moving the Buccaneers to the vacated markets of <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> Cleveland.|$|E

On August 4, 2010, the Celtics announced that they had signed O'Neal. The contract was for two years at the veteran minimum salary for a total contract value of $2.8million. O'Neal wanted the larger mid-level exception contract, but the Celtics chose instead to give it to Jermaine O'Neal. The Atlanta Hawks and the Dallas Mavericks also expressed interest but had stalled on O'Neal's salary demands. He was introduced by the Celtics on August 10, 2010, and chose the number 36.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the massive}} land size of the 48 states of the {{continental}} United States, and the match locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> San Francisco {{all the way to}} Detroit and back again, covering 2,300mi (3,680km) and 3 time zones one way. The teams in Groups C and D only played in Foxborough (Boston), Chicago and Dallas – a trip from Boston to Dallas is 2,000 miles (3,200km), but only covers one time zone; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still 1,000 miles away from both Dallas and Boston. The teams in Groups E and F's travel was a bit easier – they played exclusively in East Rutherford, New Jersey (New York City), Washington and Orlando. A few teams such as Cameroon and Italy did not have to travel great distances to cities to play matches.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduces}} {{the audience to}} a precinct station and the challenges that its police officers face in a setting of urban decay in a large anonymous city.

500|$|Korean {{popular music}} (K-pop), {{considered}} {{by some to be}} the most important aspect of the Korean Wave, is a music genre that relies on cultural technology to adapt to the tastes of foreign audiences and has now grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults in many places around the world. Although it has spread to the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, its reception in the Western world has so far been lukewarm. However, social media networks such as YouTube, Facebook and Twitter have made it easier for K-pop musicians to reach a wider audience in the West. According to Mark James Russell from Foreign Policy, while the Korean Wave [...] "may not (yet) turn heads in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> London", this could soon change because of [...] "Gangnam Style".|$|E

500|$|Levinson and Fontana {{sought to}} {{establish}} {{many of the}} stylistic elements in the episode which would define the series for its entire run. Among them were near-constant movement with hand-held Super 16 cameras to give the episode a naturalistic documentary look and an editing style involving jump cuts that was unusual for television at the time. Levinson said this camera and editing style was partially inspired by Breathless, the 1960 Jean-Luc Godard film. The scenes were shot on-location in Baltimore, as {{would be the case}} throughout the duration of the series. The use of hand-held cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city, rather than on a sound-stage in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> New York City, where most shows are typically shot. Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore [...] "to be a character in the show".|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, Kroonland {{and sister}} ship Finland were {{chartered}} to the Panama Pacific Line for the long-planned service between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Kroonland departed from New York for California on 22 May and counted 50 honeymooning couples {{and a large}} cargo of flour from St. Paul, Minnesota, among her payload. The intercoastal trip took about 17 days each way and the ships called at either <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> San Diego on eastbound and westbound trips. With two ships on the route, one ship departed from either New York or San Francisco about every three weeks. The service was marketed as the ideal manner to visit the Panama-California Exposition in San Diego and the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. At the San Francisco exhibition, a detailed model of Kroonland was one of ten that comprised a part of IMM's [...] exhibit in the Palace of Transportation.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Helmut F.

In early 1966, Dr. Walter Orr Roberts—director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research—warned of the imminent threat of a smog event {{with the potential to}} kill as many as 10,000 people. Roberts identified <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> New York City as the cities most vulnerable to a large-scale lethal smog in the United States, and London, Hamburg, or Santiago as other the most vulnerable internationally. Asked if [...] "many" [...] American cities were vulnerable to a disaster smog event, Roberts replied, [...] "Yes. I have been worried that we would wake up some morning to an unusual meteorological situation that prevented the air from circulating and that we might find thousands of people dead {{as the result of the}} air they were forced to breathe in that smog situation." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 23, Cuomo {{announced}} that the band would start recording material [...] "with or without" [...] a producer. However, the band's record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self-produced album Pinkerton. The band began rehearsing and arranging both the Summer Songs of 2000 and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford. The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasekwho had also produced their debut album—as producer, and began sending demos to Ocasek {{during the summer of}} 2000. There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> Ocasek's New York home, with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios. The band continued to demo new music daily and started to weed through more than seventy-five demos, eventually homing in on twenty-five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek's arrival. Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs.|$|E
500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as [...] "purple haze all in my brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse me while I kiss the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse me while I kiss this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse me while I kiss that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles),</b> <b>or</b> [...] "'scuse me while I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E
500|$|Like {{the rest}} of the series, the scenes for the first-season episodes were shot on-location in Baltimore. The use of {{hand-held}} cameras allowed the film to be shot more easily in the city, rather than on a sound-stage in <b>Los</b> <b>Angeles</b> <b>or</b> New York City, where most shows are typically shot. Levinson said being on location at all times allowed Baltimore [...] "to be a character in the show". The Recreation Pier Building, a Fells Point structure built in 1914 which once housed Baltimore's marine police, was used as the set of the police department station, which was the principal set for the show. The building looked so realistic that Baltimore residents would occasionally wander into it to report actual crimes. Production director Vincent Peranino created the squad room set inside the Recreation Pier Building. While most sets include a few fake walls opposite an open space for the cameras and crew, Peranino designed the entire room {{as if it were a}} real setting, including separate areas for the detectives' coffee room and the interrogation room known as [...] "The Box". The actors began storing their actual belongings at their desks on the set, left real personal messages to each other on the bulletin boards, and got business cards with their characters' actual names for their desks.|$|E
