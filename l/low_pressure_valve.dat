5000|$|In recent years, {{the engine}} has {{developed}} a noise, referred to as [...] "The Squeak". While {{the cause of this}} noise is not definitively known, it is presumed to come from the <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> There are no physical indications of scuffing, galling, or damage to components indicating a metal-to-metal contact. The squeak is more pronounced as the engine warms up, and goes away as the engine speed increases. The problem has so vexed the engineers that they have started a tongue-in-cheek fund, whereby visitors are required to donate $1 to the repair fund if they wish to talk to an engineer about it.

40|$|Purpose: Ventricular shunt-induced {{craniosynostosis}} is {{a widely}} recognised cause of secondary craniosynostosis. We reviewed the management and long-term outcome of the cases of cranial deformity post cerebrospinal fluid shunting in our unit and compared these with previously published series. Methods: The Australian Craniofacial Unit and Department of Neurosurgery database was searched to identify cases of ventricular shunt-induced cranial deformity and a case note review was undertaken. Results: Eight cases were identified, and all were shunted within 6 months of birth. Our patients required shunting with a <b>low</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> for hydrocephalus secondary to either aqueduct stenosis or intraventricular haemorrhage. The diagnosis was made following computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the skull. Two cases of confirmed suture fusion were treated with cranial vault remodelling and programmable shunt insertion. In six cases, the sutures were not completely fused on the CT images despite a scaphocephalic head shape. These patients were managed conservatively with close monitoring. Conclusion: Cranial vault remodelling together with insertion of programmable shunt valve is indicated in CT confirmed cases of secondary craniosynostosis. X. Doorenbosch, C. J. Molloy, D. J.

The zipper ran from mid-back to mid-chest via the crotch. This design became the industry standard for a while and use was widespread.

40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential <b>pressure</b> or flow-regulated <b>valves</b> for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple differential <b>pressure</b> <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R
