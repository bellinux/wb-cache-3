5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} Venezuela and Colombia. In Venezuela, the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many <b>low-income</b> <b>housing</b> units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in Venezuela, most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} boundary {{was drawn}} to include the highest concentration of historic resources. The street plan dates to 1787 {{and the most recent}} historic building dates to 1940, making those years the period of significance. While some newer buildings are inevitably located within the area, the boundary, where possible, excluded significant mid and late 20th-century buildings like the city hall, <b>low-income</b> <b>housing</b> projects, and the Uncle Sam Atrium, a large shopping mall downtown. All of the original five historic districts are included in full, along with other historic neighborhoods, for a total of 10% of the city's area.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{describes}} the development status of 127 homeless and 91 <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> infants and toddlers. METHODS: The Bayley Scales of Infant Development and the Vineland Screener {{were used to}} gather data. RESULTS: There were no differences between homeless and <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> children. However, younger children in both groups performed better than the older children on most summary scores. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless and <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> children {{did not differ in}} their cognitive and motor skills. However, older children scored lower than younger children on most measures of development status, suggesting that the cumulative effects of poverty may increase with time...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Knowledge {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) and its risk behaviors have not been systematically studied in homeless mothers. The identification of the factors associated with HIV-risk practices will guide interventions for <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> and homeless women. METHODS: We interviewed 220 homeless and 216 <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> mothers living in Worcester, Massachusetts, to gather information on demographic, psychosocial, and HIV-risk practice characteristics. We used standardized instruments and questions drawn from national surveys. The primary study outcome was high HIV-risk behavior. RESULTS: Although homeless mothers {{were more likely than}} <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> mothers to report first sexual contact at an early age, multiple partners during the last 6 months, and a history of intravenous drug use, homelessness was not associated with high HIV-risk practices. Both homeless and <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> mothers demonstrated misconceptions about HIV transmission through casual contact. Among high-risk women, approximately 75 % perceived themselves as having low or no risk for contracting HIV. A history of childhood victimization, adult partner violence, or both placed women at a significantly increased likelihood of high HIV-risk practices. African American race, knowledge about HIV, and self-perception of risk were also significantly associated with high-risk practices. CONCLUSIONS: Homeless mothers are a subgroup of poor women at high risk for HIV and should be targeted for preventive interventions. In addition, there are potentially modifiable factors associated with HIV-risk practices in both <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> and homeless mothers that should be directly addressed...|$|R
5|$|As {{early as}} 1966 Uptown {{was among the}} {{possible}} sites proposed for a northeast-side commuter campus in the City Colleges of Chicago community college district.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show the importance of measuring electricity end-uses in order to promote energy efficiency in <b>low-income</b> <b>houses</b> in Southern Brazil. Sixty <b>low-income</b> <b>houses</b> were surveyed, and data of socioeconomic variables, electricity use, and usage pattern were measured and obtained. Confidence intervals were assigned to obtain representative electricity end-uses and usage patterns.

Usage patterns were obtained for appliances and lighting for each room and also for the electric shower. The results of this study will provide basis for determination of guidelines for <b>low-income</b> <b>houses</b> and government programmes for energy efficiency, rational use of energy and renewable energy...|$|R

40|$|Knowing water {{consumption}} patterns in buildings is key information for water planning. This article aims {{to characterize the}} {{water consumption}} pattern and water end-uses in <b>low-income</b> <b>houses</b> {{in the region of}} Florianópolis, Southern Brazil. Data were collected by interviewing householders, as well as by measuring the flow rate of existing water fixtures and appliances. The results indicated that the shower was the fixture with the largest water consumption in households, i. e., about 30 %– 36 % of total water consumption on average, followed by the toilet (18 %– 20 %). The surveyed households consumed from 111 to 152 L/capita·day on average, based on different income ranges. No correlation was found between income and water consumption. The results of this study can be used to estimate the consumption of water for new buildings, as well as to develop integrated water management strategies in low-income developments, in Florianópolis, such as water-saving plumbing fixtures, rainwater harvesting, and greywater reuse. Likely, there would be a deferral of capital investments in new water assets for enhancing water and wastewater services by saving water in <b>low-income</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} health {{characteristics}} and service utilization patterns of homeless women and <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> {{women who are}} heads of household. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Community of Worcester, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 220 homeless mothers and 216 <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> mothers receiving welfare. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included health status, chronic conditions, adverse lifestyle practices, outpatient and emergency department use and hospitalization rates, and use of preventive screening measures. Both homeless mothers and housed mothers demonstrated low levels of physical and role functioning {{and high levels of}} bodily pain. Prevalence rates of asthma, anemia, and ulcer disease were high in both groups. More than half of both groups were current smokers. Compared with the housed mothers, homeless mothers reported more HIV risk behaviors. Although 90 % of the homeless mothers had been screened for cervical cancer, almost one third had not been screened for tuberculosis. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the homeless mothers, compared with the housed mothers, had more frequent emergency department visits in the past year (adjusted mean, homeless vs housed, 1. 41 vs. 95, p =. 10) and {{were significantly more likely to}} be hospitalized in the past year (adjusted odds ratio 2. 22; 95 % confidence interval 1. 13, 4. 38). CONCLUSIONS: Both homeless mothers and <b>low-income</b> <b>housed</b> mothers had lower health status, more chronic health problems, and higher smoking rates than the general population. High rates of hospitalization, emergency department visits, and more risk behaviors among homeless mothers suggest that they are at even greater risk of adverse health outcomes. Efforts to address gaps in access to primary care and to integrate psychosocial supports with health care delivery may improve health outcomes for homeless mothers and reduce use of costly medical care services...|$|R
