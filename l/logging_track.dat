To maintain competitiveness and control costs in a global market, an efficient <b>log</b> <b>tracking</b> method must be used by regional stakeholders in the log supply chain from stump to mill to end consumer. It is important to understand the implications of recent innovations in <b>log</b> <b>tracking</b> for stakeholders in the Pacific Northwest {{in the context of a}} global economy, and how innovations in other regions may affect the future of <b>log</b> <b>tracking.</b> In this report, we (1) discuss the importance of <b>log</b> <b>tracking</b> technology, (2) review both regional and international efforts to harness technology for <b>tracking</b> <b>logs</b> from stump to mill, (3) report on a regional survey that examines the current status of <b>log</b> <b>tracking</b> in the Pacific Northwest, and (4) identify the most promising technologies that could be implemented in the near future. The majority of regional stakeholders use paper tags or other relatively simple tagging methods. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and other tracer technologies were not used when marking, sorting, tracking, or paying for logs by any of the regional organizations responding to the survey. RFID tags and spray-on code marking show promise for the near future...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in a logging road in a 28 years old secondary forest in theAtlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. We gathered information from three different microhabitats:track road, edge road and an adjacent logged forest. The main objective was to study thedynamics and composition of woody seedlings ³ 20 cm height and < 1 cm dbh. Sets of 5 m 2 quadrats were laid out at 15 meters intervals in the logging road (320 m long). Datawere collected at 12, 19 and 25 months after logging. The author registered density,species richness and diversity, height growth rate, recruitment and mortality. Seedlingsgrowing in the road quadrats had the highest density, growth rate and recruitment. Seedlingdensity in the <b>logging</b> <b>track</b> and edge road did not differ significantly. Mortality rate did notdiffer significantly among the three microhabitats. Species diversity, based on Shannon’sand Simpson’s index, was highest in the logged forest quadrats, but the road quadrats hadthe highest species density. The most abundant species in the track road were Vochysiaferruginea (Mart), Hampea appendiculata (Donn Sm) Standl, and Ossaea brenesii (Standl). V. ferruginea accounted {{for more than half of}} the density per plot. The microhabit conditionscreated by logging activities, especially in the track and edge road may have favored theestablishment of pioneer and other light -demanding species in these open areas regardingthe adjacent logged forest. Long-term studies should be conducted in logged secondaryforests of different ages to understand processes of forest recovery after anthropogenicdisturbance. Furthermore, the role of soil conditions and light availability in these processesneeds to be investigated in more detail...|$|E

40|$|We studied diet {{selection}} and density of forest buffalo in the Campo Ma'an National Park of southern Cameroon. The buffalo's diet in this rainforest comprised 43 % grass, including 15 %Leptochloa caerulecens. Other species eaten were non-graminoid monocots (21. 3 %), mainly Commelinaceae (18. 2 %), including Palisota spp. and dicotyledons (32. 7 %), mainly leaves (26. 5 %). This diet revealed that buffalo collect their food on road verges, <b>logging</b> <b>tracks</b> and along large rivers. This agrees {{well with the}} distribution of buffalo tracks in the study area. Mean buffalo density in the forest was only 0. 01 buffalo km¿ 2, whereas the density on the road together with its direct surroundings was 0. 4 buffalo per km of road. We estimated {{the total number of}} buffalo in the 650 km 2 southern part of National Park Campo-Ma'an of only twenty individuals. We suggest that the buffalo's ancestral niche was not a primeval type of rainforest, as suggested by Kingdon, but an interface between savanna and rainforest. The Campo-Ma'an buffalo most likely depend to a very large extent on anthropogenic vegetation types. Maintaining some grass cover by annual clear-cutting along roads and on <b>logging</b> <b>tracks</b> might be necessary for the survival of the buffalo population within the National Par...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose the}} idea of an online, user {{submitted}} digital library of recreation trails. Digital libraries of trails offer advantages over paper guidebooks in that they are more accurate, dynamic and not limited to the experience of the author(s). The basic representation of a trail is a GPS <b>track</b> <b>log,</b> recorded as recreators travel on trails. As users complete trips, the GPS <b>track</b> <b>logs</b> of their trips are submitted to the central library voluntarily. A major problem is that <b>track</b> <b>logs</b> will overlap and intersect each other. We present a method for the combination of overlapping and intersecting GPS <b>track</b> <b>logs</b> to create a network of GPS trails. Each trail segment in the network can then be characterized by automatic and manual means, producing a digital library of trails. We also describe the TopoFusion system which creates, manages and visualizes GPS data, including GPS networks...|$|R
