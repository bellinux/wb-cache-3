5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, ecology transitioned {{from a more}} {{descriptive}} form of natural history to a more analytical form of scientific natural history. Frederic Clements published the first American ecology book in 1905, presenting the idea of plant communities as a superorganism. This publication launched a debate between ecological holism and individualism that lasted until the 1970s. Clements' superorganism concept proposed that ecosystems progress through regular and determined stages of seral development that are analogous to the developmental stages of an organism. The Clementsian paradigm was challenged by Henry Gleason, who stated that ecological communities develop from the unique and coincidental association of individual organisms. This perceptual shift placed the focus back onto the <b>life</b> <b>histories</b> of individual organisms and how this relates {{to the development of}} community associations.|$|E

From a <b>life</b> <b>history</b> perspective, individuals from higher-SES backgrounds should adopt a slower <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategy, whereas individuals from lower-SES backgrounds should adopt a faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategy. However, {{some researchers have}} found that lower-SES individuals behave more prosocially than higher-SES individuals. This finding is somewhat problematic for the popular view that faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists ought to behave more opportunistically than slower <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists. The goal of the current line of research was to resolve this paradox by identifying a moderator¬ (the cohesiveness of one’s social network) that might help to explain the prosocial interpersonal orientations observed among lower-SES individuals. Three studies were designed to test the notion that there are two ways faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists might interact with members of their social networks: (1) a dependent strategy among faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists who live in residentially stable environments that provide immediate, on-demand resources from members of narrower and deeper social networks, and (2) an opportunistic strategy among faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists who live in residentially unstable environments that allow them to maximize the resources they can extract from their environments in the absence of narrower and deeper social ties. Although the current studies provided very limited support for the hypothesis that faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists (lower-SES individuals) who possess more social network/residential stability would behave more prosocially than slower <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists (higher-SES individuals) or faster <b>life</b> <b>history</b> strategists who lack social network/residential stability, some of the current findings suggest that this hypothesis should not be abandoned out of hand...|$|R
5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of <b>life</b> <b>histories</b> among species.|$|E

Knowledge of their basic biology and <b>life</b> <b>history</b> traits, such as growth, age and maturity, is fundamental to sustainably manage these species, and maintain their critical role in marine ecosystems. Given their economic and social importance of their fisheries in many regions throughout the world, numerous <b>life</b> <b>history</b> studies have been conducted in the last century. Despite efforts to create global repositories of <b>life</b> <b>history</b> parameters, e. g. FishBase, many <b>life</b> <b>history</b> studies remain scattered and are not readily accessible.

40|$|<b>Life</b> <b>history</b> {{variation}} {{can often}} reflect differences in age-specific mortality within populations, {{with the general}} expectation that reproduction should be shifted away from ages experiencing increased mortality. Investigators of <b>life</b> <b>history</b> in vertebrates frequently focus {{on the impact of}} predation, but there is increasing evidence that predation may have unexpected impacts on population density that in turn prompt unexpected changes in <b>life</b> <b>history.</b> There are also other reasons why density might impact <b>life</b> <b>history</b> independently of predation or mortality more generally. We investigated the consequences of predation and density on <b>life</b> <b>history</b> variation among populations of the Pacific leaping blenny, Alticus arnoldorum. This fish from the island of Guam spends its adult life out of the water on rocks in the splash zone, where it is vulnerable to predation and can be expected to be sensitive to changes in population density that impact resource availability. We found populations invested more in reproduction as predation decreased, while growth rate varied primarily in response to population density. These differences in <b>life</b> <b>history</b> among populations are likely plastic given the extensive gene flow among populations revealed by a previous study. The influence of predation and density on <b>life</b> <b>history</b> was unlikely to have operated independently of each other, with predation rate tending to be associated with reduced population densities. Taken together, our results suggest predation and density can have complex influences on <b>life</b> <b>history,</b> and that plastic <b>life</b> <b>history</b> traits could allow populations to persist in new or rapidly changing environments...|$|R

25|$|Fungal endophytes {{which provide}} {{defensive}} services to their host plants may exert selective pressures favouring association through enhanced fitness relative to uninfected hosts. The fungus Neotyphodium spp. infects grasses and increases fitness under conditions {{with high levels}} of interspecific competition. It does this through a combination of benefits including anti-herbivore defenses and growth promoting factors. The customary assumption that plant growth promotion is the main way fungal mutualists improve fitness under attack from herbivores is changing; alteration of plant chemical composition and induced resistance are now recognized as factors of great importance in improving competitive ability and fecundity. Plants undefended by chemical or physical means at certain points in their <b>life</b> <b>histories</b> have higher survival rates when infected with beneficial endophytic fungi. The general trend of plants infected with mutualistic fungi outperforming uninfected plants under moderate to high herbivory exerts selection for higher levels of fungal association as herbivory levels increase. Unsurprisingly, low to moderate levels of herbivore damage also increases the levels of infection by beneficial endophytic fungi.|$|E

Only recently have researchers begun to investigate the mechanistic bases of <b>life</b> <b>history</b> tradeoffs. A recent proposal is that reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a central role in shaping <b>life</b> <b>history</b> traits and tradeoffs.

This is particularly important for salmonid species like Oncorhynchus mykiss, where some individuals remain in freshwater to mature (nonanadromous Rainbow Trout) and others migrate to sea (anadromous Steelhead). Whether one strategy is adopted over the other may depend on the individual’s growth and size. In this study, we explored (1) how water temperature in Beaver Creek, a tributary to the Methow River, Washington, may increase under four climate scenarios, (2) how these thermal changes may alter the <b>life</b> <b>history</b> trajectory followed by O. mykiss (i. e., when and if to smolt), and (3) how changes in food quality or quantity might interact with increasing temperatures.
