5|$|The {{miniature}} city project involved {{students from}} eighteen Springfield public high schools. The students, who were learning construction and handicraft, built {{the city of}} about 1,200 structures {{under the supervision of}} their teachers. It consisted of 1,000 miniature houses, in several neighborhoods, and 200 other structures. The miniature buildings and houses were built according to standard construction plans, and lumber and building-materials companies donated items for the project. The buildings and homes were landscaped with real grass. Their interiors were furnished and decorated like a full-sized house or building. The buildings were scaled at one-half inch to the foot. Tiny Town, with water mains and electric lights, was laid out on streets <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> city.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{physically}} demanding, {{especially for}} the passenger. This is reflected in most in the Swedish term for passenger, burkslav, roughly translated as trunk/body/barrel-slave.

25|$|The {{inspiration}} for the name came from a Pee-wee brand miniature harmonica and the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth. Reubens thought the name Pee-wee Herman was a name that sounded too real to be made up, and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> name a parent would give a child that they didn't really care about.|$|E

He managed to stay aloof of all science `politics' most of the time, even in very adverse circumstances such as those during the McCarthy era when completely unfounded political accusations were made about one or two members of his close research group. Not unlike another American theoretical physicist Robert Oppenheimer, he then had much to lose for his loyal support of the wrongly accused researcher in his group.|$|E
50|$|It is {{an event}} {{organized}} by students for students. Every year 50 EDHEC Business School students (in Lille, France) take up the challenge of organizing the leading student sporting event in Europe. The entire event is organized by student, from the logistic to the communication of the event and its 4 trophies.

25|$|In the Super Smash Bros. series, Toad {{is shown}} to emit spores <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> {{mushroom}} whenever he is attacked, as shown when Peach uses her standard special move. However, this has never {{been seen in the}} main Mario series games. Toad exhibits a similar technique in Mario Sports Mix where he is capable of using the spores to cause mushrooms to sprout from the ground, and his special move is also based on this skill. He is also capable of using these emitted spores as a shield against various attacks in this game.|$|E
25|$|To plan his {{visual effects}} sequences, Jackson also {{utilized}} a lipstick camera for {{the models of}} sets and computer animatics (learned from Industrial Light & Magic), planning the battle sequences <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> general and giving a sense of direction. This would often allow room for him to improvise for action sequences, such as the Moria staircase collapse (which was never in any script draft). He also bought 40,000 toy soldiers to play with. Pre-visualisation would continue throughout production, such as the late addition of the Ents attacking Isengard, and the siege of Minas Tirith in February 2003.|$|E

Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E

It soon became apparent that she was a talented gymnast and Gennadiy took over her coaching himself. By 1972 Davydova was the best in her age group at the school.|$|E
25|$|The {{season was}} {{made all the}} more special {{following}} Shawn Redhage's announcement that the 2016/17 season would be his last in the NBL. When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals {{for the first time in}} 31 years seemed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name—380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)—while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.|$|E

His abilities and powers begin and end with masticating, defecating, and regular napping. You know, just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> dog. Consequently, episodes devoted to Santa’s Little Helper {{tend to be a}} little on the sleepy side, even the Simpsons Christmas special that launched the series." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{operations}} required precise {{flying in}} elongated circuits with replacement aircraft having to merge in seamlessly to avoid tell-tale gaps. The bombers were staged at [...] intervals {{parallel to the}} French coast. Once in position they would spend {{two and a half}} minutes flying toward the coast, dropping chaff at fifteen-second intervals. Then the aircraft would turn and head away from the coast for two minutes and ten seconds. By repeating this circuit, the wide cloud of chaff edged toward the coast just <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> sea-borne fleet. The aircraft had to be modified by cutting a hole in the nose to allow the large quantities of chaff to be dropped.|$|E
