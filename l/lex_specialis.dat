The situation ordinarily arises {{with regard to the}} construction of earlier-enacted specific legislation when more general legislation is later passed. However, then, the doctrine called [...] "lex posterior derogat legi priori" [...] may also apply, the younger law overriding the older law.|$|E

Methods which were used in this research are firstly the type {{of this research is}} normative legal research, focused on the positive legal norms by the shape of legislations. This writing used normative legal research by using secondary data as primary data. Primary Legal Materials were vertically systematized by using subsumption and horizontally was conducted by non contradictive legal reasoning. Legal principles in this research used legal principles of <b>Lex</b> <b>Speciali</b> Derogat Legi Generali, thus it valid the Law Number 7 of 1984 on the Validation of Convention concerning on the Eliminating of Any Forms of Discrimination Toward Women. Analysis was conducted by secondary legal materials which seeking for any similarities, differences, or even the opinion from the source persons. At last, it was compared between primary legal materials to secondary legal materials. The taking conclusion was conducted by deductive process. The result of this research is the role of agency in providing legal protection toward Sales Promotion Girl (SPG) from the perspective of Civil Code is in the shape of working agreement. However in fact, it had not protected women as workers. By the reason that if it should be perceived on the attitude of SPG. The shape of legal protection which is provided toward Sales Promotion Girl (SPG) from the perspective of Criminal Law is sentenced in the Criminal Code in Article 335, Article 281 to Article 296 and the Law Number 13 of 2003 on Workers relating to the unclear contents of working agreement which will bring any impact on Criminal Law. This unclearness is related to the working time to the Sales Promotion Girl (SPG) which had not been managed...|$|R

5000|$|Court {{decisions}} have set vastly different {{standards for the}} eligibility of works of applied art {{on the one hand}} and other types of work on the other, especially fine art. While the barrier is usually very low for fine art and protection is granted even for minimal creativity (dubbed [...] "kleine Münze", literally [...] "small coin" [...] or [...] "small change"), there are extremely high standards for applied art to be reached for it to achieve copyright protection. This is so because Geschmacksmuster (design patents) and Schriftzeichengesetz (typeface patents) are seen as <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> for applied art such that the threshold of originality must not be assumed low for them. This has been confirmed by courts several times, especially for logos, but also for earrings.|$|E

5000|$|Having spent 14 {{years in}} Mount Athos, Sava had {{extensive}} theological knowledge and spiritual power. According to Sava's biography, {{he was asked}} to teach the court and people of Serbia the Christian laws and traditions and [...] "in that way enwisen and educate". Sava then worked on the religious and cultural enlightenment of the Serbian people, educating in Christian morality, love and mercy, meanwhile also working on the church organization. Since his return in 1206, he became the hegumen of Studenica, and as its elder, self-willed entered regulations on the independent status of that monastery in the Studenica Typikon. He used the general chaos in which the Byzantine Empire found itself after the fall of Constantinople (1204) {{into the hands of the}} Crusaders, and the strained relations between the Despotate of Epirus (where the Archbishopric of Ohrid was seated, which the Serbian Church was subordinated to) and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Nicaea, into his advantage. The Studenica Typikon became a sort of <b>lex</b> <b>specialis,</b> which allowed Studenica to have independent status ("Here, therefore, no one is to have authority, neither bishop nor any one else") in relation to the Bishopric of Raška and Archbishopric of Ohrid. The canonization of Nemanja and the Studenica Typikon would be the first steps towards the future autocephaly of the Serbian Church and elevation of the Serbian ruler to king ten years later. In 1217, archimandrite Sava left Studenica and returned to Mount Athos. His departure has been interpreted by a part of the historians as a revolt against his brother Stefan accepting the royal crown from Rome. Stefan had just prior to this made a large switch in politics, marrying a Venetian noblewoman, and subsequently asked the Pope for a crown and moral support. With the establishment of the Latin Empire (1204), Rome had considerably increased its power in the Balkans. Stefan was crowned in Žiča, and was now equal to the other kings, and was called [...] "the First-Crowned King" [...] of [...] "all Serb lands". According to Ćorović, Stefan's politics were not well received in the country; Orthodox tradition had already taken grip, especially Sava rose against his brother, to whom he had up until then been a faithful companion; he was the main representative of Orthodoxy and Byzantine ecclesiastical culture in Serbia. According to Zorić, though Sava left Serbia while talks were underway between Stefan and Rome (apparently due to disagreeing with Stefan's excessive reliance on Rome), he and his brother resumed their good relation after receiving the crown. According to Mileusnić it is possible that Sava did not agree with everything in his brother's international politics, however, his departure for Athos may also be interpreted as a preparation for obtaining the autocephaly (independence) of the Serbian Archbishopric. His departure was planned, both Domentijan and Teodosije, Sava's biographers, stated that before leaving Studenica he appointed a new hegumen and [...] "put the monastery in good, correct order, and enacted the new church constitution and monastic life order, to be held that way", after which he left Serbia.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, a {{majority}} of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) members in the Namibia advisory opinion held that the resolution contained legal declarations that were made while the Council was acting on behalf of the members in accordance with Article 24. The Court also said that an interpretation of the charter that limits the domain of binding decision only to those taken under Chapter VII would render Article 25 [...] "superfluous, since this binding effect is secured by Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter", and that the [...] "language of a resolution of the Security Council should be carefully analyzed before a conclusion can be made as to its binding effect". The ICJ judgment has been criticized by Erika De Wet and others. De Wet argues that Chapter VI resolutions cannot be binding. Her reasoning, in part states:Allowing the Security Council to adopt binding measures under Chapter VI would undermine the structural division of competencies foreseen by Chapters VI and VII, respectively. The whole aim of separating these chapters is to distinguish between voluntary and binding measures. Whereas the pacific settlement of disputes provided by the former is underpinned by the consent of the parties, binding measures in terms of Chapter VII are characterized by the absence of such consent. A further indication of the non-binding nature of measures taken in terms of Chapter VI is the obligation on members of the Security Council who are parties to a dispute, to refrain from voting when resolutions under Chapter VI are adopted. No similar obligation exists with respect to binding resolutions adopted under Chapter VII... If one applies this reasoning to the Namibia opinion, the decisive point is that none of the Articles under Chapter VI facilitate the adoption of the type of binding measures that were adopted by the Security Council in Resolution 276(1970)... Resolution 260(1970) was indeed adopted in terms of Chapter VII, even though the ICJ went to some length to give the opposite impression.Others disagree with this interpretation. Professor Stephen Zunes asserts that [...] "this does not mean that resolutions under Chapter VI are merely advisory, however. These are still directives by the Security Council and differ only in {{that they do not have}} the same stringent enforcement options, such as the use of military force". Former President of the International Court of Justice Rosalyn Higgins argues that the location of Article 25, outside of Chapter VI and VII and with no reference to either, suggests its application is not limited to Chapter VII decisions. She asserts that the Travaux préparatoires to the UN Charter [...] "provide some evidence that Article 25 was not intended to be limited to Chapter VII, or inapplicable to Chapter VI." [...] She argues that early state practice into what resolutions UN members considered binding has been somewhat ambiguous, but seems to [...] "rely not upon whether they are to be regarded as [...] "Chapter VI or [...] "Chapter VII" [...] resolutions ... but upon whether the parties intended them to be [...] "decisions" [...] or [...] "recommendations" ... One is left with the view that in certain limited, and perhaps rare, cases a binding decision may be taken under Chapter VI". She supports the view of the ICJ that [...] "clearly regarded Chapters VI, VII, VIII and XII as <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> while Article 24 contained the lex generalis ... and that resolutions validly adopted under Article 24 were binding on the membership as a whole".|$|E

It may be said, therefore, {{that the}} {{doctrine}} of <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> serves more to determine the precise rules to apply to a particular situation, rather than precluding application of one body of law. This view is supported by Marko Milanović, who has highlighted that understanding the doctrine as being generally applicable to the human rights and humanitarian regimes as a whole, is mistaken (Milanović 2011, 98 – 101). Following Kreiger, Milanović’s suggestion is to assess which rule constitutes the <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> {{by looking at the}} relationship between specific norms, rather than regimes as a whole (Milanović 2011, citing Kreiger 2006).

3000|$|The rhetoric {{pertaining}} to the application of international human rights law to armed conflicts was initially somewhat divergent. A major focus of this debate has revolved around the doctrine of <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> derogat legi generali (<b>lex</b> <b>specialis),</b> which many believed to render the application of human rights during armed conflicts inappropriate (e.g. Schabas 2007, 594).

The doctrine mandates that more precise and specialised law is to take precedence over more general laws. Reluctance to apply human rights law during armed conflicts was also due to the differing natures and ‘roots’ of humanitarian and human rights law (Solis 2010, 24). On the one hand, humanitarian law (not seeking to abolish conflict) does not prohibit the immediate killing of the enemy. It seeks rather to diminish the devastating human cost of conflicts and to ensure a fairer fight (ICRC 2004). 9 Human rights law, on the other hand, seeks to protect individuals from potentially abusive actions by states and does not allow the arbitrary taking of life under any circumstances. 10 [...]...|$|E

To the extend that this is so, I contend that each BIT is nothing but a <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> between parties designed to create a mutual regime of investment protection.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Brill via [URL] article explores the expression of State sovereignty through customary norms in a regulatory space dominated by investment treaties. It argues that, {{because most of the}} actionable concepts expressing sovereignty in international law are general (not specific to a “branch”) and customary, misunderstanding the role of customary law in investment regulation amounts to confining sovereignty to a few narrow carve-outs and exceptions in investment treaties. However, customary concepts operate autonomously and in parallel to treaties, unless specifically excluded by the latter. The <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> principle does not necessarily command the exclusion in toto of relevant customary rules. The article discusses the work of the Institut de Droit International in this regard and then analyses the investment case law relating to the application of the police powers doctrine, necessity, countermeasures and transnational public policy.

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} human rights in armed conflict and international humanitarian law. The topic has the appearance of being somewhat of a Gordian knot in international law scholarship. However, the longstanding character of the dispute surrounding the topic does not diminish its importance. An agreement to disagree {{is not an option}} when considering the practical consequences. While it is unsatisfactory from an academic view that a workable solution on applying both legal regimes to armed conflict settings is still lacking, it is deeply troubling on a practical level. The current situation means no less than an uncertainty concerning legal norms in armed conflicts. This has adverse effects on the protection of legal interests such as life, liberty, and due process in the most extreme circumstances, but it also poses the danger of undermining the acceptance of legal standards. Borrowing from recent judicial developments especially in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, this thesis first outlines the background of the topic and then attempts to reconcile the two main opposing theories, one focussing on the complementary relationship between the legal regimes and one focusing on the <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> characteristic of international humanitarian law, by integrating both into a two-step-approach. This approach features first the attempt to harmonize two applicable norms by way of interpretation and it sees <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> proper as a subsidiary measure to be applied, when such harmonization fails. However, the respective <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> maintains a higher weight on the interpretation stage as well. The thesis then tests the approach by applying it to the human right to life and the human right to liberty in international armed conflicts and the much more problematic field of non-international armed conflicts. This thesis is guided by the hope, that the current state of affairs may offer fertile ground {{for an end to the}} decade-long dispute, as state parties now tend to accept the need for legal clarity in armed conflicts and have given up their fundamental opposition towards applying human rights in extraterritorial settings and national and human rights courts have growingly acknowledged that they are not fostering legal protection by treating the actions of armed forces on the battlefield settings like police operations in peacetime...|$|E

40|$|This Article scrutinizes varying interpretive methodologies used by {{different}} tribunals of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes ("ICSID") {{in relation to}} Article XI of the US-Argentina bilateral investment treaty ("BIT"), which, in different degrees, had referred to the customary doctrine of "necessity" to derive Article XI's substantive meaning and legal effects. Neither Sempra v. Argentina, LG&E v. Argentina, CMS Gas v. Argentina, nor most recently in 2008, Cont'l Cas. Ins. Co. v. Argentina, evince a demonstrably adequate interpretive methodology {{within the framework of}} Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties ("VCLT"). Accordingly, this Article proposes a return to these fundamental rules of treaty interpretation. Given conceptual and methodological incompatibilities between the customary doctrine of "necessity" and Article XI, this Article holds that the customary doctrine has no interpretive utility for Article XI. Rather, treaty appliers of Article XI (and other similarly-worded treaty clauses on nonprecluded measures) should abide by the components of the unitary system of interpretation under the VCLT, particularly the treaty text and context. A State invoking an Article XI-type Non- Precluded Measure ("NPM") utilizes Article XI to address potential international responsibility vis-a-vis the other State Party to the BIT, and cannot use Article XI to remove its <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> substantive duties under the BIT to that State Party's investors.

40|$|The {{parallel}} {{application of}} {{international humanitarian law}} (IHL) and international human rights law (IHRL) to armed conflicts is widely accepted today. Its detailed legal consequences, which will help in understanding its practical effect and potential to enhance the protection of people affected by armed conflicts, remain to be analysed in many areas. This thesis investigates the relationship of state obligations under IHL and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), with a special emphasis on health-related issues in non-international armed conflicts. ICJ jurisprudence suggests that the simultaneous application of IHL and IHRL can be structured {{with the help of}} the <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> maxim. This thesis argues that the function of the <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> maxim is relative and highly situation-dependent. When this is recognised, the maxim - alongside other interpretative methods - promises to aid the flexible parallel application of IHL and economic, social and cultural (ESC) rights to non-international armed conflicts. Despite developments in customary IHL applicable to non-international armed conflicts, the distinction between international and non-international armed conflicts remains relevant in IHL. Likewise, questions remain regarding the threshold of application of some IHL rules. These factors will affect the parallel application of IHL and the ICESCR to non-international armed conflicts. The scope of state obligations under the ICESCR in times of armed conflict has received little attention so far. It is argued that this scope is determined by two Articles: the notion to 'take steps' towards the 'progressive realisation' of ESC rights in Article 2 (1) ICESCR, and by Article 4 ICESCR, the Covenant's general limitation clause. It is shown that the minimum core approach can be helpful in interpreting both Articles - minimum core rights should be implemented as a matter of highest priority even in times of armed conflict. It is further argued that no derogations are permitted from the right to health and other ESC rights in times of armed conflict, in particular not from their minimum cores. Building on these findings and focusing on health-related issues, the thesis analyses how a relative and context-sensitive <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> maxim can assist in easing substantial tensions between elements of the right to health and IHL relating to the targeting of military objectives, in particular so-called 'dual-use' objects. IHL rules on military targeting are found most likely to be given preference in situations of active combat. Nonetheless, the simultaneous application of the right to health will ensure that adverse long-term public health and other socio-economic consequences of NIACs for civilians are not ignored even when hostilities are ongoing and military-target decisions are made. It is also shown that IHL on the protection and care of the wounded and sick and the right to health complement each other well in mitigating the direct and indirect health consequences of armed conflicts, similarly supported by a context-sensitive use of <b>lex</b> <b>specialis.</b> With certain nuances, these findings apply to the relationship between IHL and ESC rights more generally. The operationalisation of this thesis' findings, and of the legal implications of the parallel application of other ESC rights and IHL, requires further efforts. It is concluded that the development of guidelines that assist practitioners in assessing the flexible relationship between IHL and the ICESCR in a given situation are the most functional option in that regard.

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is the law {{enforcement}} in accordance with Part Six of the OSŘ and its comparison with the legislation of civil law execution by Act No. 120 / 2001 Coll. The aim of this work is to describe the rules of inforcement by the OSŘ and the execution by the EŘ, define the basic {{differences between the two}} processes, reflect on the meaningfulness of this dual regulation, as well as {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} performance leadership decision one way or another. The work deals with the relationship between the two rules as lex generalis and <b>lex</b> <b>specialis,</b> and a description of significant differences between the modes of enforcement, as shown in both treatments...|$|E
40|$|The Legal of {{guarantees}} are {{the terms}} and rules of law governing the legal relationship between giver and recipient accounts receivable by charging a guarantee. Previous law guarantees {{are subject to the}} Code of Civil Law (Civil Code) Book II Law Objects. In the development of guarantees are no longer tied to the Civil Code, as <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> subject to other legislation related to the guarantee is understood as economic development gave birth to the type and shape of new guarantee, such as Act No. 4 of 1996 on Mortgage of Land, Along with objects related to the Land and Act No. 42 of 1999 on Fiduciary and other legislation which imposes a guarantee in any legal action...|$|E
30|$|The above {{discussion}} {{demonstrates that}} the more embellished standards relating to the provision of food, water and healthcare found within international human rights law makes these norms, rather than those found in humanitarian law, the <b>lex</b> <b>specialis</b> in the present context. This finding is strengthened by the conclusion that subsistence rights are non-derogable {{and may not be}} limited during NIAC. Unfortunately, whilst this affords perhaps more protection to individuals within territory controlled by a state, it leaves individuals in areas controlled by NSAGs (as non-human rights obligations-holders) without human rights protection. This problem and efforts to use human rights law to remedy the gap in protection through the indirect application of human rights obligations to NSAGs will now be assessed.|$|E
30|$|Ceasefire {{agreements}} generally {{consist of}} three core elements, which provide for “(1) a cessation of hostilities, (2) {{the separation of}} forces, and (3) the verification, supervision, and monitoring of the agreement” (Public International Law and Policy Group 2013, 1). A key component {{to the success of}} ceasefire agreements is to “clearly indicate the rights and obligations of the parties” (ibid, 1 – 2). This component is of particular relevance here, as it suggests that some level of detail concerning the rights and obligations is required. This supports (in light of the above discussion as to the relevant <b>lex</b> <b>specialis)</b> an argument that human rights norms, rather than humanitarian norms {{should be included in the}} agreement to improve the protection of subsistence rights.|$|E
40|$|WTO {{panels are}} {{often called upon}} to decide {{overlapping}} claims based on different WTO agreements. One such dispute was the EC Asbestos case where claims were made under both GATT 1994 and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). This paper examines whether the Appellate Body s refusal in that case to examine Canada s TBT claims was justified. The conclusion reached is no, based on the principle jura novit curia, the general prohibition on non liquet and the WTO case law on judicial economy. In addition, the paper examines when two WTO norms must be seen as in conflict. It argues in favour of broadening the current definition of conflict and clarifies the consequences of a norm being <b>lex</b> <b>specialis.</b> ...|$|E
