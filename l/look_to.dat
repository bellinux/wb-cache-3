5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction {{based on}} religion or caste. It remains unclear {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba.

One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam.

5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will <b>look</b> <b>to</b> the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair.

Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would <b>look</b> <b>to</b> any populist leader for relief.|$|E
