5000|$|Burns Beach {{has managed}} to {{maintain}} much of its original character even with its <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation,</b> and the original caravan park is still in operation. Burns Beach marks {{one end of a}} coastal nature walk extending to Fremantle. The suburb also contains a cafe and restaurant (Burns Beach Cafe and Restaurant) with outdoor seating, as well as a picnic area (beware sandflies) with barbecues and toilets. The historically rich Jack Kickeros community hall is the site of many memorable moments. Burn's Beach's ocean facing parking bays are a popular destination for residents seeking a pleasant spot to watch the sun set in the summer or watch the waves pound through in winter. The parking lot's most seasoned visitor, Michael Stephens, claims to enjoy the [...] "soothing effect of the ocean's waves and the awe inspiring sunsets that come by every so often". A new estate, Peet Limited's Burns Beach Estate, is presently being built north of Burns Beach Road. In early 2006 clearing and road widening were undertaken to facilitate the construction. A community centre and school is expected to be built as part of the development.|$|E

Incorporation into an interdependent world system and <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>isolation</b> caused peripheral sectors within Peru's Amazon to replicate not only the capitalist characteristics of the national economy, but also Peru's dominated and dependent status as a satellite nation. Indigenous societies in the Peruvian Amazon have been undergoing socio-economic adaptations since the penetration of outside economic forces extracting jungle products. Because of internal colonialism, the national government, multi-national corporations, internal middle-men and missionaries, have brought indigenous societies out of isolation, exposed them {{to the demands of}} the world market and incorporated them into the capitalist system as exploited laborers.

40|$|We propose an {{isolation}} network to simultaneously improve the input return loss, output return <b>loss</b> and <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> the Wilkinson power divider {{in a wide}} bandwidth. The required even mode and odd mode reflection coefficients <b>of</b> the <b>isolation</b> network are calculated.

Compared with the single-section Wilkinson divider, the final design can triple the bandwidth for an input-output return <b>loss</b> and <b>isolation</b> <b>of</b> greater than 25 dB.

40|$|The Arndt blocker is {{positioned}} in the desired bronchus using a wire loop which couples the blocker with a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB). The wire loop once removed cannot be reinserted in 5 F and 7 F blockers making repositioning of the blocker difficult. A 34 -year-old female was to undergo left thoracotomy followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The left lung was isolated with a 7 F Arndt bronchial blocker. During one-lung ventilation, the wire loop was removed for oxygen insufflation. There was <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> lung <b>isolation</b> during the procedure and dislodgement of the blocker {{was confirmed by}} FOB.

Out of the patients recruited (n = 226), the completion rate of a full set of four diaries (n = 37) and one three month diary (n = 194) was very good. Vision related to daily life in patients with AMD appears to decline over 12 months with limited psychosocial adjustment to visual loss. Seven themes were generated from the patients’ accounts of their experiences, as recorded in the diaries: safety, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> independence, <b>isolation,</b> support mechanisms, mood, effects of the media and psychosocial adjustment.

40|$|Prolonged {{periods of}} allopatry {{might result in}} <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> the ability to {{discriminate}} against other formerly sympatric species, {{and can lead to}} heterospecific matings and hybridization upon secondary contact. <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> premating <b>isolation</b> during prolonged allopatry can operate in the opposite direction of reinforcement, but has until now been little explored. We investigated how premating isolation between two closely related damselfly species, Calopteryx splendens and C. virgo, might be affected by the expected future northward range expansion of C. splendens into the allopatric zone of C. virgo in northern Scandinavia. We simulated the expected secondary contact by presenting C. splendens females to C. virgo males in the northern allopatric populations in Finland. Premating isolation towards C. splendens in northern allopatric populations was compared to sympatric populations in southern Finland and southern Sweden. Male courtship responses of C. virgo towards conspecific females showed limited geographic variation, however, courtship attempts towards heterospecific C. splendens females increased significantly from sympatry to allopatry. Our results suggest that allopatric C. virgo males have partly lost their ability to discriminate against heterospecific females. Reduced premating isolation in allopatry might lead to increased heterospecific matings between taxa that are currently expanding and shifting their ranges in response to climate change...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wideband dual-polarization {{performance}} is desired for low-noise receivers and radiom eters at cent imete r and m illimeter wavelengths. The {{use of a}} waveguide orthomode transducer (OMT) can increase spectral coverage and sensitivity while reducing exit aperture size, optical spill, and instrumental polarization offsets. For these reasons, an orthomode junction is favored over a traditional quasi-op tical wire grid for focal plane imaging arrays from a systems perspective. The fabrication and pe rformance o f wideban d symm etric Bøifot OM T junctions at K-, Ka-, Q-, and W-bands are described.

40|$|M. Ing. The {{need for}} efficient, power dense, high {{frequency}} DC-DC converters {{is becoming more}} important in applications such as on board voltage regulation modules for low voltage microprocessors {{as well as the}} interconnection system of the two parallel DC-busses present in future automobiles. These applications have a few basic criteria in common, namely, that they exhibit a low voltage conversion ratio, demand a high power capability as well as a high power density and have no explicit need for galvanic isolation. For applications that fit this description, a new innovative conversion system is presented and critically evaluated against similar converters on the bases of efficiency and component rms currents. The comparison involves four such DC-DC converters, from which two are new topologies brought about by the new innovative system configuration. Generalised analytical results, alongside practically verified results, are presented for each converter topology. A detailed design also accompanies each converter topology. The results show that significant gain can be achieved from the new innovative conversion system above currently implemented DC-DC converters in the fields of switch and passive component rms currents as well as power density and efficiency. This gain is shown to come at the cost of increased complexity and the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> galvanic <b>isolation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Almost {{three-quarters of}} family {{practice}} residents in British Columbia (BC) meet criteria for burnout. We sought {{to understand how}} burnout is perceived and experienced by family medicine residents, and to identify both contributory and protective factors for resident burnout. Method: Two semi-structured focus groups were conducted with ten family practice residents from five distinct University of British Columbia training sites. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). The {{data were analyzed using}} a thematic analysis approach. Results: Seventy percent of the focus group participants met criteria for burnout using the MBI. The experience of burnout was described as physical and emotional exhaustion, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> motivation, <b>isolation</b> from loved ones, and disillusionment with the medical profession. Contributory factors included high workload, burned-out colleagues, perceived undervaluing of family medicine, lack of autonomy, and inability to achieve work-life balance. Protective factors included strong role models in medicine, feeling that one’s work is valued and rotations in family medicine. Conclusions: The high level of burnout in family medicine residents in BC is a multifactorial and complex phenomenon. Training programs and faculty should be aware of burnout risk factors and strive to implement changes to reduce burnout, including allowing residents increased control over scheduling, access to counselin...|$|R
