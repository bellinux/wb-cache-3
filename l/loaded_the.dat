5|$|Colón {{scored on}} a hit by Escobar. The Royals <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bases, and Cain drove home three more runs with a double off of Bartolo Colón. Davis pitched a shutout inning for the Royals to {{complete}} the series and win the championship. He struck out Flores looking to end the game, series, baseball season, and their 30-year World Series title drought.|$|E
5|$|The game {{remained}} scoreless in {{the early}} innings, with only two baserunners apiece for each team through the first three innings. The Giants <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bases with two outs {{in the top of}} the 4th inning, but Brian Johnson struck out to end the inning. The first runs of the game came in the bottom of the 5th as Henry Rodriguez singled to lead off the inning and scored on a home run by Gary Gaetti to give the Cubs a 2–0 lead. The Cubs threatened again in the next inning with singles by Lance Johnson and Sammy Sosa. Rich Rodriguez relieved Gardner, but <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bases with a walk to Mark Grace and allowed a single to Matt Mieske which scored two more runs and extended the Cubs' lead to 4–0. John Johnstone relieved Rodriguez and closed the inning without further scoring.|$|E
40|$|The Diploma’s {{thesis is}} focused on the design of {{selected}} parts of reinforced concrete exhibition hall (prestressed concrete purlin, prestressed concrete girder, reinforced concrete column, reinforced concrete footing, post-tensioned concrete girders). <b>The</b> <b>load</b> calculation (<b>the</b> self weight, <b>the</b> permanent <b>load,</b> <b>the</b> wind <b>load,</b> <b>the</b> snow <b>load</b> and imposed <b>load),</b> <b>the</b> design and the review of selected reinforced concrete items and the drawing documentation are included in this thesis...|$|R
50|$|Also, if, {{between two}} <b>loads,</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> is heavier, <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> must be {{examined}} in both <b>loading</b> orders (<b>the</b> larger <b>load</b> on <b>the</b> right and <b>the</b> larger <b>load</b> on <b>the</b> left) to ensure that <b>the</b> maximum <b>load</b> is found. If there are three or more <b>loads,</b> then <b>the</b> number of cases to be examined will increase.|$|R

5|$|A {{piece of}} {{slightly}} later date, the Dardanelles Gun (see picture), {{was cast in}} bronze and made in two parts: the chase and the breech, which, together, weighed 18.4tonnes. The two parts were screwed together using levers to facilitate the work. Created by Munir Ali in 1464, the Dardanelles Gun was still present for duty more than 300 years later in 1807, when a Royal Navy force appeared and commenced the Dardanelles Operation. Turkish forces <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> ancient relics with propellant and projectiles, then fired them at the British ships. The British squadron suffered 28 dead through this bombardment.|$|E
5|$|As a {{three-way}} loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two tweeters, two midrange drivers and two woofers. One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are {{mounted on the}} top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric <b>loaded,</b> <b>the</b> midrange is mounted in a terminated transmission line. Crossover points are set at 375Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3kHz between the tweeter and midrange. The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend {{time and money to}} build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven the evolution of the bulk carrier.|$|E
5000|$|This formula {{was derived}} in 1757, by the Swiss {{mathematician}} Leonhard Euler. The column will remain straight for <b>loads</b> less than <b>the</b> critical <b>load.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "critical load" [...] is <b>the</b> greatest <b>load</b> {{that will not}} cause lateral deflection (buckling). For <b>loads</b> greater than <b>the</b> critical <b>load,</b> <b>the</b> column will deflect laterally. <b>The</b> critical <b>load</b> puts <b>the</b> column {{in a state of}} unstable equilibrium. A <b>load</b> beyond <b>the</b> critical which causes the column to fail by buckling. As <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is increased beyond <b>the</b> critical <b>load</b> <b>the</b> lateral deflections increase, until it may fail in other modes such as yielding of <b>the</b> material. <b>Loading</b> of columns beyond <b>the</b> critical <b>load</b> are not addressed in this article.|$|R

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge <b>loaded,</b> <b>the</b> fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|In the PlayStation version, a mini-game of Galaxian can {{be played}} as the game loads. If won, eight {{additional}} cars become available. Once the game has <b>loaded,</b> <b>the</b> CD is needed only to play six music tracks. The disc can be replaced {{at any time during}} gameplay, although the game does not update; regardless of what disc is inserted, there will always be six tracks, corresponding to the starting points of the tracks on the game disc.|$|E
5|$|Loup {{took the}} {{loss in the}} Blue Jays' second game of the 2015 season. Entering with a 3–1 lead against the New York Yankees in the eighth inning, he <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bases without {{recording}} an out. All three runners would come in to score and Toronto would lose, 4–3. On April 12, Loup pitched 1 perfect innings against the Orioles, taking the win by a score of 10–7. Loup experienced ineffectiveness throughout the season, posting an ERA over 5.00 into August. Following a 3–1 win over the Yankees on August 16, Loup was optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. He was recalled on September 1.|$|E

5|$|Prior to May 18, Kehoe had <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> {{back seat}} of his truck with metal debris capable of {{producing}} shrapnel during an explosion. He also bought {{a new set of}} tires for his truck to avoid breaking down when transporting the explosives. He made many trips to Lansing for more explosives, {{as well as to the}} school, town, and his house. A neighbor allegedly saw Kehoe carrying objects into the school building at night numerous times but never thought to mention it to anyone.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. Before it could be <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
5|$|A {{proposed}} {{part of the}} regeneration is {{an extension}} of the London Underground to serve the area. Although the site is close to Battersea Park and Queenstown Road stations, it appears to be considered that trains from these stations to Victoria and Waterloo respectively are already heavily <b>loaded.</b> <b>The</b> proposed 2-mile tunnelled extension would branch from the Northern line at Kennington and travel west to Nine Elms and Battersea. The proposed extension would cost at least £500 million in 2008 terms before inflation and optimism bias (extra contingency amounts) and would be part funded by REO and, possibly, other significant land owners in the Nine Elms area. The 2010 planning consent for the site includes a phased contribution of approximately £200 million to the Underground extension, which adds another financial hurdle to the many difficulties in developing the site.|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of cracks in a structure can considerably affect its behaviour. This paper presents a finite element {{study on the}} vibration, buckling and dynamic stability behaviour of a cracked cylindrical shell with fixed supports and subject to an in plane compressive/tensile periodic edge <b>load.</b> <b>The</b> effects of crack length and orientation are analysed. Under tension <b>load,</b> <b>the</b> {{results show that the}} frequency of the shell initially increases with <b>the</b> <b>load,</b> but then decreases as <b>the</b> <b>load</b> further increases leading to buckling due to tension <b>load.</b> <b>The</b> size and the orientation of the crack and <b>the</b> <b>loading</b> parameter can all {{have a significant effect on}} the dynamic stability behaviour of the shell under both compressive and tensile <b>loading.</b> <b>The</b> effects of these parameters are discussed in detail...|$|R
50|$|In geology, a forebulge is a {{flexural}} {{bulge in}} front of a <b>load</b> on <b>the</b> lithosphere. <b>The</b> <b>load</b> causes <b>the</b> lithosphere to flex by depressing the plate beneath it. Because of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, the area around <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is uplifted by a height that is 4% of that of the depression under <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> <b>The</b> <b>load</b> and <b>the</b> resulting flexure place stress on the mantle, causing it to flow into the area around <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> area. <b>The</b> subsidence of the area under <b>the</b> <b>load</b> and <b>the</b> uplift of the forebulge continue until <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is in isostatic equilibrium, a process that takes on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 years. Because of the coupling with the mantle, the rate of forebulge formation and collapse is controlled by mantle viscosity.|$|R

5|$|After a 91-minute rain delay, the offenses {{fought back}} and forth, scoring run after run in an up-and-down affair in Philadelphia. Ryan Howard ended his home run drought, hitting his first round-tripper {{since the end}} of September. Chase Utley and Carlos Ruiz also hit home runs for the Phillies, while Carl Crawford and Dioner Navarro contributed a double each for the Rays. Philadelphia starter Jamie Moyer turned in his first strong {{performance}} of the post-season, allowing three runs over 6⅓ innings. His counterpart Matt Garza allowed four runs over six innings, but neither would factor in the decision. After the Rays tied the game {{in the top of the}} eighth, the Phillies <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> bases on two intentional walks with Eric Bruntlett on third base. Even with a five-man infield, Ruiz was still able to engineer some late-game heroics, sneaking a dribbling ground ball down the third base line to score Bruntlett. Philadelphia took a 21 series lead.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} court that, during his visit on 6 August, hours before the murders, he had <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> rifle, {{thinking}} he had heard rabbits outside, but hadn't used it. He had then left it on the kitchen table, with a full magazine {{and a box of}} ammunition, before leaving the house. When he left it in the kitchen, it did not have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he said; they had been on the rifle in late July according to a nephew, but Bamber said his father must have removed them in the meantime. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E

5|$|Brooklyn went hitless in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis hitless. With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases <b>loaded.</b> <b>The</b> Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E

The ship was assigned as the flagship of Group 2, along with the destroyers Paul Jakobi, Theodor Riedel, Friedrich Eckoldt, and Bruno Heinemann. KzS Heye was given command of Group 2 during the operation. The five ships carried a total of 1,700 Wehrmacht mountain troops, whose objective was the port of Trondheim; the ships <b>loaded</b> <b>the</b> troops in Cuxhaven. The ships steamed to the Schillig roadstead outside Wilhelmshaven, where they joined Group 1, consisting of ten destroyers, and the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which were assigned to cover Groups 1 and 2. The ships steamed out of the roadstead at midnight on the night of 6–7 April.|$|E
