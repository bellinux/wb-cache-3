50|$|The {{nature of}} {{particle}} counting {{is based upon}} either <b>light</b> <b>scattering,</b> <b>light</b> obscuration, or direct imaging. A high intensity light source is used to illuminate the particle as it passes through the detection chamber. The particle passes through the light source (typically a laser or halogen light) and if <b>light</b> <b>scattering</b> is used, then the redirected light is detected by a photo detector. If direct imaging is used, a halogen light illuminates particles from the back within a cell while a high definition, high magnification camera records passing particles. Recorded video is then analyzed by computer software to measure particle attributes. If light blocking (obscuration) is used the loss of light is detected. The amplitude of the <b>light</b> <b>scattered</b> or <b>light</b> blocked is measured and the particle is counted and tabulated into standardized counting bins.

But its results for particles of complex shape remain to be validated. The surface integral equation (SIE) with parallel multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) is a rigorous numerical method so it permits us to obtain accurate results of particles of any shape. With new improvement we have made, our parallelized code of MLFMA allows us to calculate the scattering of non-spherical dielectric particles of size much larger than the incident wavelength. This paper is devoted to the validation of the VCRM by comparison of the <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> with the MLFMA results. The <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> of large ellipsoidal particles with different size parameters and aspect ratios are computed by using the two methods. Good agreements between them prove the ability of both MLFMA and VCRM for large non-spherical particles. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

First, we examine a finite-order higher-derivative scalar field theory and find that we cannot eliminate the external momentum divergences of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the regime of large external momenta. Then, we employ an infinite-derivative scalar toy model and obtain that the external momentum dependence of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> is convergent as the external momenta become very large. In order to eliminate the external momentum divergences, one has to dress the bare vertices of the <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> by considering renormalised propagator and vertex loop corrections to the bare vertices. Finally, we investigate <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{in the context of a}} scalar toy model which is inspired by a ghost-free and singularity-free infinite-derivative theory of gravity, where we conclude that infinite derivatives can eliminate the external momentum divergences of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> and make the <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> convergent in the ultraviolet.

40|$|<b>Scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{arose in}} the context of mirror symmetry, but a special class of <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> (the cluster <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams)</b> were {{recently}} developed to prove key structural results on cluster algebras. This paper studies <b>scattering</b> <b>diagrams</b> from a combinatorial and discrete-geometric point of view. We show that a consistent <b>scattering</b> <b>diagram</b> with minimal support cuts the ambient space into a complete fan. We give a simple derivation of the function attached to the limiting wall of a rank- 2 cluster <b>scattering</b> <b>diagram</b> of affine type. In the skew-symmetric rank- 2 affine case, this recovers a formula due to Reineke. In the same case, we point out that the generating function for signed Narayana numbers appears in a role analogous to a cluster variable. In acyclic finite type, cluster scattering fans are known to coincide with Cambrian fans because both coincide with the g-vector fan.

In a planetary-scale field, the qP(P) <b>scatter</b> <b>diagram</b> of an NAO event exhibits a linear multivalued functional relationship in a narrow region for the negative phase, but exhibits a linear singlevalued functional relationship during the positive phase. It was also found that there is no steepening of the slope of the main straight line in the qP(P) <b>scatter</b> <b>diagrams</b> for two phases of the NAO event. Instead, the slope of the straight line in the scatterplots is time independent throughout the life cycle of the NAO event. However, when synoptic-scale eddies are included in the streamfunction field, the qT(T) <b>scatter</b> <b>diagram</b> of the negative-phase NAO event shows a trend toward steepening during the intensification phase, and this tendency reverses during the decay phase. During the positive NAO phase the slope of the qt(T) <b>scatter</b> <b>diagram</b> shoals during the intensification phase and then steepens during the decay phase. Thus, it appears that the steepening and shoaling of the <b>scatter</b> <b>diagrams</b> of the streamfunction versus PV for the negative and positive-phase NAO events are attributed to the effect of synoptic-scale eddies that force NAO events to form.

50|$|Dynamic <b>light</b> <b>scattering</b> {{provides}} {{insight into}} the dynamic properties of soft materials by measuring single scattering events, meaning that each detected photon has been scattered by the sample exactly once. However, the application to many systems of scientific and industrial relevance has been limited due to often-encountered multiple scattering, wherein photons are scattered multiple times by the sample before being detected. Accurate interpretation becomes exceedingly difficult for systems with nonnegligible contributions from multiple scattering. Especially for larger particles and those with high refractive index contrast, this limits the technique to very low particle concentrations, and a large variety of systems are, therefore, excluded from investigations with dynamic <b>light</b> <b>scattering.</b> However, as shown by Schaetzel, {{it is possible to}} suppress multiple <b>scattering</b> in dynamic <b>light</b> <b>scattering</b> experiments via a cross-correlation approach.
