5000|$|Tangra is {{a region}} in east Kolkata that {{traditionally}} housed {{a large number}} of tanneries owned by people of Hakka Chinese origin. [...] "47 South Tangra Road", may be the most confusing postal address, as it used to cover the whole of Chinatown Tangra with over 350 tanneries. Most of the standing structures have been built, over many years, by the industrious Hakka Chinese, upon marshy and reclaimed low-lying land. Over the past several decades, it has served as the location of Calcutta's Chinatown. This is not a coincidence; the Hakka Chinese of Calcutta have gradually turned this part of the Kolkata into an important destination for sourcing finished and semi-finished leather. The Hakka Chinese specialized in the manufacture of leather and turned it into one of the major industries of West Bengal, providing employment {{to tens of thousands of}} local inhabitants. In addition to the huge volume of exports to the developing and developed countries, finished leather is supplied to the major shoe and <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> <b>manufacturers</b> all over the country.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for consumer goods ecolabelling, coming from consumers concern for adverse environmental impacts of industrial pollution and manufacturers need to protect their existing markets and to expand into new ones. Ecolabels are used to guarantee the purchaser a product meets certain minimum standards relating to its environmental impact during production, use or disposal, and to distinguish the product from competitors in a positive way. In order to be awarded an ecolabel, a product must be certified according {{to a set of}} requirements or criteria, with regard to environmental, health and quality aspects. Leather industry and leather products trade hold a significant share of the worldwide economy and leather sector is vital for the economies of many developing countries. Though, leather processing is recognized as a highly polluting activity. Principles and practice of pollution control and prevention in tanning industry are well-known, and ecolabelling appears as an advanced tool to address the sector environmental issues. The emergence of ecolabels in the leather sector proves the commitment of tanneries and <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> <b>manufacturers</b> for increasing their environmental performance and the consumers move towards more green purchasing patterns. It is the aim of this paper to shortly present the main ecolabels in use on the market of leather and leather products, the key parameters that define an eco-friendly leather, and the benefits and disadvantages of ecolabelling in the leather sector...|$|R
40|$|The Government of Bangladesh has {{identified}} the leather sector as one with considerable growth and investment potential ranked {{fifth in the}} export earning sector. Currently Bangladesh produces and exports quality bovine and ovine, caprine (buffalo and cow; sheep and goat) leathers that have a good international reputation for fine textured skins. However, the entire leather sector meets only 0. 5 % of the world’s leather trade worth US$ 75 billion. There are about 113 tanneries in Bangladesh that produce 180 {{million square feet of}} hides and skins per year. In addition there are about 30 modern shoe manufacturing plants engaged in the production of high-quality footwear, with over 2500 smaller footwear manufacturers also present in the sector. There are around 100 small-to-medium <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> and a small number of niche larger manufacturers. The sector directly employs approximately 558 000 people. Most of the tanneries do not have proper effluent plants and generate 20 000 m 3 tannery effluent and 232 tonnes solid waste per day. Tannery liquid and solid wastes are a potential pollutant but also have a potential value. Specific technologies to convert wastes are required. These vary from crude and simple to highly sophisticated and complex. A proposed new leather park is expected to bring a clear transformation to the leather industry with a marked increase in production, product diversification and new product lines with increased sustainability of the sector. Sustainable and cleaner production will be a key issue for the development without placing burdens on the environment...|$|R
40|$|Leather {{industry}} in Sri Lanka {{is an industry}} belonging to the small and medium sector with a good potential for future development. In fact, the industry of manufacturing leather and leather products is very labor intensive and can provide employment to the country. In addition, {{it is capable of}} contributing to the growth in Gross Domestic Production. Leather Industry in Sri Lanka first became commercialized {{at the time of the}} Second World War, with the objective of supplying the <b>Leather</b> <b>goods</b> for the Armed Services. Initially the government owned the operation and later in the 1960 's, the private sector entered into the industry. At present, there are 14 private tanneries located in the Colombo and Gampaha Districts. Two of them are doing only the vegetable tanning while the others are doing bothvegetable and chrome tanning. Most of the tanneries fall within the small-scale sector processing up to three tons of raw materials whereby one or two tanneries may be considered as medium-scale where about six tons of raw materials are processed per day. The products of tanneries are both semi finished or finished Leather and they are either exported or sold to the domestic <b>Leather</b> <b>goods</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Today, the <b>Leather</b> industry is facing two major threats: Inability to comply with the Central Environmental Authority's standards for tannery effluents discharge and the increasing market rivalry on price and quality in the export market. The opinion of the Leather industry specialists is that the technology used in the local tanneries is out dated and they have not invested in the technology upgrade during the last decade because of the risk of closing the industry due to the environmental issue. However the industry cannot survive in the export market with the same old products and it essentially needs product and quality improvement. The <b>Leather</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturing industry, which is very intensive for skilled labour, has the potential to absorb the unemployed youth most probably generated through the quota removal of the garment {{industry in}} 2005. However to develop the <b>Leather</b> <b>goods</b> manufacturing industry, it is a must to develop the tanning sector in the country as the imported Leather is very expensive and not cost effective to be used for the manufacturing of <b>Leather</b> <b>goods.</b> In this research, an attempt has been made to study the present structure of the Leather industry in Sri Lanka, i. e. the tanning sector, with special emphasis on the present technology and the accumulated technological capability. The embodied form perspective of technology many technology components and technological capabilities that are not satisfactory. Especially, the training and skill development, production management systems and organizational practices, accumulation knowledge and information availability need improvement. Considering the technological capability, the operative capability and the adaptive capability were poor compared to the acquisitive capability. Though the technology can be either purchased or transferred, the technological cap ability needs to essentially be accumulated in the industry itself. The presence of a satisfactory level of technology will probably be supportive for the accumulation of technological cap abilities in the industry and vice versa is also true. The findings of the study were summarized and the recommendations are suggested for the development of the leather industry in Sri Lanka. As a value addition to the study, the recommendations were prioritized by assessing them on the need of capital, need of time for the completion, level of strategic effect, sustainability and the feasibility for realization. After the prioritization it had been found that the commissioning of the Bata- atha project comes asthe most needed immediate implementation. Then the need of systematic training and skill development program me, export marketing development program me, Techno ware(machinery and other production related equipment) development program me, establishment of a testing laboratory, academic recognition through a certification program me, establishment of a coordination mechanism between the relevant public organizations and the tanneries and the program me on raw hide quality improvement are needed to be implemented in the above mentioned order. The implementation of the policy recommendations in the suggested order will result in successful implementation with a considerable strategic impact to the industry. Also the above mentioned prioritized recommendations. are useful as a guideline in preparation of the leather industry development plan by the government...|$|R

5000|$|In 1906 James B. Kirby {{developed}} his {{first of many}} vacuums called the [...] "Domestic Cyclone". It used water for dirt separation. Later revisions {{came to be known}} as the Kirby Vacuum Cleaner. In 1907 department store janitor James Murray Spangler (1848-1915) of Canton, Ohio invented the first portable electric vacuum cleaner, obtaining a patent for the Electric Suction Sweeper on June 2, 1908. Crucially, in addition to suction from an electric fan that blew the dirt and dust into a soap box and one of his wife's pillow cases, Spangler's design utilized a rotating brush to loosen debris. Unable to produce the design himself due to lack of funding, he sold the patent in 1908 to local <b>leather</b> <b>goods</b> <b>manufacturer</b> William Henry Hoover (1849-1932), who had Spangler's machine redesigned with a steel casing, casters, and attachments, founding the company that in 1922 was renamed the Hoover Company. Their first vacuum was the 1908 Model O, which sold for $60. Subsequent innovations included the beater bar in 1919 ("It beats as it sweeps as it cleans"), disposal filter bags in the 1920s, and an upright vacuum cleaner in 1926.|$|E
