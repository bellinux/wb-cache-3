5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 1990s, after the {{completion}} of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> and those that did being critically unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, Carpenter, with Captain Nolan {{as second}} in command, and three {{companies}} of troopers {{headed out to}} Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches. In the early <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant, crawling onto the plain. Victorio sent a band of warriors riding {{out of the mountains}} and attacked savagely. The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons. The warriors were met with rifle fire, as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions. Alerted by his Indian scouts, Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue. The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains. Nolan's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them.|$|E
5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from U.S. officials, Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to U.S. officials, had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E

25|$|Not completed. Only a march {{sequence}} {{from this}} opera saw the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day,</b> {{as the second}} movement of his Symphony No. 2 in C minor {{and a few other}} segments are occasionally heard as concert pieces. Interestingly, while Tchaikovsky revised the Second symphony twice in his lifetime, he did not alter the second movement (taken from the Undina material) during either revision. The rest of the score of Undina was destroyed by the composer.|$|E
25|$|Boullée's ideas {{had a major}} {{influence}} on his contemporaries, not least because of his role in teaching other important architects such as Jean Chalgrin, Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart, and Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand. Some of his work only saw the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> in the 20th century; his book Architecture, essai sur l'art ("Essay on the Art of Architecture), arguing for an emotionally committed Neoclassicism, was only published in 1953. The volume contained his work from 1778 to 1788, which mostly comprised designs for public buildings on a wholly impractical grand scale.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2007 the band went on the Bad Boys of Rock tour, {{supporting}} Hinder.

25|$|The band entered Academy Music Studio in June 1994 and {{recorded}} their debut album, A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria, {{in just two}} weeks. Due to label problems, the album was shelved for nearly a year, finally seeing the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> in 1995. The album showcased more traditional black metal/death metal ideas versus the more epic and sprawling arrangements the group would utilize in later works. The vocal style of Byron Roberts is also different from later efforts, using more traditional death metal and black metal grunts, {{as well as the}} spoken narrative passages which would become more prevalent on subsequent albums.|$|E
25|$|One {{version that}} did see the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> was the Metro 25, which {{featured}} an increased passenger capacity of 25 {{at the expense}} of the baggage space found in earlier models; the deletion of the left rear cargo door, the addition of a passenger door on the right-hand rear fuselage, and a belly pod for baggage. A Metro III was converted as a Metro 25 demonstrator, it flew in this configuration in October 1989. Also mooted but not built was the Metro 25J, which would have been another jet-powered aircraft with TFE731s in over-wing pods.|$|E
25|$|Around 1770 Antoine Dauvergne {{planned to}} set La Bruère's {{libretto}} {{in collaboration with}} Jean-Claude Trial and Pierre Montan Berton. All three composers were admirers of Rameau. Berton wrote {{the majority of the}} score. Linus was scheduled to be part of celebrations at Versailles but it was cancelled. It was rescheduled for the following year and went into rehearsal on 4 April 1771 but was never staged because of problems with the fifth act and was replaced by Monsigny's Aline, reine de Golconde. In the 1790s Berton's son Henri Montan Berton made another attempt at setting the libretto but this version never saw the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
