50|$|According to Thompson {{the primary}} {{morphological}} {{distinction between the}} triploid and the North American forms of the diploid is made {{by the number of}} prominent leaf veins, the diploid having a single prominent midvein and {{on both sides of this}} equally raised secondary veins, the triploid having a single prominent midvein with the secondary veins barely distinct. Thompson notes a number of other details which she claims can be used to tell the different forms apart in North America, such as flower <b>length,</b> <b>average</b> maximum leaf length, relative length of the sympodial leaf with respect to the vegetative leaves, the average length of the spadix during flowering, and tendency of the leaf margin to undulate in the triploid. She notes that many of these characteristics overlap, but that in general the triploid is somewhat larger and more robust on average than most North American forms of the diploid. According to Heng Li, Guanghua Zhu and Josef Bogner in the Flora of China there is clear overlap in these characteristics and the different cytotypes are impossible to distinguish morphologically.|$|E
50|$|Bell miners are the {{smallest}} of their genus and differ from the other three predominantly grey miner species in having olive-green plumage, darker on the wings and yellower on the belly.They are a medium bodied honeyeater, slightly smaller and stockier than a Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), weighing in between 25-35g(average 29g).Bell miners are 17.5-20 cm in <b>length</b> (<b>average</b> 18.5) with a 22-30 cm wingspan (average 26.5).They have the characteristic yellow miner bill, which is slightly downturned. The legs are bright orange, and the bare patch behind the eye is red-orange.The crown and lores are black while the feathers {{in front of the}} eye are yellow. A dark streak runs from the corner of the bill downwardgiving a slight frowning appearance. Eyes are brown and mouth is yellow.Both sexes look alike though the males tend to be slightly larger.It is possible to determine the sex of the birds by analyzing wing length, tail length, and culmen depth or by observing calls that are unique to females, but there is no easy way to reliably determine the sex in the field without careful observation of behavior and calls.Juveniles are more brown colored than adults and overall less bright in color. Young birds do not have the bare skin patch behind the eye. The patch initially develops as pale grey and then transforms to pale yellow and darkens to pale orange before taking on the adult bright red-orange color as the bird matures.Nestlings are born naked and develop light brown down about two days post hatch.|$|E
5000|$|Estonia {{lies in the}} {{northern}} part of the temperate climate zone and in the transition zone between maritime and continental climate. Because Estonia (and all of Northern Europe) is continuously warmed by maritime air influenced by the heat content of {{the northern}} Atlantic Ocean, it has a milder climate despite its northern latitude. The Baltic Sea causes differences between the climate of coastal and inland areas.

[...] The average annual temperature in Estonia is [...] The average temperature in February, the coldest month of the year, is [...] The average temperature in July, which is considered the warmest month of the year, is [...] The climate is also influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, the North-Atlantic Stream and the Icelandic Minimum, which is an area known for the formation of cyclones and where the average air pressure is lower than in neighbouring areas. Estonia is located in a humid zone in which the amount of precipitation is greater than total evaporation. The average precipitation in 1961-1990 ranged from 535 to 727 mm per year and was heaviest in late summer. There were between 102 and 127 rainy days a year, and average precipitation was most plentiful on the western slopes of the Sakala and Haanja Uplands. Snow cover, which is deepest in the south-eastern part of Estonia, usually lasts from mid-December to late March.|$|E
