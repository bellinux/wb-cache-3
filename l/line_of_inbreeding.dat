40|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> inbred <b>lines</b> {{for potential}} use as parent seed stocks for stable, high-performance hybrids {{is the major}} objective of maize (Zea mays L.) breeding programs. Inbreeding in maize {{is accompanied by a}} reduction in the mean phenotypic value for most traits. This genetic phenomenon is known as inbreeding depression;No empirical evidence was available to determine whether newer greater yielding maize inbred lines are less affected by inbreeding depression than older inbred <b>lines.</b> Two groups <b>of</b> maize inbred <b>lines</b> were used in this study. One group included six inbred lines released before the 1960 s (B 14 A, B 37, L 289, L 317, M 14, and WF 9). The other group included six lines released after the 1970 s (B 73, B 75, B 76, B 77, B 79, and B 84). Nineteen generations within each of the inbred groups representing nine levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> (from 0 % to 100 % homozygosity at 12. 5 % intervals) were evaluated at five Iowa environments in 1988 and 1989 to determine if the <b>inbreeding</b> depression rate <b>of</b> new <b>lines</b> had changed for 15 plant and ear traits;The rate <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression remained unchanged for the older and newer groups <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> for nine <b>of</b> the 15 traits, but rate <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression was less for tassel-branch number, ear-leaf width, number of ears per plot, ear length, ear diameter, and cob diameter in the newer group <b>of</b> <b>lines.</b> The effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> in the two groups <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> studied were a reduction in the mean for all traits except days-to-anthesis and dropped ears. The reduction in the mean with inbreeding was negatively and linearly correlated with the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> for all traits except days-to-anthesis which was positively and linearly correlated with the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding.</b> Percentage <b>of</b> dropped ears was unchanged with inbreeding. The additive genetic model explained the majority of the variation among the inbreeding level means. The reduced rate <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression in the group <b>of</b> newer <b>lines</b> for six <b>of</b> 15 traits evaluated suggest that this group is either segregating at fewer loci than the group <b>of</b> older <b>lines</b> or the favorable allele frequency has increased beyond 0. 5...|$|R

Inbreeding depression refers to the reduction of fitness that results from matings between relatives. Evidence for reduced fitness in inbred individuals is widespread, but the strength <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression varies widely both within and among taxa. Environmental conditions can mediate this variation in the strength <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression, with environmental stress exacerbating the negative consequences <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding.</b> Parents can modify the environment experienced by offspring, and have thus the potential to mitigate the negative consequences <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding.</b> While such parental effects have recently been demonstrated during the postnatal period, the role of prenatal parental effects in influencing the expression <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression remains unexplored. To address this gap, we performed matings between full-sibs or unrelated individuals in replicated <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) experimentally selected for high and low maternal egg provisioning. We show that in the low maternal investment lines hatching success was strongly reduced when parents were related. In the high maternal investment lines, however, this negative effect <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> on hatching success was absent, demonstrating that prenatal maternal provisioning can alleviate the negative fitness consequences <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding.</b> The study was financially supported by Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (PP 00 P 3 _ 128386 and PP 00 P 3 _ 157455 to B.

40|$|A {{mating system}} {{to reduce the}} <b>inbreeding</b> <b>of</b> {{commercial}} females in the lower level was examined theoretically, assuming a hierarchical breed structure, in which favorable genes are accumulated in the upper level by artificial selection and the achieved genetic progress is transferred to the lower level through migration of males. The mating system examined was rotational mating with several closed sire lines in the upper level. Using the group coancestry theory, we derived recurrence equations for the <b>inbreeding</b> coefficient <b>of</b> the commercial females. The asymptotic inbreeding coefficient was also derived. Numerical computations showed that the critical factor for determining the inbreeding is the number <b>of</b> sire <b>lines,</b> and that the size <b>of</b> each sire <b>line</b> has a marginal effect. If four or five sire lines were available, rotational mating {{was found to be}} quite an effective system to reduce the short- and long-term <b>inbreeding</b> <b>of</b> the commercial females, irrespective of the effective size <b>of</b> each sire <b>line.</b> Oscillation <b>of</b> the <b>inbreeding</b> coefficient under rotational mating with initially related sire lines could be minimized by avoiding the consecutive use <b>of</b> highly related <b>lines.</b> Extensions and perspectives of the system are discussed in relation to practical application...|$|R

40|$|Inbreeding {{is common}} in plants and can have {{considerable}} effects on population viability, because <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression. Understanding what determines the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression is <b>of</b> fundamental importance for conservation biology. We used meta-analysis of 116 studies and 107 plant species to investigate the effects of population size, test environment, life history characteristics and stage on the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression in 13 different fitness traits. We found that inbreeding depression levels significantly increase with population size. This may be a consequence of either, or both, a higher baseline of the level <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> or increased impact of purging in small populations; unfortunately the available data did not allow distinguishing between these potential explanations. In general, inbreeding depression {{was found to be}} common across species and environments, and was significant in all traits examined. Yet, the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression was significantly influenced by plant longevity and life-history stage, and varied depending on how plant fitness was measured.

This clearly has important implications for conservation biology. Moreover, our findings on the overall generality <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression confirm that inbreeding depression {{is one of the key}} factors reducing plant population fitness and viability.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel theory for the {{evolution}} of polyandry driven by genetic benefits to females whose offspring interbreed. In species with an ecology characterized by frequent colonization of new habitat patches, consanguineous matings may be common during the early stages of colonization, but genetic diversity may grow as new colonizers arrive. We show that with levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression similar to those found in predominantly inbreeding populations, a polyandrous female can benefit her descendants since matings among her brood are mainly between half siblings rather than full siblings. We examine the invasion by a polyandrous phenotype using explicit genetic models in which costs <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> are themselves subject to selection. In common with other models <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding,</b> we find that underlying high levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> tend to purge deleterious recessive alleles, and hence these are unlikely to maintain sufficient inbreeding depression to favour polyandry. However, if costs <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> are due to overdominance, biologically realistic levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression result in genetic benefits large enough to favour polyandry provided it is not too costly. The potential significance of polyandry as a mechanism to reduce inbreeding in grandchildren will depend upon the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression in natural, inbreeding populations...|$|R

Then it describes ways, in which inbreeding impacts population allele frequency and other effects influencing populations (e. g. Bottle-neck Effect, Founder Effect or Genetic Drift). Inbreeding is undesireable in nature, because it leads to inbreeding depression. That manifests itself by decreasing individuals fitness, which then has a substantial impact on populations dynamics. Main part of the thesis is then focused on wild populations of birds and mammals. The degree <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> is most commonly assessed by pedigree analysis. That is a highly demanding method, as it requires a longterm population observation in the field and, in many cases, also tissue collection for genetic analysis. The last step is represented by thorough statistical analysis, allowing to determine kinship in population as precisely as possible. Based on pedigree, we can calculate coefficient <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> 'F', which then allows us {{to determine the extent}} <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression.

We examined the influence of these proximate factors on precopulatory inbreeding avoidance in a laboratory-adapted, outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster.

MethodsSeveral levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> were created in coastal Douglas-fir, using a nine-clone founder population to produce 148 families with varying levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> ranging from f[*]=[*] 0 (outcrossed) to f[*]=[*] 0. 5 (selfed). The trees were planted in 1987 on two farm-field sites in coastal BC. Here, we report effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> in height, diameter, tree volume, survival, and wood density in 26 -year-old trees. ResultsPrevious results obtained from this test population showed negative near linear effects with levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> in seed production, nursery growth performance, and growth traits in the field assessed at age 10. At age 26, inbreeding depression was highest in survival, ranging from 20 to 80  % for f[*]=[*] 0. 125 and f[*]=[*] 0. 5, respectively. In contrast, the most severe inbreeding depression among the three levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> was only 4  % for wood density at f[*]=[*] 0. 5 (selfing). Inbreeding depression in height, diameter at breast height (dbh), and volume increased linearly from f[*]=[*] 0 to f[*]=[*] 0. 25, then leveled off. ConclusionFounder genotypes had varied responses to inbreeding as parental breeding values across inbreeding levels were inconsistent (in magnitude, sign, and trait). No differences in levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression were found between full-sib matings and parent-offspring matings. These findings have implications for the testing of parents within sublines, where inbreeding is accumulated in sublines. However, since parents respond differently to levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding,</b> their performance may not be well correlated to their quality as outcrossing parents...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: Biparental inbreeding, mating {{between two}} relatives, occurs {{at a low}} {{frequency}} in many natural plant populations, which also often have substantial rates of self-fertilization. Although biparental inbreeding is likely to influence the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression {{and the evolution of}} selfing rates, it has received limited theoretical attention in comparison to selfing. The only previous model suggested that biparental inbreeding can favour the maintenance of stable intermediate selfing rates, but made unrealistic assumptions about the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression. Here we extend a genetic model <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression, describing nearly recessive lethal mutations at {{a very large number of}} loci, to incorporate sib-mating. We also include a constant component <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression modelling the effects of mildly deleterious, nearly additive alleles. We analyze how observed rates of sib-mating influence the mean number of heterozygous lethals alleles and inbreeding depression in a population reproducing by a mixture of self-fertilization, sib-mating and outcrossing. We finally use the ensuing relationship between equilibrium inbreeding depression and population selfing rate to infer the evolutionarily stable selfing rates expected under such a mixed mating system. Results: We show that for a given rate <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding,</b> sib-mating is more efficient at purging inbreeding depression than selfing, because homozygosity of lethals increases more gradually through sib-mating than through selfing. Because sib-mating promotes the purging <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression and the evolution of selfing, our genetic model <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression also predicts that sib-mating is unlikely to maintain stable intermediate selfing rates. Conclusions: Our results imply that even low rates of sib-mating affect plant mating system evolution, by facilitating the evolution of selfing via more efficient purging <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression. Alternative mechanisms, such as pollination ecology, are necessary to explain stable mixed selfing and outcrossing...|$|R
40|$|Cooperative breeders {{provide a}} {{particularly}} interesting scenario for studying inbreeding. Such populations are viscous due to delayed dispersal and short dispersal distances, {{resulting in the}} build-up of relatives in the local population. This leads to a high risk <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding,</b> and consequently <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression. This has driven the evolution of an array <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance mechanisms resulting in a relatively low level <b>of</b> close <b>inbreeding</b> {{in the majority of}} cooperative breeders. However, there are a number <b>of</b> species where <b>inbreeding</b> occurs relatively frequently. The presence <b>of</b> regular <b>inbreeding</b> (in cases where inbreeding is not a result of recent population declines), suggests that inbreeding tolerance and even preference can evolve under some circumstances. Both inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance mechanisms have enormous downstream fitness consequences for cooperative breeding species. For example, they can influence reproductive dynamics leading to a monopolisation of breeding opportunities by dominant individuals. Inbreeding and its avoidance are also likely to impact on the evolution of cooperative breeding itself through influencing levels of relatedness between potential cooperators. Finally, in some cooperative breeders, a high degree <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance can be detrimental to population viability, and hence is of particular concern to conservationists. In this review, I discuss these issues in detail and also briefly consider recent advances in the methods available for the study <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> in natural populations...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{population has been}} improved by recurrent selection for germination salt tolerance. However, recurrent selection may lead to increased inbreeding. Since alfalfa is subject to severe <b>inbreeding</b> depression, accumulation <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> during the selection process may negatively affect performance. This experiment was designed {{to determine the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> on germination performance in alfalfa under saline and non-saline conditions. The germination {{performance of}} seed having three different levels <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> as examined. No adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> were observed in non-saline conditions. Consistent (but nonsignificant) declining trends were observed in germination percentage in saline conditions as the level <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> increased. Proportionately larger declines were observed between generations in germination speed and early seedling vigor. These results suggest heterozygosity in alfalfa may be maintained simultaneously while recurrent selection for germination salt tolerance is conducted. Moreover, reducing inbreeding during recurrent selection for germination salt tolerance may be more successful if germination speed index or early seeding vigor are used for the measurement...|$|R
40|$|The costs <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> depression, {{as well as}} the {{opportunity}} costs <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance, determine whether and which mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance evolve. In African ele-phants, sex-biased dispersal does not lead to the complete separation of male and female relatives, and so individuals may experience selection to recognize kin and avoid inbreed-ing. However, because estrous females are rare and male-male competition for mates is intense, {{the opportunity}} costs <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance may be high, particularly for males. Here we combine 28 years of behavioural and demographic data on wild elephants with genotypes from 545 adult females, adult males, and calves in Amboseli National Park, Kenya, to test the hypothesis that elephants engage in sexual behaviour and reproduction with relatives less often than expected by chance. We found support for this hypothesis: males engaged in proportionally fewer sexual behaviours and sired proportionally fewer offspring with females that were natal family members or close genetic relatives (both maternal and paternal) than they did with nonkin. We discuss the relevance of these results for understanding the evolution <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> avoidance and for elephant conservation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLittle {{is known}} about the effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> on {{reproduction}} in modern human societies. It appears indeed that biological effects are hidden by socioeconomic factors, which are the major determinants of fertility. It has been established, in particular, that socially induced reproductive compensation tends to homogenize the number of offspring per family in a given population. Besides, in the field of evolutionary biology, a number of empirical and theoretical {{studies have shown that the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> are condition dependent. In particular, theoretical developments on the evolution of senescence predict that the deleterious effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> should increase with age. We rely on these developments to examine the effects <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> on fertility in a cohort of Canadian women born in the late 19 th century. The analysis does not allow for the detection of any effect <b>of</b> <b>inbreeding</b> on the overall number of offspring of women. However, results indicate that high levels <b>of</b> close father <b>inbreeding</b> are associated with a reduction of the productivity of parents during the second half of their reproductive period, as compared with the first half. We suggest that inbreeding depression affects reproduction in modern societies through an interaction with age...|$|R
