Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the <b>Luxor</b> Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, walking up the side of <b>Luxor</b> Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying on a bed of broken glass.|$|E

5|$|As had {{occurred}} with Bilheimer's previous film, A Closer Walk, Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) hosted a preview screening at the Willard InterContinental Washington in September 2009 {{as part of}} a day-long symposium on human trafficking. A preview screening in Egypt, including the material shot in that country that was later removed, took place in December 2010 at the International Forum against Human Trafficking in <b>Luxor.</b>|$|E

The film was nominated for three Academy Awards amid many other nominations and novelised in 1977 by Christopher Wood as James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Brown {{served as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member of George Washington University until her death in 1976. In 1972, Brown travelled again, this time to African cities which include Gao, Cairo, Segou, Marrakesh, Timbuktu, Fez, Ibandan, Benin, Axum, Kumasi and <b>Luxor.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1922, Boyce {{departed}} {{on another}} expedition to Africa, {{this time for}} six months. Morocco {{reminded him of the}} Dakotas, Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Arizona. In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun, which had been discovered just a few months earlier. His expedition then went to <b>Luxor</b> and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu, where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed {{for the first time in}} decades. Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa, he had shot at least one of every game animal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Luxor’s</b> {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the games Marble Lines, Puzz Loop, and Zuma, in that it challenges the user to eliminate colored magical spheres by causing three or more spheres of the same color to collide. When spheres are eliminated, nearby spheres which now form a segment of three or more of the same color will also explode in a chain reaction.|$|R
2500|$|The last king {{to build}} royal pyramids was Ahmose, with later kings hiding their tombs in the hills, {{such as those}} in the Valley of the Kings in <b>Luxor's</b> West Bank. In Medinat Habu, or Deir el-Medina, smaller pyramids were built by individuals. [...] Smaller pyramids were also built by the Nubians who ruled Egypt in the Late Period, though their pyramids had steeper sides.|$|R
50|$|Tomb KV1, {{located in}} the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, {{was used for the}} burial of Pharaoh Ramesses VII of the Twentieth Dynasty. Although it has been open since antiquity, it was only {{properly}} investigated and cleared by Edwin Brock in 1984 and 1985. The single corridor tomb itself is located in <b>Luxor's</b> West Bank, and is small in comparison to other tombs of the twentieth dynasty.|$|R
5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction began {{principal}} {{photography in}} Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico in May, 2006 after filming locations {{had to be}} changed from the Australian Outback to Mexico, causing production dates to be pushed back repeatedly from November 2005 to May 2006. Numerous sets were designed by production designer Eugenio Caballero including Umbrella's underground laboratory, the Las Vegas Strip, the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Realto Ponte, <b>Luxor</b> Hotel and the replica of the Spencer Mansion. The film entered post-production in late July 2006 with details about production being kept secret and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom both worked on the 2006 film Silent Hill.|$|E

5|$|Molwyn Joseph is an Antiguan {{politician}} and Chairman of the Antigua Labour Party (ALP). First entering politics in 1984 {{when he was}} made a Minister without Portfolio {{in the government of}} Vere Bird, Joseph became Minister of Finance seven years later, renegotiating the Antiguan national debt and introducing fiscal reforms. After a 1996 scandal in which it was discovered he had used his position to import a 1930s Rolls Royce for a friend, bypassing normal import duties and taxes, he was dismissed from the Bird administration, returning 14 months later to serve as Minister for Planning, Implementation and the Environment. Following the 1999 general election he became Minister of Heath and Social Improvement before being made Minister of Tourism and the Environment a few months later. As Minister, Joseph attempted to improve the perception of Antigua as a tourist destination and invest in the industry, spending 2 million US dollars increasing the number of hotel rooms on the island and providing money for both Air Jamaica and Air <b>Luxor</b> to provide flights to the island.|$|E
50|$|Angel {{claimed to}} have been {{developing}} aspects of the show for over 15 years. He originally tried to develop the show for a Broadway run, as well as other casinos, but nothing came to fruition. Eventually, Believe came together when he entered a partnership with Cirque du Soleil and the <b>Luxors</b> parent company, MGM Mirage Resorts, which financed the show with $100 million. The partnership marked the first time Cirque built a show around an individual performer.|$|R
50|$|He began {{teaching}} at the College of Fine Arts in 1930 and designed his first adobe buildings in the late 1930s. Fathy gained international critical acclaim for {{his involvement in the}} construction of Kurna, located on <b>Luxor's</b> West Bank, built to resettle the tomb robbers that operated in the Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens. This project was applauded in a popular British weekly in 1947 and soon after in a British professional journal; further articles were published in Spanish, French and in Dutch.|$|R
5000|$|The game's {{publisher}} Beyond Software {{offered a}} prize—models {{of the major}} characters in an Icemark setting—to the first player who revealed the [...] "Watchwords of Midnight", an inscription on <b>Luxor's</b> Moon Ring that would be shown upon ultimate victory. The conditions {{for this to happen}} was if the player could bring all the major characters including Morkin to the Gate of Varenorn and eliminate Shareth. The first to do so was then-15-year-old Richard Harris from Lowestoft in November 1984. Harris, however, had to wait for the models for 14 months—until January 1986—because the publisher had not expected anyone to [...] "finish the game so quickly".|$|R
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived back}} in Cairo in late September 1829 where the expedition bought 10,000 francs worth of antiquities, a budget extended {{to them by}} minister Rochefoucauld. Arriving in Alexandria, they were notified that the French boat that would take them back was delayed, {{and they had to}} stay here two months until the sixth of December. On their return to Alexandria, the Khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha, offered the two obelisks standing at the entrance of <b>Luxor</b> Temple to France in 1829, but only one was transported to Paris, where it now stands on the Place de la Concorde. Champollion and the Pasha spoke often and on the Pasha's request Champollion wrote an outline of the history of Egypt. Here, Champollion {{had no choice but to}} challenge the short Biblical chronology arguing that Egyptian civilization had its origins at least 6000 years before Islam. The two also spoke about social reforms, Champollion championing education of the lower classes – a point on which the two did not agree.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the god's visit varied. Some were tied to the {{ideology}} of kingship. In the Opet Festival, an extremely important ceremony during the New Kingdom, the image of Amun from Karnak visited the form of Amun worshipped at <b>Luxor</b> Temple, and both acted to reaffirm the king's divine rule. Still other celebrations had a funerary character, as in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley, when Amun of Karnak visited the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis to visit the kings commemorated there, while ordinary people visited the funerary chapels of their own deceased relatives. Some may have centered on ritual marriages between deities, or between deities and their human consorts, although the evidence that ritual marriage was their purpose is ambiguous. A prominent example is a festival in which an image of Hathor from Dendera Temple was brought annually to visit the Edfu, the temple of her mythological consort Horus. These varied ceremonies were united by the broad purpose of renewing life among the gods and in the cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Today {{there are}} dozens of sites with {{substantial}} temple remains, although many more once existed, and none of the major temples in Lower or Middle Egypt are well preserved. Those that are well preserved, such as Karnak, <b>Luxor,</b> and Abu Simbel, draw tourists from around the world and are therefore a key attraction for the Egyptian tourist industry, which is a major sector of the Egyptian economy. Three temple sites—Ancient Thebes with its Necropolis, Memphis and its Necropolis, and the Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae—have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. The Egyptian government is working to balance the demands of tourism against the need to protect ancient monuments from the harmful effects of tourist activity. Archaeological work continues as well, as many temple remains still lie buried and many extant temples are not yet fully studied. Some damaged or destroyed structures, like the temples of Akhenaten, are even being reconstructed. These efforts are improving modern understanding of Egyptian temples, which in turn allow better understanding of ancient Egyptian society as a whole.|$|E
