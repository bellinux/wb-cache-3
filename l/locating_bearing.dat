50|$|CARB {{bearings}} are toroidal {{roller bearings}} and similar to spherical roller bearings, but can accommodate both angular misalignment and also axial displacement. Compared to a spherical roller bearing, their {{radius of curvature}} is longer than a spherical radius would be, making them an intermediate form between spherical and cylindrical rollers. Their limitation is that, like a cylindrical roller, they do not locate axially. CARB bearings are typically used in pairs with a <b>locating</b> <b>bearing,</b> such as a spherical roller bearing. This non-locating bearing can be an advantage, {{as it can be}} used to allow a shaft and a housing to undergo thermal expansion independently.|$|E

40|$|Vision guided {{robotics}} {{for manufacturing}} {{is an area}} which has diversified applications and geometry based issues to be addressed. The paper {{is an attempt to}} solve a typical problem that could be faced by an bearing manufacturing industry incorporating vision assisted robot based sorting of annular metallic ball bearings. The robots incorporating magnetic grippers are the ones which are more prone to the problem of picking up closely placed components where in picking of one component would disturb the position of the other. It is obvious that in an electromagnetic gripper this task could be achieved by controlling the current in the windings of the gripper from which the magnetic field could be altered to apply only the required gripping force. Though online cameras could be a better choice for such application whereby new position of the dislocated neighboring component could be easily found, this paper is just an attempt to avoid the neighbouring parts being disturbed from their actual positions. The component’s priority for being picked and placed in the respective containers might have to be varied dynamically based on the locations of the object of interest and the neighboring object. Generally this is a particular issue required to be addressed during the picking and placing operation involving ferromagnetic parts handled by an electromagnetic gripper. The main objective of the paper is to develop an instantaneous inverse kinematics scheme for the typical cases of closed <b>located</b> <b>bearings</b> which has to be taken care for change in priority of picking and spatial positioning of the electromagnetic gripper.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The addition of hydrated lime to clay soils {{is one of the most}} common methods of soil stabilization. However, when sulfates are present in the soil, the calcium in the lime reacts with the sulfates to form ettringite, an expandable mineral. This expansion causes a considerable amount of economical as well as structural problems. In this research, a field test method is developed to <b>locate</b> sulfate <b>bearing</b> soils. A permittivity probe is used to measure the electrical conductivity of the insitu soil. The electrical conductivity is then related to sulfate content in soils. Expansion tests were performed to determine the amount of expansion that occurs when lime is added to soils with different sulfate contents. A model that relates the amount of expansion of clay soils to electrical conductivity, is proposed. The use of low calcium lime stabilizers are investigated and proposed as alternative form of stabilizer for sulfate bearing soils...|$|R
