5|$|The dock {{was used}} for fitting out vessels, and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships.

5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E

40|$|Study Design – This {{study used}} a {{concurrent}} validation design with 45 healthy female participants. Objectives – The {{objective of this}} study was to measure the relative contributions of aerobic capacity and back strength to <b>lift</b> <b>capacity.</b> Summary of Background Data – This was the first concurrent study of the relationships among spinal strength, aerobic <b>capacity,</b> and <b>lift</b> <b>capacity.</b> Previous research has demonstrated moderate to strong relationships between spinal strength and <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> and between aerobic <b>capacity</b> and <b>lift</b> <b>capacity.</b> Methods- Multiple regression techniques were used on reliable and valid measures of each construct to study the individual and joint contributions of spinal strength and aerobic <b>capacity</b> to <b>lift</b> <b>capacity.</b> Results – Both spinal strength and aerobic capacity make significant independent contributions to <b>lift</b> <b>capacity,</b> accounting for 11 % and 27 % of the variance, respectively. Taken together, the predictive power of these variables on <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> accounts for 43 % of the variance...|$|R

The general requirements include: launch and <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> to {{low earth orbit}} (LEO); space based transfer systems for orbital operations between LEO and geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO), the Moon, and Mars; and Transfer vehicle systems for long duration deep space probes. These mission requirements are incorporated in the NASA Civil Needs Data Base. To accomplish these mission goals, adequate <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> to LEO must be available: to support science and application missions; to provide for construction of the Space Station Freedom; and to support resupply of personnel and supplies for its operations. Growth in <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> must be time phased to support an expanding mission model that includes Freedom Station, the Mission to Planet Earth, and an expanded robotic planetary program. The near term increase in cargo <b>lift</b> <b>capacity</b> associated with development of the Shuttle-C is addressed.

25|$|A western-rigged trawler, David Starr Jordan was {{designed}} and rigged for midwater trawling, bottom trawling, longline sets, plankton tows, oceanographic casts, ocean-bottom sample grabs, scuba diving, and visual surveys of marine mammals and seabirds. She had a hydraulic hydrographic winch with a drum capacity of 15,000 feet (4,572 meters) of 5/16-inch (7.9-mm) line and a maximum pull of 1,600 pounds (726kg), a hydraulic hydrographic winch with a drum capacity of 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) of 3/16-inch (4.8-mm) line and a maximum pull of 1,600 pounds (726kg), a hydraulic combination winch with a drum capacity of 6,080 feet (1,853 meters) of 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) wire rope and a maximum pull of 6,500 pounds (2,948kg), and two hydraulic trawl winches, each with a drum capacity of 8,830 feet (2,691 meters) of 5/8-inch (15.9-mm) line and a maximum pull of 12,000 pounds (5,443kg). She also had a 50-foot (15.2-meter) telescoping boom with a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 11,838 pounds (5,370 kg), an 18-foot (5.5-meter) articulated boom with a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 4,650 pounds (2,109 kg), and a movable A-frame.|$|E

25|$|Oscar Dyson has a traction-type oceanographic winch {{which can}} deploy up to 5,000 meters (16,404 feet) of 17-mm (0.67-inch) wire rope or other cable, {{including}} fiberoptic cable. She also has two hydrographic winches, {{each of which}} can deploy 3,600 meters (11,811 feet) of 9.5-mm (3/8-inch) EM cable, two trawl winches, each of which can deploy 4,300 meters (14,107 feet) of cable, and a Gilson winch. She has a 60-foot (18.3-meter) telescopic boom with a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 6,250 pounds (2,835 kg) aft and a 23-foot (7-meter) fixed boom with a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of 1,000 pounds (454kg) at her bow. She has an A-frame on her starboard side with a safe working load of 8,050 pounds (3,651kg) and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Oscar Dyson the capability to have two scientific packages ready for sequential operations. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps. The hydrographic winches can deploy CTD instruments to measure the electrical conductivity, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence of sea water. Oscar Dyson also can deploy specialized gear such as Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System (MOCNESS) frames, towed vehicles, dredges, and bottom corers, and she can deploy and recover both floating and bottom-moored sensor arrays.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{monolith}} lifted by {{a single}} crane can be determined from the characteristic lewis iron holes (each of which points at the use of one crane) in the lifted stone block.

25|$|The present Soyuz rocket {{would not}} be able to lift Kliper into low earth orbit, because the {{spacecraft}} (the version designed without Parom) was expected to weigh between 13 and 14.5 metric tons (with payload and crew) whereas Soyuz only has a <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity</b> of around 8 metric tons. It was originally planned to heavily enhance the Soyuz rocket - a project that was labelled the Onega rocket or Soyuz-3. Until fall of 2005 it was much more likely that Kliper would have used an Angara-A3 rocket, which was scheduled to make its first launch in 2012 (however the Angara program has been delayed and Angara-A3 may not be developed in light of the funding of the development of Soyuz 2-3) or possibly a Zenit rocket that is built in Ukraine.|$|E

25|$|When Finn-Baltic capsized, {{some heavy}} fuel oil spilled to the sea {{and had to be}} {{recovered}} from the nearby shores. After the chief engineer and the chief officer had been rescued, the combination was refloated from the shallows and towed to a sheltered location near Ryssö and Mässkär islands on 9 January 1991 to prevent further oil spills and damage to the vessels due to heavy seas. Finn-Baltic was rightened two months later by a Soviet crane ship Stanislav Yudin. The first two attempts resulted in failures, the first on 28 January due to a severed cable and the second two days later due to insufficient <b>lifting</b> <b>capacity,</b> but the third attempt on 1 February was successful.
