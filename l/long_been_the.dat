5|$|Like the extravaganza and the burlesque, {{the variety}} {{show was a}} comic and ribald production, popular from the middle {{to the end of}} the 19th century, at which time it had evolved into vaudeville. This form was innovated by {{producers}} like Tony Pastor who tried to encourage women and children to attend his shows; they were hesitant because the theater had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> domain of a rough and disorderly crowd. By the early 20th century, vaudeville was a respected entertainment for women and children, and songwriters like Gus Edwards wrote songs that were popular across the country. The most popular vaudeville shows were, like the Ziegfeld Follies, a series of songs and skits that had a profound effect on the subsequent development of Broadway musical theater and the songs of Tin Pan Alley.|$|E

5|$|Linezolid's {{spectrum}} of activity against Gram-positive bacteria {{is similar to that}} of the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin, which has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include teicoplanin (trade name Targocid, a glycopeptide like vancomycin), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid, a combination of two streptogramins, not active against E. faecalis), and daptomycin (Cubicin, a lipopeptide), and some agents still being developed, such as ceftobiprole, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth. In the future, oritavancin and iclaprim may be useful oral alternatives to linezolidâ€”both are in the early stages of clinical development.|$|E
5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> real powers behind the throne.

5|$|On 19 August AD 14, Augustus {{died while}} visiting Nola {{where his father}} had died. Both Tacitus and Cassius Dio wrote that Livia was rumored to have brought about Augustus' death by {{poisoning}} fresh figs. This element features in many modern works of historical fiction pertaining to Augustus' life, but some historians view it {{as likely to have}} been a salacious fabrication made by those who had favoured Postumus as heir, or other of Tiberius' political enemies. Livia had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> target of similar rumors of poisoning on the behalf of her son, most or all of which are unlikely to have been true.|$|E

5|$|The Declaration became {{official}} when Congress {{voted for}} it on July 4; signatures of the delegates were not needed to make it official. The handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence that was signed by Congress is dated July 4, 1776. The signatures of fifty-six delegates are affixed; however, the exact date when each person signed it has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of debate. Jefferson, Franklin, and Adams all wrote that the Declaration had been signed by Congress on July 4. But in 1796, signer Thomas McKean disputed that the Declaration had been signed on July 4, pointing out that some signers were not then present, including several who were not even elected to Congress until after that date.|$|E
5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E

Almost all of these use upper Princes Street between the Exchange and the Octagon as part of their route.|$|E

5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three hooves each, and short feet with four hooves each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs has <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> subject of some debate. Originally, {{it was believed}} that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E
5|$|The Marrakesh {{area was}} {{inhabited}} by Berber farmers from Neolithic times, and numerous stone implements have been unearthed in the area. Marrakesh {{was founded in}} 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar) by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and second cousin of the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin (c. 1061â€“1106). Under the Almoravids, pious and learned warriors from the desert, numerous mosques and madrasas (Koranic schools) were built, developing the community into a trading centre for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Africa. Marrakesh grew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting Aghmat, which had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> capital of Haouz. Andalusian craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville built and decorated numerous palaces in the city, developing the Umayyad style characterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique style of architecture which was fully adapted to the Marrakesh environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin completed the city's first mosque (the Ben Youssef mosque, named after his son), built houses, minted coins, and brought gold and silver to the city in caravans. The city became {{the capital of the}} Almoravid Emirate, stretching from the shores of Senegal to the centre of Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} West Saxon {{territory}} {{at the start}} of Ine's reign is fairly well known. The upper Thames valley {{on both sides of the}} river had <b>long</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> territory of the Gewisse, though CÃ¦dwalla had lost territory north of the river to the kingdom of Mercia before Ine's accession. To the west, Ceawlin of Wessex is known to have reached the Bristol Channel one hundred years before. The West Saxons had since expanded further down the southwestern peninsula, pushing back the boundary with the British kingdom of Dumnonia, which was probably roughly equivalent to modern Devon and Cornwall. On the West Saxons' eastern border was the kingdom of the East Saxons, which included London and what is now Surrey. To the southeast were the South Saxons, on the coast east of the Isle of Wight. Beyond Sussex lay the kingdom of Kent. Ine's predecessor, CÃ¦dwalla, had made himself overlord of most of these southern kingdoms, though he had not been able to prevent Mercian inroads along the upper Thames.|$|E
