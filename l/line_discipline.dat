5|$|The first {{portion of}} the 827th to be {{deployed}} for combat was a single company {{in support of the}} 714th Tank Battalion of the 12th Armored Division, on 20 December 1944. Failing to see action, the company was withdrawn to reserve after three days on the <b>line.</b> <b>Discipline</b> proved to be a problem during this period, with men abandoning their guns to collect firewood, despite assistance and advice from the 614th Tank Destroyer Battalion (an experienced and well-regarded black unit operating in the same area). A second company was used for screening purposes {{in the first week of}} January, also not seeing combat, while the remainder of the battalion narrowly avoided being assigned to an indirect-fire role it was completely unprepared for.|$|E
50|$|Strictly speaking, in Unices a {{terminal}} device comprises the underlying tty device driver, {{responsible for the}} physical control of the device hardware via I/O instructions and handling device interrupt requests for character input and output, and the <b>line</b> <b>discipline.</b> A <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> is independent of the actual device hardware, and the same <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> {{can be used for}} {{a terminal}} concentrator device responsible for multiple controlling terminals as for a pseudoterminal. In fact, the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> (or, in the case of BSD, AIX, and other systems, line disciplines) are the same across all terminal devices. It is the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> that is responsible for local echo, line editing, processing of input modes, processing of output modes, and character mapping. All these things are independent of the actual hardware, dealing as they do in the simple abstractions provided by tty device drivers: transmit a character, receive a character, set various hardware states.|$|E
50|$|A <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> (LDISC) is a {{layer in}} the {{terminal}} subsystem in some Unix-like systems. The terminal subsystem consists of three layers: the upper layer to provide the character device interface, the lower hardware driver {{to communicate with the}} hardware or pseudo terminal, and the middle <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> to specify a policy for the driver.|$|E
50|$|In Seventh Edition Unix, BSD {{systems and}} {{derivatives}} including macOS, and Linux, each terminal device can be switched amongst multiple <b>line</b> <b>disciplines.</b> In the AT&T STREAMS system, <b>line</b> <b>disciplines</b> are STREAMS modules {{that may be}} pushed onto and popped off a STREAMS I/O stack.|$|R
50|$|Some Unix-like systems use STREAMS to {{implement}} <b>line</b> <b>disciplines.</b>|$|R
50|$|CB UNIX was {{developed}} to address deficiencies inherent in Research Unix, notably the lack of interprocess communication (IPC) and file locking, considered essential for a database management system. Several Bell System operation support system products were based on CB UNIX such as Switching Control Center System. The primary innovations were power-fail restart, <b>line</b> <b>disciplines,</b> terminal types, and IPC features.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} {{moving the}} terminal emulation into userland, while still keeping the TTY subsystem (session management and <b>line</b> <b>discipline)</b> intact, the pseudoterminal was invented.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reason why}} the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> is inside the kernel, is to avoid context {{switches}} at the reception of each character (which in the early times of small core memories, would imply swap-outs and swap-ins!). So the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> keeps in a kernel buffer a line of input, and since it is simple enough to test for a specific byte and decrement a counter to implement the backspace [...] "editing" [...] (and a few other simple editing functions), it's done there.|$|E
50|$|Technically, {{the term}} “cooked mode” should be {{associated}} only with streams {{that have a}} terminal <b>line</b> <b>discipline,</b> but generally it is applied to any system that does some amount of preprocessing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soon; {{of course}} {{no one can}} say when, but I don't see {{anything}} to gain from waiting longer. The mobiles are as good as {{they are likely to be}} made. One can't call the <b>line</b> <b>disciplined,</b> according to the English ideas of discipline, but they are better than they were, and at any rate all are anxious for something to be done." ...|$|R
40|$|All countries, {{regions and}} {{institutions}} are ultimately {{built on a}} degree of consensus, on a collective commitment to a concept, belief or value system. This consensus is continuously rephrased and reinvented through a narrative of cohesion and challenged by expressions of discontent and discord. The history of the Low Countries is characterised by both a striving for consensus and eruptions of discord, both internally and from external challenges. This interdisciplinary volume explores consensus and discord in a Low Countries context along broad cultural, linguistic and historical <b>lines.</b> <b>Disciplines</b> represented include early-modern and contemporary history; art history; film; literature; and translation scholars from both the Low Countries and beyond...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} that the POSIX standard addressed with its definition of a general terminal interface was the plethora of programmatic interfaces. Although {{by the time of}} the standard the behaviour of terminals was fairly uniform from system to system, most Unices having adopted the notions of <b>line</b> <b>disciplines</b> and the BSD job control capabilities, the programmatic interface to terminals via the [...] system call was a mess. Different Unices supplied different [...] operations, with different (symbolic) names, and different flags. Portable source code had to contain a significant amount of conditional compilation to accommodate the differences across software platforms, even though they were all notionally Unix.|$|R
5000|$|... {{local control}} flags for {{controlling}} the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> {{rather than the}} terminal hardware: canonical mode, echo modes, signal-generation character recognition and handling, and enabling the generation of the [...] signal by the [...] system call ...|$|E

50|$|TPNS {{supports}} the simulation {{of a wide}} range of networking protocols and devices: SNA/SDLC, start-stop, BSC, TWX, TTY, X.25 Packet Switching Network, Token ring Local Area Networking, and TCP/IP servers and clients (Telnet 3270 & 5250, Telnet Line Mode Network Virtual Terminal, FTP and simple UDP clients). TPNS can also simulate devices using the Airline Line Control (ALC) and the HDLC protocols. The full implementation of SNA in TPNS enables it to simulate all LU types (including LU6.2 and CPI-C), PU types (including PU2.1), and SSCP functions. Finally, TPNS also provides extensive user exit access to its internal processes to enable the simulation of user-defined (home-grown) <b>line</b> <b>disciplines,</b> communications protocols, devices (terminals and printers) and programs.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the hard}} <b>lines</b> of <b>discipline</b> and {{equality}} that mark out a landscape and give it all its mould and meaning. It is just because {{the lines of the}} furrow arc ugly and even that the landscape is living and superb. As I think I have remarked elsewhere, the Republic is founded on the plough.|$|R
50|$|Newer voting {{comparators}} compare {{signal-to-noise ratio}} at the voting comparator, accounting for end-to-end noise, bad phone <b>lines,</b> poor level <b>discipline,</b> {{as well as}} the best diversity reception path.|$|R
5000|$|In {{line mode}} the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> {{performs}} all line editing functions and recognizes the [...] "interrupt" [...] and [...] "quit" [...] control characters and transforms them into signals sent to processes. Applications programs {{reading from the}} terminal receive entire lines, after line editing has been completed by the user pressing return.|$|E
50|$|The <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> glues the {{low level}} device driver code with the high level generic {{interface}} routines (such as read(2), write(2) and ioctl(2)), and is responsible for implementing the semantics associated with the device. The policy is separated from the device driver so that the same serial hardware driver {{can be used by}} devices that require different data handling.|$|E

40|$|Though {{the theme}} of System Engineering is {{integration}}, and it is normal to attempt in integration to ignore the <b>lines</b> between <b>disciplines,</b> there are distinct characteristics of the mechanical design portion of any major system design project that make this difficult.

50|$|Native Americans, on {{the other}} hand, did not fight in lines, {{utilizing}} instead guerrilla tactics. American colonists and European forces continued using <b>disciplined</b> <b>lines,</b> continuing into the American Civil War.|$|R
30|$|The {{preceding}} section {{discussed this}} research effort’s grounding in educational science (cf. section “Study design”); {{the next section}} will break down the object of investigation (SLEs) along the <b>lines</b> of neighboring <b>disciplines.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{serial port}} {{could also be}} used for a dial-up Internet {{connection}} using a serial modem and PPP. In this case, a PPP <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> would be used; it would accumulate input data from the serial line into PPP input packets, delivering them to the networking stack rather than to the character device, and would transmit packets delivered to it by the networking stack on the serial line.|$|E
5000|$|... raw mode:raw mode is {{the other}} of the two character-at-a-time modes. The <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> {{performs}} no line editing, and the control sequences for both line editing functions and the various special characters ("interrupt", [...] "quit", and flow control) are treated as normal character input. Applications programs reading from the terminal receive characters immediately, and receive the entire character stream unaltered, just as {{it came from the}} terminal device itself.|$|E
50|$|For example, the {{standard}} <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> processes the data it receives from the hardware driver and from applications {{writing to the}} device {{according to the requirements}} of a terminal on a Unix-like system. On input, it handles special characters such as the interrupt character (typically Control-C) and the erase and kill characters (typically backspace or delete, and Control-U, respectively) and, on output, it replaces all the LF characters with a CR/LF sequence.|$|E
50|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, {{land use}} {{planning}} in Sydney restricted development to corridors within a short distance of the existing railway <b>lines.</b> This <b>discipline</b> broke down in the 1980s, however, when the Wran Government released new areas for development far from existing rail lines. This meant that buses outside of the inner-city, government-operated network, would play an increasing role in meeting Sydney's transport needs.|$|R
60|$|The {{resignation}} {{peculiar to}} the Orientals had sustained Besso under his overwhelming calamity. He neither wailed nor moaned. Absorbed in a brooding silence, he awaited {{the result of}} the measures which had been taken for the release of Eva, sustained by the chance of success, and caring not to survive if encountering failure. The Pasha of Aleppo, long irritated by the Ansarey, and meditating for some time an invasion of their country, had been fired by the all-influential representations of the family of Besso instantly to undertake a step which, although it had been for some time contemplated, might yet, according to Turkish custom, have been indefinitely postponed. Three regiments of the <b>line,</b> <b>disciplined</b> in the manner of Europe, some artillery, and a strong detachment of cavalry, had been ordered at once to invade the contiguous territory of the Ansarey. Hillel Besso had accompanied the troops, leaving his uncle under his paternal roof, disabled by his late conflict, but suffering from wounds which in themselves were serious rather than perilous.|$|R

50|$|Streams {{could also}} be used for inter-process communication, by {{connecting}} two processes to pseudoterminals. This possibility was in the mpx window system for the Blit graphics terminal, which could display multiple terminal emulator windows. Each window was a process that communicated with the window system through a pseudoterminal that had the <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> driver installed, sending typed characters to it and receiving text (and graphics) to display. Control signals designated the user's wish to switch between windows or close them.|$|E
50|$|STREAMS's {{design is}} a modular {{architecture}} for implementing full-duplex I/O between kernel and device drivers. Its most frequent uses {{have been in}} developing terminal I/O (<b>line</b> <b>discipline)</b> and networking subsystems. In System V Release 4, the entire terminal interface was reimplemented using STREAMS. An important concept in STREAMS {{is the ability to}} push drivers custom code modules which can modify the functionality of a network interface or other device together to form a stack. Several of these drivers can be chained together in order.|$|E
5000|$|The network {{operated}} {{using what}} were then high-speed serial links; its software implementation shipped with the Berkeley Software Distribution from version 2.0 onwards. It {{consisted of a}} <b>line</b> <b>discipline</b> within the Unix kernel, a set of daemons that managed queues of commands to be sent across machines, {{and a set of}} user-level programs that enqueued the actual commands. The Berkeley Network introduced the [...] file; Horton noted in 1984 that [...] "Berknets are gone now", but support for Berknet's custom email addressing scheme was provided in the Sendmail program until 1993.|$|E

40|$|Systems {{thinking}} is often invoked as a panacea {{for dealing with}} issues of sustainable development. Imperatives towards being more holistic - getting the bigger picture – are often coupled with a need for greater interdisciplinarity - joined-up-thinking – particularly amongst triple bottom <b>line</b> <b>disciplines</b> of economics, social studies and natural sciences. So why are systems thinking courses not more prevalent? And how might the teaching of systems thinking enhance the value of thinking differently about sustainable development? The Open University, UK, is a recognised international leader {{in the provision of}} Systems education for over 40 years. More recent experiences with the launch of a postgraduate Systems Thinking in Practice suite of qualifications at Certificate, Diploma, and Masters level, suggest an appetite for systems thinking amongst mature-age part-time students from a variety of professional backgrounds with an interest in learning for sustainability. This paper outlines three key features of the two core modules of the programme - epistemic understanding, active pedagogy, and design praxis. Significantly, these attributes have helped to complement rather than replace existing skill-sets amongst professionals from different sectors working in the field of sustainable development. ...|$|R
