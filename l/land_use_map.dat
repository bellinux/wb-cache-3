The recent, explosive growth of online geo-referenced photo collections suggests an alternate approach to geographic knowledge discovery.

Second, we utilize high-level semantic image features extracted using deep learning, specifically convolutional neural net- works, which allow us to achieve upwards of 76 % accuracy on a challenging eight class <b>land</b> <b>use</b> <b>mapping</b> problem.

5000|$|To {{the east}} of the Great Park the forests were {{gradually}} pushed back through the Middle Ages and the land was being put to agricultural use. In 1390 forest covered half of the total area of Hornsey. By the middle of the seventeenth century, farmland covered two-thirds. [...] By the fifteenth century the landscape of Harringay was dominated by pasture, but there were some fields given over to cereal crops and a little woodland remained. An inspection of Hornsey Manor by the King's reeve in 1283 notes wages for herdsmen and ploughmen and recorded activities including ploughing, sowing winnowing chaff and spreading clay. The value of oats and wheat were noted and animals such as pigs, plough-oxen, horses, cattle listed. Some five hundred years later Rocque's map of 1745 noted the particular agricultural uses to which the land had been set. These may well have been established hundreds of years before. His maps show that most of the lands in the west of modern-day Harringay were given over to pasture; those in the east, {{with the exception of a}} strip along Green Lanes, were in arable use.
