5|$|During the Enlightenment and its {{debates about}} human origins, it became fashionable to {{speculate}} {{about the origin of}} language. Thinkers such as Rousseau and Herder argued that language had originated in the instinctive expression of emotions, and that it was originally closer to music and poetry than to the <b>logical</b> <b>expression</b> of rational thought. Rationalist philosophers such as Kant and Descartes held the opposite view. Around the turn of the 20th century, thinkers began to wonder about the role of language in shaping our experiences of the world– asking whether language simply reflects the objective structure of the world, or whether it creates concepts that it in turn imposes on our experience of the objective world. This led {{to the question of whether}} philosophical problems are really firstly linguistic problems. The resurgence of the view that language plays a significant role in the creation and circulation of concepts, and that the study of philosophy is essentially the study of language, is associated with what has been called the linguistic turn and philosophers such as Wittgenstein in 20th-century philosophy. These debates about language in relation to meaning and reference, cognition and consciousness remain active today.|$|E

Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form {{is based on the}} creation and editing of keyframes, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include procedural and expression-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating particle effects and crowd simulations; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined <b>logical</b> <b>expression,</b> coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a hierarchy offers in skeletal system set up).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{specifications}} for many software systems, including safety-critical control systems, are often described using complex <b>logical</b> <b>expressions.</b> It {{is important to}} find effective methods to test implementations of such expressions. Analyzing {{the effectiveness of the}} testing of <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> manually is a tedious and error prone endeavor, thus requiring special software tools for this purpose. This paper presents Fault Evaluator, which is a new tool for experimental investigation of testing <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> in software. The goal of this tool is to evaluate <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> with various test sets that have been created according to a specific testing method and to estimate the effectiveness of the testing method for detecting specific faulty variations of the original expressions. The main functions of the tool are the generation of complete sets of faults in <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> for several specific types of faults; gaining expected (Oracle) values of logical expressions; testing faulty expressions and detecting whether a test set reveals a specific fault; and evaluating the effectiveness of a testing approach.

For model-based testing approaches {{the system is}} modeled {{by a set of}} <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> (predicates) specifying the system's behavior. For selecting test cases the model is partitioned into equivalence classes over the valid interpretation of the set of the <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> describing the system under development. Each class is representing a certain system behavior and can therefore serve as a test case. The simplest partitioning is done by the disjunctive normal form approach. The <b>logical</b> <b>expressions</b> describing the system's behavior are transformed into the disjunctive normal form.|$|R

Look yer! there's a dozen men as you and me know, that we could unload to to-morrow. Suppose we did? Well, what happens? They go in on four hundred thousand--that's about the figures we represent. Well.

60|$|They specialise extremely, for example, {{under such}} {{conditions}} as one had in Hindustan up to {{the coming of the}} present generation. There the metal worker or the cloth worker, the wheelwright or the druggist of yesterday did his work under almost exactly the same conditions as his predecessor did it five hundred years before. He had the same resources, the same tools, the same materials; he made the same objects for the same ends. Within the narrow limits thus set him he carried work to a fine perfection; his hand, his mental character were subdued to his medium. His dress and bearing even were distinctive; he was, in fact, a highly specialised man. He transmitted his difference to his sons. Caste was the <b>logical</b> <b>expression</b> in the social organisation of this state of high specialisation, and, indeed, what else is caste or any definite class distinctions but that? But the most obvious fact of the present time is the disappearance of caste and the fluctuating uncertainty of all class distinctions.|$|E
60|$|These {{are people}} who really do {{consider}} the Normal Social Life as the only proper and desirable life for the great mass of humanity, and they are fully prepared to subordinate all exceptional and surplus lives to the moral standards and limitations that arise naturally out of the Normal Social Life. They desire a state in which property is widely distributed, a community of independent families protected by law and an intelligent democratic statecraft from the economic aggressions of large accumulations and linked by a common religion. Their attitude to the forces of change is necessarily a hostile attitude. They are disposed to regard innovations in transit and machinery as undesirable, and even mischievous disturbances of a wholesome equilibrium. They are at least unfriendly to any organisation of scientific research, and scornful of the pretensions of science. Criticisms of the methods of logic, scepticism of the more widely diffused human beliefs, they would classify as insanity. Two able English writers, Mr. G.K. Chesterton and Mr. Belloc, have given the clearest expression to this system of ideals, and stated an admirable case for it. They present a conception of vinous, loudly singing, earthy, toiling, custom-ruled, wholesome, and insanitary men; they are pagan {{in the sense that}} their hearts are with the villagers and not with the townsmen, Christian {{in the spirit of the}} parish priest. There are no other Conservators so clear-headed and consistent. But their teaching is merely the <b>logical</b> <b>expression</b> of an enormous amount of conservative feeling. Vast multitudes of less lucid minds share their hostility to novelty and research; hate, dread, and are eager to despise science, and glow responsive to the warm, familiar expressions of primordial feelings and immemorial prejudices The rural conservative, the liberal of the allotments and small-holdings type, Mr. Roosevelt--in his Western-farmer, philoprogenitive phase as distinguished from the phase of his more imperialist moments--all present themselves as essentially Conservators as seekers after and preservers of the Normal Social Life.|$|E

6000|$|The {{next day}} {{some of us}} {{gathered}} in Dickinson's office and decided that Grierson should {{go ahead and get}} the options. This was done; not, of course, in Grierson's name. The next move, before the formation of the Riverside Company, was to [...] "see" [...] Mr. Judd Jason. The success or failure of the enterprise was in his hands. Mahomet must go to the mountain, and I went to Monahan's saloon, first having made an appointment. It {{was not the first time}} I had been there since I had made that first memorable visit, but I never quite got over the feeling of a neophyte before Buddha, though I did not go so far as to analyze the reason,--that in Mr. Jason I was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy I had adopted, the logical consequence of enlightened self-interest. If he had ever heard of it, he would have made no pretence of being anything else. Greatness, declares some modern philosopher, has no connection with virtue; it is the continued, strong and <b>logical</b> <b>expression</b> of some instinct; in Mr. Jason's case, the predatory instinct. And like a true artist, he loved his career for itself--not for what its fruits could buy. He might have built a palace on the Heights with the tolls he took from the disreputable houses of the city; he was contented with Monahan's saloon: nor did he seek to propitiate a possible God by endowing churches and hospitals with a portion of his income. Try though I might, I never could achieve the perfection of this man's contempt for all other philosophies. The very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place of his from out of the bright, respectable region in which I lived was in itself an acknowledgment of this. I thought him a thief--a necessary thief--and he knew it: he was indifferent to it; and it amused him, I think, to see clinging to me, when I entered his presence, shreds of that morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for the sake of decency.|$|E

If he had just thought of himself as old Chad was at sight of him thinking of him as older: he wanted to put him up for the night just because he was ancient and weary. It could never be said the tenant of these quarters wasn't nice to him; a tenant who, if he might indeed now keep him, was probably prepared to work it all still more thoroughly. Our friend had in fact the impression that with the minimum of encouragement Chad would propose to keep him indefinitely; an impression in the lap of which one of his own possibilities seemed to sit. Madame de Vionnet had wished him to stay--so why didn't that happily fit? He could enshrine himself {{for the rest of his}} days in his young host's chambre d'ami and draw out these days at his young host's expense: there could scarce be greater <b>logical</b> <b>expression</b> of the countenance he had been moved to give. There was literally a minute--it was strange enough--during which he grasped the idea that as he WAS acting, as he could only act, he was inconsistent. The sign that the inward forces he had obeyed really hung together would be that--in default always of another career--he should promote the good cause by mounting guard on it. These things, during his first minutes, came and went; but they were after all practically disposed of as soon as he had mentioned his errand. He had come to say good-bye--yet that was only a part; so that from the moment Chad accepted his farewell the question of a more ideal affirmation gave way to something else. He proceeded with the rest of his business. [...] "You'll be a brute, you know--you'll be guilty of the last infamy--if you ever forsake her." ...|$|E

We show that the contraction rule can be restricted to the atomic one, provided we employ deep-inference, i. e., to allow rules to apply anywhere inside <b>logical</b> <b>expressions.</b> However, the use of deep-inference and the asymmetry of the logic give rise to the context-dependency of the rules. We further show that this context dependency can be removed by introducing polarities into <b>logical</b> <b>expressions.</b> We present the system in the calculus of structures, a proof theoretic formalism which supports deep-inference.
