5|$|The tombs were {{constructed}} and decorated by the {{workers of the}} village of Deir el-Medina, located in a small wadi between this valley and the Valley of the Queens, facing Thebes. The workers journeyed to the tombs through various routes over the Theban hills. The daily <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> workers are quite well known and are recorded in tombs and official documents. Amongst the events documented is perhaps the first recorded worker's strike, detailed in the Turin strike papyrus.|$|E
25|$|Colonies {{are often}} {{founded by a}} group of L. vechti females using what is known as {{associative}} foundation. They begin by constructing small nests in the center, and eventually other wasps join the colony and build nests around the initial central one. The nests last for multiple years, and colonies grow and contain up to 600 nests or more. Temperature does not play a serious limiting factor in the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> wasps, and there is no particular season during which the colonies of these wasps are not present and active. However, brood rearing and reproduction is more likely to occur during the dry season, and the population of the nest tends to increase during that time as well, although brood rearing and reproduction also occurs during the wet season.|$|E
25|$|Logic {{suggests}} that Ward's fate {{was destined to}} be much the same. However, in Ward's case, his invention enabled him to turn his fate to his immense advantage. Family members state that the fact that the travels associated with the promotion of his invention took him away from the farm a lot was not something city-bred Ward considered to be disagreeable. In fact, his son David Bryant King had pretty much taken over operation of the farm {{by the time he reached}} eighteen. Leffler, after many years on his Hancock County farm, was finally able to move back to Springfield to help his father manage the family's considerable real estate holdings during his father's declining years. Like his brother, his son Edwin Askam King pretty much took over the operation of Grassland Farm. Although separated by distance, the brothers always remained very close, and they constantly worked together on the family's real estate undertakings in Springfield. Ironically, in the remarkably parallel <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two Springfield-reared farmers, their children were more farm people than they were.|$|E

500|$|After Robert Koehler of Variety previewed the {{screener}} edit of {{the series}} at the Outfest film festival, he wrote: [...] "What would have been spectacular stuff just 10 years ago is now something closer to a high-quality Oprah special, humanizing in rather simplistic terms complex lives…". Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, and perhaps it does not apply here.

500|$|Many of {{the younger}} captives were adopted into the Indian tribes or French Canadian society. Thirty six Deerfield captives, mostly {{children}} and teenagers {{at the time of}} the raid, remained permanently. Those who stayed were not compelled by force, but rather by newly formed religious ties and family bonds. [...] Captive experience was largely dictated by gender as well as age. Young women most easily and readily assimilated into Indian and French Canadian societies. Nine girls remained as opposed to only five boys. These choices reflect the larger frontier pattern of incorporation of young women into Indian and Canadian society. These young women remained, not because of compulsion, fascination with the outdoor adventure, or the strangeness of life in a foreign society, but because they transitioned into established lives in new communities and formed bonds of family, religion, and language. [...] In fact, more than half of young female captives who remained settled in Montreal where [...] "the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> former Deerfield residents differed very little in their broad outlines from their former neighbors." [...] Whether in New France or in Deerfield these women generally were part of frontier agricultural communities where they tended to marry in their early twenties and have six or seven children. [...] Other female captives remained in Native communities such as Kahnawake. These women remained because of bonds of religion and family. While European males castigated the [...] "slavery" [...] of Indian women, captive women from this time commonly chose to remain in Native society rather than return to colonial English settlements.|$|E

500|$|After the Reformation, Muhammad {{was often}} portrayed {{in a similar}} way. Guillaume Postel {{was among the first}} to present a more {{positive}} view of Muhammad when he argued that Muhammad should be esteemed by Christians as a valid prophet. Gottfried Leibniz praised Muhammad because [...] "he did not deviate from the natural religion". Henri de Boulainvilliers, in his Vie de Mahomed which was published posthumously in 1730, described Muhammad as a gifted political leader and a just lawmaker. He presents him as a divinely inspired messenger whom God employed to confound the bickering Oriental Christians, to liberate the Orient from the despotic rule of the Romans and Persians, and to spread the knowledge of the unity of God from India to Spain. Voltaire had a somewhat mixed opinion on Muhammad: in his play Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète he vilifies Muhammad as a symbol of fanaticism, and in a published essay in 1748 he calls him [...] "a sublime and hearty charlatan", but in his historical survey Essai sur les mœurs, he presents him as legislator and a conqueror and calls him an [...] "enthusiast." [...] Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in his Social Contract (1762), [...] "brushing aside hostile legends of Muhammad as a trickster and impostor, presents him as a sage legislator who wisely fused religious and political powers." [...] Emmanuel Pastoret published in 1787 his Zoroaster, Confucius and Muhammad, in which he presents the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> three [...] "great men", [...] "the greatest legislators of the universe", and compares their careers as religious reformers and lawgivers. He rejects the common view that Muhammad is an impostor and argues that the Quran proffers [...] "the most sublime truths of cult and morals"; it defines the unity of God with an [...] "admirable concision." [...] Pastoret writes that the common accusations of his immorality are unfounded: on the contrary, his law enjoins sobriety, generosity, and compassion on his followers: the [...] "legislator of Arabia" [...] was [...] "a great man." [...] Napoleon Bonaparte admired Muhammad and Islam, and described him as a model lawmaker and a great man. Thomas Carlyle in his book Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1840) describes Muhammad as [...] " [...] silent great soul; [...] one of those who cannot but be in earnest". Carlyle's interpretation has been widely cited by Muslim scholars as a demonstration that Western scholarship validates Muhammad's status as a great man in history.|$|E

2500|$|... "Omichund, his {{confidential}} servant, as he thought, {{told his}} master {{of an agreement}} made between the English and Monsieur Duprée [...] to attack him, and received for that advice a sum of not less than four lacks of rupees. Finding {{this to be the}} man in whom the nawab entirely trusted, it soon became our object to consider him as a most material engine in the intended revolution. We therefore made such an agreement as was necessary for the purpose, and entered into a treaty with him to satisfy his demands. When all things were prepared, and the evening of the event was appointed, Omichund informed Mr. Watts, who was at the court of the nawab, that he insisted upon thirty lacks of rupees, and five per cent. upon all the treasure that should be found; that, unless that was immediately complied with, he would disclose the whole to the nawab; and that Mr. Watts, and the two other English gentlemen then at the court, should be cut off before the morning. Mr. Watts, immediately on this information, dispatched an express to me at the council. I did not hesitate to find out a stratagem to save the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> people, and secure success to the intended event. For this purpose we signed another treaty. The one was called the Red, the other the White treaty. This treaty was signed by every one, except admiral Watson; and I should have considered myself sufficiently authorised to put his name to it, by the conversation I had with him. As to the person who signed admiral Watson's name to the treaty, whether he did it in his presence or not, I cannot say; but this I know, that he thought he had sufficient authority for so doing. This treaty was immediately sent to Omichund, who did not suspect the stratagem. The event took place, and success attended it; and the House, I am fully persuaded, will agree with me, that, when the very existence of the Company was at stake, and the <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> people so precariously situated, and so certain of being destroyed, {{it was a matter of}} true policy and of justice to deceive so great a villain." ...|$|E
