Unfortunately due to an error in design, the models did not feature ashpans.|$|R
50|$|In 1882, he {{attended}} the Electricity Expo at Munich, where he gained fame with his technologically new <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> whose efficiency was better than that of Edison's light bulb, also because it produced a white light instead of the yellowish light of Edison's globe.His success was repeated at the International Turin Expo of 1884 {{to the extent that}} he sold his project in France, Switzerland, Cuba and United States.|$|R

He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they [...] "were not trusted to change a <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> or put a Band-Aid on a cut". These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.|$|R
50|$|Fixture {{manufacturing}} began {{soon after}} {{production of the}} incandescent light bulb.

Such a location was identified in Alpignano where in 1885-1886 he founded a <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> factory that he managed until 1889 and that eventually grew to a productivity level of 1000 light bulbs a day.Eventually, due to strong disagreements with the factory new management, he resigned in order to pursue his favorite activity as an inventor.His old factory was sold a number of times, went bankrupt and was eventually acquired by Philips in 1927.|$|R
50|$|Hydroelectric {{development}} occurred {{soon after}} {{the development of the}} incandescent <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> and the Pelton wheel in the 1870s. Hydroelectric technologies were adopted in Australia, and Tasmania in particular, very {{soon after the}} technology was developed. The first driver of this was the electricity needs of remote mining operations that lacked access to coal. By the early 1880s, a hydro scheme was supplying electricity at a remote tin mining operation at Mount Bischoff. Other remote mining operations such as the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company copper mine in , and the Pioneer Tin Mining Co. in eastern Tasmania, followed soon after.|$|R

Since the break-up of the Egyptians, his production credits include Glenn Tilbrook, The Autumns, Sugarplastic, Kimberley Rew, Plainsong, Julian Dawson, Clear, Jazz Passengers with Debbie Harry, Helen Roche; often playing bass and keyboards on the sessions. His guest appearances on albums include David Gray, Nick Harper, Tim Keegan and he was MD and keyboard player for Channel 4's Vic Reeves Big Night Out.|$|R
40|$|An {{acoustic}} propagation experiment {{was conducted on}} 17 May 2000 in a shallow water site off the Perth metropolitan coast with the view of obtaining reflection and refraction data to contribute to developing a geoacoustic model of the area. The site proposed has constant bathymetry, though the geological properties of the site are not well known. The experiment used two hydrophones, one situated mid-water and the other moored to the seabed to explore the possibility of receiving head waves. The acoustic sources used were a 20 -cui air gun and imploding sources comprising 60 W and 75 W <b>light</b> <b>globes</b> and purpose built evacuated spheres...|$|R

25|$|An {{incandescent}} light bulb, incandescent lamp or incandescent <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> is an electric light {{with a wire}} filament heated to such a high temperature that it glows with visible light (incandescence). The filament, heated by passing an electric current through it, is protected from oxidation with a glass or fused quartz bulb that is filled with inert gas or evacuated. In a halogen lamp, filament evaporation is slowed by a chemical process that redeposits metal vapor onto the filament, extending its life. The light bulb is supplied with electric current by feed-through terminals or wires embedded in the glass. Most bulbs are used in a socket which provides mechanical support and electrical connections.|$|R

50|$|The {{auditorium}} originally housed 1107 opera style {{chairs and}} a 16 by 50 ft wooden stage. Later, when the stage was expanded, the first four rows of seating were removed leaving 976 seats. By {{the start of the}} 20th century, many of the seats were in poor condition and needed to be replaced. To preserve the historic nature of one of the school's greatest attributes, the 1000 Voices fund was established to restore the auditorium to its original state. In 2001 the seats were dismantled and sent away to be completely refurbished and reinstalled into the auditorium. Intricate details such as the gold leaf ribbons on the house <b>lighting</b> <b>globes</b> was also preserved, as well as detailed paintings on the proscenium arch.|$|R
50|$|Other works {{carried out}} were the {{building}} of players' tunnels {{at the foot of}} the Horrie Gorringe Stand and building the terraces (still in place today) during 1964/1965. The main, electronic scoreboard, opened as the Gorringe Electronic Scoreboard, sponsored by the Donald Gorringe company in North Hobart, was constructed in 1972 and opened in time for the 1972 TANFL Grand Final. After being in a rundown and precarious condition for several years, its 569 <b>light</b> <b>globes</b> were removed and replaced by the Hobart City Council in May 2011, with a flat screen installed in place and new time clock installed. The upgraded scoreboard was opened for use on 21 May 2011 for a TSL match between North Hobart and Clarence.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{describes}} a few techniques to transform daily life objects into tactile interfaces, and presents the implementation details for three objects chosen as example: a <b>light</b> <b>globe,</b> a tray and a table. Those techniques {{can be divided}} in two main categories, acoustic techniques and computer vision techniques. Acoustic techniques use the vibrations that are produced when touching an object and that are propagating through and {{on the surface of}} the object until reaching piezo sensors attached on the surface. The computer vision approach is an extension of the technique used for virtual keyboards, and is based on the detection of fingers intercepting a plane of infrared light projected above the surface by a pair of laser modules. It allows for multi-touch sensing on any flat surfaces...|$|R
5000|$|In August 1972 Newton told Nan Musgrove of The Australian Women's Weekly of an {{occasion}} where a visiting friend used his outside toilet in Perth where the <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> had blown. The friend {{reported that he}} was lucky there were no redback spiders on the toilet seat. The phrase inspired Newton to write the track, [...] "The Redback on the Toilet Seat", which he indicated was [...] "easy to write, that most songs come fairly easy except {{when you have to}} write one on demand, then and there". Newton's follow up EP, How Did the Redback Die?, appeared in October and continued the theme to explain what happened to the spider. In 1973 Newton was awarded a Golden Guitar Trophy at the inaugural Country Music Awards of Australia for Top Selling Record.|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnergy {{efficient}} lamps offer significant {{energy savings}} throughout their life. However, {{there is a}} variety of energy saving lamps available and it is unclear which impacts the environment least throughout the lifecycle under different use patterns. Different use patterns {{have a significant impact}} on the lifetime of each <b>light</b> <b>globe</b> alternative and therefore affect the life cycle impact of each globe. This paper undertakes a series of Life Cycle Assessments on two alternative lighting choices (Light Emitting Diodes and Compact Florescent Lamps) under a range of use conditions. It was found that the environmental impacts were comparable for CFLs and LEDs, though significantly less than traditional incandescent, for a range of different use cases. The sensitivity analysis carried out shows that the variation in lamp parameters has a far greater effect on the lifecycle impact rather than the use patterns...|$|R

The glowing sun marks his peculiar signature. His method of oil painting is a model that reveals itself in adopting embroiderer’s patient work that is to knit and adorn, {{and to make a}} drawing model out of it. The diverse uses of the light, the thickness of the lines and the colours, and their density pave the way to gross geometric forms. His oil paintings are the outcome of a hard and dense work process, and give the impression that they are magnified by sculpturing. His colossal works and his paintings resemble the historical art works that are consist of archaeological fragments and figures. However, the most enchanting form he adopts is the glitter of his genuine <b>light</b> <b>globes.</b>|$|R
