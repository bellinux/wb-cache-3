40|$|We {{describe}} Boeing's NLP system, BLUE, comprising {{a pipeline}} of a parser, a logical form (<b>LF)</b> <b>generator,</b> an initial logic generator, and further processing modules. The initial logic generator produces logic whose structure closely mirrors {{the structure of}} the original text. The subsequent processing modules then perform, with somewhat limited scope, additional transformations to convert this into a more usable representation with respect to a specific target ontology, better able to support inference. Generating a semantic representation is challenging, due to the wide variety of semantic phenomena which can occur in text. We identify seventeen such phenomena which occurred in the STEP 2008 "shared task " texts, comment on BLUE's ability to handle them or otherwise, and discuss the more general question of what exactly constitutes a "semantic representation", arguing that a spectrum of interpretations exist...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on results of an {{intensive}} study, which has been performed to understand and tune deep reactive ion etch (DRIE) processes for optimized aspect ratio, trench profile and etch mask selectivity. The development of the DRIE process was mainly driven by the increase of the etch depth. Trenches, made with these DRIE processes, are used for the fabrication of micro-scanner mirrors. Filled trenches are integrated for electrical isolation, open trenches for the etching of mechanical separated structures, e. g. mirror spring and comb electrodes. Especially for micro-scanners with high frequencies, the mirror thickness is of great importance due to the dependence on the dynamic mirror deformation. We investigated {{the influence of the}} passivation process by lowering the waferchuck temperature und by adding oxygen plasma as inhibitor. After an etch tool upgrade, we analyzed also the influence of a low-frequency (<b>LF)</b> <b>generator</b> and a new control software on the etch results. Goal of these developments of the DRIE process was a higher aspect ratio, an improved filling of isolation trenches and a higher selectivity to the etch mask...|$|E
40|$|Direct drive {{wave energy}} {{converters}} are attractive {{due to the}} elimination of intermediate mechanical power conversion stages. Longitudinal flux (<b>LF)</b> linear <b>generators</b> with iron-cored stators have so far been dominant in experimental direct drive WECs, but suffer from high bearing loads and unwanted end effects. A novel linear air-cored topology is {{presented in this paper}} which eliminates most of the end effects associated with LF iron-cored machines as well as the attraction forces between iron-cored stators and magnet translators. The attraction forces between the opposing sides of the translators of double-sided air-cored machines are also ideally eliminated. An analytical model and an exhaustive optimization procedure for finding the minimum active mass subject to certain performance specifications are developed for the novel topology. Finite element analysis is used to verify and further analyze the model. First test results from a 1 kW experimental machine correspond well with designed values and confirm the feasibility of implementing the novel topology on a small scale. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Model {{and motivations}} A {{simulation}} of the East model at equilibrium with density 1 / 2; the ones are in black. For p ∈ (0, 1), the East model with density p is defined on Z by the <b>generator</b> <b>Lf</b> (ω) = x∈Z (1 − ωx+ 1) (p(1 − ωx) + (1 − p) ωx) [f (ωx) − f (ω) ] It has equilibrium (and in fact reversible) measure µ the product Bernoulli measure of density p on { 0, 1 }Z. It {{can also be}} constructed by attaching a Poisson process clock to every site in Z. Every time a clock rings, the site is refreshed to a Bernoulli variable of parameter p, but only if its right neighbour is empty. This constraint creates the ”bubbles ” one can see on the picture. A natural question is: how do these bubbles appear and disappear? We begin the investigation of this matter by considering the East model with initial configuration empty on the negative sites. We then ask the following questions: •How does {{the position of the}} left-most zero (the front) behave? •What does the configuration seen from the front look like? Note: Since the dynamics is not monotonic, specific argu-ments have to be devised to address these questions. For in-stance, the sub-additivity argument used in [Lig 85] relies heav-ily on attractiveness and cannot transfer to our case. Main results •Law of large numbers for the position of the front Theorem 1 There exists v < 0 such that if Xt is the position of the front at time...|$|R
