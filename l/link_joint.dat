In {{accordance with the}} challenge and problems the subject of ITCWM faced, the standard of diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of therapeutic response should be established. The combination of symptoms-differentiation with special prescription/drug for special disease to increase the accuracy of treatment is the developing direction for clinical medicine and ITCWM. Absorption and utilization of modern science and technique is the prerequisite for breaking through in ITCWM theory.

These methods are being experimentally validated and compared on the 2 first joints of a 6 degrees of freedom heavy 500 Kg payload industrial Kuka KR 500 robot. AN...|$|E

40|$|In this study, link {{mechanisms}} are modeled using finite elements {{based upon the}} Shifted Integration technique. A single link structure of a pin joint and a rigid bar is expressed by two linear Timoshenko beam elements with their numerical integration points shifted to {{opposite ends of the}} <b>link</b> <b>joint.</b> The finite-element approach in control schemes may provide flexibility against sudden change in a hardware system, since the remodeling can be achieved easily by rewriting input data. This paper describes an application of the modeling to normal pin joint-rigid bar link mechanisms. A numerical scheme for obtaining joint torque curves in n-link mechanisms based upon Cartesian coordinates is derived, and a numerical test on an 8 -link mechanism by the Finite Element Method is carried out. The obtained joint torque curves as well as the CPU time are compared to those obtained by the conventional Newton-Euler method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Adaptive Physical Carrier Sensing(PCS) {{based on}} tuning the PCS {{threshold}} {{has been shown}} to be an effective mechanism for improving aggregate network throughput. However, earlier work [3] assumed a single link rate and a common PCS threshold for the entire network, as appropriate for a regular 2 -D lattice grid of nodes with constant link (1 -hop) distances. In an adhoc network topology, the 1 -hop link distances vary significantly and a single PCS threshold is no longer suitable. Because IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g networks provide multiple data rates over any <b>link,</b> <b>joint</b> tuning of the link rate and PCS threshold is thus desirable for achieving optimal aggregate throughput for ad-hoc networks. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective principle for the above optimization. Next, we use the intuition offered by these formulations to suggest run-time adaptive solutions in OPNET simulations. We restrict ourselves to 1 -dimensional random linear networks primarily to corroborate analysis with simulations and defer results with other topologies for future work. I...|$|E

A poor shield design can lead to economic hardships, safety concerns for the mine workers, and closure of the mine.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} method for {{tolerance}} analysis on planar structures and mechanisms. As for generic assemblies, deviations on a functional requirement involving different parts are calculated from tolerance specifications on individual part dimensions. For a linkage the requirement is usually the position or orientation of a given element (<b>link,</b> <b>joint)</b> {{with respect to a}} fixed frame, and the solution of the problem has some additional difficulties such as the correct treatment of joint clearances. The paper points out that, for underconstrained or exactly constrained linkages, tolerance analysis can be treated by analogy with a force analysis problem. The static analogy is first introduced and justified from well-known concepts of classical mechanics, and then translated into a calculation procedure that is able to evaluate the propagation of deviations from different types of dimensions (lengths of links, diameters of pins and holes at joints), as well as from linear and angular actuators. Problems of high complexity are shown to be easily solvable by the proposed method by means of available software tools for the structural analysis of planar frames and trusses...|$|E
40|$|In the {{coordinate}} systems defined in Fig. 2, XOY is an inertialthe vehicle must carry heavy loads. Platform designs {{have been proposed}} to achieve near omni-directional mobility using conventional wheels. Such designs are inherently simpler than special wheel designs. They can have high load capacity and high tolerance to floor irregularities such as bumps, cracks, dirt, and debris. The most common approach is to use actively steered wheels @ 6 #. Vehicles based on this design {{have at least two}} active wheels, each of which has both driving and steering actuators that allow the wheels to move in any direction from any configuration, but not instantaneously. However, these vehicles are not truly omni-directional because they need to stop and re-orient their wheels when following a trajectory without C 1 continuity. A truly omni-directional vehicle can be formed using coordinate frame and XwCY w is a moving coordinate frame at-tached to the wheel module at the offset <b>link</b> <b>joint</b> ~point C).

40|$|Augmented {{robust control}} of a {{free-floating}} flexible space robot Xiao-Yan Yu The flexibility of the joints and links of space robots is considerable, arising from elasticity of the joints and links. Controlling such a robot {{is more complex than}} controlling rigid one due to the interactions of rigid and flexible motion. Only a single actuation signal could be applied at each joint, whilst it has to control the motion of the <b>link</b> <b>joint,</b> the flexure of both the joints itself, and the attached link for a flexible space robot. To investigate such an underactuated flexible-link flexible-joint space robot, a free-floating space manipulator with one flexible link and two flexible revolute joints was presented in this paper. The dynamical Lagrange equation was established, and a singularly perturbed model has been formulated. The model consisted of a rigid subsystem, a flexible-link fast subsystem, and a flexible-joint fast subsystem. Based on the two-time-scale separation of the manipulator dynamics, a reduced-order controller was designed. This controller consisted of a rigid control component and two fast control components. Based only on the possible bound of the uncertainty, an augmented robust control law was constructed for the rigid coun-terpart of the flexible-link flexible-joint robot. The flexible-joint fast subsystem controller would stabilize the elastic vibrations at the joints, and the flexible-link fast subsystem controller would damp out the vibration of the flexible link. Numerical simulations showed that the link and joint vibrations had been stabilized effectively with good tracking performance...|$|E

40|$|A robot {{manipulator}} is an electronically controlled mechanism, {{consisting of}} multiple segments, that performs tasks by interacting with its environment. They are also {{commonly referred to}} as robotic arms. Robot manipulators are extensively used in the industrial manufacturing sector and also have many other specialized applications (for example, the Canadarm was used on space shuttles to manipulate payloads). The study of robot manipulators involves dealing with the positions and orientations of the several segments that make up the manipulators.
