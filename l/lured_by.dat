5|$|Bodanzky {{considered}} the screenplay a key-element {{on the production}} of Brainstorm; it was her only way of attracting a good cast and staff because it was her first feature film. It aroused interest of lead actors Santoro, Bastos, Kiss, and the producers Sara Silveira, Caio and Fabiano Gullane. Marco Muller, Italian producer of Fabrica Cinema, was also <b>lured</b> <b>by</b> the script, and the film became a Brazil-Italy co-production.|$|E

5|$|Seattle Transit {{general manager}} Lloyd Garber said that demand for parking {{was higher than}} {{expected}} {{and that it was}} too early to analyze ridership; after the first week of service, Seattle Transit began surveying riders to determine whether motorists had been <b>lured</b> <b>by</b> the new service. The study determined that 75 percent of surveyed patrons had switched from their personal automobiles, and that Blue Streak was responsible for a decrease of 400 vehicles on Interstate 5 at rush hour. By late October, demand at the Northgate park and ride prompted the State Highway Department to offer funding for an auxiliary lot.|$|E
5|$|Her most {{successful}} non-Hindi film has been director Santhosh Sivan's Ananthabhadram (2005). The first Malayalam venture for both Riya and Sivan, {{was both a}} critical and commercial success. It won five Kerala State Film Awards and surfaced {{as one of the}} biggest Malayalam successes that year. She played the role of Bhama in the film, a village girl who is <b>lured</b> <b>by</b> Digambaran, the evil magician portrayed by Manoj K. Jayan. In a song-and-dance sequence showing Digambaran turning Bhama into a medium for demonic rituals, the choreographer Aparna Sindoor made abundant use Kathakali movements. The use of Kathakali has been a high point in the resurgence of the classical dance form in other major Indian films as well, including Shaji Karun's Vanaprastham (1999) and Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair (2005). She made her Telugu Debut with Nenu Meeku Telusa...?, in which she was paired opposite Manoj Manchu.|$|E

40|$|Flight aktivity of tortricid moths, {{possible}} and traditional pests of orchards, was monitored in two localities in SE Moravia (Zlámanec) in 2013. Selectivity of pheromones was also evaluated and {{products of the}} companies Propher s. r. o. and Pherobank were compared. Cydia pomonella and Grapholita funebrana were abundant in traps, their flight activity {{was similar to the}} results of other researchers. G. molesta was proved in lower numbers. Only one specimen of G. janthinana was captured and G. lobarzewskii was not registered. G. funebrana <b>lure</b> <b>by</b> Pherobank was more effective for this species, and contrary G. molesta <b>lure</b> <b>by</b> Propher was more effective for the second species, but this lure was not so selective as that by Pherobank for G. funebrana. Knowledge on the morphology, bionomics, distribution and noxiousness of target species is summarised. The basic characteristics of non-target species are given and possible complications in pest monitoring caused by them in orchards are mentioned...|$|R

5|$|Quintus of Smyrna, in {{a passage}} whose {{atmosphere}} Boitani describes as sad and elegiac, retains what for Boitani {{are the two}} important issues of the ancient story, that Troilus is doomed by Fate and that his failure to continue his line symbolises Troy's fall. In this case, {{there is no doubt}} that Troilus entered battle knowingly, for in the Posthomerica Troilus's armour is one of the funerary gifts after Achilles' own death. Quintus repeatedly emphasises Troilus's youth: he is beardless, virgin of a bride, childlike, beautiful, the most godlike of all Hecuba's children. Yet he was <b>lured</b> <b>by</b> Fate to war when he knew no fear and was struck down by Achilles' spear just as a flower or corn that has borne no seed is killed by the gardener.|$|E
5|$|While Hughes's time at RKO {{was marked}} by dwindling {{production}} {{and a slew of}} expensive flops, the studio continued to turn out some well-received films under production chiefs Sid Rogell and Sam Bischoff, though both became fed up with Hughes's meddling and quit after less than two years. (Bischoff would be the last man to hold the job under Hughes.) There were B noirs such as The Window (1949), which turned into a hit, and The Set-Up (1949), directed by Robert Wise and starring Robert Ryan, which won the Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The Thing from Another World (1951), a science-fiction drama coproduced with Howard Hawks's Winchester Pictures, is seen as a classic of the genre. In 1952, RKO put out two films directed by Fritz Lang, Rancho Notorious and Clash by Night. The latter was a project of the renowned Jerry Wald–Norman Krasna production team, <b>lured</b> <b>by</b> Hughes from Warner Bros. with great fanfare in August 1950.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lured</b> <b>by</b> {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better {{housing and}} other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real or perceived ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E

These methods are: by trapping them in pits; by kheddah operations for capturing a herd of elephants, by driving into kheddas or enclosures, or driving the herd through the river-drive method; by noosing them with the help of mahouts sitting on the backs of trained elephants, mostly adopted to capture single elephants; and using decoy or <b>lure</b> <b>by</b> tamed female elephants and then spearing them.|$|R
