5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> British post-war planning, {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture {{and expansion of}} roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 {{one of the city}} centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest}} of French West Africa, {{authorities}} enforced explicit rules {{in an attempt to}} end slavery in the region. In 1903, the government instructed French administrators to not use slave as an administrative category anymore. This was followed in 1905 by a formal French decree that ended slavery throughout French West Africa.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest}} of French West Africa, the colony {{had a number of}} {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities. The Arabic language and Islamic law were preferred in the colony by the French in the establishment of colonial government, largely because both were codified, and thus easy to standardize.|$|E

5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural gas from the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based {{on religion and}} ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks of violence against Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the country, and {{particularly}} Texas, Galveston boomed in the 1920s. But even the Great Depression {{did not stop}} Galveston's run of prosperity. Despite the financial ruin that faced {{much of the country}} during the Depression, not a single Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of. Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution, in addition to many legitimate businesses. During much of the period, the vice industries provided the majority of employment. Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era: the Moodys controlled the largest legitimate interests, and the Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises. Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island.|$|E
40|$|In 2012, London {{will welcome}} the {{notes of the}} {{official}} Olympic Anthem, composed by Spyros Samaras in 1895 to the lyrics of the well-known Greek poet Kostìs Palamàs. This short hymn, officially adopted in Tokyo 1955, is largely reminiscent of Pindar and Pindaric imagery, <b>like</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Palamàs’ poetry, and <b>like</b> so <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Olympic celebratory paraphernalia; in a certain way, it represents one station (but {{by no means the}} last one) in the trajectory of Pindar’s Greek Nachleben from Byzantium to the present day. This paper will try and draw attention precisely to this trajectory, and especially to the changing social and political (rather than aesthetic) factors that influenced its course...|$|R

5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so called because its walls are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, this room is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of the most liberal cities in the United States, even surpassing its neighbor, Portland, Oregon. In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state. <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific Northwest (which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism), church attendance, religious belief, and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} in that location was erected by the architect Aetherius {{during the reign}} of Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491–518) to celebrate the victory in the Isaurian War (492-497). <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the city's center, this structure burned down in the Nika riots of 532, and was subsequently rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565). This building was extensively described by the historian Procopius in his De Aedificiis. In the 7th and 8th centuries, the Chalke itself or its dependencies became a prison, until Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) repaired it and converted it into a law court.|$|E

5|$|Coventry is {{an ancient}} city and a {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like many of Coventry's Grade I listed buildings, the city's walls were erected {{towards the end of}} the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies. Of the 20 buildings on this list, 14 are in the city centre, and 11 date back to the 14thcentury. The oldest is St. Mary's Priory, now a ruin, which was founded in 1043. Several other buildings in this list date from the 12thcentury. The youngest Grade I listed building in the city is the new cathedral, built in the 1950s to replace the 14th-century original. <b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the city centre, the original cathedral was almost completely destroyed in the Coventry Blitz in November 1940, and the new cathedral was built next to the ruin, which was preserved.|$|E
5|$|<b>Like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> British post-war development, the {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by Mid-Century Modern towers such as Castlemead, Modernist architecture, and improvement and expansion to road infrastructure. The world's oldest shot tower in Redcliffe {{was lost to}} road development in 1968, being replaced the following year by the Cheese Lane Shot Tower on a different site. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing, limiting access with the closure {{of a number of}} main roads, whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed. In 2006, one of the city centre's tallest Mid-Century Modern towers was lost, with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently. The transfer of the docks to Avonmouth, 7miles(11km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour). The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy, as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, {{but unlike the}} filler that might have occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' <b>like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{saw little}} active service, in part {{owing to the}} fact that they were {{considered}} too large and thus too valuable to risk during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878. The Ottoman fleet was placed in reserve for the following two decades, during which the four ships of the Osmaniye class were heavily rebuilt into more modern barbette ships. They were in poor condition by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish War in 1897, <b>like</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the fleet, and as a result saw no action during the war. The Navy considered rebuilding the ships for the second time in the early 1900s, but abandoned the idea due to their deteriorated state. As a result, the four ships were decommissioned in 1909 and Mahmudiye and Orhaniye were broken up in 1913, with Osmaniye and Aziziye remaining in the Navy's inventory until 1923, when they too were scrapped.|$|E
