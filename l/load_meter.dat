40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{measurement}} of particle loading on bubbles in the collection zone during flotation. Existing methods and instruments are critically reviewed to form a basis for developing a new bubble <b>load</b> <b>meter.</b> The new bubble load measuring device {{which is based on}} the Dyer (1995) and Seaman et al., (2004) concept is presented. It was noted that the Dyer (1995) concept as improved by Moys et al. (2010) had advantages that with refinement could yield a more robust working instrument. The device had to meet the following objectives: It must measure bubble loads accurately without particle losses as a result of bubble coalescence, or break up. Secondly the instrument should also be capable of collecting a solid sample in excess of 200 grams which is the minimum mass required for PGM analysis as function of particle size. Results of applying this newly designed bubble <b>load</b> <b>meter</b> in the laboratory and industrial plant are presented. It was shown at laboratory level through salt tracer experiments that the 20 mm and 30 mm riser worked well for the bubble <b>load</b> <b>meter</b> without sampling unattached particles. The intensity of the axial mixing in the 50 mm riser resulted in some salt transport up the riser, to an extent that would compromise the bubble load quality. An axial mixing model with 16 tanks in series was developed for the bubble <b>load</b> <b>meter</b> riser and parameters were estimated using Matlab’s Simulink toolbox. A satisfactory fit was obtained after the inclusion of an additional parameter that accounts for salt transport as a result of mechanical push by bubble swarms and the salt adsorbed on the bubble lamella. Industrial work at Lonmin’s EPC plant yielded a maximum sample mass of 35. 5 grams with the 20 mm ID riser instead of the target mass of 200 grams. This was attributed to a number of factors which include that the sample was taken using small diameter riser (20 mm ID) which meant that fewer bubbles were collected per unit cross sectional area and also the occasional breakage of the filter paper due to blinding which reduced sampling times. A froth recovery parameter fR of 0. 68 was obtained on the primary cleaner cells while a froth flow number) (fnR of 1. 55 was obtained on the primary rougher cell, this value of froth flow number in the primary rougher cell indicated high entrainment. A froth flow number was calculated for the primary rougher cell data instead of a froth recovery parameter because of the unavailability assays due to low sample masses. While the froth recovery parameter was defined as the fraction of particles that are recovered by true flotation that reports to the concentrate, the froth flow number was defined as the ratio between the total mass of solids recovered in concentrate (by true flotation +entrainment) and the mass of solids entering the froth by true flotation, i. e. collected mineral (particle-bubble aggregates). A froth flow number can assume any value less than, equal to or greater than one depending on the contribution of entrainment and true flotation. It was also demonstrated that bubble load values in conjunction with certain assumptions can be used to estimate entrainment. Results of applying bubble load data revealed that chromite recovery in the concentrate is a contribution of both true flotation and entrainment. The results also indicated that 2. 4...|$|E

During machining, such a system is anticipated to excerpt reliable data within a short time-lapse, monitor tool wear progress, anticipate its wear and breakage, alert the machinist in real time to avoid unexpected failure, and help obtaining quality products. This is vital, especially, when drilling Ni-/Ti-based superalloys as catastrophic failure and premature breakage of tools occur in random manner due to aggressive welding and chipping of the rake and flank faces. Spindle power data are easy to collect from modern machine tools and can be made available for such real-time data processing. This work aims to evaluate and analyze spindle power data for real-time tool wear/breakage monitoring during drilling of a Ni-based superalloy, Inconel 625.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{fracture}} tests on large-scale, pre-cracked, aluminum alloy panels is {{being carried out}} to examine and to characterize {{the process by which}} cracks propagate and link up in this material. Extended grips and test fixtures were specially designed to enable the panel specimens to be loaded in tension, in a 1780 -kN-capacity universal testing machine. Twelve panel specimens, each consisting of a single sheet of bare 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy, 3988 mm high, 2286 mm wide, and 1. 016 mm thick are being fabricated with simulated through-cracks oriented horizontally at mid-height. Using existing information, a test matrix has been set up that explores regions of failure that are controlled by fracture mechanics, with additional tests near the boundary between plastic collapse and fracture. In addition, a variety of multiple site damage (MSD) configurations have been included to distinguish between various proposed linkage mechanisms. All tests but one use anti-buckling guides. At this writing seven specimens have been tested. Three were fabricated with a single central crack, three others had multiple cracks {{on each side of the}} central crack, and one had a single crack but no anti-buckling guides.

40|$|Introduction Improving the {{efficiency}} of all agricultural operations has always been important for farmers and engineers. It {{is well known that}} the force required for cutting a soil using narrow blades is a function of soil and environmental physical properties, tool shape geometry and the tool’s surface characteristics like soil-tool adhesion and friction. Soil tool adhesion can reduce ploughing efficiency and quality. It may also halt the movement of tillage machines in more severe conditions. Adhesion can also disable some machine abilities, which can result in a significant reduction of machine performance. Adhesion of the soil to seed-bed preparation tools like furrowers can significantly affect the germination rate. Reducing soil tool adhesion of furrowers can reduce draft force and improve ploughing efficiency. Many researchers have worked on methods of reducing draft force by modifying the surface material and/or surface texture of the plough tools. A good prediction on draft force of a tool before producing it has always been important for farmers and engineers. There are some models for predicting the draft force of narrow blades in soil. McKyes-Ali’s model is widely used because of its accuracy and simplicity. Ultra-high molecular weight polythene (UHMW-PE) is a polymer with ultra-high weight and long molecular chains and is well known for its outstanding physical and chemical properties and self-cleaning abilities, which reduce soil-tool adhesion. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate usability of UHMW-PE coated furrower tines for draft force. Analytical and experimental investigations were carried out during the research. A comparison was conducted between the analytical and the experimental method. The results of this comparison can be used to determine reliability of the analytical model for predicting the draft force improvement caused by the surface modification on tines using different surface coatings. Materials and Methods Eight tines have been built. Four of them had a thick coating layer of UHMW-PE, and the other four were made of pure mild steel. Each set of the tines have been installed on a four shanked chisel plough chassis and then attached to a tractor. The draft force required for pulling the furrowers attached to the tractor has been measured by a simple <b>load</b> <b>meter</b> mechanism connecting two tractors. Draft force has been measured in two different speeds. Slip ratio of the tractor has been recorded. Each test has been repeated three times. McKyes-Ali’s proposed model for evaluating the draft force of narrow blades has been chosen to predict draft force of the traditional steel furrower tines and the surface coated ones. To drive the model, a computer program has been coded in the script environment of Matlab software. The model required some of the mechanical properties of the soil and the tool to operate. Specific gravity, cohesion and internal friction angle of the soil have been measured by routine laboratory methods. Soil-tool adhesion and friction of the mild steel and the UHMW-PE plates have been measured using the direct shear apparatus. Results and Discussions MkKyes-Ali’s model has predicted draft forces with an accuracy of 90...|$|E

30|$|An {{option for}} the setup of utility-owned {{communication}} networks are wireless technologies. Radio links can be installed with relatively small costs, {{and they can be}} flexibly adapted to changing needs. It must be noted, however, that the frequency bands used for such systems are not always free and may require licensing. For wireless networks, mostly smallband technologies are being used, since broadband network technologies known from the computer networking field such as WiMAX or WLAN are problematic with respect to range and reachability. For small subnets in microgrids with limited range, such solutions are nevertheless a possibility. Critical grid operation mostly relies on reliable point-to-point links. Currently, trunked radio systems like TETRA are becoming popular, for example, in Germany. As TETRA is limited in bandwidth (7.2 [*]Kbit/s per time slot), it can be assumed to be a substitute for services currently run over GSM/GPRS. Typical applications are data collection, in particular <b>metering</b> (<b>load</b> profile <b>meters</b> and household meters), supervision of transformer stations, or safety-related applications. These areas will further grow, and the trend towards active distributions grids will make data more critical, so that the requirements imposed on wireless communication solutions will grow, too.
