5|$|Several scales {{exist to}} grade the {{severity}} of acne vulgaris, but no single technique has been universally accepted as the diagnostic standard. Cook's acne grading scale uses photographs to grade severity from 0 to 8 (0 being the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> and 8 being the most severe). This scale {{was the first to}} use a standardized photographic protocol to assess acne severity; since its creation in 1979, the scale has undergone several revisions. The Leeds acne grading technique counts acne lesions on the face, back, and chest and categorizes them as inflammatory or non-inflammatory. Leeds scores range from 0 (<b>least</b> <b>severe)</b> to 10 (most severe) though modified scales have a maximum score of 12. The Pillsbury acne grading scale simply classifies {{the severity of}} the acne from 1 (<b>least</b> <b>severe)</b> to 4 (most severe).|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} a {{successful}} military campaign could vary in {{its impact on the}} defeated polity. In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca. In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods. The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed. At the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although {{adverse events}} {{are a key}} factor in compliance, their {{evolution}} during treatment with antidepressants is poorly documented. Therefore, the time course of adverse events during 6 months of antidepressant treatment was investigated. METHOD: 85 psychiatric outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder (with the exclusion of other DSM-IV Axis I disorders) were enrolled between September 2002 and March 2003 in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind trial with selective serotonin reup-take inhibitors (fluoxetine [N = 42] and paroxetine [N = 43]). At each visit, the presence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed systematically using the UKU Side Effect Rating Scale (UKU). General linear mixed modeling was used to investigate the predictors of the time course of adverse events. RESULTS: Overall, the number of at <b>least</b> moderately <b>severe</b> adverse events decreased with time. More severely depressed patients reported overall more (at <b>least</b> moderately <b>severe)</b> adverse events than less severely depressed patients (p =. 0002), but the decrease in reported adverse events was comparable over time. Men (N = 30) and women (N = 55) reported initially the same number of at <b>least</b> moderately <b>severe</b> adverse events, but the habituation was more rapid in men (p <. 0001). Completers (N = 58) and dropouts (N = 27) did not differ initially, but completers' habituation was more rapid (p =. 014). The habituation of adverse events was also more rapid in recurrent than in first-episode patients but only in men (p =. 0025). CONCLUSION: The time course of adverse events varies with the severity of depression, sex, completer or dropout status, and recurrent versus first-episode depression. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|Although {{cells of}} strain Sb 6 BP could be {{successfully}} cultivated, poly(3 HB-co- 3 HP) productivity was still low {{due to a}} low residual cell mass. The cell density was only 12.6 gCDW/L under aerobic condition in BM medium. From these results it was suspected that some substances required for cell growth were missing or that at <b>least</b> a <b>severe</b> shortage had occurred in BM medium. Therefore, the medium was optimized.|$|R
50|$|A {{withdrawal}} {{is a type}} {{of military}} operation, generally meaning retreating forces back while maintaining contact with the enemy. A withdrawal may be undertaken as part of a general retreat, to consolidate forces, to occupy ground that is more easily defended, or to lead the enemy into an ambush. It is considered a relatively risky operation, requiring discipline to keep from turning into a disorganized rout or at the very <b>least</b> doing <b>severe</b> damage to the military's morale.|$|R

These glacial maxima are called, from oldest to youngest, Tahoe, Tenaya, and Tioga. The Tahoe reached its maximum extent perhaps about 70,000 years ago. Little {{is known about the}} Tenaya. The Tioga was the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> and last of the Wisconsin Episode. It began about 30,000 years ago, reached its greatest advance 21,000 years ago, and ended about 10,000 years ago.|$|E
40|$|PurposeThe aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{prevalence}} of patients exposed to potentially severe drug-drug interactions (DDIs) at hospital admission and discharge and the related risk of in-hospital mortality and adverse clinical events, readmission, and all-cause mortality at 3 months. MethodsThis cross-sectional, prospective study was held in 70 Italian internal medicine and geriatric wards. Potentially severe DDIs at hospital admission and discharge; risk of in-hospital mortality and of adverse clinical events, readmission, and all-cause mortality at 3 -month follow-up. ResultsAmong 2712 patients aged 65 years or older recruited at hospital admission, 1642 (60. 5 %) were exposed to at least one potential DDI and 512 (18. 9 %) to at <b>least</b> one potentially <b>severe</b> DDI. Among 2314 patients discharged, 1598 (69. 1 %) were exposed to at least one potential DDI and 1561 (24. 2 %) to at <b>least</b> one potentially <b>severe</b> DDI. Multivariate analysis found a significant association with an increased risk of mortality at 3 months in patients exposed to at <b>least</b> two potentially <b>severe</b> DDIs (Odds ratio 2. 62; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 00 - 6. 68; p= 0. 05). Adverse clinical events were potentially related to severe DDIs in two patients who died in the hospital, in five readmitted, and one who died at 3 months after discharge. ConclusionsHospitalization was associated with an increase in potentially severe DDIs. A significant association was found for mortality at 3 months after discharge in patients with at <b>least</b> two potentially <b>severe</b> DDIs. Careful monitoring for potentially severe DDIs, especially those created at discharge or recently generated, is important to minimize the risk of harm.

40|$|A {{total of}} 101 elderly {{depressed}} patients and 85 community residents (matched for age and sex) were interviewed about life events, difficulties, and confiding relationships. Significantly {{more of the}} depressed sample reported at <b>least</b> one <b>severe</b> event {{in the three months}} before the onset of their illness. Lack of a good confiding relationship was associated with depression in men but not in women. In this relatively affluent Australian sample, life difficulties were rare and, probably as a result, were not significantly associated with depression...|$|R

25|$|The {{underlying}} {{mechanism is}} usually a problem with connective tissue {{due to a lack}} of type I collagen. This occurs in more than 90% of cases due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. These genetic problems are often inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner or occur via a new mutation. There are eight types with type I being the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> and type II the most severe. Diagnosis is often based on symptoms and may be confirmed by collagen or DNA testing.|$|E
25|$|The MRHA, the Sedition Act, section 298A of the Penal Code and the ISA {{all share}} an {{underlying}} objective: to maintain public order. The greatest {{disparity between the}} MRHA and the other pieces of legislation {{lies in the fact}} that the former provides for a much more benign resolution of issues. One commentator has said that there seems to be no apparent purpose for having a wide array of outcomes to choose from when dealing with the same mischief – religious disharmony. On the other hand, it might be argued that given a highly sensitive topic like religion, which incites deep feelings, an arsenal of options is vital so that an outcome best suiting the scenario can be tailored. Nevertheless, the MRHA, despite having the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> consequences, has not yet been invoked.|$|E
25|$|GD type I (non-neuropathic) is {{the most}} common and <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> form of the disease. Symptoms may begin early in life or in {{adulthood}} and mainly affect the liver, spleen, and bone. Enlarged liver and grossly enlarged spleen (together hepatosplenomegaly) are common; the spleen can rupture and cause additional complications. Skeletal weakness and bone disease may be extensive. Spleen enlargement and bone marrow replacement cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The brain and nervous system are not affected pathologically, but lung and, rarely, kidney impairment may occur. Patients in this group usually bruise easily (due to low levels of platelets) and experience fatigue due to low numbers of red blood cells. Depending on disease onset and severity, type I patients may live well into adulthood. The range and severity of symptoms can vary dramatically between patients.|$|E

Despite these similarities in terms of the scientific progress, public awareness of dyscalculia is much lower than it is for dyslexia. The UK's Chief Scientific Advisor, John Beddington, notes that, [...] "developmental dyscalculia is currently the poor relation of dyslexia, with a much lower public profile.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the prevalence and {{risk factors of}} perceived diabetes-related discrimination {{in the workplace and}} in work-related insurances in persons with diabetes mellitus in Switzerland. 509 insulin-treated diabetic subjects representative of the northwestern Swiss population responded to a self-report questionnaire on perceived diabetes-related discrimination in the workplace and in work-related insurances (salary loss insurance, supplementary occupational plan). Discrimination was defined as being treated differently at least once in relation to diabetes. The reported rates of different aspects of discrimination in the workplace and in work-related insurances ranged between 5 - 11 % and 4 - 15 % respectively. Risk factors that independently increased the risk of not being hired due to diabetes were the presence of at <b>least</b> two <b>severe</b> hypoglycaemic events/year and relevant diabetic complications (OR 5. 6 and OR 2. 6 respectively; both< 0. 05). The presence of at <b>least</b> two <b>severe</b> hypoglycaemic events/year was also associated with an increased risk of losing one's job (OR 6. 5, < 0. 01). Overweight or obesity were related to increased discrimination in work-related insurances (OR for denial 2. 1 - 2. 4; OR for reserve 3. 9 - 4. 4; all< 0. 05). Perceived diabetes-related discrimination in the workplace and by work-related insurances is a common problem. In the light of our findings the introduction of effective non-discrimination legislation for patients with chronic illnesses appears to be desirable...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{evaluation}} of narrators, each scholar would then conclude by describing the standing of each narrator. A system of terminology developed to codify the standing of each narrator, with some variation in usage of terms between the individual evaluators. These are divided into two categories, those terms that constitute praise (taʻdīl) and those that constitute criticism (jarḥ). al-Suyūṭī gathered the various terms and arranged them in order of strength. He quoted four levels of strength for praise from Ibn Abi Hatim and Ibn al-Salah, adding that al-Dhahabi and Abd al-Rahim ibn al-Husain al-'Iraqi added an additional level and Ibn Ḥajr one above that. Thus according to al-Suyūṭī, there are six levels of praise. Similarly, al-Suyūṭī described six levels of terms used to criticize a narrator; he arranged them beginning with the <b>least</b> <b>severe</b> and concluding with the most severe criticism.|$|E
25|$|Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} {{is a significant}} cause of hepatitis and {{is the most common}} cause of cirrhosis in the U.S. Alcoholic hepatitis is within the spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. This ranges in order of severity and reversibility from alcoholic steatosis (<b>least</b> <b>severe,</b> most reversible), alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer (most severe, least reversible). Hepatitis usually develops over years-long exposure to alcohol, occurring in 10 to 20% of alcoholics. The most important risk factors for the development of alcoholic hepatitis are quantity and duration of alcohol intake. Long-term alcohol intake in excess of 80 grams of alcohol a day in men and 40 grams a day in women is associated with development of alcoholic hepatitis (1 beer or 4 ounces of wine is equivalent to 12g of alcohol). Alcoholic hepatitis can vary from asymptomatic hepatomegaly (enlarged liver) to symptoms of acute or chronic hepatitis to liver failure.|$|E

Degenerative changes begin to occur without symptoms as early as age 25-30 years.
