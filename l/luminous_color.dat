500|$|The New York Times said of her: [...] "The simple realism, nostalgic {{atmosphere}} and <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> with which Grandma Moses portrayed simple farm life and rural countryside won her a wide following. She {{was able to}} capture the excitement of winter's first snow, Thanksgiving preparations and the new, young green of oncoming spring... In person, Grandma Moses charmed wherever she went. A tiny, lively woman with mischievous gray eyes and a quick wit, she could be sharp-tongued with a sycophant and stern with an errant grandchild." ...|$|E

50|$|The chapel has frescoes of Stories of the Virgin and the Cintola by Agnolo Gaddi (1392-1395), {{which are}} notable for their <b>luminous</b> <b>colors.</b> Also {{noteworthy}} is the panorama of Prato in the Michael's Return scene.|$|R
50|$|Grey {{became a}} highly fashionable {{color in the}} 18th century, both for women's dresses and for men's {{waistcoats}} and coats. It looked particularly <b>luminous</b> <b>coloring</b> the silk and satin fabrics worn by the nobility and wealthy.|$|R
25|$|By 1905 Metzinger {{began to}} favor the {{abstract}} qualities of larger brushstrokes and <b>luminous</b> <b>colors.</b> Following the lead of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Cézanne, Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism.|$|R
60|$|Harbury {{itself is}} a very {{beautiful}} place. The country about {{it has all the}} charm of river scenery in a settled and ancient land, and the great castle and piled town of Wetmore, cliffs of battlemented grey wall rising above a dense cluster of red roofs, form the background to innumerable gracious prospects of great stream-fed trees, level meadows of buttercups, sweeping curves of osier and rush-rimmed river, the playing fields and the sedgy, lily-spangled levels of Avonlea. The college itself is mostly late Tudor and Stuart brickwork, very ripe and mellow now, but the great grey chapel with its glorious east window floats over the whole like a voice singing in the evening. And the evening cloudscapes of Harbury are a perpetual succession of glorious effects, now serene, now mysteriously threatening and profound, now towering to incredible heights, now revealing undreamt-of distances of <b>luminous</b> <b>color.</b> Assuredly I must have delighted in all those aspects, or why should I remember them so well? But I recall, I mean, no confessed recognition of them; no deliberate going-out of my spirit, open and unashamed, to such things.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am afraid}} I cannot convey the {{peculiar}} sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There {{is a feeling}} exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I {{had come into the}} open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Woman with a wine glass, by Johannes Vermeer (1659-1660). Vermeer used {{different}} {{shades and}} tints of vermilion {{to paint the}} red skirt, then glazed it with madder lake to make a more <b>luminous</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Cogniat {{describes}} how Chagall's designs [...] "immerse the spectator in a <b>luminous,</b> <b>colored</b> fairy-land where forms are mistily defined and the spaces themselves seem animated with whirlwinds or explosions." [...] His technique of using theatrical color {{in this way}} reached its peak when Chagall returned to Paris and designed the sets for Ravel's Daphnis and Chloë in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The Imperial Eagle beakers {{showed the}} {{solidarity}} between {{the owner and}} the Empire and were very popular because of their decorativeness and <b>luminous</b> <b>colors.</b> But these drinking vessels were also valued for their generous size. Equally popular were the electors' beakers, which were decorated with illustrations of the emperor and electors {{as the most important}} representatives of the Empire.|$|R
50|$|Painted in {{the early}} days of Impressionism, this rural {{landscape}} uses gently <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> and loose brushwork to capture the atmospheric conditions of a silvery-grey, overcast day. While the surface texture is sensuous, the firm compositional network, Pissarro's hallmark, locks the road, river, field, and sky together tightly. Encroaching on the French landscape are clear signs of industrialization: factory, smokestack, railroad, and barge.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Roberts began {{experimenting with}} the {{demanding}} medium of egg tempera. She {{was drawn to}} {{it because of the}} <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> still seen in medieval and early Renaissance masterworks. Roberts has written a monograph on the technique and now teaches master classes in egg tempera.|$|E
50|$|Parrish's art is {{characterized}} by vibrant colors; the color Parrish blue was named after him. He achieved such <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> through glazing. This process involves applying alternating bright layers of oil color separated by varnish over a base rendering. Parrish usually used a blue and white monochromatic underpainting.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in 2000 Everhart {{discovered}} French Polynesia, a {{small group}} of islands {{in the center of the}} Pacific Ocean. The ongoing trips between French Polynesia and Venice, California have had a significant effect on the paintings most easily observed in the <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> palette. But, most importantly, it offered him a new way of seeing the work that he was dedicated to continuing.|$|E
50|$|Drobychevskaja {{works in}} a variety of media, {{including}} pastel, acrylics and oils. She prefers horses as a subject, which are valued by classicists of Spanish horses. She also paints other subjects, for instance, female nudes. Animals are often used in the artworks of Drobychevskaja, for example in the works Corrida and Wild Horse. Abstract portraits are also a favoured subject. Drobychevskaja uses <b>luminous</b> <b>colors,</b> favouring red shades.|$|R
5000|$|In 1972, amply {{fulfilling}} {{a desire}} {{to do something more}} [...] "real", Brady switched from fabric panels to watercolor and was soon producing photo-realistic works of complex color, texture, and intricacy. In her obituary, the New York Times stated, [...] "With their sharp focus, <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> and dimensions as great as 60 by 90 inches, her paintings have a hyper-realistic visual impact rarely encountered in the medium of watercolor." ...|$|R
50|$|Established in 1918 by two chemists, Walter Merz and Albert Benteli, Merz & Benteli AG {{had split}} to create mb-microtec AG in 1968. Before then, the {{production}} of <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> were mainly supplied to Swiss watch making industries, and even to renowned scientists such as Marie Curie. The usage of tritium gas/phosphor rather than glow paint was put into consideration for producing military-certified watches under the trade name Traser, and various other military components under glotac.|$|R
50|$|In Renaissance painting, red {{was used}} to draw the {{attention}} of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or another central figure. In Venice, Titian was the master of fine reds, particularly vermilion; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more <b>luminous</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
50|$|Encaustic art {{has seen}} a {{resurgence}} in popularity since the 1990s with people using electric irons, hotplates and heated styli on different surfaces including card, paper and even pottery. The iron makes producing a variety of artistic patterns easier. The medium {{is not limited to}} just simple designs; {{it can be used to}} create complex paintings, just as in other media such as oil and acrylic. Although technically difficult to master, attractions of this medium for contemporary artists are its dimensional quality and <b>luminous</b> <b>color.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three icons {{placed upon}} the iconostasis were {{executed}} by the Bishop of Tripoli, Barthenios, in 1761, just after the church’s restoration. They are typical of the Aleppine iconographic school, with Arabic inscriptions, brown faces, almond eyes, and sumptuous gilded costumes that reveal something of the prosperity and tastes of urban Syrian Christians at that time. The background is a dark gold tending towards orange. The <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> of these icons blends with the dark tint of the wooden iconostasis to give a warm effect.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning in the mid-1870s, Lindenschmit's works {{gradually}} became more <b>luminous</b> in <b>color,</b> {{being associated with}} the modern Munich school of painting. A few of these paintings include: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1964, {{with the}} {{encouragement}} of Giacometti, Weber traveled to New York, where the avant garde movement had been developing and coming to prominence on a global scale. While intrigued by the creative expression of the abstract painters he encountered in New York, {{he was drawn to}} the historic monuments of the Mayas and the Aztecs and began traveling to Mexico regularly. It was this combination of experiences - the breadth and spatiality of American abstract painting and Mexico’s <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> that moved Weber to a radical new start.|$|R
5000|$|He is {{best known}} for his {{landscape}} painting even though he did portraits, still lifes and human figures. His style is a faithful representation of nature, without distortion of form or light. His representation is more “classical” than that of Impressionism, done in clean <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> with attention given to volume. One of his influences was José María Velasco, with a similar perspective painting valleys, gulleys, groves and observations points. Raquel Tibol stated, “Feliciano Peña did not want to possess nature but rather to understand it in a dimension that would be apprehensible both physically and mentally.” ...|$|R

50|$|Jean Carolus, {{born and}} raised in Belgium, was a protege of François-Joseph Navez, Director of the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Carolus, however, {{spent most of his life}} in France, where between 1855 and 1880 he painted prolifically; portraying elegantly attired aristocrats often engaged in pursuits of a leisurely nature. The artist chose the subject matter of his {{paintings}} with great care, focusing primarily of representations of people in the 18th century; French interiors and garden scenes. His style characteristically combines a <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> palette with the expressive grace and elegance of his meticulously rendered figures.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{simultaneous}} reproduction of images, requiring different {{amounts of time}} to reproduce, on a cathode ray tube (CRT) screen is disclosed. Ultrasonic sectional views and electrocardiogram curves are simultaneously reproduced on the CRT screen by producing the images on different areas of a screen with two phosphors having different persistence times and <b>luminous</b> <b>colors,</b> within the times required for {{the appearance of the}} images. In front of the area on which is produced the image requiring the shorter time is a color filter which is permeable to the color of the phosphor with the shorter persistence time by which absorbs the color of the other phosphor...|$|R
40|$|Artist 2 ̆ 7 s statement: My recent {{landscape}} series depicts vines, buds, {{and lush}} botanical forms which appear and then fade under layers of gestural brush stroke. Surrounded by a backyard garden and natural beauty of Cape Cod, I am {{inspired by the}} ever-changing, kinetic qualities of landscape. Over several session or even several years, I build up marks, tones, and textures to echo nature 2 ̆ 7 s visceral attributes. While some of the paintings are based on garden themes, others are watery imagery which reflect the <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> and flora/fauna I see while swimming or kayaking at nearby Chapoquoit bay. A range of hues not typically seen in nature expands the possibilities for abstraction. Through these invented images, I hope to convey the magic and resilience of our fragile environment.

50|$|Despite her meticulous technique, <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> palette, and eye {{for telling}} detail {{reminiscent}} of Flemish painters, {{she was a}} modernist in sensibility and subject. A painting like Resurrection of a Waitress (1984), displays a sly humor in its choice of subject matter that hearkens back to her Tribute, but also shares with the latter a modernist's assumption that {{the life of a}} waitress or working man is as deserving of our attention as any saint. The waitress is carried heavenwards—held aloft means of an eggbeater caught in her hair—by a partially nude angel, whose method of propulsion is a whirlygig rather than wings.|$|E
5000|$|... "Before {{developing}} his reductive line-color-plane approach...Daphnis {{was involved}} with biomorphic imagery. Part of his inspiration came from a botanical hobby: hybridizing tree peonies, an avocation he pursues to this day. At Kouros, a group of rarely seen canvases and watercolors from 1947-48 deals with organic, floral and undersea forms, in poetic compositions of <b>luminous</b> <b>color.</b> Despite their amorphous look, they have a well-ordered structure that doesn't seem too {{far removed from the}} artist's later concerns. In one of the strongest - called, in fact, Hybridization - plant leaves and stems, bathed in a shimmering light, are beautifully locked in a harmonious balance of shapes and hues." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prangenberg's initial {{forays into}} art making {{were in the}} 1980s and his {{interests}} were focused primarily on color and structure. His medium of choice was watercolor on paper or canvas and his easel of choice was in fact not an easel at all, but the floor. Only after he was done would he stretch the painting over stretcher bars. He continued using this process until 2007. According to John Yau, these early paintings were [...] "planes of <b>luminous</b> <b>color</b> inhabited by geometric forms, which {{seem to have been}} scooped out." [...] Yau may have made use of the words [...] "scooped out" [...] because Prangenberg was using an impasto technique, applying the paint in a thick manner that allowed the surfaces to be cut into.|$|E

50|$|Oil {{paint is}} a type of slow-drying paint that {{consists}} of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and <b>luminous</b> <b>colors</b> make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.|$|R
