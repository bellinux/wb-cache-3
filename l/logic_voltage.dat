50|$|Integrated {{injection}} logic (IIL, I2L, or I2L) is a {{class of}} digital circuits built with multiple collector bipolar junction transistors (BJT). When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. Although the <b>logic</b> <b>voltage</b> levels are very close (High: 0.7V, Low: 0.2V), I2L has high noise immunity because it operates by current instead of voltage. It is sometimes also known as merged transistor logic.|$|E
50|$|By using a {{transmission}} gate to switch alternating voltages (e.g.: audio signal), the negative power supply potential must {{be lower than}} the lowest signal potential. This ensures that the substrate diode will remain non-conducting even at negative voltages. Although the transmission gate can still switch to <b>logic</b> <b>voltage</b> levels, there are special versions with integrated level shifters. A good example, is the 4053 standard chip, commonly used to select between analogue inputs to an audio amplifier, has a separate ground (pin 8) and negative substrate connection (pin 7) that also supplies the level shifter.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, pass {{transistor}} logic (PTL) describes several logic families {{used in the}} design of integrated circuits. It reduces the count of transistors used to make different logic gates, by eliminating redundant transistors. Transistors are used as switches to pass logic levels between nodes of a circuit, instead of as switches connected directly to supply voltages. This reduces the number of active devices, but has the disadvantage that the difference of the voltage between high and low logic levels decreases at each stage. Each transistor in series is less saturated at its output than at its input. If several devices are chained in series in a logic path, a conventionally constructed gate may be required to restore the signal voltage to the full value. By contrast, conventional CMOS logic switches transistors so the output connects to one of the power supply rails, so <b>logic</b> <b>voltage</b> levels in a sequential chain do not decrease. Simulation of circuits may be required to ensure adequate performance.|$|E

40|$|Complementary {{symmetry}} (CS) Boolean logic utilizes both p- and n-type field-effect transistors (FETs) so that {{an input}} <b>logic</b> <b>voltage</b> signal will turn {{one or more}} p- or n-type FETs on, while turning {{an equal number of}} n- or p-type FETs off. The voltage powering the circuit is prevented from having a direct pathway to ground, making the circuit energy efficient. CS circuits are thus attractive for nanowire logic, although they are challenging to implement. CS logic requires a relatively large number of FETs per logic gate, the output logic levels must be fully restored to the input <b>logic</b> <b>voltage</b> level, and the logic gates must exhibit high gain and robust noise margins. We report on CS logic circuits constructed from arrays of 16 nm wide silicon nanowires. Gates up to a complexity of an XOR gate (6 p-FETs and 6 n-FETs) containing multiple nanowires per transistor exhibit signal restoration and can drive other logic gates, implying that large scale logic can be implemented using nanowires. In silico modeling of CS inverters, using experimentally derived look-up tables of individual FET properties, is utilized to provide feedback for optimizing the device fabrication process. Based upon this feedback, CS inverters with a gain approaching 50 and robust noise margins are demonstrated. Single nanowire-based logic gates are also demonstrated, but are found to exhibit significant device-to-device fluctuations...|$|E

As the process scales down to smaller dimensions, area decreases, rise/fall times decrease, propagation times decrease, maximum frequency increases, power consumption decreases, and jitter decreases. We then evaluate the quality of phase measurements between read circuits for assessing clock skew in systems that use magnetic global clocking.

50|$|Whether or not {{a circuit}} {{experiences}} a soft error depends on {{the energy of the}} incoming particle, the geometry of the impact, the location of the strike, and the design of the logic circuit. Logic circuits with higher capacitance and higher <b>logic</b> <b>voltages</b> are less likely to suffer an error. This combination of capacitance and voltage is described by the critical charge parameter, Qcrit, the minimum electron charge disturbance needed to change the logic level. A higher Qcrit means fewer soft errors. Unfortunately, a higher Qcrit also means a slower logic gate and a higher power dissipation. Reduction in chip feature size and supply voltage, desirable for many reasons, decreases Qcrit. Thus, the importance of soft errors increases as chip technology advances.|$|R

40|$|Coherent optical data {{processing}} is recognised, for many applications, {{as a viable}} alternative to digital electronic signal processing; the case for using coherent optics is particularly strong when the data to be processed is two dimensional in nature. It has long been accpeted that, in order for coherent optical processing to achieve its full performance potential, two dimensional spatial light modulators - capable of operating in real time - are essential at both the object plane (where the data is input to the system) and the Fourier plane (where the operation carried out on the data is determined). Most previous research in the field of spatial modulators has concentrated on optically addressed devices for use in the object plane. This thesis describes a prototype liquid crystal over silicon spatial light modulator built to test the feasibility of using such devices in a coherent optical processor. Optically, the device operates as a binary amplitude modulator, consisting of a square array of 16 x 16 pixels, each of size 100 x 100 m^ 2 and located at 200 m centres.
