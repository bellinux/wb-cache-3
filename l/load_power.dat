It was {{primarily}} used in winter to boost capacity, as required by the widespread use of electric heating and poor home insulation in Quebec. It was also sporadically operated as a base <b>load</b> <b>power</b> plant between 1989 and 1991, in 1998 and in 2003-2004 to mitigate low water conditions in the company's reservoirs.|$|E
40|$|In {{designing}} a multiple load electrical system, the designer {{may wish to}} compare the performance of two setups: a common electrical source <b>powering</b> all <b>loads,</b> or separate electrical sources <b>powering</b> individual <b>loads.</b> Three types of electrical sources: an ideal voltage source, an ideal current source, and solar cell source <b>powering</b> resistive <b>loads</b> were analyzed for their performances in separate and common source systems. A mathematical proof is given, for each case, indicating the merit of the separate or common source system. The main conclusions are: (1) identical resistive <b>loads</b> <b>powered</b> by ideal voltage sources perform the same in both system setups, (2) nonidentical resistive <b>loads</b> <b>powered</b> by ideal voltage sources perform the same in both system setups, (3) nonidentical resistive <b>loads</b> <b>powered</b> by ideal current sources have higher performance in separate source systems, and (4) nonidentical resistive <b>loads</b> <b>powered</b> by solar cells have higher performance in a common source system {{for a wide range}} of load resistances...|$|R

25|$|British Energy {{bought the}} 2,000 MWe Eggborough coal fired station from National Power in 2000 {{to provide a}} more {{flexible}} power production facility and reduce penalty charge risks from the New Electricity Trading Arrangements introduced in March 2001. Despite this, the new arrangements led to a significantly lower electricity price for inflexible base <b>load</b> <b>power</b> stations such as British Energy had. The purchase of Eggborough occurred {{at the peak of the}} market for power stations, and in 2002 the value of the station was written down by half.|$|E
25|$|The {{displaced}} dispatchable generation {{could be}} coal, natural gas, biofuels, nuclear, geothermal or conventional hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is effective {{to use them}} as constant base <b>load</b> <b>power,</b> when that power is not needed it can displace heating fuels or be converted to storage for later use. Biofuels and hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. Alternatives to burning coal and natural gas with the production of greenhouse gases may eventually make them a stranded asset that is left in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plant capacity and lower capacity factors.|$|E
25|$|Power factors below 1.0 {{require a}} utility to {{generate}} more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the <b>load</b> <b>power</b> factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to {{the square of the}} current). Alternatively all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current.|$|E
30|$|Suppressing <b>power</b> <b>load</b> {{stochastic}} {{noise is}} one of the important links in <b>power</b> <b>load</b> modeling and forecasting.

2500|$|Since {{the units}} are consistent, the power factor is by {{definition}} a dimensionless number between −1 and 1. When power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the <b>load.</b> <b>Power</b> factors are usually stated as [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] to show {{the sign of the}} phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and inductive loads are lagging (current lags voltage).|$|E
2500|$|However, the {{marginal}} {{cost of electricity}} varies because of the varying operational and fuel costs of different classes of generators. At one extreme, base <b>load</b> <b>power</b> plants such as coal-fired power plants and nuclear power plants are low marginal cost generators, as they have high capital and maintenance costs but low fuel costs. At the other extreme, peaking power plants such as gas turbine natural gas plants burn expensive fuel but are cheaper to build, operate and maintain. To minimize the total operational cost of generating power, base load generators are dispatched most of the time, while peak power generators are dispatched only when necessary, generally when energy demand peaks. [...] This is called [...] "economic dispatch".|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) {{is a practical}} broadband signaling technique for use in multipath fading channels. Over the past ten years, {{research has shown that}} <b>power</b> <b>loading,</b> where the <b>power</b> allocations on the OFDM frequency tones are jointly optimized, can improve error rate or capacity performance. The implementation of <b>power</b> <b>loading,</b> however, is dependent on the presence of complete forward link channel knowledge at the transmitter. In systems using {{frequency division}} duplexing (FDD), this assumption is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> for OFDM symbols using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the receiver to the transmitter. The <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vector is designed at the receiver, which is assumed to have perfect knowledge of the forward link channel, and conveyed back to the transmitter over a limited rate feedback channel. To allow for the vector to be represented by a small number of bits, the <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vector is restricted to lie in a finite set, or codebook, of <b>power</b> <b>loading</b> vectors. This codebook is designed offline and known apriorito both the transmitter and receiver. We present two power allocation selection algorithms that optimize the probability of symbol error and capacity, respectively.
