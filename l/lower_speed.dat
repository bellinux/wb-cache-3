5|$|A seven-mile (11km) journey over {{increasingly}} {{rolling and}} open terrain takes the two highways {{into the town}} of North East and towards Millerton. Just south of the village, NY199 reaches its eastern terminus. The road enters Millerton on South Elm Street, making a sharp turn north that necessitates a concrete barrier and a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limit just south of downtown.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate deicing procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
50|$|The great {{majority}} of the route mileage has permitted line speeds between 55 and 60 miles per hour (mph), with shorter sections of both higher and <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b> Junctions are no faster than 30 mph, with significant numbers rated at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds,</b> down to 10 mph in some cases.|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} the EEDI {{regulations}} on the design speed of the vessel underestimates the possible reductions of the fuel consumption at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b> For example The current practice of running the controllable pitch propeller on a constant rpm because of the PTO lowers the propeller efficiency substantially at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R

5|$|Unsurprisingly, the {{two teams}} found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already {{concluded}} they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic Caravelle). As neither company had experience {{in the use of}} high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used– above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that Küchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.|$|E
5|$|Domestic {{high-speed}} {{services on}} High Speed 1 are operated by Southeastern. Having been in planning since 2004, a preview {{service of the}} British Rail Class 395 trains, popularly known as Javelins, started in June 2009, and regular services began on 13 December 2009. The quickest journey time from Ashford to London St Pancras is 35 minutes, compared with 80 minutes for the service to London Charing Cross via Tonbridge. This service on Section 2 of the CTRL, known previously as CTRL-DS, {{was a factor in}} London's successful 2012 Olympic Bid, promising a seven-minute journey time from the Olympic Park at Stratford to the London terminus at St Pancras. Although the Class 395 has a maximum speed of , for timetabling purposes a 10% <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> is assumed. These trains have faster acceleration than the Eurostar units.|$|E
5|$|The 1973–1974 {{oil embargo}} had lasting {{effects on the}} United States and other industrialized nations, which {{established}} the International Energy Agency in response, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand months of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and appliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-conditioning, better insulation, increased support of mass transit, and greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other alternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough that US oil consumption would rise only 11 percent during 1980–2014, while real GDP rose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly that their oil {{could be used as}} both a political and economic weapon against other nations, {{at least in the short}} term.|$|E

5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so at a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> than c, {{the speed of}} light in a vacuum. For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing {{can be explained by the}} light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E

25|$|Variable {{speed limits}} offer some {{potential}} to reduce speed-related crashes. However, {{due to the}} high cost of implementation, they exist primarily on freeways. Furthermore, most speed-related crashes occur on local and collector roads, which generally have far <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limits and prevailing speeds than freeways.|$|E

25|$|The {{closely related}} Class 318 units which were {{built for the}} Ayrshire Coast {{electrification}} in Scotland, are effectively a 3-car {{version of the same}} design, but with a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> capability of 90mph and are fitted with Brush traction motors in place of GEC traction motors.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{standard}} definition, {{but in the}} United States (where {{the terminology}} was devised in the 1970s from the engineering term light railway), light rail operates primarily along exclusive rights-of-way and uses either individual tramcars or multiple units coupled {{to form a train}} that is lower capacity and <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> than a long heavy passenger train or metro system.|$|E

25|$|Due to the Oberth {{effect and}} {{starting}} from a nonzero speed, the required potential energy needed from the propellant {{may be less}} than the increase in energy in the vehicle and payload. This can be the case when the reaction mass has a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> after being expelled than before – rockets are able to liberate {{some or all of}} the initial kinetic energy of the propellant.|$|E
25|$|There may {{be other}} sidings at the station which are <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> tracks for other purposes. A {{maintenance}} track or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a passing track, is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, autoracks or sleepers. A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{indicators}} are provided whenever {{there is a}} reduction in permissible speed of a third or more, and are placed at the service braking distance {{from the start of}} the <b>lower</b> <b>speed.</b> There is also an AWS magnet placed before the indicator to give an audible warning to the train driver. Colloquially known as 'Morpeth boards', after the 1969 derailment at Morpeth, Northumberland that led to their introduction.|$|E

50|$|At higher speeds {{approaching}} or {{exceeding the}} speed of sound, the Mach number becomes important ({{the speed of}} sound is Mach 1). At these speeds the air becomes compressible and its characteristics change dramatically, with shock waves forming. Fast jets are often inefficient at low airspeeds, so a model designed to fly {{at the speed of}} sound will also be inefficient at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b> In particular, the swept wings and pointed noses common on fast jets tend to increase drag or impair handling at <b>lower</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|The default {{speed limit}} and National Speed Limits is 90km/h (55mph); however, a <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limit of 80km/h (50mph) has been {{implemented}} during festive seasons {{starting from the}} 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri as a preventive measure to reduce accidents during festive seasons. In town areas, the speed limit is reduced to 60km/h (40mph). Speed traps are also deployed by the Malaysian police at many places along the federal roads.|$|E
25|$|In June 1999 {{the section}} of the third lane (the lane nearest the central reservation) between Junctions 2 and 3 was {{converted}} to a bus lane, first as a pilot scheme and then permanently in 2001. A <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limit was introduced along the bus lane section at the same time (the lane was however reverted to general traffic use by the incoming coalition government in late 2010).|$|E
25|$|SD card {{speed is}} customarily rated by its {{sequential}} {{read or write}} speed. The sequential performance aspect is the most relevant for storing and retrieving large files (relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory), such as images and multimedia. Small data (such as file names, sizes and timestamps) falls under the much <b>lower</b> <b>speed</b> limit of random access, which can be the limiting factor in some use cases.|$|E
