In this work, we first show that web links have an intrinsic multi-level feedback structure. For example, consider a 2 -level feedback web link: the 1 st level feedback provides the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and the 2 nd level feedback provides the potential revenue, which collectively produce the compound 2 -level revenue. We consider the context-free <b>links</b> <b>selection</b> problem of selecting links for a homepage so as to maximize the total compound 2 -level revenue while keeping the total 1 st level feedback above a preset threshold. We further generalize the problem to links with n (n> 2) -level feedback structure. The key challenge is that the links' multi-level feedback structures are unobservable unless the links are selected on the homepage. To our best knowledge, we {{are the first to}} model the <b>links</b> <b>selection</b> problem as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem and design an effective <b>links</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm by learning the links' multi-level structure with provable sub-linear regret and violation bounds. We uncover the multi-level feedback structures of web links in two real-world datasets. We also conduct extensive experiments on the datasets to compare our proposed LExp algorithm with two state-of-the-art context-free bandit algorithms and show that LExp algorithm is the most effective in <b>links</b> <b>selection</b> while satisfying the constraint.

50|$|Background {{selection}} {{describes the}} loss of genetic diversity at a non-deleterious locus due to negative <b>selection</b> against <b>linked</b> deleterious alleles. It is one form of <b>linked</b> <b>selection,</b> where the maintenance or removal of an allele from a population is dependent upon the alleles in its linkage group. The name emphasizes {{the fact that the}} genetic background, or environment, of a neutral mutation has a significant impact on whether it will be preserved (genetic hitchhiking) or purged (background selection) from a population. In some cases, the term background selection is used broadly to refer to all forms of <b>linked</b> <b>selection,</b> but most often it is used only when neutral variation is reduced due to negative selection against deleterious mutations. Background selection and all forms of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> contradict the assumption of the Neutral theory of molecular evolution that the fixation or loss of neutral alleles is entirely stochastic, the result of genetic drift. Instead, these models predict that neutral variation is correlated with the selective pressures acting on linked non-neutral genes, that neutral traits are not necessarily oblivious to selection. Because they segregate together, non-neutral mutations linked to neutral polymorphisms result in decreased levels of genetic variation relative to predictions of neutral evolution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{wireless}} sensor network, {{there are}} several links from one node to another, selecting the high quality link from the links is an important basic research. As a general algorithm, the typical <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm is usually used in selecting the high quality link, but the typical <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm needs lots of data packages as the testing samples. But the energy of a wireless sensor network is limited; therefore, the typical <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithm is not suitable for wireless sensor network.

40|$|Natural {{selection}} at {{one site}} shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Quantifying {{the effects of}} "linked selection" on levels of genetic diversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null model in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of natural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers parameters of distinct modes of <b>linked</b> <b>selection,</b> notably background selection and selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations and genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate {{the probability that a}} neutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and recombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples using composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of distinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach yields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing data from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity levels at the 1 Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction of beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They allow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of selection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive sweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a substantial effect of other modes of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> and of adaptation in particular. More generally, we demonstrate that <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> has had a larger effect in reducing diversity levels and increasing their variance in D. melanogaster than previously appreciated...|$|R
40|$|Two {{major sources}} of stochasticity in the {{dynamics}} of neutral alleles result from resampling of finite populations (genetic drift) and the random genetic background of nearby selected alleles on which the neutral alleles are found (<b>linked</b> <b>selection).</b> There is now good evidence that <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> {{plays an important role}} in shaping polymorphism levels in a number of species. One of the best investigated models of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> is the recurrent full sweep model, in which newly arisen selected alleles fix rapidly. However, the bulk of selected alleles that sweep into the population may not be destined for rapid fixation. Here we develop a general model of recurrent selective sweeps in a coalescent framework, one that generalizes the recurrent full sweep model to the case where selected alleles do not sweep to fixation. We show that in a large population, only the initial rapid increase of a selected allele affects the genealogy at partially linked sites, which under fairly general assumptions are unaffected by the subsequent fate of the selected allele. We also apply the theory to a simple model to investigate the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on levels of neutral diversity, and find that for a given reduction in diversity, the impact of recurrent partial sweeps on the frequency spectrum at neutral sites is determined primarily by the frequencies achieved by the selected alleles. Consequently, recurrent sweeps of selected alleles to low frequencies can have a profound effect on levels of diversity but can leave the frequency spectrum relatively unperturbed. In fact, the limiting coalescent model under a high rate of sweeps to low frequency is identical to the standard neutral model. The general model of selective sweeps we describe goes some way towards providing a more flexible framework to describe genomic patterns of diversity than is currently available. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{adaptive}} <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms for distributed estimation {{problems are}} proposed and studied in this chapter. Specifically, we develop adaptive <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms that can exploit {{the knowledge of}} poor links by selecting a subset of data from neighbor nodes. The first approach consists of exhaustive search-based least mean squares (LMS)/ recursive least squares (RLS) <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> (ES-LMS/ES-RLS) algorithms, whereas the second technique is based on sparsity-inspired LMS/RLS <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> (SI-LMS/SI-RLS) algorithms. With both approaches, distributed processing {{can be divided into}} two steps. The first step is called the adaptation step, in which each node employs LMS or RLS to perform the adaptation through its local information. Following the adaptation step, each node will combine its collected estimates from its neighbors and local estimate, through the proposed adaptive <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms. The proposed algorithms result in improved estimation performance in terms of the mean square error (MSE) associated with the estimates. In contrast to previously reported techniques, a key feature of the proposed algorithms is that the combination step involves only a subset of the data associated with the best performing links.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a simple network {{consisting of a}} source, a half-duplex decode-and-forward relay, and a destination. We propose a new relaying protocol employing adaptive <b>link</b> <b>selection,</b> i. e., in any given time slot, based on the channel state information of the source-relay and the relay-destination link a decision is made whether the source or the relay transmits. In order to avoid data loss at the relay, adaptive <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> requires the relay to be equipped with a buffer such that data can be queued until the relay-destination link is selected for transmission. We study both delay constrained and delay unconstrained transmission. For the delay unconstrained case, we characterize the optimal <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> policy, derive the corresponding throughput, and develop an optimal power allocation scheme. For the delay constrained case, we propose to starve the buffer of the relay by choosing the decision threshold of the <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> policy smaller than the optimal one and derive a corresponding upper bound on the average delay. Furthermore, we propose a modified <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> protocol which avoids buffer overflow by limiting the queue size. Our analytical and numerical results show that buffer-aided relaying with adaptive <b>link</b> <b>selection</b> achieves significant throughput gains compared to conventional relaying protocols with and without buffers where the relay employs a fixed schedule for reception and transmission.

40|$|The {{effects of}} linkageon {{comparative}} estimators of selection Carmen HS Chan 1, 2 *, Steven Hamblin 1, 2 and Mark M Tanaka 1, 2 Background: A major goal of molecular evolution {{is to determine}} how natural selection has shaped {{the evolution of a}} gene. One approach taken by methods such as KA/KS and the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test is to compare the frequency of non-synonymous and synonymous changes. These methods, however, rely on the assumption that a change in frequency of one mutation will not affect changes in frequency of other mutations. Results: We demonstrate that linkage between sites can bias measures of selection based on synonymous and non-synonymous changes. Using forward simulation of a Wright-Fisher process, we show that hitch-hiking of deleterious mutations with advantageous mutations can lead to overestimation of the number of adaptive substitutions, while background selection and clonal interference can distort the site frequency spectrum to obscure the signal for positive selection. We present three diagnostics for detecting these effects of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> and apply them to the human influenza (H 3 N 2) hemagglutinin gene. Conclusion: Various forms of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> have characteristic effects on MK-type statistics. The extent of background selection, hitch-hiking and clonal interference can be evaluated using the diagnostic statistics presented here. The diagnostics {{can also be used to}} determine how well we expect the MK statistics to perform and whether one form of the statistic may be preferable to another...|$|R
40|$|Speciation is a {{continuous}} process during which genetic changes gradually accumulate in the genomes of diverging species. Recent studies have documented highly heterogeneous differentiation landscapes, with distinct regions of elevated differentiation ("differentiation islands") widespread across genomes. However, {{it remains unclear}} which processes drive the evolution of differentiation islands; how the differentiation landscape evolves as speciation advances; and ultimately, how differentiation islands are related to speciation. Here, we addressed these questions based on population genetic analyses of 200 resequenced genomes from 10 populations of four Ficedula flycatcher sister species. We show that a heterogeneous differentiation landscape starts emerging among populations within species, and differentiation islands evolve recurrently in the very same genomic regions among independent lineages. Contrary to expectations from models that interpret differentiation islands as genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation that are shielded from gene flow, patterns of sequence divergence (d(XY) relative node depth) do not support a major role of gene flow {{in the evolution of}} the differentiation landscape in these species. Instead, as predicted by models of <b>linked</b> <b>selection,</b> genome-wide variation in diversity and differentiation can be explained by variation in recombination rate and the density of targets for selection. We thus conclude that the heterogeneous landscape of differentiation in Ficedula flycatchers evolves mainly as the result of background selection and selective sweeps in genomic regions of low recombination. Our results emphasize the necessity of incorporating <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> as a null model to identify genome regions involved in adaptation and speciation...|$|R
40|$|Recombination rate is {{heterogeneous}} {{across the}} genome of various species {{and so are}} genetic diversity and differentiation {{as a consequence of}} <b>linked</b> <b>selection.</b> However, we still lack a clear picture of the underlying mechanisms for regulating recombination. Here we estimated fine-scale population recombination rate based on the patterns of linkage disequilibrium across the genomes of multiple populations of two closely related flycatcher species (Ficedula albicollis and F. hypoleuca). This revealed an overall conservation of the recombination landscape between these species at the scale of 200 kb, but we also identified differences in the local rate of recombination despite their recent divergence (< 1 million years). Genetic diversity and differentiation were associated with recombination rate in a lineage-specific manner, indicating differences in the extent of <b>linked</b> <b>selection</b> between species. We detected 400 - 3, 085 recombination hotspots per population. Location of hotspots was conserved between species, but the intensity of hotspot activity varied between species. Recombination hotspots were primarily associated with CpG islands (CGIs), regardless of whether CGIs were at promoter regions or away from genes. Recombination hotspots were also associated with specific transposable elements (TEs), but this association appears indirect due to shared preferences of the transposition machinery and the recombination machinery for accessible open chromatin regions. Our results suggest that CGIs are a major determinant of the localization of recombination hotspots, and we propose that both the distribution of TEs and fine-scale variation in recombination rate may be associated with the evolution of the epigenetic landscape...|$|R
