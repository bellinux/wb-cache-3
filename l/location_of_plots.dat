They were designed for comparative studies of conventional logging (CNV) and reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques under the ITTO Project PD 12 / 97 Rev. 1 (F), Forest, Science and Sustainability. Bulungan Model Forest. The Malinau concession is located about 30 km to the East of CIFOR’s Bulungan Research Forest in a forest area with elevation between 100 m to 300 m above sea level. The terrain is undulating with slopes ranging from 10 % to 70 %. The mean annual rainfall in the area is 3. 790 mm, with the number of wet months of more than 9 months per year.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the management and}} administration of tribal land in Botswana. The administration processes that are practiced today are neither effective nor suitable for present and future needs. Existing problems relates to registration, archiving and order among the ownership rights. A solution to these problems would promote a system that secures the right of each individuals land. Our aim is to recognize the processes and work methods that are {{the reason for the}} mentioned problems in administration of tribal land. We want to find suggestions for solutions to these problems. To be able to recognize the existing difficulties a thorough literature review has been made as well as interviews with persons with dissimilar positions at three different land boards. Interviews were made at the Mogoditshane Subordinated Land Board, Tlokweng Main Land Board and Mochudi Subordinated Land Board. Questions asked concerned the Tribal Land Act, practice of land allocation and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots,</b> appeals, recordkeeping and compensation. We have also looked into how a pilot study regarding land adjudication directed by the LAPCAS-project, which is a five year running project in cooperation with Swedish Lantmäteriet and Ministry of Lands and Housing in Botswana, can act as one solution to the many problems that exists. Our conclusion is that tribal land tenure in its own meaning is not a problem, the problem concerning tribal land lies in the administration thereof. Some common regulations for all land boards are needed to implement routines and structures that will improve the administration of tribal land. These kinds of routines can be learnt from involvement and close work with the LAPCAS-project. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Historical {{ecological}} {{data are}} valuable for reconstructing early environmental and vege-tation community conditions and examining change to vegetation communities and distur-bance regimes over decadal and longer temporal scales, but {{these data are}} not free from error. We examine the spatial uncertainties associated with 18, 000 vegetation plots in the decades-old Cali-fornia Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) dataset that has been digitized for use in modern ecolog-ical analysis. We examine the relationship be-tween plot location error and basemap year, basemap scale, plot elevation, plot slope, and general plot habitat type. Bivariate plots and {{classification and regression tree}} analysis (CART) confirm that basemap scale and age are the strongest explanation of total error. Total error in spatial location for all plots ranged from 126. 9 m to 462. 3 m; plots drawn on 15 -min (1 : 62, 500 -scale) basemaps had total error ranging from 126 m to 199. 7 m, and plots drawn on coarser-scale basemaps (1 : 125, 000 -scale) had total errors ranging from 241 m to 461. 2 m. Relocation of individual VTM plots is considerably easier for plots originally marked on 1 : 62, 500 -scale maps produced after 1904, and more difficult for plots originally marked on 1 : 125, 000 -scale maps pro-duced before 1898. Biogeographical analyses that rely less on relocating individual plots, such as environmental niche modeling or multivariate analyses can alleviate some of these concerns, but all researchers using these kinds of data need to consider errors in spatial <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots.</b> The paper also discusses ways in which the differing spatial error might be reported and visualized by those using the dataset, and how the data might be used in modern environmental niche models...|$|E

40|$|With the {{widespread}} availability of digital elevation models (DEM) and regional surveys of soils, topographic and physiographic features of landscapes {{are now more}} easily characterized. Within southwestern Oregon 391 field plots were registered within a geographic information system (GIS) to digitized topographic and soils coverages and properties extracted from the digital coverages compared with those estimated in the field. The initial comparison showed major differences in estimates of aspect, slope, and maximum available soil water content (theta), although the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> showed general agreement with elevations recorded on the maps. To extrapolate climatic data and interpret hydrologic responses accurately, an automated search procedure was developed whereby the initial location of each plot was, if necessary, shifted within specified bounds to give closer agreement with field estimates of aspect, slope, and theta. Specifically, the search routine sequentially identifies the nearest 100 m-resolution cell within a search radius of 3 or 5 cells in which differences are within +- 22. 5 degree of aspect, +- 20 % of slope, and in closest agreement with field estimates of theta. The search procedure resulted in improved agreement with field estimates: r 2 s = 0. 82 for aspect, 0. 56 for slope, 0. 54 for theta. To obtain these improvements required that the initial plot locations be shifted, on the average, 289 m within the 3 -pixel search radius, and 435 m within the 5 pixel radius. With the terrain analysis procedures developed in this paper, {{it is possible to}} overcome many problems associated with registering the precise location of field plots upon digitized topographic and soil maps. The procedure is particularly appropriate in situations where the environmental regimes associated with a specified field location are to be extrapolated across landscapes. The approach also permits a wealth of historical survey plot data to be incorporated into a GIS format and to be spatially extendedCoops "Comparison of topographic and physiographic properties measured on the ground with those derived from digital elevation models.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the effect that plot locational errors, termed plot co-registration errors, have on the strength of regression between LiDAR canopy metrics and the measured total standing volume (TSV) of plots in a Pinus radiata forest. Methods: A 737 hectare plantation of mature Pinus radiata located in Northern Hawkes Bay was selected for the study. This forest had been measured in a pre-harvest inventory and had aerial LiDAR assessment. The <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>plots</b> was verified using a survey-grade GPS. Least square linear regression models were developed to predict TSV from LiDAR canopy metrics for a sample of 204 plots. The regression strength, accuracy and bias was compared for models developed using either the actual (verified) or the incorrect (intended) locations for these plots. The change to the LiDAR canopy metrics after the plot co-registration errors was also established. Results: The plot co-registration error in the sample ranged from 0. 7 m to 70. 3 m, with an average linear spatial error of 10. 6 m. The plot co-registration errors substantially reduced the strength of regression between LiDAR canopy metrics and TSV, as the model developed from the actual plot locations had an R 2 of 44 %, while the model developed from the incorrect plot locations had an R 2 of 19 %. The greatest reductions in model strength occurred when there was less than a 60 % overlap between the plots defined by correct and incorrect locations. Higher plot co-registration errors also caused significant changes to the height and density LiDAR canopy metrics that were used in the regression models. The lower percentile elevation LiDAR metrics were more sensitive to plot co- registration errors, compared to higher percentile metrics. Conclusion: Plot co-registration errors have a significant effect on the strength of regressions formed between TSV and LiDAR canopy metrics. This indicates that accurate measurements of plot locations are necessary to fully utilise LiDAR for inventory purposes in forests of Pinus radiata...|$|E
