50|$|On 30 July 1981, the Dudelange Radio Tower {{was totally}} {{destroyed}} after {{a collision with}} a Belgian military aircraft, and RTL Télé Luxembourg was off the air for a few hours, until the back-up systems were up and running. The French president, François Mitterrand in person authorised TDF to use the former VHF 819 line transmitters of TF1 in Lorraine to relay RTL Télé Luxembourg in colour until the rebuilding of the tower in Dudelange. However, the 819 <b>line</b> <b>transmitter</b> did not correctly show the programmes. The transmitter at Dudelange was rebuilt in 1983, replaced by an automatic pylon.|$|E

The programming consisted of films, American serials, gameshows, and chatshows using the same presenters gave Télé-Luxembourg star status in Luxembourg, the East of France and Belgium, reinforced by their move to colour in 1972 : as well as the VHF 819 <b>line</b> <b>transmitter</b> (channel E-07) reconverting to 625 lines SECAM, two new UHF transmitters were launched at the Dudelange Radio Tower, one for channel 21 in SECAM for France, one on channel 27 on PAL for Belgium. Every day, {{at the start of the}} channel, the heraldic lion of Luxembourg appeared on the circles symbolising the radio waves and the name Télé-Luxembourg, followed by an image of the Dudelange transmitter, with the voice of Jacques Harvey announcing : [...] "Here is Télé-Luxembourg, channels 7, 21 and 27, Dudelange transmitter, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.". The game shows soon followed, with Coffre-fort presented by Michèle Etzel, under the slogan Vivement ce soir sur Télé-Luxembourg, and advertising based on car stickers which viewers were encouraged to place in their cars, with these cars then being filmed and broadcast on air.|$|E

50|$|The first {{television}} {{network in the}} United Kingdom was operated by the BBC. On 2 November 1936 the BBC opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from a 405 <b>lines</b> <b>transmitter</b> at Alexandra Palace. The BBC remained dominant until eventually on 22 September 1955, commercial broadcasting was established {{in order to create}} a second television network. Rather than creating a single network with local stations owned and operated by a single company (as is the case with the BBC), each local area had a separate television station that was independently owned and operated, although most of these stations shared a number of programmes, particularly during peak evening viewing hours. These stations formed the ITV network.|$|R
50|$|Television {{broadcasts}} {{spread to}} the North West relatively late - the first monochrome 405 <b>line</b> television <b>transmitter</b> covering the area (from Holme Moss) did not open until 1951. Commercial TV began in May 1956 and the signals were broadcast from Winter Hill.|$|R

40|$|Black powder {{is usually}} found in natural gas {{transmission}} and distribution systems throughout the world. The Hellenic gas transmission system was constantly subjected to large volumes of black powder, mainly pipeline corrosion product, originated upstream and carried in the gas flow. Due to amorphous nature of this powder, particles was breaking up to sub-micron sizes, flowed through filtration devices, agglomerated to larger sizes downstream and deposited in metering lines, instruments, analysers etc. The impact of black powder on gas measurement equipment is examined at this case study. Metering instruments may deviate beyond acceptable tolerance due to powder contamination. Cleaning works of metering runs, impulse <b>lines,</b> <b>transmitters</b> and gas analysers are presented together with photographs of the operations. Maintenance best practices are described...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{discussions are}} {{presented}} {{of the measures}} taken on the Communications Technology Satellite (CTS or Hermes) which provide protection against the effects of spacecraft charging. These measures include: a comprehensive grounding philosophy and implementation; provision of command and data <b>line</b> <b>transmitters</b> and receivers for transient noise immunity; and a fairly restrictive EMI specification. Ground tests were made on materials {{and the impact of}} these tests on the CTS spacecraft is described. Hermes, launched on 17 January 1976 on a 2914 Delta vehicle, has successfully completed 10 months of operations. Anomalies observed are being assessed in relation to spacecraft charging, but no definite correlations have yet been established. A list of conclusions with regard to the CTS experience is given and recommendations for future spacecraft are also listed...|$|R

30|$|First we {{analyzed}} a one-dimensional model with fixed geometry where a single RS resides on the <b>line</b> between the <b>transmitter</b> and the receiver. This scenario {{can be understood}} as the projection of the RS position onto the <b>line</b> between the <b>transmitter</b> and the receiver. This minimizes the physical lengths of the access link and the relaying link, and the results provide an upper bound for the power gain of relaying. It is found that in a fading channel there is a significant potential for relaying gain, with the highest probability of gain when the relay node is half-way between the source and destination.|$|R
5000|$|By 1941 the [...] "Fernsehsender Paris" [...] station {{transmitted}} from the Eiffel Tower in Paris using the German 441 lines {{system and its}} main technical characteristics. Television programs were mainly for wounded soldiers of the Wehrmacht occupation troops who recovered in the Greater Paris Area hospitals, but they also included French-language shows. Broadcasts were monitored in the United Kingdom during the Second World War to gather intelligence information from occupied France. Because the 819 lines standard had been adopted in 1948 for the national network, {{it was due to}} cease on January 1, 1958. However, after a long elections coverage night, most of the equipment was destroyed by fire on January 3, 1956. It was decided to indemnify the 3,000 owners of remaining 441 lines sets and to entitle them to reduced rates for their new 819 lines receivers. Since July 1952 the 441 <b>lines</b> <b>transmitter</b> was no longer broadcasting separate programs, but simply picked up the national network's picture through an 819-441 lines [...] "optical converter" [...] (a 441 lines camera, slightly out of focus, pointed at an 819 lines monitor equipped with an oval spotlight cathode ray tube).|$|R

50|$|The idle, no {{data state}} is high-voltage, or powered. This is a {{historic}} legacy from telegraphy, in which the line is held high {{to show that the}} <b>line</b> and <b>transmitter</b> are not damaged. Each character is framed as a logic low start bit, data bits, possibly a parity bit, and one or more stop bits. In most applications the least significant data bit (the one on the left in this diagram) is transmitted first, but there are exceptions (such as the IBM 2741 printing terminal).|$|R
5000|$|Prior to Hurricane Katrina making {{landfall}} in late August 2005, {{general manager}} Chuck Miller called extra staff {{in to the}} station to help, dropped the regular program format, played short burst music and shared {{as much information as}} possible about traffic, evacuation procedures, and anything else that would be helpful to the 86,000+ people that tuned in each week. The building had a back-up generator with buried transmission <b>lines.</b> The <b>transmitter</b> site had generator power. Staff prepared to sleep away from windows. Computers and other valuable items were brought into interior rooms.|$|R
50|$|Passive (multistatic) radar, {{bistatic}} {{radar and}} especially multistatic radar systems detect some stealth aircraft better than conventional monostatic radars, since first-generation stealth technology (such as the F-117) reflects energy {{away from the}} <b>transmitter's</b> <b>line</b> of sight, effectively increasing the radar cross section (RCS) in other directions, which the passive radars monitor.|$|R
50|$|Transmitters {{feeding a}} {{balanced}} transmission line {{will need a}} balun. This transforms the single ended output of the transmitter to a higher impedance balanced output. High power short wave transmission systems typically use 300 ohm balanced <b>lines</b> between the <b>transmitter</b> and antenna. Amateurs often use 300-450 ohm balanced antenna feeders.|$|R

5000|$|Collins {{remained}} an important manufacturer of AM and FM broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the 1960s and 1970s.

50|$|Although a {{resonant}} antenna has {{a purely}} resistive feed-point impedance {{at a particular}} frequency, many (if not most) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies. The frequency range or bandwidth over which an antenna functions well can be very wide (as in a log-periodic antenna) or narrow (in a resonant antenna); outside this range the antenna impedance becomes a poor match to the transmission <b>line</b> and <b>transmitter</b> (or receiver). Also {{in the case of}} the Yagi-Uda and other end-fire arrays, use of the antenna well away from its design frequency affects its radiation pattern, reducing its directive gain; the usable bandwidth is then limited regardless of impedance matching.|$|R
50|$|Although {{radio waves}} {{generally}} travel {{in a straight}} line, fog and even humidity can cause some of the signal in certain frequencies to scatter or bend before reaching the receiver. This means that objects that are clear {{of the line of}} sight path will still potentially block parts of the signal. To maximize signal strength, one needs to minimize the effect of obstruction loss by removing obstacles from both the direct radio frequency line of sight (RF LoS) line and also the area around it within the primary Fresnel Zone. The strongest signals are on the direct <b>line</b> between <b>transmitter</b> and receiver and always lie in the first Fresnel zone.|$|R
50|$|If {{the loss}} of power is very low in the <b>line</b> {{carrying}} the <b>transmitter's</b> signal into the antenna, a tuner at the transmitter end can produce a worthwhile degree of matching and tuning for the antenna and feedline network as a whole. With lossy feedlines, maximum power transfer only occurs if matching is done {{at both ends of}} the line.|$|R
