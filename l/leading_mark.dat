6000|$|How {{could the}} <b>leading</b> <b>mark</b> of {{progress}} made in Mr. Gladstone’s age be more truly hit, how defined with more pith and pregnancy? How could the illumination {{of his own}} vigorous mind in forty years of life and thought be better demonstrated? It would even be no bad thing if those who are furthest removed from Mr. Gladstone’s opinions either in religion or politics could lay this far-reaching dictum of his to heart. By many men in all schools his lesson is sorely needed. Shrill was the clamour. Dr. Pusey, in Mr. Gladstone’s own phrase, was “rabid.” He justified his anger by reputed facts, which proved to be no facts at all, but the anger did not die with the fable. Even Phillimore was disquieted. “It has cut very deep indeed,” he said. Mr. Gladstone, confident of his ground, was not dismayed. “The movement against Dr. Temple is like a peculiar cheer we sometimes hear in the House of Commons, vehement but thin.” ...|$|E

50|$|The prime {{method of}} coping with {{currents}} is by taking backsights on the land when leaving {{so as to be}} able to estimate the current and also the leeway (the angle the boat is drifting off the wind). On many islands, <b>leading</b> <b>marks</b> are set up to aid in this. The course is then adjusted to suit the conditions. There can be daily fluctuations in current but these are generally random and do not accumulate. Expert navigators can also detect currents from the shape of the waves, if the current is confined to the top layers of the water.|$|R
