25|$|In the forts along Hadrian’s Wall, no more Roman coins {{have been}} found in the {{excavation}} layers dating to after 407. Following the withdrawal of the Britannic field army between 407 and 410 by the usurper Constantine III the garrisons on the Wall probably lost troops as well. But it is unlikely that many soldiers from the north followed Constantine, as they were mostly born there and cultivated their own farms at their cantonment sites with their families. According to the Notitia Dignitatum, <b>last</b> <b>amended</b> in 420, the Wall appears to have been still guarded by regular limitanei until at least the early 5th century. They were at that time under the command of a dux (“duke”) who probably had significant military assets. Before leaving Britain, Magnus Maximus probably appointed a certain Coelius as the supreme commander on the northern border; he was the last to use the title Dux Britanniarum ("Duke of Britannia") introduced by the Romans. John Morris suspects that Coel Hen who, according to a Welsh tradition, was the ancestor of all Celto-British kings of the north, was in fact this Coelius. Archaeological finds prove that some forts along the Wall were still inhabited until {{the first half of the}} 5th century by the descendants of the Roman soldiers. Birdoswald was even continuously inhabited until the Early Middle Ages. In the course of time, most of them became fortified villages (oppida) or were used as quarries; a few milecastles were inter alia used as cattle pens. The southeast continued to be defended by the troops of the dux in Eburacum against attacks by the Picts and Scots. However, the administrative districts of the late Roman provinces in the south quickly became small independent kingdoms by inheritance, which is why the dux soon ceased to receive any material or financial contributions from there. In the early fifth century Eburacum became the metropolis of the Celto-British kingdom of Ebrauc. The dux and his followers were now also rulers of an independent statelet. The consequence of this was that he finally left the southeast to itself and intruders were only fought when they threatened his own territory.|$|E

40|$|Audit Committees have an {{important}} role in the governance framework of entities by providing an independent source of assurance and advice to Chief Executives/Boards. A distinguishing feature of an Audit Committee within an entity’s governance framework is its independence and objectivity, as Audit Committees do not undertake management responsibilities and are not a substitute for entity management controls and accountabilities. The aim of the Guide is to provide guidance on the operation of the Audit Committees of public sector entities operating under both the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The Guide updates and replaces the Australian National Audit Office’s (ANAO) 2005 Public Sector Audit Committees Better Practice Guide. The Guide is intended as a reference document for Chief Executives, Boards, members of Audit Committees and senior managers with responsibility for Audit Committee activities, and complements the ANAO’s Better Practice Guide Public Sector Internal Audit issued in September 2007. The ANAO has also supplied a number of checklists and templates which supplement this better practice guide.  These can be used and modified to suit individual circumstances. They are contained in the zip file which is attached below.

The Clean Air Act, first passed in 1963, was <b>last</b> reauthorized and <b>amended</b> in 1990, when new programs were created and changes were made {{to the ways in which}} air pollution is controlled. The 1990 amendments included hundreds of requirements for EPA, as well as other parties, to take steps that will ultimately reduce air pollution. The amendments also established deadlines for many of these requirements. Since the 1990 amendments, various actions have been proposed to either amend the Clean Air Act or implement its provisions in new ways. GAO was asked to report on the current status of EPA's implementation of requirements under Titles I, III, and IV of the 1990 amendments.

40|$|Throughout 1984, and {{particularly}} in the past six or seven months, it has become increasingly clear that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has been accelerating its research and regulatory efforts in the area of hazardous air pollutants under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act. The flurry of agency activity has included statements before congressional committees and several regulatory actions. This work is quickly approaching a regulatory crisis. Congress, moreover, undoubtedly will address Section 112 issues as part of any reauthorization of the Air Act. As evidence of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s continuing concern, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mi.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, introduced a bill in the closing week of the <b>last</b> Congress to <b>amend</b> Section 112 by providing EPA with increased regulary flexibility. The intense regulatory efforts and legislative interests are symptoms of an underlying crisis faced by EPA due to the current language in Section 112. The section requires the Administrator to list as hazardous those pollutants which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible, illness. The listing of a pollutant triggers the Administrator 2 ̆ 7 s responsibility to develop emission standards that will protect public health with an amply margin of safety. The crisis faced by the agency is being produced by a forced confluence of two regulatory policies developed in isolation from each other and designed separately {{in such a way that}} they do not produce reasonable results when they are merely joined together. These regulatory policies derive from the air dispersion modeling efforts in the air program and the hazard evaluation techniques for cancer in the water and pesticide regulatory areas...|$|R

C. A. § 12 - 3 - 1003 was <b>amended</b> <b>last</b> year to authorize counties to purchase used or secondhand goods, equipment, materials, supplies, or commodities from private individuals and entities without public advertisement and competitive bidding as long as the county documents the general range of value of the item through a listing in a nationally-recognized publication, or through an appraisal by a licensed appraiser. The price paid must be within 10 % of the documented range. From Governmental Entities – Under T. C. A. § 12 - 3 - 1005, counties are authorized to purchase, trade, or receive as a gift any used or surplus personal property from another governmental entity without public advertisement and competitive bidding, upon approval of the governing bodies of each governmental entity involved in the transaction. Governmental entities include counties, cities, metropolitan governments, state government, federal government, and any instrumentality of the foregoing. (This law also authorizes counties to establish procedures for disposing of their surplus personal property to another governmental entity by sale, gift, trade, or barter upon any terms and conditions the governing body may authorize, without regard to any other laws governing the disposition of surplus property.) We are often asked whether a county may obtain used goods or equipment without going through a competitive bidding process. The answer is yes. The procedures that must be followed depend on whether the property is being obtained from a private individual or entity, or from another governmental entity.

The Angel of {{this story}} is the Angel of Art, not the Angel that one must be irreverent to touch--neither the Angel of {{religious}} feeling nor the Angel of popular belief. The last we all know. She is alone among the angelic hosts in being distinctly feminine: she wears a robe of immaculate, unmitigated white with sleeves, is fair, with long golden tresses, and has eyes of the blue of Heaven. Just a pure woman she is, pure maiden or pure matron, in her robe de nuit, and with wings attached to her shoulder blades. Her callings are domestic and sympathetic, she watches over a cradle or assists a sister soul heavenward. Often she bears a palm leaf, but one {{would not be surprised}} if one met her carrying a warming-pan softly to some poor chilly sinner. She it was who came down in a bevy to Marguerite in prison, in the <b>amended</b> <b>last</b> scene in Faust at the Lyceum, and the interesting and improving little children that are to die young, have visions of such angels in the novels of Mrs Henry Wood. This white womanliness with her indescribable charm of lavender-like holiness, her aroma of clean, methodical lives, is, it would seem after all, a purely Teutonic invention. Latin thought knows her not; the old masters have none of her. She is of a piece with that gentle innocent ladylike school of art whereof the greatest triumph is [...] "a lump in one's throat," [...] and where wit and passion, scorn and pomp, have no place. The white angel was made in Germany, in the land of blonde women and the domestic sentiments. She comes to us cool and worshipful, pure and tranquil, as silently soothing as the breadth and calmness of the starlit sky, which also is so unspeakably dear to the Teutonic soul.... We do her reverence. And to the angels of the Hebrews, those spirits of power and mystery, to Raphael, Zadkiel, and Michael, of whom only Watts has caught the shadow, of whom only Blake has seen the splendour, to them too, do we do reverence.|$|R
