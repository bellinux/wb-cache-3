40|$|We {{present a}} new hybrid {{approach}} to performance management, combining disparate strengths of Reinforcment Learning (RL) with model-based (e. g. queuing-theoretic) approaches. Our method trains nonlinear function approximators using offline RL on data collected while a model-based policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid potentially {{poor performance in}} <b>live</b> <b>online</b> <b>training,</b> while function approximation allows generalization across both states and actions, so {{that the need for}} exploratory actions may be greatly reduced. Our results show that, in a prototype resource allocation scenario among multiple web applications, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial queuing model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Reinforcement Learning (RL) {{provides}} a promising {{new approach to}} systems performance management that differs radically from standard queuing-theoretic approaches making use of explicit system performance models. In principle, RL can automatically learn high-quality management policies without an explicit performance model or traffic model, and {{with little or no}} built-in system specific knowledge. In our original work [1], [2], [3] we showed the feasibility of using online RL to learn resource valuation estimates (in lookup table form) which {{can be used to make}} high-quality server allocation decisions in a multi-application prototype Data Center scenario. The present work shows how to combine the strengths of both RL and queuing models in a hybrid approach, in which RL trains offline on data collected while a queuing model policy controls the system. By training offline we avoid suffering potentially poor performance in <b>live</b> <b>online</b> <b>training.</b> We also now use RL to train nonlinear function approximators (e. g. multi-layer perceptrons) instead of lookup tables; this enables scaling to substantially larger state spaces. Our results now show that, in both open-loop and closed-loop traffic, hybrid RL training can achieve significant performance improvements over a variety of initial model-based policies. We also find that, as expected, RL can deal effectively with both transients and switching delays, which lie outside the scope of traditional steady-state queuing theory. I...|$|E

40|$|This mixed methods {{research}} study evaluated {{the use of}} technology-based action plans {{as a way to}} help improve compliance with the learning objectives of an <b>online</b> <b>training</b> event. It explored how the action planning strategy impacted subjects in a treatment group and compared them to subjects in a control group who did not get the action plan. The study revealed that the action planning process supported the compliance of the learning objectives and provided insights into how the action planning process contributes to this compliance. As a result, this study recommends the use of technology-based action plans, as opposed to paper-based actions plans, as a simple and effective strategy to support the application and evaluation of <b>training,</b> specifically for <b>online</b> <b>live</b> <b>training</b> events. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} a <b>live</b> and <b>online</b> <b>training</b> program for first year pharmacy students in implementing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) principles (Reflect, Plan, Act, and Evaluate), writing SMART learning objectives, and documenting learning activities prior to and during a hospital introductory professional practice experience. Design: Cohort Study. Setting: Introductory professional practice experience. Participants: First year (PY 1) students at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. Intervention: <b>Live</b> <b>training</b> or <b>online</b> <b>training</b> to introduce the concept of Continuing Professional Development in practice. Main Outcomes: Implementation of CPD principles through 1) completed pre-rotation education action plans with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) learning objectives; and 2) completed learning activity worksheets post-rotation indicating stimuli for learning, resources used and accomplished learning. objectives; and 3) documented suggestions and content feedback for future lectures and pharmaceutical care lab experiences. Results: Out of the whole cohort (N= 154), 14 (87. 5 %) live (in person) trainees and 122 (88 %) online trainees submitted an education action plan. Objectives were scored using a rubric on a scale of 1 - 5. A rating of 5 means “satisfactory”, 3 means “work in progress” and 1 means “unacceptable”. There were significant differences between the mean live trainee scores and the mean online trainee scores for the following respective section comparisons: Specific 4. 7 versus 3. 29 (p< 0. 001); Measurable 3. 9 versus 2. 05 (p< 0. 001); number of objectives 3. 6 versus 4. 6 (p< 0. 001); and average grade 92. 9 versus 77. 7 (p< 0. 001). Of the 396 learning activity worksheets reviewed, 75 % selected discussion with peers and/or health providers as a stimulus for learning. Students reported spending an average of 50. 2 hours completing the learning objectives. All of the pre-stated objectives were fulfilled completely or partially. Conclusion: Live trainees performed significantly better than online trainees in writing SMART learning objectives. With focused training, students are more capable of implementing principles of CPD...|$|R

40|$|A {{proliferation}} of retail <b>online</b> <b>training</b> materials exists, but often {{the person in}} charge of choosing the most appropriate <b>online</b> <b>training</b> materials is not versed in best practices associated with <b>online</b> <b>training.</b> Additionally, the person must consider {{the context of the}} training situation when choosing a training solution. To assist this decision-making process an evaluation instrument was developed. The instrument was designed to help decision-makers 1) assess multiple <b>online</b> <b>training</b> programs against known best practices, and 2) consider context specific training needs via a weighting process. Instrument testing across multiple <b>online</b> <b>training</b> programs was performed, and weighted and unweighted results were examined to determine the impact of contextualized weighting. Additionally, evaluation data from the new instrument were compared to data from an existing <b>online</b> <b>training</b> evaluation instrument. Results indicated the new instrument allowed for consistent rankings by raters across multiple programs, and when the new weighting process was applied small differences were magnified making them more noticeable in overall rating scores. Thus the new weighted instrument was effective in 1) assessing multiple <b>online</b> <b>training</b> programs, and 2) providing reviewers clearer context-specific rating data on which they could make purchasing decisions...|$|R

Learning, and motivation and attitudes were measured for instructional effectiveness. Instructional time and cost/benefit calculations were used as measures of efficiencies. Study 2 investigated multimedia benefits when included in <b>online</b> <b>training.</b> ^ In Study 1, Jail Management trainees {{in the state of}} Nebraska were randomly assigned to receive either <b>online</b> or classroom <b>training.</b> Results indicated, as predicted, that <b>online</b> <b>training</b> is as effective an instructional method as classroom training, and more efficient than classroom. No meaningful learning differences occurred between the 2 groups, but <b>online</b> <b>training</b> was completed in almost half the time of classroom instruction and at a lesser cost. The classroom group felt more motivated and positive toward their instruction than the online group. This result was specifically attributed to women in the online group. Trainees stated the biggest disadvantage of <b>online</b> <b>training</b> was missing classroom interaction, but this was countered by the convenience and time efficiency of <b>online</b> <b>training.</b> Training implications and recommendations are discussed. ^ Study 2, a separate parallel study, experimentally examined learning, instructional time, and motivation and attitude advantages of multimedia included in Jail Management <b>online</b> <b>training</b> courses. The multimedia study results indicated there were no differences in UNL student participants 2 ̆ 7 test scores, whether they received training with text only, audio, or video. Motivation, attitudes and depth of learning also did not differ between the groups, but the text only group completed the training course in less time than the other 2 groups. This did not support the prediction that video would enhance learning, motivation and attitude, but did support the prediction that text only would be the most efficient condition. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Training of {{postgraduate}} {{students has}} traditionally been done in person in a hospital setting with hands-on training with each faculty member imparting knowledge to 2 to 4 students per year. Supplementing their practical education with online instruction could make {{a significant difference in}} standardizing pediatric cardiology education in India. Objective: To present the rationale, methods and survey results of a live e-Teaching methodology implemented for Pediatric cardiology trainees in association with the National Board of Examinations, India. Materials and Methods: Between March 2010 and March 2014, 310 e-classes were conducted in the Pediatric cardiac sciences by 24 e-teachers. Content of the e-Learning program was based on a 2 -year pediatric cardiology curriculum and included twice-weekly <b>live</b> <b>online</b> video <b>training</b> sessions, a library of recorded sessions and online test quizzes for the students. A total of 231 students accessed the program at various times over the 4 -year period. Results: In our study, requests for access to the e-lectures increased from 10 /year the first year to 100 /year by the fourth year with feedback surveys conveying a high satisfaction level from the students and a high need for this knowledge. The advantages of virtual live e-Learning included the fact that one teacher can teach multiple students in multiple geographic locations at the same time, obviating the issue of quality teacher shortage and the same content can be disseminated to all students undergoing specialist training so there is a national consensus on diagnostic and management approach among all trainees. Additionally, the e-classes can be recorded and replayed so they can be viewed repeatedly by the same group or new trainees. Conclusion: This is the first sustained use of e-Teaching in a medical super-specialty in India. We believe that e-Teaching is an innovative solution that can be applied, not just to Pediatric Cardiology as we have done, but to all branches of specialist and super-specialist medical training in India and globally...|$|R
