40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies on {{the effect}} of <b>laminate</b> {{configuration}} on the properties of glass fiber-reinforced plastics (GFRPs) are carried out. The GFRP-laminated composites are prepared by a hand lay-up technique. Five types of <b>laminate</b> configurations are prepared, and the correlation between different <b>laminate</b> configurations and the end physical and flexural properties are analyzed. In this present study, the effect of water absorption on the flexural properties of GFRP composites is examined. As a result, it is found that the properties of GFRPs are governed by the <b>laminate</b> configurations of the <b>laminate</b> system, which further influence the properties of GFRPs after the water absorption test.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Laminated</b> {{composite}} material have found extensive application in the mechanical, aerospace, marine, automotive industry {{due to their}} high fatigue life and high strength to weight ratio.

Effects of two assemble patterns(inner to inner and outer to outer) on physical and mechanical properties of 2 -ply bamboo <b>laminated</b> lumber from carbonized and bleached bamboo strips were investigated.

25|$|Many {{pigments}} and dyes absorb UV {{and change}} colour, so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent bulbs, two common sources of UV radiation. Window glass absorbs some harmful UV, but valuable artifacts need extra shielding. Many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles, for example. Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels, they need extra protection from UV. Various forms of picture framing glass, including acrylics (plexiglass), <b>laminates,</b> and coatings, offer {{different degrees of}} UV (and visible light) protection.|$|E
25|$|The Mackenzie River delta was a {{focus of}} ground and air surveys as early as 1957, and geologists drew {{comparisons}} then to the Mississippi and Niger Deltas, speculating that the Mackenzie could prove as prolific. For millions of years sediments had been pouring out of {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie, creating tremendous banks of sand and shale – <b>laminates</b> of sedimentary rock warped into promising geological structures. Drilling began in the Mackenzie Delta-Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula in 1962, and accelerated during the early 1970s. The mouth of the Mackenzie River was not a Prudhoe Bay, but it did contain large gas fields.|$|E
25|$|He {{also worked}} {{on the design of}} a {{propeller}} with small jet engines on the end of its blades, something he patented in 1911, and which earned him a research studentship from the university in the autumn of 1908. At the time, contemporary propeller designs were not advanced enough to actually put Wittgenstein’s ideas into practice, and it would be years before a blade design that could support Wittgenstein’s innovative design was created. Wittgenstein’s design required air and gas to be forced along the propeller arms to combustion chambers on the end of each blade, where it was then compressed by the centrifugal force exerted by the revolving arms and ignited. Propellers of the time were typically wood, whereas modern blades are made from pressed steel <b>laminates</b> as separate halves, which are then welded together. This gives the blade a hollow interior, and therefore creates an ideal pathway for the air and gas.|$|E

500|$|Gibraltar's {{guns were}} reorganised and {{upgraded}} from 1856. Many of the 24-pounder guns were replaced with 32-pounders and the retired batteries were equipped with 68-pounders. A {{wide variety of}} old guns was still in use, including iron-cast 6-, 12- and 18-pounder, which complicated the supply and maintenance of the batteries. At its peak, the fortress had 681 guns in 110 batteries and positions.

However, only a decade later the rapid introduction of rifled artillery firing explosive shells was already beginning to make the fortifications obsolete. As a result of recommendations by Colonel William Jervois, the coastal batteries were upgraded with armoured casemates made from expensively constructed iron <b>laminates.</b> He also proposed to build a sea fort in the bay, along the lines of Britain's Palmerston Forts, though this was never carried out.|$|E
