5|$|In {{the early}} morning of April 18, 1906, a large {{earthquake}} with an epicenter {{near the city of}} San Francisco hit the region. Immediate casualty estimates by the U.S. Army's relief operations were 498 deaths in San Francisco, 64 deaths in Santa Rosa, and 102 in or near San Jose, for a total of about 700. More recent studies estimate the total death count to be over 3,000, with over 28,000 buildings destroyed. Rebuilding efforts began immediately. Amadeo Peter Giannini, owner of the Bank of Italy (now known as the Bank of America), had managed to retrieve the money from his bank's vaults before fires broke out through the city and was the only bank with <b>liquid</b> <b>funds</b> readily available and was instrumental in loaning out funds for rebuilding efforts. Congress immediately approved plans for a reservoir in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, a plan they had denied a few years earlier, which now provides drinking water for 2.4 million people in the Bay Area. By 1915, the city had been sufficiently rebuilt and advertised itself to the world during the Panama Pacific Exposition that year, although the effects of the quake hastened the loss of the region's dominant status in California to the Los Angeles metropolitan area.|$|E

50|$|A {{borrower}} that cannot refinance {{their existing}} debt {{and does not}} have sufficient funds on hand to pay their lenders may have a liquidity problem.

50|$|Banks can {{generally}} maintain as much liquidity {{as desired}} because bank deposits are insured by governments in most developed countries. A lack of liquidity can be remedied by raising deposit rates and effectively marketing deposit products. However, an important {{measure of a}} bank's value and success {{is the cost of}} liquidity. A bank can attract significant <b>liquid</b> <b>funds.</b> Lower costs generate stronger profits, more stability, and more confidence among depositors, investors, and regulators.|$|E
50|$|The sale of Case Shiller Weiss, Inc. to Fiserv caused Weiss {{to observe}} {{the extent to which}} smaller assets are worth less, for each dollar they earn, than larger more liquid assets; {{therefore}} liquid assets generate lower income per dollar invested. Seeing how much the owners of the smaller assets could benefit from higher prices if some of their cash flows were aggregated into a larger more <b>liquid</b> <b>fund,</b> Weiss patented Common Index Securities - US patents 7155468 and 7716106 - that allows for the creation of financing structures that generate liquid and therefore value enhanced investments by aggregating cash flows from these smaller assets. This solution applies to any asset class whose value or earnings can be reliably indexed.|$|R

Investment may also not be investment in fixed capital (see above).|$|E
50|$|Balloon {{payments}} {{introduce a}} certain amount of risk for the borrower and the lender. In many cases, the intention of the borrower is to refinance the amount of the balloon payment at the final maturity date. Refinancing risk exists at this point, since it is possible {{that at the time of}} payment, the borrower will not be able to refinance the loan; the borrower faces the risk of having insufficient <b>liquid</b> <b>funds,</b> and the lender faces the risk that the payment may be delayed.|$|E

50|$|Another {{trend that}} may see more action within {{the near future}} as venture capital funds {{continue}} to be scarce is {{an increasing number of}} strategic partnerships between firms that are based not on exchange of funds, but rather on exchange of technologies or process information. These types of partnerships, also known as corporate in-kind investments, may become increasingly common as <b>liquid</b> <b>funds</b> become less available but technologies that have been developed are readily shareable. One specific example of this sort of information exchange is a partnership between a large, well-established company and a small, developing company who have complementary technologies or processes. Such 'David and Goliath' partnerships are already starting to emerge outside of the healthcare industry and will likely emerge within healthcare soon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{denouement}} for Ponzi {{began in}} late July, when McMasters found several highly incriminating documents that indicated Ponzi was merely [...] "robbing Peter to pay Paul." [...] He {{went to his}} former employer with this information. Grozier offered him $5,000 for his story. On August 2, 1920, McMasters wrote an article for the Post declaring Ponzi hopelessly insolvent. The article claimed that while Ponzi claimed $7 million in <b>liquid</b> <b>funds,</b> he was actually at least $2 million in debt. With interest factored in, McMasters wrote, Ponzi was as much as $4.5 million in the red. The story touched off a massive run, and Ponzi paid off in one day. He then sped up {{plans to build a}} massive conglomerate that would engage in banking and import/export operations.|$|E

Also, the funds of the Unit Trust of India and open-ended equity oriented funds were kept out of the tax net [...] The taxation rate for mutual funds was originally 12.5% but was increased to 20% for dividends distributed to entities other than individuals with effect from 9 July 2004.

40|$|After Lehman's {{collapse}} in 2008, investors ran from risky money market funds. In 27 funds, outflows overwhelmed cash inflows, thus forcing asset sales. These funds sold their safest and most <b>liquid</b> holdings. <b>Funds</b> were thus left with riskier and longer maturity assets. Over the subsequent quarter, however, the hard-hit funds reduced risk {{more than other}} funds. In contrast, money funds hit by idiosyncratic liquidity shocks before Lehman did not alter portfolio risk. The result suggests that moral hazard concerns with the Treasury Guarantee of investor claims did not increase risk taking. Funds that benefited most from the government bailout reduced risk.

50|$|Savings {{and loans}} {{were given a}} certain amount of {{preferential}} treatment by the Federal Reserve inasmuch as they were given the ability to pay higher interest rates on savings deposits compared to a regular commercial bank. This was known as Regulation Q (The Interest Rate Adjustment Act of 1966) and gave the S&Ls 50 basis points above what banks could offer. The idea was that with marginally higher savings rates, savings and loans would attract more deposits {{that would allow them to}} continue to write more mortgage loans, which would keep the mortgage market <b>liquid,</b> and <b>funds</b> would always be available to potential borrowers.|$|R
50|$|Hedge fund investors use serial {{correlation}} to detect smoothing in hedge fund returns. Market frictions such as transaction costs and information processing costs that cannot be arbitraged away lead to {{serial correlation}}, {{as well as}} do stale prices for illiquid assets. Managed prices are a more nefarious cause for serial correlation. Confronted with illiquid, hard to price assets, managers may use some leeway {{to arrive at the}} fund’s NAV. When returns are smoothed by marking securities conservatively in the good months and aggressively in the bad months a manager adds serial correlation as a side effect. The more <b>liquid</b> the <b>fund’s</b> securities are, the less leeway the manager has to make up the numbers.|$|R

5000|$|Despite the {{potential}} benefits to crop yields, inorganic fertilizer application in Sub-Saharan Africa lags behind other developing regions. Average application in Sub-Saharan Africa is less than 10 kg per hectare, while the average application in Latin America and South Asia is nearly 140 kg per hectare. [...] Sub-optimal or inefficient fertilizer use may result from farmers’ incomplete knowledge of its benefits or proper application techniques, inadequate (<b>liquid)</b> <b>funds,</b> or aversion to the risk associated with investing in a new input. Proponents of subsidies argue that they can help to mitigate these circumstances and bring fertilizer use up to optimal levels. The implementation of subsidy programs may also be argued for equity reasons. Like other forms of social support (health, education spending) subsidies represent a redistribution of funds within a society, and {{can be an effective}} way to target subsistence farmers (a disproportionately large amount of Sub-Saharan Africa’s poor).|$|E
