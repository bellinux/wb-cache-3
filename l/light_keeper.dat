25|$|The first <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> at the Caloundra Head Lightstation was {{appointed}} {{when the light}} became operational in September 1896. One room of his cottage functioned as a postal receiving office, complete with telegraph facilities, with the <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> appointed as the receiving office keeper. In 1910 the telegraph service was discontinued but {{was replaced by a}} telephone service in 1912. The post office remained at the lighthouse until 1934 and as a result, a rough track along the ridge was created by a steady stream of local residents, helping to foster closer settlement around the lighthouse in the immediate years after its erection. This rough track eventually became Canberra Terrace. As a married man with a large family, the arrival of the first lightkeeper also led to the establishment of the first Caloundra School, which for several months in the late 1890s was conducted at the light keeper's cottage.|$|E

25|$|What was {{probably}} New Jersey's first summer resort was on Tucker's Island off shore from Little Egg Harbor. The island sported boarding houses, private cottages, and a school. In 1848 a Lighthouse was erected there, with Eben Rider {{as its first}} <b>light</b> <b>keeper.</b> In 1869 the Little Egg Harbor Lifesaving's Station was constructed there. Also known as Sea Haven, the island contained two hotels. The island was wiped away in a storm, including its lighthouse, which fell into the sea. At the Tuckerton Seaport Museum a re-created lighthouse has been built {{as well as other}} re-created buildings that were on Tuckers Island. In the lighthouse there are several wall-mounted pictures showing the instant that the original lighthouse fell into the sea. The original island remains under water.|$|E
5000|$|During 1865, P.B. Small was {{reported}} as the <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> on Long Island Light.

50|$|In 1937, a 125-foot steel radiobeacon {{tower was}} {{installed}} and the reed horn fog signal {{replaced with a}} diaphragm over the next decade. In 1939 the United States Coast Guard replaced the U.S. Lighthouse Service as the agency responsible for maintaining the light but a civilian <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> remained on site until November 1973 {{and was replaced by}} the Coast Guard. Before Joseph Hindley retired, he may have been the last civilian <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> in New England.|$|E
50|$|This light {{contained}} no dwelling. The Rawley Point <b>Light</b> <b>keeper</b> tended it, accessing the light via a long catwalk running {{the length of}} the pier.|$|E

5000|$|CCG {{completed}} a large-scale program of automation and de-staffing {{which began in}} 1968 and was largely completed in the 1990s. [...] The result of this program saw the automation of all lighthouses {{and the removal of}} <b>light</b> <b>keepers</b> except for a handful of stations in British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick.|$|R
500|$|The {{lighthouse}} was extinguished in 1877 {{when the}} offshore Southwest Ledge Light replaced it for navigation. The keeper, Elizur Thompson, went {{to be the}} Southwest Ledge <b>Light's</b> <b>keeper</b> for five years before returning {{to live in the}} Five Mile Point <b>Light</b> <b>keeper's</b> quarters and fly storm signal flags for the United States Weather Bureau. In 1896, the lighthouse was transferred to the United States Department of War and was improved by a leasee named Albert Widmann. In 1922, the property was split up, with the land given to the state of Connecticut and the buildings to the city of New Haven. Two years later, New Haven purchased the land from the state for $11,180. The tower was renovated in 1986. The $86,000 restoration included repairing cracked mortar, steam cleaning the interior and exterior and removing [...] "guano [...] accumulated over the decades".|$|R
50|$|Original {{architectural}} drawings from 1882 depict four {{floors and}} an attached fog bell tower accessible {{from the fourth}} floor. Two floors were designed to be finished living space for the <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> with the lower (still existing) stone caisson used as a cellar.|$|E
5000|$|The {{apparatus}} was a {{fixed light}} 4th order catadioptric apparatus {{of less than}} 1000 cd and was visible for [...] It was powered by colza oil. As the light was operated {{in conjunction with a}} nearby pilot station, only one <b>light</b> <b>keeper</b> was required.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, the lightkeeper {{house was}} sold. The front range light {{had already been}} lost due to erosion. The house was sold at auction and then sold to its last <b>light</b> <b>keeper,</b> Gus Ohman. In 1926, he sold it to a former {{assistant}} <b>light</b> <b>keeper,</b> Arthur A. [...] "Papy" [...] Burn, Jr., who lived there for about 40 years. In 1953, Papy Burn started making wine using blackberries, elberberries, scuppernongs, and other fruit in the lamp house [...] and/or the oil house. [...] Although wine making was a small operation, he called the building the Silver Dew Winery. Two small brick buildings with the sign for the Silver Dew Winery were described by Pat Conroy in his autobiographical book the Water is Wide.|$|E
