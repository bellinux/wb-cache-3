5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty drawing her character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E

The filter consists of capacitors or inductors, and makes a non-linear device <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> linear load. An example of passive PFC is a valley-fill circuit.|$|E
25|$|The first Reform synagogue, {{which opened}} in Hamburg in 1811, {{introduced}} changes that made the synagogue <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> church. These included: the installation of an organ to accompany the prayers (even on Shabbat, when musical instruments are proscribed by halakha), a choir to accompany the hazzan, and vestments for the synagogue rabbi to wear.|$|E
25|$|Episode four: Chris and Tracey - Tracey and Chris {{have been}} married {{just over a year}} and were very much in love. But even though they were very happy together, they feel under {{constant}} pressure from others around them, because Tracey is forty-two and her husband Chris is just twenty-four. With an eighteen-year age gap, Chris is often mistaken for Tracey's son. Woodall and Susannah see that both their wardrobes needed revamping and modernising which will help the couple bridge their age gap. Tracey and Chris hope that by dressing differently they might begin to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> couple and be more accepted together. Constantine helps Tracey to overcome her body insecurities by investing in some good items that will emphasize her good figure. As a result of a new appearance, Tracey begins to feel more glamorous. The pair are given a new look and are once again reunited.|$|E

500|$|As {{the hall}} was {{considered}} to be unsympathetic to its setting, it was later decided to change its exterior. [...] This was undertaken by the Percy Thomas Partnership. [...] Work on recasing the Dennys Hall to make it <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> French château began in 1989 and was completed in 1991. The result has not been widely praised; the 2011 Cheshire Pevsner describes the building as [...] "Château style, (Waterhouse's) Eaton style, but also Tesco style".|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her roles in Lenzi's films with {{a leading role}} in Corrado Farina's [...] Baba Yaga (1973) as the titular witch, alongside Isabelle De Funès and George Eastman. TV Guide referred to the film as an [...] "exceptionally handsome example of 1970s Italian pop-exploitation filmmaking sweetened by Piero Umilani's lounge-jazz score," [...] and praised Baker's performance, but noted that she was [...] "physically wrong for the role; her elaborate lace-and-beribboned costumes sometimes make her <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fleshy Miss Havisham than a sleekly predatory sorceress".|$|E
500|$|Distancing {{the film}} from what {{producer}} Preston Stutzman called the [...] "candy-coated, brightly colored pastel world" [...] of other CG animated films, an {{attempt was made}} to bring an organic look to the film, and dirt was rubbed into the colors. The Nightmare Before Christmas was cited as an inspiration for the filmmakers to try to bend the characters' shapes into extremes, and many other choices unconventional to computer-animated films were also made. For example, one of the Woodsman's eyes was made bigger than the other, and Red was given only four fingers, so as to make her <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> doll. Producer Katie Hooten explained that [...] "CG in the past has been pushing the envelope to make things look more realistic, but Hoodwinked takes things back to where CG looks a lot more like a cartoon." ...|$|E

500|$|Akihiko Yoshida {{has stated}} that Ashe's {{physical}} features were designed {{with the intent of}} making her look vaguely French, stating that [...] "the base of her bone structure is a French person's. We were given orders from the start to not make her look like an Asian. But we modified her a bit to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Japanese {{for the sake of the}} Japanese audience, and also since a character that looks completely French makes some of the CG expressions difficult." [...] Ashe was voiced by Kari Wahlgren in English and by Mie Sonozaki in Japanese. Despite having been created for Final Fantasy XII, she was first introduced in the 2004 crossover board game Itadaki Street Special. She also appears in Itadaki Street Portable, and was set to appear in Fortress, as revealed in concept art for the game.|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the land}} {{remained}} in possession of the Marquesses of Bristol throughout the 20th century, but from the 1970s the indebted 6th Marquess and his son, the 7th Marquess, sold much of their farmland around Sleaford and Quarrington. In 1989, the Bristol Estates office in Sleaford closed. The result was a boom in house-building, especially in the fields around Quarrington. In the 1980s, hundreds of houses were constructed in Southfields, and developments on Quarrington Hill followed in the late 1990s. Low house prices and crime rates, and good educational facilities in Sleaford made the new homes attractive. As the local historian Simon Pawley wrote, [...] "Quarrington... began to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suburb of Sleaford than a village in its own right". In July 2015 planning permission for a further 200 homes between Northfield Road and the A15 was granted by North Kesteven District Council.|$|E
500|$|Anthropy told Harvey {{that she}} {{preferred}} characters with more realistic proportions; as a result, {{he ended up}} with a design that was three and a half heads tall. Due to her submissive position, he designed her to be an [...] "innocent" [...] who looked [...] "eager-to-please", with [...] "benign, wide eyed facial expressions". The evolution of her design resulted in Harvey having to redesign her appearance on the title screen. He employed different colors to demonstrate Jill's feelings for the Queen; he used a rose tint to demonstrate her [...] "blissful display of affection" [...] while using a grey wash to demonstrate her sadness. Harvey intended to add some red to her rubber body suit order to make her stand out from the background; however, he felt that this made the suit <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "crazy wrestler costume". He later thought to include grey in the design or to put her initials on her chest, but decided on using an all black design. One of the difficulties of designing the suit was to make it look shiny without resembling [...] "gross lolicon manga porn".|$|E

500|$|When casting [...] "Tall Girl #1" [...] (the {{woman who}} would kiss with Dwight), the show {{was looking for a}} girl 6'1 or taller. Actress Cassie Fliegel, who is 5'11, auditioned for the part anyway. After getting a callback, Fliegel went to a gym to work out, {{attempting}} to gain muscle to <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> basketball player. On the day of the callbacks, Fliegel remembers being next to a girl who was 6'8. Despite her size, Fliegel, a former basketball player herself, was cast for the part. Initially, she did not know that her character was going to make out with Dwight. Fliegel recalls that when she first heard about kissing Dwight she [...] "was like, I don't think so". However, after finding out that she had her own trailer, Fliegel warmed up to the idea. The music in the club was chosen by Novak, Kaling's then-boyfriend Benjamin Nugent, and Daniel Chun. When filming Ryan dancing in the club, the girl that Ryan hit was actually a stunt woman. Pads had been placed on the floor so Novak could fall down safely. The German lullaby that Dwight sang to Ryan was script supervisor Veda Semarne's idea. Semarne's Austrian grandmother sang the same song to her when she was a child.|$|E
500|$|Early scenes {{animated}} by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston show that Pinocchio's design was exactly {{like that of}} a real wooden puppet with a long pointed nose, a peaked cap and bare wooden hands. Walt Disney, however, was not pleased with the work that was being done on the film. He felt that no one could really sympathize with such a character and called for an immediate halt in production. Fred Moore redesigned the character slightly to make him more appealing but the design still retained a wooden feel. Young and upcoming animator Milt Kahl felt that Thomas, Johnston and Moore were [...] "rather obsessed with the idea of this boy being a wooden puppet" [...] and felt that they should [...] "forget that he was a puppet and get a cute little boy; you can always draw the wooden joints and make him a wooden puppet afterwards". Hamilton Luske suggested to Kahl that he should demonstrate his beliefs by animating a test sequence. Kahl showed Disney a test scene in which Pinocchio is underwater looking for his father. From this scene Kahl re-envisioned the character by making him <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real boy, with a child's Tyrolean hat and standard cartoon character four-fingered (or three and a thumb) hands with Mickey Mouse-type gloves on them. The only parts of Pinocchio that still looked more or less like a puppet were his arms, legs and his little button wooden nose. Disney embraced Kahl's scene and immediately urged the writers to evolve Pinocchio into a more innocent, naïve, somewhat coy personality that reflected Kahl's design.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Wenders]]' Paris, Texas? Hold on a little, people. If you just checked with Google maps...." [...] Washington, D.C., the Mojave Desert and Fox's soundstages in Los Angeles also served as locations. The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E

500|$|While in {{the comics}} Shaw's {{absorption}} power was depicted by having him {{grow up to}} ten times his original size, First Class instead does what company Digital Domain called a [...] "kinetic echo", where a digital Kevin Bacon would be rippled, deformed and at times multiplied in repeated [...] "iterations" [...] that appear in a short period, to [...] "see [...] displace and deform in a kinetic and organic way". According to Dykstra, {{the biggest problem with}} Frost's diamond body was depicting it [...] "without looking like she was made of Jell-o or the polygon model of a human being". The morphed Frost, which the visual effects tried to make <b>look</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> faceted crystal than glass, was rotomated into Jones in the live-action plates, while still retaining the actress' eyes and lips. As the character kept on {{going in and out of}} her diamond form, a motion capture tracking suit could not be employed, so instead the effects team used both gray and chrome balls and a jumpsuit covered in mirrors—which also served as a lighting reference. For Angel's digital wings, the animators studied slow-motion footage of dragonflies to create the wing pattern in a realistic way, and the designers added iridescence to [...] "make the wings prettier". The visual of Banshee's screams was done through a digital ring-like structure based on renderings of sound waves such as Schlieren photography. The visual for Havok's blasts employed similar rings, concentrated in beams or rings of light which were then match moved into Till's mimed throwing. For Banshee's flight, the visual effects team used digital doubles only for distant shots, with closer ones employing Jones shot in a special flight rig. Azazel's teleporting was made to resemble the [...] "inky smoky effects" [...] used with Nightcrawler, who appeared in X2 and is Azazel's son in the comics. However, while Nightcrawler only left a smoke trail, the visual effects team had Azazel accompanied by digital fire and smoke [...] "because he was more closely aligned with the devil". The fire was also used [...] "as a mask to hide or reveal the body", according to effects supervisor Matt Johnson. Since the visible part of whirlwinds are the dust and dirt sucked up by them, the ones Riptide produces were made to resemble [...] "a tornado of gas, made out of nothingness" [...] by visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi. The final product was mostly a practical effect made with dry ice, which was augmented by computer-generated imagery. The visual effects team portrayed Mystique's abilities slightly differently due to this being a younger version, with [...] "the scales being slightly longer and the transformation being slightly showier than when she became the more mature Rebecca." [...] For Beast, computer graphics depicted his simian-like feet, the transformation sequence, and a few facial replacements for when Beast opened his mouth wider than the mask on Hoult's face allowed.|$|E
