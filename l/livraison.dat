500|$|The russet sparrow was scientifically described, as Fringilla rutilans, by the Dutch {{zoologist}} Coenraad Jacob Temminck in 1836, from {{a specimen}} collected in Japan. Its specific {{name comes from}} the Latin rutilus, [...] "of a glowing or auburn red". Temminck's description is contained in his Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées d'oiseaux which was issued in 102 livraisons or parts between 1820 and 1839. It was at one time believed that the <b>livraison</b> containing {{the description of the}} russet sparrow was issued in 1835 but it has now been established that it appeared in 1836 sometime after 30 April. The English ornithologist John Gould described a specimen of the russet sparrow collected in the Himalayas {{at a meeting of the}} Zoological Society of London in December 1835 under the binomial name Pyrgita cinnamomea. His description was included in the volume of the society's proceedings for 1835 that was published on 8 April 1836. Some taxonomists give priority to Gould's publication and use the binomial name Passer cinnamomeus for the russet sparrow.|$|E

These relate to Asian taxa. There is every probability that similar cases will be found in the context of some names given to birds from other regions.

40|$|This {{incomplete}} {{catalogue of}} the Leiden collection, initiated by Hermann Schlegel in 1862, {{was made up of}} monographs, most of them on birds, treating Schlegel’s systematic apportionment of bird species to what today we would call orders or families. These monographs were grouped for issue several at a time to make up a numbered ‘Livraison’ (or part). The wrappers of the early <b>Livraisons</b> seem not to bear actual dates of publication and internal dates are not publication dates. We have assembled archival evidence, from Schlegel’s official reports to the Curators of Leiden University, from the archives of the Royal Library, and similar sources to provide a table of dates comparing wrapper dates with this archival information thus achieving more accuracy. Originally the monographs were collected in wrappers printed for the <b>Livraisons</b> which listed their contents. The individual monographs were later subordinated to a changed, systematic order for binding as definitive volumes (‘Tomes’) 5. We indicate that sequence. The published series in the period up to Schlegel’s death included one monograph on monkeys but otherwise dealt with the bird collection - although this was not completely catalogued. Of these monographs only one, ‘Buccones’ by A. Goffin, was not by Schlegel himself. The early volumes were indexed in 1881 by Fredericus A. Jentink - who succeeded Schlegel as director of the museum in 1884. The indices form part of the set...|$|R

40|$|The {{clinical}} and pathological features of multiple sclerosis were fully described, in France and subsequently in England, {{during the latter}} half of the XIXth century but clinical descriptions, personal accounts and depictions of the disease had appeared at various times over the previous 50 years. Jean Cruveilhier is usually credited with having first illustrated the lesions of multiple sclerosis in the second tome of his pathological atlas which bears the title date 1835. But the 40 <b>livraisons</b> which make up this work were published separately in parts and documentary evidence contained within the second volume indicates that the putative case of multiple sclerosis cannot have appeared earlier than 1841. Robert Carswell also may have published his pathological atlas in parts but the work was completed by 1838 and so his depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis, appearing on plate 4 fig 1, predates Cruveilhier's by at least three years. Curiously, Carswell and Cruveilhier each observed their pathological material in Paris but they cannot have depicted the same individual. 1988 is therefore the 150 th anniversary of the depiction of the lesions of multiple sclerosis; the unnamed patient was French, the illustrator a Scotsman...|$|R

While depicting the martyrdom of forty-four personages well-known in the hagiographie Parisian calendar, the inner Sainte Chapelle painted medallions still testify {{of the most}} important stages which left a mark on the art of this famous edifice. During the XVIIth century, some of the apse have been done up, but the most significant restoration remains the XIXth century one. Twenty medallions were entirely or partially restored from 1853 till 1881. Today, only two of them has been authenticated as originated from the XIIIth century, and may thus evoke the Gothic decor chosen then by Saint Louis. This study, thanks to recent experiments carried out by the Champ-sur-Marne Laboratory since 1980 when, for the safety of this precious witness of the Royal gothic art, it was decided to intervene on the building, especially aims at completing the 1968 Robert Branner survey.

6000|$|Nor {{has he been}} {{content with}} merely blowing the trumpet for the battle of well-doing; he has given to his precepts the {{authority}} of his own brave example. Naturally a grave, believing man, {{with little or no}} sense of humour, he has succeeded as well in life as in his printed performances. The spirit that was in him has come forth most eloquently in his actions. Many who have only read his poetry have been tempted to set him down as an ass, or even as a charlatan; but I never met any one who had known him personally who did not profess a solid affection and respect for the man's character. He practises as he professes; he feels deeply that Christian love for all men, that toleration, that cheerful delight in serving others, which he often celebrates in literature with a doubtful measure of success. And perhaps, out of all his writings, the best and the most human and convincing passages {{are to be found in}} [...] "these soil'd and creas'd little <b>livraisons,</b> each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fastened with a pin," [...] which he scribbled during the war by the bedsides of the wounded or in the excitement of great events. They are hardly literature in the formal meaning of the word; he has left his jottings for the most part as he made them; a homely detail, a word from the lips of a dying soldier, a business memorandum, the copy of a letter-short, straightforward to the point, with none of the trappings of composition; but they breathe a profound sentiment, they give us a vivid look at one of the sides of life, and they make us acquainted with a man whom it is an honour to love.|$|R

The war of attempted secession has, of course, been the distinguishing event of my time. I commenced {{at the close of}} 1862, and continued steadily through '63, '64 and '65, to visit the sick and wounded of the army, both on the field and in the hospitals in and around Washington city. From the first I kept little note-books for impromptu jottings in pencil to refresh my memory of names and circumstances, and what was specially wanted, &c. In these, I brief'd cases, persons, sights, occurrences in camp, by the bed-side, and not seldom by the corpses of the dead. Some were scratch'd down from narratives I heard and itemized while watching, or waiting, or tending somebody amid those scenes. I have dozens of such little note-books left, forming a special history of those years, for myself alone, full of associations never to be possibly said or sung. I wish I could convey to the reader the associations that attach to these soil'd and creas'd <b>livraisons,</b> each composed of a sheet or two of paper, folded small to carry in the pocket, and fasten'd with a pin. I leave them just as I threw them by after the war, blotch'd here and there with more than one blood-stain, hurriedly written, sometimes at the clinique, not seldom amid the excitement of uncertainty, or defeat, or of action, or getting ready for it, or a march. Most of the pages from 20 to 75 are verbatim copies of those lurid and blood-smuch'd little notebooks.|$|R
