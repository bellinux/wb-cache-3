25|$|Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> Villages AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> AOC, this wine region covers six communes {{along the}} <b>Layon</b> river that have {{historically}} produced wines of high quality. The six communes are Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay. According to wine expert Tom Stevenson, there are noticeable {{differences among the}} wines produced by each commune (all made from Chenin blanc) with the wines of Beaulieu-sur-Layon being characterized by their light aromas; Faye-d'Anjou wines having a distinctive brushwood aroma; Rablay-sur-Layon wines {{tend to be the}} most bold and round; the wines of Rochefort-sur-Loire tend to be full bodied and have the most aging potential; Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné wines are characterized by their delicate aromas that develop over time and the wines of Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay often have very round mouthfeel and robust flavors.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc is an {{authorized}} planting in many Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regions but is mostly {{planted in the}} Middle Loire AOCs of Anjou, Bonnezeaux, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> Jasnières, Montlouis, Quarts de Chaume, Saumur, Savennières, and Vouvray. The wines of the Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> Bonnezeaux, and Quarts de Chaume are produced as sweet dessert wines, while Savennières produce predominately dry wines. The wines of Anjou, Crémant de Loire, Coteaux de l'Aubance, Jasnières, Montlouis, Saumur, and Vouvray have {{a wide range of}} sweetness levels, from dry to semi-sweet to sweet.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wine}} regions in Anjou are located south of the river Loire, with the one notable {{exception}} of Savennières which {{is located on the}} right bank of the river just south of Angers. The tributaries of the Loire, particularly the <b>Layon</b> and Aubance, play significant roles in the area's wine production with vineyard planted on their right banks and sheltered from wind by nearby hill sides. The Aubance and <b>Layon</b> flow parallel to each other going northwest towards the Loire and when the climate is favorable can help promote the development of noble rot that {{is at the heart of}} the region's sweet wine production.|$|E
25|$|The {{departments}} {{included in}} the uprising, called the Vendée Militaire, included the area between the Loire and the <b>Layon</b> rivers: Vendée (Marais, Bocage Vendéen, Collines Vendéennes), part of Maine-et-Loire west of the <b>Layon,</b> and the portion of Deux Sèvres west of the River Thouet. Having secured their pays, the deficiencies of the Vendean army became more apparent. Lacking a unified strategy (or army) and fighting a defensive campaign, from April onwards the army lost cohesion and its special advantages. Successes continued for some time: Thouars was taken in early May and Saumur in June; there were victories at Châtillon and Vihiers. After this string of victories, the Vendeans turned to a protracted siege of Nantes, {{for which they were}} unprepared and which stalled their momentum, giving the government in Paris sufficient time to send more troops and experienced generals.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate of}} the wine region tends to dictate what style of Chenin blanc is most {{prevalent}} in the area. In the northernmost reaches of Jasnières, Chenin blanc is at its limits for cultivation with the wines being mostly dry and thin. While most of the Middle Loire experiences a continental climate, the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> receives more climatic influence from the Atlantic Ocean, which promotes the development of Botrytis cinerea, than in nearby Vouvray or Montlouis. While all three AOCs produce sweet, botrytized wine there tends to be less vintage variation in the Coteaux du <b>Layon.</b> The cool continental influence in Montlouis and Vouvray lends itself to producing {{a wide range of}} Chenin blanc including grapes with the necessary balance of acidity to sugar needed to produce sparkling wine. In the AOC of Savennières, there is less fog and mist from the nearby rivers and more wind that makes it difficult for botrytis to take root. This {{is part of the reason}} why Savennières is the one Loire AOC that produces predominately dry Chenin blanc. In the south of France, the warm Mediterranean {{climate of the}} Languedoc region encourages the production of much more dry styles of Chenin blanc rather than sweet.|$|E
25|$|The white wines of the Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> Montlouis-sur-Loire, Savennières, and Vouvray {{are based}} on Chenin blanc and {{are known for their}} high acidity when young and ability to develop and age well. The villages of Sancerre and Pouilly-sur-Loire are known for their crisp and {{herbaceous}} Sauvignon blancs. Some producers in the area are experimenting with oak aging their Sauvignon blanc to give them more rounder and softer appeal. The villages of Bourgueil, Chinon and Saumur are known for their Cabernet franc based wines that range from light and fruity in Saumur to rich and velvety in Chinon. The Muscadet wines from the Pays de la Loire are made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape and are known for their citrus and mineral notes.|$|E
25|$|Bonnezeaux AOC A sub-appellation of the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> AOC {{comprises}} three southwest facing slopes {{within the}} village of Thouarcé that produce sweet, often botrytized, wines made entirely from Chenin blanc. Harvest in Bonnezeaux is very labor-intensive requiring harvested {{to go through the}} vineyards in multiple passes or tries selecting only the ripest individual grapes. In 2003 the Institut National des Appellations d'Origine (INAO) increased the harvest sugar levels from 204grams per liter to 238 and the minimum residual sugar levels of the finished wine from 17grams per liter to 34. Wine expert Tom Stevenson describes the wines of Bonnezeaux as being more full-bodied and richer than those of Quarts-de-Chaume with an aging potential of up to 20 years or more.|$|E
25|$|Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> AOC This large {{appellation}} overlaps the Saumur AOC to {{the southeast}} and the Anjou Coteaux de la Loire AOC in the northwest. The region {{has a long history}} of winemaking sweet white wines dating back to the 4th century AD. Today the AOC is dedicated to 100% Chenin blanc wines that, in favorable years, are afflicted by noble rot. Yields are restricted to a maximum of 30 hectoliters per hectare and wines must have a minimum 12% alcohol level in order to qualify for AOC designation. In 2003 mandatory harvest sugar levels being increased from 204grams per liter to 221 g/l or 294 g/l for the newly established Sélection de Grains Nobles (SGN) designation and minimum residual sugar levels in the finished wines increased from 17 g/l to 34 g/l.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc is the {{dominant}} and nearly exclusive grape of Vouvray. While the obscure minor grape Arbois is permitted in the Vouvray AOC, it is rarely seen. With more 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) of vineyards planted as of 2006, it is the single largest producer of Chenin blanc-based wines in France by a sizable margin, with only the Anjou wine region of the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> coming close. Most of the vineyards are planted on a plateau with a southern aspect facing towards the river. Viticulture and wine production {{in the region is}} dictated almost completely by the climate characteristics of a particular vintage with cooler climate years shifting productions towards dry and sparkling wines while warmer vintages seeing increased production of sweet and even botrytized wines. The harvest in Vouvray is often the last in France to be completed, potentially lasting until November. When sweet and botrytized wine are being produced, the harvest is often very labor-intensive, involving successive tries or passages through the vineyards with harvesters hand-picking only the ripest berries.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} grape {{varieties}} of the Anjou are Chenin blanc, {{known locally as}} Pineau de la Loire, which is used for dry, sweet, still and sparkling wine and Cabernet Franc which is used mostly for rosé and still red wines. The sweet wine production of Anjou is highly dependent on favorable climate conditions and experiences marked vintage variation from year to year. The character of the vintage and climate will ultimately determine what type of wine will be produced. Many of the vineyards in the Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs are located on sheltered slopes along tributaries of the Loire. In favorable vintages, the late summer and early fall months will bring climate conditions that encourage moisture and mist {{in the morning and}} enough sunshine in the afternoon to promote the development of favorable Botrytis cinerea rot instead of less desirable forms of grape rot. In exceptional years where there is enough warmth and dry weather during the harvest months, the grapes will be left on the vine to raisin in a process known as passerille. This method desiccates the wine, removing moisture and concentrating sugars, without adding the nuance of flavor that Botrytis does.|$|E
25|$|Within the Anjou wine {{region are}} several Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC)s {{responsible}} for {{a broad spectrum of}} wines including still red, white and rosé produced with varying levels of sweetness. The region produce more variety of different wine styles, from different grape varieties than any other Loire Valley wine region. The majority of wine production in the region revolves around sweet white wines produced under their own sub-appellation including the Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> Bonnezeaux, Quarts de Chaume and Coteaux de l'Aubance AOCs. Around 15% of yearly Angevin wine production goes to dry white wines made predominantly from Chenin blanc with the Savennières AOC being the most noted example and Anjou Blanc AOC being the most commonly found on the worldwide wine market. Among the rosés produced in the region are predominantly Grolleau Rosé d'Anjou AOC and the Cabernet Franc and/or Cabernet Sauvignon based Cabernet d'Anjou with the later being more widely recognized for quality than the former. Grapes from the region also go into third style of rosé known as Rosés de Loire, which can include grapes from across the Middle Loire Valley though the bulk of the production is centered around Anjou. This style of rosé is completely dry and can be made from Pinot noir, Gamay, Grolleau, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pineau d'Aunis.|$|E
2500|$|Along the <b>Layon</b> {{river is}} the commune of Rochefort-sur-Loire which {{contains}} {{the village of}} Chaume with a long making tradition that finally received AOC designation in the early 21st century. In 2003 the INAO granted the request for the sweet wines from this region to be called Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> AOC. Made entirely from Chenin blanc, these wines are most often the product of passerillage or [...] "raisining" [...] on the vine than of infection by noble rot. Yields were restricted {{to no more than}} 25 hectoliters per hectares as grapes were harvested with a minimum of 238grams per liter with at least 34grams of residual sugar in the finished wine. The producers in the Quarts-de-Chaume AOC, located on the plateau southwest of Chaume, took exception to the new AOC particularly the inclusion of the term 1er Cru (or Premier cru) which has a quality association with the wines of Burgundy. The producers of the Quarts-de-Chaume AOC felt that consumers would equate Chaume 1er Cru des Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> as being of a higher quality than their own wines and such their own AOC designation was being devalued. In response to these concerns, the INAO renamed the AOC in 2006 to the shorter Chaume AOC. Quarts-de-Chaume AOC producers still felt that the close associate between their AOC and Chaume was causing damage to the value of their wines and continued to object to the AOC naming. In response the INAO disbanded the Chaume AOC entirely in 2009. Now wine produced in this region must fall under the larger Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> AOC designation.|$|E

2500|$|The broad {{spectrum}} of wine styles produced in Anjou brings with it {{a wide variety of}} winemaking techniques. In areas such as the Coteaux du <b>Layon,</b> the wines are fermented in 400 l (106 gallons) [...] "double-barriques" [...] and submitted to partial malolactic fermentation. The basic still wines of Anjou blanc are made similar to still white wine production elsewhere though, as wine expert Jancis Robinson notes, they do have an historical association with being over sulfited. As red wine production continues to find a market, and plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon increase, more producers are experimented with the use of new oak barrels. In riper years Angevin producers can make more fuller bodied reds similar to those found in the Touraine wine reds but still relatively light when compared to the reds of warmer climates such as Bordeaux and the Rhone.|$|E
2500|$|Wine expert Tom Stevenson {{describes}} the wines {{of the area}} as being a [...] "microcosm of the Loire Valley", featuring wines made from every grape variety and in almost every style produced in the entire Loire wine region. Among the wines of Anjou, Savennières is noted for its dry Chenin blanc wines and the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> for its sweet dessert wines that includes the botrytized wines of Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume. Various rosé wines are produced in the region under different AOC designation include Rosé d'Anjou, the most basic level made predominantly from Grolleau, and Cabernet d'Anjou which is usually made from Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon. For most of its history, dry red wines have represented {{a small percentage of}} Anjou winemaking but in recent years the numbers have been steadily increasing—aided, in part, by the 1987 establishment of the Anjou-Villages AOC designation for red wines which can be made from only Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The Gamay grape of the Beaujolais wine region has had a long history in the Anjou with its own Anjou-Gamay AOC. Grapes from around the region can go into basic Anjou blanc and Anjou Rouge AOC wines.|$|E
2500|$|Lyon {{will enter}} the 2009–10 Coupe de France season having won the title just two seasons ago. Lyon will start from the Round of 64, as all Ligue 1 clubs will. On 14 December 2009, the draw for the Round of 64 was {{determined}} and Lyon were giving the task of traveling to Alsace to face second division club Strasbourg. Lyon's first match of the 2010 winter season was highly anticipated {{by the media and}} supporters alike following the team's disastrous ending to 2009 portion of the campaign. Lyon started this game in fantastic fashion scoring two goals in the first 15 minutes with Bafétimbi Gomis getting the opener in the 11th minute and Bastos getting one three minutes later. <b>Layon</b> maintained the 2–0 until injury time in the first half when Nicolas Fauvergue netted a goal for his side. Within the first 15 minutes of the second half, Lyon struggled to maintain its first half mentality. Young Strasbourg striker Magaye Gueye tested Lloris on two occasions. Eventually, the match was put to bed after 71 minutes following a laser free kick from Bastos giving Lyon a 3–1 lead, which was the final result. In the ensuing draw, Lyon were given another tough test, courtesy of fellow Ligue 1 club AS Monaco. In the Round of 32 clash, Lyon opened the scoring through Jean-Alain Boumsong on the cusp of half-time with a thumping header following a corner kick. After half-time, Monaco's Brazilian striker Nenê equalised from the penalty spot seven minutes into the second period after Sidney Govou was adjudged to have fouled him in the penalty area. Despite maintaining consistency throughout the match, Lyon would suffer defeat and elimination from the competition following the conversion of a close-range header by South Korean Park Chu-young, following a cross, 13 minutes from time. The goal was partially attributed to goalkeeper Hugo Lloris' unwillingness to intercept the ball upon realizing a teammate was attempting to clear it himself. The former's unwillingness and the teammate's attempt at a clearance was both futile as Park headed the ball in easily.|$|E

5000|$|Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> is an Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) for sweet {{white wine}} in the Loire Valley wine region of France. Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> is {{situated}} in the Anjou district of the region, along the river <b>Layon,</b> which is {{a tributary of the}} Loire River. Six of the villages (communes), namely Beaulieu-sur-Layon, Faye-d'Anjou, Rablay-sur-Layon, Rochefort-sur-Loire, Saint-Aubin-de-Luigné and Saint-Lambert-du-Lattay are allowed to add their name to that of the appellation. Usually, the [...] "de" [...] or [...] "sur" [...] part is dropped, to give names like Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> Beaulieu and Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> Saint-Aubin. Furthermore, two villages within the Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> area form their own respective AOC - Bonnezeaux and Chaume. Finally, a favoured enclave within Chaume is a separate AOC under the name Quarts de Chaume. For the geographically delimited AOCs, required grape maturity is higher and allowed yield is lower. The best vineyards are generally located on the north bank of the <b>Layon,</b> where they enjoy a good sun exposure on roughly south-facing slopes. Coteaux du <b>Layon</b> including its enclave appellations cover about 1400 ha in the early 2000s.|$|E
