5000|$|This {{is not the}} {{shortest}} distance between the chosen endpoints on the parallel because a parallel {{is not a great}} circle. The difference is small for short distances but increases as λ, the longitudinal separation, increases. For two points, A and B, separated by 10° of longitude on the parallel at 60° the distance along the parallel is approximately 0.5 km greater than the great circle distance. (The distance AB along the parallel is (a cos φ) λ.

In the extreme case where the longitudinal separation is 180°, the distance along the parallel is one half of the circumference of that parallel; i.e., 10,007.5 km. On the other hand, the geodesic between these points is a great circle arc through the pole subtending an angle of 60° at the center: the length of this arc is one sixth of the great circle circumference, about 6,672 km. The difference is 3,338 km so the ruler distance measured from the map is quite misleading even after correcting for the <b>latitude</b> <b>variation</b> of the scale factor.|$|E

A comparison is made of the <b>latitude</b> <b>variation</b> of the interplanetary (IP) Ly-alpha signal in 1986 at solar minimum from Pioneer Venus and in 1990 at solar maximum from Galileo. The Galileo EUV spectrometer shows that a large enhancement of the IP Ly-alpha emission occurred over the intervening four years near the solar equator.

The model fit to the data shows a 25 -percent decrease of the full disk solar Ly-alpha flux from solar equator to solar pole in 1990. A detailed study of the Galileo IP Ly-alpha observations on day-of-year 190, 193, 197, and 200 in 1990 reveals that large variations occur in response to the 27 -d solar variation.

Part of observing programmes, carried out during the last century for the purpose of studying the Earth's rotation, were realized by using PZT instruments. These observations were performed within in the intervals (tens of years) much longer than that of the Hipparcos mission (less than 4 years). In addition, the annual number of observations for every PZT-programme star is several hundreds on the average. Though the accuracy of the star coordinates in the Hipparcos Catalogue is by two orders of magnitude better than that of the star coordinates from the PZT observations, the large number of observations performed a much longer time interval makes it possible to correct the Hipparcos proper motions and to improve their accuracy with respect to the accuracy given in the Hipparcos Catalogue. Long term examinations of <b>latitude</b> and time <b>variations</b> were used to form the Earth Orientation Catalogue (EOC- 2), aimed at a more accurate determination of positions and proper motions for the stars included. Our method of calculating the corrections of the proper motions in declination from the <b>latitude</b> <b>variations</b> is different from the method used in obtaining the EOC- 2 Catalogue.

40|$|The heliospheric {{termination}} shock must exhibit asymmetry in its shape, {{due in part}} {{to internal}} <b>latitude</b> <b>variations</b> in the solar wind, and in part to the special directions defined by the external interstellar flow and/or the galactic magnetic field. This asymmetry shows up naturally in numerical simulations of the interaction between the heliosphere and local interstellar medium. However, to date only one analytical treatment of the theory has appeared, which discussed the modification of the shock shape due to solar wind <b>latitude</b> <b>variations</b> in the presence of spherically symmetric outer boundary conditions. In the present report, we discuss an extension and generalization of this theory to an axially symmetric gasdynamic system, in which departure from spherical symmetry may be due either to internal solar wind variations or to the directional properties of the external interstellar medium. It is shown that for steady flow the post-shock region is characterized by an infinite set of quantities that are conserved along streamlines; among these invariants are the stagnation pressure and a quantity closely related to vorticity. Moreover, for a given latitude profile of the (supersonic) solar wind, the geometry of the termination shock uniquely determines the valued of these invariants at the points where the streamlines emerge from the shock. A self-consistent solution of the problem thus requires a match between the shock geometry and distant boundary conditions. The theory is applied to give estimates of termination-shock asymmetry for various internal and external conditions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe have {{presented}} {{a comparison between}} the modeled NmF 2 and hmF 2, and NmF 2 and hmF 2 which were observed at the equatorial anomaly crest {{and close to the}} geomagnetic equator simultaneously by the Akita, Kokubunji, Yamagawa, Okinawa, Manila, Vanimo, and Darwin ionospheric sounders and by the middle and upper atmosphere (MU) radar (34. 85 ° N, 136. 10 ° E) during the 25 - 27 August 1987 geomagnetically storm-time period at low solar activity near 201 °, geomagnetic longitude. A comparison between the electron and ion temperatures measured by the MU radar and those produced by the model of the ionosphere and plasmasphere is presented. The corrections of the storm-time zonal electric field, E ?, from 16 : 30 UT to 21 : 00 UT on 25 August bring the modeled and measured hmF 2 into reasonable agreement. In both hemispheres, the meridional neutral wind, W, taken from the HWW 90 wind model and the NRLMSISE- 00 neutral temperature, T n, and densities are corrected so that the model results agree with the ionospheric sounders and MU radar observations. The geomagnetic <b>latitude</b> <b>variations</b> in NmF 2 on 26 August differ significantly from those on 25 and 27 August. The equatorial plasma fountain undergoes significant inhibition on 26 August. This suppression of the equatorial anomaly on 26 August is not due to a reduction in the meridional component of the plasma drift perpendicular to the geomagnetic field direction, but is due to the action of storm-time changes in neutral winds and densities on the plasma fountain process. The asymmetry in W determines most of the north-south asymmetry in hmF 2 and NmF 2 on 25 and 27 August between about 01 : 00 - 01 : 30 UT and about 14 : 00 UT when the equatorial anomaly exists in the ionosphere, while asymmetries in W, T n, and neutral densities relative to the geomagnetic equator are responsible for the north-south asymmetry in NmF 2 and hmF 2 on 26 August. A theory of the primary mechanisms causing the morning and evening peaks in the electron temperature, T e, is developed. An appearance, magnitude <b>variations,</b> <b>latitude</b> <b>variations,</b> and a disappearance of the morning T e peaks during 25 - 27 August are caused by variations in E ?, thermospheric composition, T n, and W. The magnitude of the evening T e peak and its time location are decreased with the lowering of the geomagnetic latitude due to the weakening of the effect of the plasma drift caused by W on the electron density. The difference between 25 August and 26 - 27 August in an appearance, magnitude and <b>latitude</b> <b>variations,</b> and a disappearance of the evening T e peak is caused by variations in W, the thermospheric composition, T n, and E ?...|$|R

The amplitude of the changes (on the order of 5 to 10 m/s) appears to fall within the natural variability of the zonal wind fluctuations.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{gives an}} {{overview}} of interannual variations of total ozone and 50 hPa temperature. It is based on newer and longer records from the 1979 to 2001 Total Ozone Monitoring Spectrometer (TOMS) and Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) instruments, and on US National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses. Multiple linear least squares regression is used to attribute variations to various natural and anthropogenic explanatory variables. Usually, maps of total ozone and 50 hPa temperature variations look very similar, reflecting a very close coupling between the two. As a rule of thumb, a 10 Dobson Unit (DU) change in total ozone corresponds to a 1 K change of 50 hPa temperature. Large variations come from the linear trend term, up to - 30 DU or - 1. 5 K/decade, from terms related to polar vortex strength, up to 50 DU or 5 K (typical, minimum to maximum), from tropospheric meteorology, up to 30 DU or 3 K, or from the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), up to 25 DU or 2. 5 K. The 11 -year solar cycle, up to 25 DU or 2. 5 K, or El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), up to 10 DU or 1 K, are contributing smaller variations. Stratospheric aerosol after the 1991 Pinatubo eruption lead to warming up to 3 K at low latitudes and to ozone depletion up to 40 DU at high <b>latitudes.</b> <b>Variations</b> attributed to QBO, polar vortex strength, {{and to a lesser}} degree to ENSO, exhibit an inverse correlation between low latitudes and higher <b>latitudes.</b> <b>Variations</b> related to the solar cycle or 400 hPa temperature, however, have the same sign over most of the globe.
