This {{suggests that}} the ancestral deuterostome <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mobile worm-like enteropneust than a sessile colonial pterobranch. The fact that lophophorates and pterobranchs both use tentacles for feeding is probably not a synapomorphy of lophophorates and deuterostomes, but evolved independently as convergent adaptations to a sessile lifestyle.|$|E

It is used in transfer service between rail yards or short switching runs, and as such, lacks sleeping, cooking or restroom facilities. The ends of a transfer caboose are left open, with safety railings surrounding the area between the crew compartment {{and the end of the}} car.|$|E

25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> weak strike than doubling.|$|E
25|$|The Atlantis DHD is {{more similar}} to the Earth's dialing {{computer}} than an actual DHD, and <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> set of crystal panels. It can block out certain gate addresses. The Atlantis DHD also has an extra control-crystal allowing the dialing of an eighth chevron during the dialing sequence {{and is the only}} DHD in the Pegasus Galaxy capable of dialing Earth. A similar DHD is also used on Puddle Jumpers, where the set of used glyphs corresponds to the galaxy of the Puddle Jumper. The Wraith also travel through Stargates in small spacecraft called darts and have some means of remote-dialing them {{in a manner similar to}} Ancient ships.|$|E

But the moon <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> golf course compared to what's up there." [...] A film crew, led by Seattle filmmaker Otto Seiber, was dropped by helicopter on St. Helens on May 23 to document the destruction. Their compasses, however, spun in circles and they quickly became lost. A second eruption occurred on May 25, but the crew survived and was rescued two days later by National Guard helicopter pilots. Their film, The Eruption of Mount St. Helens, later became a popular documentary.|$|E

500|$|The {{early months}} of 1706 also proved {{frustrating}} for the Duke as Louis XIV's generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough's original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon adjusted his schemes and marched into enemy territory. LouisXIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out Monsieur Marlbrouck. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough's most successful action, and {{one in which he}} had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 3,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 20,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, [...] "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs". The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. [...] "It really <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dream than truth", wrote Marlborough to Sarah. With Prince Eugene's rout of the French army at Turin in September, 1706 proved a miraculous year for Allied arms.|$|E
2500|$|During the 19th century, the {{population}} {{began to grow}} around the palace, but this remained generally a rural community (a aspect that would continue until the 20th century). José Mangens in 1936 echoed similar indications of Mafra in writing about old Rua dos Arcipestres, noting: [...] "...Mafra offers nothing interesting and <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hinterland village with its huts and ruined portals typical backyard, shielded with old cans...".|$|E

Indeed, Hetch Hetchy today remains the least visited area of the park. Karin Klein has described Yosemite Valley as [...] "so crammed... that it <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ripstop ghetto than the site of a nature experience." [...] However, she does support breaching the dam once it has reached the end of its lifespan, and not replacing it.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design was}} given a fairly {{extensive}} set of upgrades and rectified as the Commander 114B in 1992. Among the changes were a new streamlined cowling, strengthening of the airframe, changes to various air intakes, and a new prop. These improved cruise speed by a significant , making it more competitive with similar models from other companies. More significant upgrades were {{carried out in the}} interior, which received a high-quality leather upholstery upgrade, reading lamps, better soundproofing and an optional powerful air conditioning unit. One reviewer summed it up as [...] "an ultra-spacious interior that <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> luxury car than a spam can".|$|E
2500|$|Florence Mall is {{the other}} major {{shopping}} center {{in the city of}} Florence. [...] Florence Mall was developed as an open-air mall in the 1960s and now <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shopping plaza. [...] It contains 340,506 sq. ft. [...] Retailers include: Stein Mart, Piggly Wiggly, Talbots, TJ Maxx, Shoe Carnival, Ross, etc. Food options include: Red Bone Alley, Moe's Southwest Grill, Zaxby's: Buffalo Wings and Fingers, Five Guys Burgers & Fries, Cici's Pizza, Hardee's, Schlotzsky's Deli, and Cold Stone Creamery. In addition, Florence has two Walmart Supercenters, a Sam's Club, a Kmart, and two Lowe's among other retailers. [...] Other shopping plazas/strip malls, craft/hobby stores, antique stores and mom and pop stores are spread throughout the city.|$|E
2500|$|By 1980 {{the city}} reduced its {{expectations}} and looked only for developers for whole blocks, not the neighborhood. Half {{of the finished}} units would have to rented to low-income families. Eventually the Pastures was repopulated, but to some critics the damage to both its human and architectural character had been done. [...] "The real place ceased to exist when its last resident was trundled off to a distant housing project", urbanist Roberta Brandes Gratz wrote a quarter-century later. She calls the Pastures project [...] "a vivid example of the inappropriateness of Historic Preservation as The Answer". Some of the buildings have, she notes, been incorrectly restored and [...] "the area <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sanitized suburban enclave ... than an urban neighborhood".|$|E

2500|$|The Frighteners was {{regarded}} as a commercial failure. Film critic Roger Ebert expressed disappointment stating that [...] "incredible effort has resulted in a film that <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> demo reel than a movie". In February 1997, Jackson launched legal proceedings against the New Zealand Listener magazine for defamation, over a review of The Frighteners which claimed that the film was [...] "built from the rubble of other people's movies". In the end, the case was not pursued further. Around this time Jackson's remake of King Kong was shelved by Universal Studios, partly because of Mighty Joe Young and Godzilla, both giant monster movies, that had already gone into production. Universal feared it would be thrown aside by the two higher budget movies.|$|E
2500|$|The {{notion that}} the entire {{campaign}} amounts to {{nothing more than a}} [...] "political purge" [...] has been advanced in Western media outlets. British news magazine The Economist wrote in its [...] "Banyan" [...] column, [...] "it is hard not to see corruption allegations as the latter-day weapon of choice in the winner-takes-all power struggles that the party has always suffered". Meanwhile, He Pin, editor at overseas Chinese news portal Boxun, likened Zhou Yongkang, Bo Xilai, Ling Jihua, and Xu Caihou, to a latter-day [...] "Gang of Four", whose real crime was not corruption but conspiring to usurp power. Chinese writer Murong Xuecun, a continual critic of the Chinese Communist Party, wrote in an opinion article [...] "In my view, Xi's anti-corruption campaign <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Stalinist political purge... he relies on the regulations of the party and not on the laws of the state, the people carrying it out operate like the KGB, and most cases cannot be reported on with any transparency." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to RFE/RL, [...] "It is, of course, {{possible}} that the Georgian authorities initially assumed that the incursion was masterminded by Moscow, and realized only after verbal contact was established with the intruders that it was not. Alternatively, they may have inferred {{at an early stage}} that the men were insurgents from Daghestan but killed them all the same, in order to perpetuate the uncertainty over their true identity and why they crossed the border and thus, by extension, the suspicion that Russia may have been behind the incident." [...] Caucasus expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Mamuka Areshidze, said it was [...] "odd" [...] that the special forces apparently did not try to take the gunmen alive for interrogation, as they could have shot to incapacitate rather than to kill. Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said he has an [...] "impression that this clash was accidental from both sides. I do not have any reasons yet to connect what happened with the conspiracy theories. [...] What happened in Lapankuri <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> serious misunderstanding." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lobsters {{have long}} bodies with muscular tails, {{and live in}} crevices or burrows on the sea floor. Three of their five pairs of legs have claws, {{including}} the first pair, which are usually {{much larger than the}} others. Highly prized as seafood, lobsters are economically important, and are often one of the most profitable commodities in coastal areas they populate. Commercially important species include two species of Homarus (which looks more like the stereotypical lobster) from the northern Atlantic Ocean, and scampi (which <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shrimp, or a [...] "mini lobster") – the Northern Hemisphere genus Nephrops and the Southern Hemisphere genus Metanephrops. Although several other groups of crustaceans have the word [...] "lobster" [...] in their names, the unqualified term [...] "lobster" [...] generally refers to the clawed lobsters of the family Nephropidae. Clawed lobsters are not closely related to spiny lobsters or slipper lobsters, which have no claws (chelae), or to squat lobsters. The closest living relatives of clawed lobsters are the reef lobsters and the three families of freshwater crayfish.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the early}} readers of Vestiges, Charles Darwin had {{conceived}} his own theory {{of natural selection}} to explain evolution six years earlier, and in July 1844 had written down his ideas in an '"Essay". For a year he had been tentatively discussing his evolutionary ideas in correspondence with Joseph Dalton Hooker, who wrote to Darwin on 30 December 1844 that he had [...] "been delighted with Vestiges, from the multiplicity of facts he brings together, though I do [...] agree with his conclusions at all, {{he must be a}} funny fellow: somehow the books <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 9 days wonder than a lasting work: it certainly is “filling at the price”.— I mean the price its reading costs, for it is dear enough otherwise; he has lots of errors." [...] Darwin had read the book in November, finding that it drew on some of the lines of evidence he had been putting together, and introduced questions that had to be dealt with. He responded that he had been [...] "somewhat less amused at it.... the writing & arrangement are certainly admirable, but his geology strikes me as bad, & his zoology far worse. Darwin had learnt geology from Adam Sedgwick, and was particularly interested in what his former mentor had to say about evolution. In October 1845 he wrote to his friend Charles Lyell that Sedgwick's review was a [...] "grand piece of argument against mutability of species" [...] which he had read with [...] "fear & trembling," [...] but had been [...] "well pleased to find" [...] that he had anticipated Sedgwick's objections and [...] "had not overlooked any of the arguments".|$|E
