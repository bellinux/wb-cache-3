40|$|Abstract – Seed-borne {{diseases}} are increasingly becoming important in organic farming, therefore effective seed treatment methods are urgently needed. Physical methods have efficacy against {{a number of}} seed-borne pathogens, but may have adverse effects if applied at too high intensity. Thermal treatment in water has the widest application. To control the <b>loose</b> <b>smuts</b> of wheat and barley {{it is still the}} only available non-chemical sanitation method. Other physical treatment methods with practical relevance in cereals are hot humid air and electron treatment. Hot water treatment is also known to control different seed-borne pathogens of vegetables. Various preparations of microorganisms, plant extracts and other agents of natural origin have been and are still being tested in cereals and vegetables. In cereals, some of them are already applied commercially. ...|$|R
40|$|Oats {{have been}} among the five or six leading crops in acreage grown in Utah since its settlement. For many years Swedish Select has been by far the most {{predominant}} variety. This variety is well adapted to Utah conditions, but because of its high susceptibility to <b>loose</b> and covered <b>smut,</b> it is not the most desirable. In 1934, after extensive trials, the variety, Markton, which is resistant to <b>loose</b> and covered <b>smuts,</b> was introduced into the state to replace Swedish Select. In those trials, Markton averaged 13 percent higher in acre yield than Swedish Select. Markton possessed one drawback in that it had a yellowish kernel, whereas Swedish Select produced a large white kernel. As a result of this, Markton has never been grown extensively in the state. Uton, which is a selection from the Markton x Swedish Select cross, is a high-yielding variety resistant to both <b>loose</b> and covered <b>smuts,</b> and yet produces a large white kernel similar to that of Swedish Select. The good qualities of both Swedish Select and Markton appear to have been combined in Uton...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Glenn', a six-row, white-aleurone variety, was {{released}} by NDSU in 1978.

40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) {{is one of}} {{the main}} food crops of Eritrea. A total of 35 fields at 15 lowland {{locations}} and 13 fields at 8 highland locations planted with a variety of cultivars were surveyed in 2001 for sorghum diseases, based on the percentage of diseased plants in 5 subplots. In highland areas, covered kernel smut (Sporisorium sorghi [Sphacelotheca sorghi]) was predominant followed by head smut (Sporisorium reilianum [Sphacelotheca reiliana]) and about 10 % incidence of Striga hermonthica. In lowland areas, leaf blight (Exserohilum turcicum [Setosphaeria turcica]), anthracnose (Colletotrichum graminicola [Glomerella graminicola]), zonate leaf spot (Gloeocercospora sorghi), <b>loose</b> kernel <b>smut</b> (Sporisorium cruentum) and covered kernel smut were important. Striga had between 2 - 100 % incidence and was more prevalent in the drier lowlands. For all diseases, different cultivars exhibited different susceptibilities, and full results are tabulated...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Larker', a six-rowed, semi-smooth-awn malting barley, {{was first}} {{released}} in 1961. It was medium-maturity with moderate straw strength and medium height. 'Larker' was rust-resistant, but susceptible to leaf diseases and <b>loose</b> <b>smut.</b> It {{was superior to}} all other malt varieties for kernel plumpness {{at the time of}} release.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Bowman', a two-rowed, smooth-awned variety, was jointly {{released}} by NDSU and USDA in 1984 as a feed barley, spring variety developed in North Dakota. It has good test weight and straw strength. It is resistant to wheat stem rust, but {{is susceptible to}} <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> and barley yellow dwarf virus.|$|E
2500|$|... 'Compana', an American variety, was {{developed}} from a composite cross by the Idaho and Montana Agricultural Experiment Stations {{in cooperation with}} the USDA's Plant Science Research Division. It was released by Montana in 1941. 'Compana' is a two-row variety with moderately weak straw, midshort with midseason maturity. The kernels are long and wide with yellow aleurone. This variety is resistant to <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> and moderately resistant to covered smut.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>loose</b> kernel <b>smut</b> fungus Sporisorium cruentum on Sorghum halepense (Johnson grass) was {{investigated}} in vitro and in greenhouse experiments. Smut infection induced {{a decrease in the}} dry matter of rhizomes and aerial vegetative parts of the plants evaluated. Moreover, the diseased plants showed a lower height than controls. The infection resulted in multiple smutted buds that caused small panicles infected with the fungus. In addition, changes were observed in the structural morphology of the host. Leaf tissue sections showed hyphae degrading chloroplasts and vascular bundles colonized by the fungus. Subsequently, cells collapsed and widespread necrosis was observed as a symptom of the disease. The pathogen did not colonize the gynoecium of Sorghum plants until the tassel was fully developed. The sporulation process of the fungus led to a total disintegration of anthers and tissues. When panicles were inspected before emergence, fungal hyphae were observed on floral primord. Histological sections of panicles showed fungal hyphae located in the parenchyma tissue and the nodal area. Infection occurred in the floral primordium before the tassel had fully developed and emerged from the flag leaf. Grains were replaced by sori surrounded by a thin membrane that usually was broken before or after the emergence of the panicle. The results, together with the significant decrease of the dry matter of rhizomes and seeds of S. halepense, suggest that S. cruentum could be considered as a potential biocontrol agent in the integrated management of this weed...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Dickson', a six-row, rough-awned variety, was {{released}} by NDSU in 1965.

50|$|Covered smut {{of barley}} {{is caused by}} the fungus Ustilago hordei. The disease is found {{worldwide}} and it is more extensively distributed than either <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> or false <b>loose</b> <b>smut.</b>|$|E
50|$|False <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> is a {{fungal disease}} of barley caused by Ustilago nigra. This fungus {{is very similar}} to U. nuda, the cause of <b>loose</b> <b>smut,</b> and was first {{distinguished}} from it in 1932.|$|E
50|$|Ustilago esculenta is {{a species}} of fungus in the Ustilaginaceae, a family of smut fungi. It {{is in the same}} genus as the fungi that cause corn smut, <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> of barley, false <b>loose</b> <b>smut,</b> covered smut of barley, <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> of oats, and other grass diseases.

50|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> {{of barley}} {{is caused by}} Ustilago nuda. It is a disease that can destroy a large {{proportion}} of a barley crop. <b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> replaces grain heads with smut, or masses of spores which infect the open flowers of healthy plants and grow into the seed, without showing any symptoms. Seeds appear healthy and only when they reach maturity the following season is it clear that they were infected. Systemic fungicides are the major control method for <b>loose</b> <b>smut.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Loose</b> <b>smut</b> has {{recently}} {{become a more}} serious problem in the Ladakh region in the Himalayan mountains of India. This area has been particularly affected by global climate change and has experienced many new crop pests and diseases because of it.

50|$|The {{most widely}} used method of control for <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> is using treated seed. Seeds are {{typically}} treated with a systemic fungicide to kill any fungus that may be inside. Since the fungus grows up with the plant, it's {{very important that the}} fungicide used to treat the seed be systemic and not just external. The most common type of systemic fungicides used for <b>loose</b> <b>smut</b> are from the Carboxin group of chemicals. Although carboxins are highly toxic to fish and mildly toxic to other animals, they degrade rapidly in the environment and since there the fungicide is coated on seed and not sprayed there is not much loss to the environment.|$|E
