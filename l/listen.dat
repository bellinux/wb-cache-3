30|$|As we expected, L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety had a {{negative}} relationship with L 2 linguistic knowledge {{and the use of}} L 2 <b>listening</b> strategies. This suggests that, the higher the learners’ use of L 2 <b>listening</b> strategies, the lower their L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety is likely to be. Additionally, as levels of L 2 linguistic knowledge become greater, the less L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety learners are likely to have (see also Dewaele and MacIntyre 2014). These findings offer additional justification both for intentional L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy instruction and for increasing L 2 linguistic knowledge in order to decrease L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety and thereby improve L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency. Taken all together, the structural relationships among the pertinent factors affecting L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency begin from intrinsic motivation which directly affects L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use, indicating that intrinsic motivation only indirectly affects L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency mediated through all the other variables. L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use has an indirect impact on L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency mediated through L 2 linguistic knowledge and L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety as well as an indirect impact on L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency. Furthermore, L 2 linguistic knowledge directly affects L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency and also indirectly affects L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency mediated through L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety.

The object of inquiry is The Art of <b>Listening</b> (Adelmann 2009) as a Swedish example from a Scandinavian context, compared to mainstream <b>listening</b> research in the USA.

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  3, {{intrinsic}} motivation exerted a direct effect only on L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use, while it had an indirect effect on all the other variables.

For its part, L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use had a direct effect on both L 2 linguistic knowledge and L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety, whereas it had an indirect effect on both L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety and L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency. Furthermore, the indirect effect it exerted on L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency was mediated through L 2 linguistic knowledge and L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety. On the other hand, L 2 linguistic knowledge had both a direct and indirect impact on L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency – the latter mediated through L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety.

30|$|Studies, {{particularly}} {{in foreign language}} instructional settings, have confirmed the seemingly commonsense observation that L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety is negatively linked with L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use (Jung 2004; Kim and Park 2006; Lee and Lee 2007). For instance, Jung (2004) {{examined the relationship between}} L 2 <b>listening</b> strategies and L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety of Korean, Chinese, and Japanese university students of English. As expected, the results for all three groups of students indicated that <b>listening</b> strategy use had a negative relationship with <b>listening</b> anxiety. However, focused findings diverged depending on the nationality of learners: <b>listening</b> strategy use was the only predictor for L 2 <b>listening</b> proficiency in Korean participants, while L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety was a better predictor than L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use for the Chinese and Japanese respondents. This latter finding was echoed in Kim and Park’s (2006) study which found that L 2 <b>listening</b> success was influenced more strongly by L 2 <b>listening</b> anxiety than by L 2 <b>listening</b> strategy use.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} whether the English <b>listening</b> strategies had the effect to English <b>listening</b> comprehension and also {{to see whether or}} not the application of the metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategies would produce higher English <b>listening</b> comprehension compared to the using of the cognitive <b>listening</b> strategies. In order to study this relationship, 60 (sixty) students of Deck Department in Politeknik Pelayaran Surabaya (Surabaya Merchant Marine Polytechnic) were choosen randomly and surveyed with thirty two structured questionnaires and a TOEIC <b>listening</b> test. The questionnaire was about a <b>Listening</b> strategy use developed by Lee (1997) and modified by Ho (2006) and also based on Vandergrift’s (1997, 2003) cognitive and metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategy classification and also from O’Malley and Chamot’s (1990) language learning strategy to represent the participants’ activities in employing the cognitive and metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategies. The scale consisted of 32 items divided into 2 categories of metacognitive and cognitive <b>listening</b> strategies. In order to comprehend whether there is a relationship between cognitive and metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategies and the students’ <b>listening</b> comprehension, and to see that metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategy would give more influence in <b>listening</b> comprehension that the cognitive <b>listening</b> strategies, statistical analysis of Linear Regression analysis, One-way Annova, Multiple regression analysis of Tukey HSD and Homogeneous subset test were used. The result suggests that the students who work with metacognitive <b>listening</b> strategies did not achieve better English <b>listening</b> comprehension than those who work with cognitive <b>listening</b> strategies.

For the purpose of the topic, three groups of students consisting of eighty four were cluster randomly selected and were divided into two groups of twenty eight as the experimental and control class. Research method was quasi-experimental. The instruments were multiple choice test and questionnaire. Both groups were taught in the same style. Before the instruments were used, a tryout had been administered to know the validity and reliability of the instruments. Furthermore, it was found out that the data were in normal distribution and homogeneous based on the normality testing and homogeneity testing. The researcher analyzed the <b>listening</b> test scores of students who had high and low <b>listening</b> habit in both groups. Multifactor Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test were applied with the level of significance α = 0. 05. The results of the test and the related comparisons, findings showed that: (1) podcast is more effective than movie to teach <b>listening</b> comprehension; (2) students having high <b>listening</b> habit have better <b>listening</b> comprehension than those having low <b>listening</b> habit; (2) there is interaction effect between teaching media and different <b>listening</b> habit on the students’ <b>listening</b> comprehension.
