40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a multi-layered planner for the motion of modules in a uniform group of I-Cube selfreconfiguring modular robotic system. The planner uses metacubes, the {{high-level}} abstraction of 8 C 16 L groups.

30|$|The {{clinical}} {{evaluation of the}} neurological function was evaluated at different time points. The reference at the upper extremities was always 7 points (3 points for normal reaction to claw clamping and 4 additional points for spontaneous movements). Furthermore, each animal showed maximal reflexes of the hind legs before balloon occlusion. In the sodium chloride group, only one animal showed <b>link</b> <b>motions</b> (2 points) {{at each time point}} during reperfusion. All other animals in both groups lost muscular reaction.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} horizontally {{and outside the}} engine frame.

In the vehicle group, only one animal recovered partial neuronal function with regain of MEPs and <b>link</b> <b>motions</b> {{at each time point}} after deflating.

50|$|Breaking {{coupling}} rods were a {{cause of}} accidents in 1873 and 1884 and in 1885 the cross section was increased.

50|$|For {{the first}} time on Bavarian locomotives, running plates and Hardy vacuum brakes were {{installed}} on these saturated-steam engines. Several examples had gangways as well.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-layered hierarchical motion planning strategy {{for a class}} of self-reconfigurable modular robotic systems, I-Cubes.

50|$|For {{improved}} accessibility, {{the steam}} chests were mounted outside the frames instead of between them. The slide valves, operated by Stephenson <b>Link</b> <b>motion,</b> were {{on top of}} the cylinders and employed rocker shafts. The balance weight for the Stephenson motion was seldom used on American locomotives and was replaced by a powerful coiled spring.|$|E

50|$|The {{valve gear}} {{is of the}} Heusinger type, with {{internal}} <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> driven by flycrank on the left wheel of the rear coupled axle.

50|$|There {{was talk}} of them at one point having outside Walschaerts valve gear {{which would have been}} a major break from {{traditional}} GWR designs. In the event the favoured inside Stephenson <b>link</b> <b>motion</b> of the GWR was used, but the GWR 1500 Class, also designed by Hawksworth, used outside Walschaerts - the only standard gauge locomotive designed by the GWR to do so.|$|E
50|$|Their {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} outside the plate frames. The Murdoch's D slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were arranged at an incline and were actuated by Allan straight <b>link</b> <b>motion.</b> In {{this type of}} valve gear, the valve rod and the expansion link are respectively connected to opposing arms on the reversing shaft, so that partial rotation of the shaft moves the link and the die block in opposite directions.|$|E

40|$|Morphing {{aircraft}} are a focus today {{due to their}} ability to combine multiple mission flexibility with a single vehicle. The Hyper-Elliptical Cambered Span (HECS) wing is one such wing being developed as a testbed for morphing technologies, due to its ability to vary the spanwise curvature in order to alter a craft’s lift-to-drag performance. Through analysis of the aft-swept wing geometry and review of theory, predictions of aerodynamic performance are benchmarked against quasi-static rigid wing models in the Cornell University low-speed wind tunnel facility. Models assume a discretized approximation of the continuously varying spanwise curvature, with system order reduced significantly via a spool-and-tendon mechanism <b>linking</b> <b>motions</b> proportionally. The traditional rib-and-skeleton framework is replaced by a composite structure more adept at withstanding compressive loads due to actuation as verified through finite element analysis. Actuation methods are contrasted between a DC motor driven system and one employing shape memory alloy (SMA) wires, which generate proportional <b>motion</b> by <b>linking</b> sections electrically rather than mechanically.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} further {{investigations of}} local-time {{effects on the}} laboratory scale. We study dependence of the effect on spatial directions defined {{by a pair of}} sources of fluctuations. The results show that the effect appears in the neighborhood of directions North-South and East-West. Only for these directions are the experimental results in excellent agreement with theoretically predicted local-time values. The results reveal the character of near-Earth space heterogeneity and lead to the conclusion that at the laboratory scale, local-time effects cannot be caused by some axial-symmetric structure, which has permanent properties along an Earth meridian. Appearance of the effect along an Earth parallel is <b>linked</b> to rotational <b>motion</b> of the Earth. Observed properties of local-time effects in the direction of an Earth meridian can be <b>linked</b> to <b>motion</b> of the Earth in this direction. ...|$|R
