5|$|Platform C7 is an <b>L-shaped</b> {{platform}} that closes {{the east side}} and northeast corner of the East Plaza. Steps run {{the entire length of}} the platform.|$|E
5|$|Robust layout means {{buildings}} more square than elongated, and symmetrical not <b>L-shaped,</b> {{as well as}} no 'soft' first stories (stores {{with large}} windows, buildings on unbraced columns). New Zealand's earthen building guidelines check for enough bracing wall length {{in each of the}} two principal directions, based on wall thickness, story height, bracing wall spacing, and the roof, loft and second story weight above earthen walls.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a gabled roof {{was used as a}} post office in the late 19th century, and may have served as a schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is <b>L-shaped</b> with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey <b>L-shaped</b> {{main house}} forms {{the east and}} south sides of a {{courtyard}} with single-storey stables forming {{the north and west}} sides. To the south-west of the house, is a second, larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings.|$|E
5|$|Several L-shape half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical <b>L-shaped</b> half-sections. Where a port of image impedance ZiT faces another ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section so formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{as a basic}} <b>L-shaped</b> tower {{built from}} tooled ashlar dressed rubble, the castle was {{extended}} in a southerly direction {{by the addition of}} a circular tower during the first alterations in the late 16th century. A staircase was inside the new tower and further structures were added to the south and north sides of the courtyard {{at this stage of the}} development. Replacement entrances were installed and the original first-floor doorway was closed off. Access on the west side was gained through a narrow round-headed entrance and a wider main doorway was incorporated in the south elevation.|$|E
5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building, {{also known}} as the Yale Laundry Building, the City Linen Supply Co. Building, Perfect Fit Manufacturing and simply Yale Union (YU), in {{southeast}} Portland, Oregon, is a two-story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built largely of brick in 1908, and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations, it was added to the register in 2007. Two-story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an <b>L-shaped</b> structure that shares a party wall with a commercial building to the east.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg. Kray posted his main body of 95,000 soldiers in the <b>L-shaped</b> angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France. Unwisely, Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach, near the northwestern end of Lake Constance, only a day's march from French-held Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, <b>L-shaped</b> implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} years border fortifications inside the city mostly {{consisted}} of brick walls with a top made of barbed wire. Clay bricks and concrete slabs were used for construction. Further obstacles of barbed wire and upstate walls delimitated the East and at some places, like Bernauer Straße, bricked-up buildings formed the boundary line. The buildings were situated on East-Berlin territory, whereas the pavement {{in front of the}} houses belonged to West-Berlin. In many places safety installations of West-Berlin's outer ring consisted of metal fences and barbed wire barriers. Technologically advanced upgrading took place later on and only in 1975 <b>L-shaped</b> concrete segments that were known from the fall of the Wall were added.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} {{success of this}} game, Nintendo released several follow-up titles in the Dr. Mario series. Dr. Mario 64, released in 2001 for the Nintendo 64, features Wario and several Wario Land 3 characters, and offers numerous game modes, including a story-focused single-player mode. The game also supports simultaneous multiplayer for up to four players at once. Dr. Mario 64 was subsequently released in Japan in the compilation game Nintendo Puzzle Collection on the GameCube. Dr. Mario Online Rx, released in 2008 on WiiWare, offers online multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Dr. Mario Express, released in 2009 for the Nintendo DSi, does not support multiplayer gameplay. Dr. Luigi, released in 2013, features Luigi as a playable character and has all the modes in Dr. Mario Online Rx, {{as well as a}} new mode with <b>L-shaped</b> capsules. The latest installment, , was released in 2015 and introduced power-ups to the series.|$|E
5|$|The Kop Stand and the Tilton Road Stand, {{opened in}} 1994, form a {{continuous}} <b>L-shaped</b> single-tier stand, with seating capacity for nearly 17,000 spectators, round the remaining {{half of the}} pitch. A walkway separates back and front sections. The Kop seating includes the directors' box and a row of executive boxes, within the stand {{are a number of}} function rooms and hospitality areas, and there are electronic perimeter advertising boards in front. The stadium has floodlight pylons only on the north side; the south side is lit by a row of lights along the front of the Kop roof. The Tilton Road Stand has 9,000 seats, and is the only one without hospitality boxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn and}} the {{surrounding}} Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed to restore the barn {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new <b>L-shaped</b> office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through.|$|E
5|$|The {{comparatively}} old {{globular cluster}} NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200light-years distant and somewhat obscured by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially obscured by dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900light-years away from Earth and 23,000light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark <b>L-shaped</b> river through a bright field of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.|$|E
5|$|By early 1799, the French Directory {{had become}} {{impatient}} with stalling tactics employed by Austria. The uprising in Naples raised further alarms, and recent gains in Switzerland suggested {{the timing was}} fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany. At the beginning of 1800, the armies of France and Austria faced {{each other across the}} Rhine. Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120,000 troops. In addition to his Austrian regulars, his force included 12,000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria, 6,000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg, 5,000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz, and 7,000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol. Of these, 25,000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance (Bodensee) to protect the Vorarlberg.

5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is <b>L-shaped,</b> with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Abu Bakar State Mosque, {{located along}} Skudai Road, {{is the main}} and the oldest mosque in the state. It was built with a {{combination}} of Victorian, Moorish and Malay architectures. The Johor Bahru Old Chinese temple, located on the Trus Road, hosts the Gods of five Chinese dialects spoken in the city. It was built in 1875 and renovated by the Persekutuan Tiong Hua Johor Bahru (Johor Bahru Tiong Hua Association) in 1994–95 {{with the addition of a}} small <b>L-shaped</b> museum in one corner of the square premises. The Wong Ah Fook Mansion, the home of the late Wong Ah Fook, was a former historical attraction. It stood for more than 150 years but was demolished illegally by its owner in 2014 to make way for a commercial housing development without informing the state government. Other historical religious buildings include the Arulmigu Sri Rajakaliamman Hindu Temple, Sri Raja Mariamman Hindu Temple, Gurdwara Sahib and Church of the Immaculate Conception.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most heavily eroded part of the chain are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85million years in age. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains are {{separated}} by a large <b>L-shaped</b> bend that causes the orientations of the chains to differ by about 60°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change {{in the direction of}} plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue is still currently under debate. All of the volcanoes {{in this part of the}} chain have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots (see also the seamount and guyot stages of Hawaiian volcanism). Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The seamount chain extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.|$|E
5|$|There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from {{at least}} 1540. The terraced garden dates {{from the time of}} the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and {{comprises}} four broad <b>L-shaped</b> terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted. The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden. Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century. The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981, and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed any evidence of historic planting schemes.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of Dumpford, a hamlet in the civil parish of Trotton with Chithurst, is Terwick Mill. It is a grade II* listed structure, and {{consists}} of two mills, side by side. They were operational until 1966. The north mill is a timber-framed building, clad with weatherboarding, dating from the sixteenth century. The south mill was built of coursed stone rubble around 1750. Although it has {{been converted into a}} house, it still contains two iron waterwheels, one for each mill, and its machinery. The earliest documentary evidence for the mill dates from 1635. The adjacent mill house, parts of which date from the eighteenth century, is also a listed building. The river turns to the north to pass to the east of Trotton, and is crossed by Trotton Bridge, dating from the early 1600s, which has five ribbed arches. The river then turns to the east again at Chithurst, where Abbey House, an <b>L-shaped</b> timber-framed building dating from the fifteenth century, and the parish church, much of which dates from the eleventh century, are located on the north bank. An eighteenth century stone and brick bridge with two arches carries Chithurst Lane over the river.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{primitive}} rhinoceroses, {{the front}} teeth of Paraceratherium {{were reduced to}} {{a single pair of}} incisors in either jaw, which were large and conical, and have been described as tusks. The upper incisors pointed downwards; the lower ones were shorter and pointed forwards. Among known rhinoceroses, this arrangement is unique to Paraceratherium and the related Urtinotherium. The incisors may have been larger in males. The canine teeth otherwise found behind the incisors were lost. The incisors were separated from the row of cheek teeth by a large diastema (gap). This feature is found in mammals where the incisors and cheek teeth have different specialisations. The upper molars, except for the third upper molar that was V-shaped, had a pi-shaped (π) pattern and a reduced metastyle. The premolars only partially formed the pi pattern. Each molar {{was the size of a}} human fist; among mammals they were only exceeded in size by proboscideans, though they were small relative to the size of the skull. The lower cheek teeth were <b>L-shaped,</b> which is typical of rhinoceroses.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the third-person {{perspective}} in Silent Hill games, P.T. uses a first-person perspective, which centers on an unknown protagonist, whom the player controls, who awakens in a haunted suburban house and experiences supernatural occurrences. Available areas to explore {{in the home}} consist of an <b>L-shaped</b> corridor with two rooms adjacent to it: a bathroom, and a staircase {{which leads to the}} room in which the player starts a loop, or a continuous reincarnation of the corridor. The only actions the player can use are walking and zooming. To progress, the player must investigate frightening events and solve cryptic puzzles. Each time a loop is successfully completed, changes appear in the corridor. Additionally, the player encounters a hostile ghost named Lisa. If she catches the protagonist, the player has a random chance of triggering a startling jump scare when turning the camera horizontally and is sent {{back to the beginning of}} the current loop.|$|E

25|$|A G-kitchen has {{cabinets}} along three walls, {{like the}} U-kitchen, {{and also a}} partial fourth wall, often with a double basin sink {{at the corner of}} the G shape. The G-kitchen provides additional work and storage space, and can support two work triangles. A modified version of the G-kitchen is the double-L, which splits the G into two <b>L-shaped</b> components, essentially adding a smaller <b>L-shaped</b> island or peninsula to the L-kitchen.|$|E

25|$|The {{vulnerability}} of the earlier rooms was appreciated, and new airfields built during the expansion programme of the 1930s used bombproof Mk. II, <b>L-shaped</b> structures.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic pipes often {{featured}} animal effigies. <b>L-shaped</b> elbow pipes {{were the}} most common form. A hollow reed or sourwood stem would be inserted into the pipe for smoking.|$|E
25|$|At both Eastern and Western {{sides of}} the lobby, and at both levels, <b>L-shaped</b> arcaded {{hallways}} lead to the classrooms. Two semi-enclosed patios are thus defined between the library-auditorium wing (much higher and wider) and the identical classroom wings facing East and West. Three sets of stairs are symmetrically {{laid out in the}} scheme: one of secondary importance at either side of the lobby; the most public one next to side entrances at the <b>L-shaped</b> circulation wings. A third set of stairs faces the patios and is the only one not to connect to the building's basement where more classrooms are found.|$|E
25|$|Water {{channels}} {{join the}} upper cisterns to the fountain {{house and the}} fountain house to the cistern of the sanctuary and the <b>L-shaped</b> stoa. At intervals there were settling basins along the water conduit, including one immediately above the fountain house.|$|E
25|$|There was {{a little}} ten-ton {{breakdown}} crane, and several (at least four) hand-operated pump trucks for the permanent way staff to use. Two were noted at Eastry, and two at Wingham. Miller trucks (the <b>L-shaped</b> things with two wheels) were noted at Eastry and Staple.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two major {{additions}} to the Mill. The first occurred in the 1880s when a two story <b>L-shaped</b> addition was added. The second was a two-story annex added in the 1900s. The three sections combine {{to make up the}} look of mill as it stands today.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-four stone hut circles {{have been}} officially {{recorded}} here, {{although there are}} probably remains of more within the enclosure, which has an area of over 16,000 square metres (four acres). Many of these hut circles feature <b>L-shaped</b> porches. The doorways are paved with naturally flat stones, and all face both downhill {{and away from the}} prevailing wind.|$|E
25|$|The line {{opened in}} 1812; {{it was made}} as a double track line, as a plateway, in which the rails were <b>L-shaped</b> in cross section; wagons with plain wheels could use the line. The railway used horses for traction; a {{locomotive}} was tried, {{but it was too}} heavy and broke the plates. Passengers were carried by independent hauliers.|$|E
25|$|Park Lane Tower, the 35-story <b>L-shaped</b> {{high-rise}} {{apartment building}} {{shown in the}} opening credits of the television show The Jeffersons (1975-1985), is located at 185 East 85th Street and Third Avenue. Designed by architect Hyman Isaac Feldman and completed in 1967, the beige-brick structure features distinctive rounded balconies at its corners and angled balconies on its sides.|$|E
25|$|<b>L-shaped</b> ambushes {{included}} {{the most effective}} aspects of both the 'Bloody Nose' and Linear ambush. The short end, or base, of the 'L' was positioned so {{that at least one}} machine gun could fire straight down the kill zone, enfilading it. Parallel to the kill zone and tied into the 'L' was a second, flanking ambush.|$|E
