40|$|It took 100 years, {{since the}} age of "Manyoshu" through the age of Kokuhuankoku, for Waka to come to life againas "Kokmshu". I believe that the {{comparative}} literature way of investigation is necessary, as for as =Kokinsh虎" isconcerned. However, the conventional comparative literature-viewpoint is easy to focus on the aspect that "Kokin-sku" one-sidedly followed Chinese poetry. Still, at the time when "Kokinshu" was edited to make Waka bloom again,there was two intention. On one hand, the intention to bring Waka closer to Kanshi (Japanese poetry in Chinese) which was public literature at that time, on the other, the intention to keep originality of Waka [...] In this paper, taking up `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March'and ･The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> September'in "Kokinshu" and I will provehow they correspond to above-mentioned intention. As for as `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March'is concerned, the theme is influenced by Hakushi's (The Chinese poetry byHakukyoi吊xed to the world of Kanshi and Waka. Hakushi looks at spring as the peak of human life and, as springpasses by, the poet regrets the end of youth and the coming of older age. In Kanshi, Hakushi's `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March' appears unaltered. On the contrary when it comes to `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March'inりKokinshu", the focus seems to bemerely on the nostalgic feeling about the end of spring. Therefore `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March'in HKokinshu", while beinginfluenced by Hakvf蝣ski's, respects the originality of Waka started up withりManyoshu. On the other hand, `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> September'does not have any similar example in Chinese poetry, and can bethus thought of as a Japanese application <b>of</b> `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March'. This was applied first in the world of Kanshi,and than in Waka. However, as for as Kanshi is concerned, the focus stands in the longing for the gone chrysanthe-mum flower, a月ower which occur much in Chinese poetry. On the other hand, `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> September in"Kokinshu", though, merely expresses the nostalgic feeling about the end of autumn as spring, and respect thetradition of Wak alive ever since "Manyoshu". In my opinion, `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> September'represents the originalpoetical practice within "Kokinsh虎'of considering spring and autumn as opposite seasons. Therefore inバKokinshu ',･The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> September'was actually created in order to correspond for `The <b>last</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> March...|$|R
