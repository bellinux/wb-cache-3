5|$|Some {{gendarmerie}} actions, {{including the}} enforcement of government press censorship, {{and the use of}} conscripted civilian <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> infrastructure development, have been cited as factors leading to the Second Caco War (1918–20), a rebellion by Haitians against the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The labor tax {{took the}} form of conscripted <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> one month per year, which was imposed upon male commoners aged fifteen to fifty-six. This could be avoided in Eastern Han with a commutable tax, since hired labor became more popular.|$|E
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> nearly all unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E

5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.

The later invention of electric light and the telephone would also affect communication and urban life.|$|E
5|$|Various {{cases for}} rape, {{physical}} abuse and murder were prosecuted in court. Women, although usually having fewer rights by custom, {{were allowed to}} level civil and criminal charges against men. While suspects were jailed, convicted criminals were never imprisoned. Instead, punishments were commonly monetary fines, periods of forced hard <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> convicts, and the penalty of death by beheading. Early Han punishments of torturous mutilation were borrowed from Qin law. A series of reforms abolished mutilation punishments with progressively less-severe beatings by the bastinado.|$|E
5|$|Wealthy Egyptians {{were buried}} with larger {{quantities}} of luxury items, but all burials, regardless of social status, included goods for the deceased. Beginning in the New Kingdom, {{books of the}} dead {{were included in the}} grave, along with shabti statues that were believed to perform manual <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> them in the afterlife. Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials. After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} home, Houston {{negotiated}} a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In {{lieu of a}} cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, and he set about to build the Woodland home for his wife. The first child to be born {{in the house was}} Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.|$|E
5|$|All this {{economic}} power was ultimately under the pharaoh's control, and temple products and property were often taxed. Their employees, even the priests, {{were subject to}} the state corvée system, which conscripted <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> royal projects. They could also be ordered to provide supplies for some specific purposes. Harkhuf's trading expedition in the Old Kingdom was allowed to procure supplies from any temple it wished, and the mortuary temples of the Theban Necropolis in the New Kingdom oversaw the provision of the royally employed tomb workers at Deir el-Medina. Kings could also exempt temples or classes of personnel from taxation and conscription.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949–1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for their hard work, they were provided {{access to education}} and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real decision-making power.|$|E

5|$|Following Thomas Williams's {{sentence}} of one year's hard <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> publishing The Age of Reason in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when Richard Carlile included {{it in an}} edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and blasphemous libel. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of The Age of Reason in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.|$|E

5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of <b>Labor.</b> <b>For</b> the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready to pose a major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} of <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> shooting the starship models was decided early on by effects cameramen Peter Daulton and Pat Sweeney. There was {{an equal amount}} of work if one crew did all the Enterprise shots and another did the Bird of Prey, Klingon cruiser and Excelsior shots, so the cameramen flipped to decide who worked on which models. Old and new techniques were applied to shooting the models. To make sure the vessels were seamlessly inserted into star fields in post-production, the crew filmed second passes in overexposed yellow light, which reduced light spillage onto the bluescreen backdrop. The yellow overcast was removed by filtration in the optical process, with the result being a clean edge around the ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{hamlet of}} Port Kent and the {{connecting}} road were originally built in 1823. The village was planned {{to act as}} a source of <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> iron manufacturing and to provide for the industrial needs of Essex County. The hamlet grew and eventually became connected to Burlington, Vermont, via an hour-long ferry across Lake Champlain. The road that accessed Port Kent originally began in Keeseville, but became part of the longer Port Kent and Hopkinton Turnpike in the 1830s. The highway that is now NY373 was also designated as part of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

5|$|After {{coming to}} power, Rajoelina's HAT pursued action against Ravalomanana and his {{business}} interests. On 2 June 2009, Ravalomanana was fined 70 million US dollars (42 million British pounds) and sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} alleged abuse of office which, according to HAT Justice Minister Christine Razanamahasoa, included the December 2008 purchase of a second presidential jet ("Air Force II") worth $60 million. Rajoelina sold the controversial jet in 2012 and pursued legal action against Ravalomanana's company Tiko to reclaim 35 million US dollars in back taxes. Additionally, on 28 August 2010, the HAT sentenced Ravalomanana in absentia to hard <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> life and issued an arrest warrant {{for his role in the}} protests and ensuing deaths. Rajoelina likewise sought to distinguish himself from his predecessor in policy choices. One of Rajoelina's first measures as president was to cancel Ravalomanana's unpopular deal with Daewoo Logistics. He also rejected Ravalomanana's medium term development strategy, termed the Madagascar Action Plan, and abandoned education reforms initiated by his predecessor that adopted Malagasy and English as languages of instruction, instead returning to the traditional use of French.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} July 1, 1928, with convict <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> the easier {{portions}} and contractors for the remainder, {{as well as}} bridges and tunnels, but was slowed by the Great Depression. On the most difficult portion, between Cresta and Rock Creek, three tunnels had to be built at Arch Rock, Grizzly Dome, and Elephant Butte; at the former two, surveyors had to hang out on rope over steep granite slopes, and rockslides repeatedly caused delays. The commission dedicated the road at a ceremony at Grizzly Dome, halfway between the ends, on August 14, 1937. Construction had cost $8.15 million for 78 miles (126km) of new road. The remainder of the old trail from Quincy to the junction with Route 29 (now U.S. 395) east of Beckwourth Pass {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1931 as an extension of Route 21, and was paved by 1936. A new Route 87 was created in 1933, stretching from Woodland via Marysville and Oroville to Route 3 (State Route 99) southeast of Chico, including the present SR 70 between Marysville and Oroville. Route 87 from Woodland to Oroville and Route 21 from Oroville to east of Beckwourth Pass became a new State Route 24 in 1934; State Route 24 was extended southwest from Woodland to Oakland by the end of 1937.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{suggested}} a plan where the encomienda would be abolished and Indians would be congregated into self-governing townships to become tribute-paying vassals of the King. He still {{suggested that the}} loss of Indian <b>labor</b> <b>for</b> the colonists could be replaced by allowing importation of African slaves. Another important part of the plan was to introduce a new kind of sustainable colonization, and Las Casas advocated supporting the migration of Spanish peasants to the Indies where they would introduce small-scale farming and agriculture, a kind of colonization that didn't rely on resource depletion and Indian labor. Las Casas worked to recruit a large number of peasants who would want to travel to the Islands, where they would be given lands to farm, cash advances, and the tools and resources they needed to establish themselves there. The recruitment drive was difficult, and during the process the power relation shifted at court when Chancellor Sauvage, Las Casas's main supporter, unexpectedly died. In the end a much smaller number of peasant families were sent than originally planned, and they were supplied with insufficient provisions and no support secured for their arrival. Those who survived the journey were ill-received, and had to work hard even to survive in the hostile colonies. Las Casas was devastated by the tragic result of his peasant migration scheme, which he felt had been thwarted by his enemies. He decided instead to undertake a personal venture which would not rely on the support of others, and fought to win a land grant on the American mainland which was in its earliest stage of colonization.|$|E
