40|$|Mr. Teysmann, the indefatigable honorary Inspector of the {{cultures}} at Buitenzorg in Java, collected, amongst other objects of Natural history, several years ago, {{during a visit}} to the island of Sumba, commonly called Sandelwoodisland, two specimens of a pigeon of the genus Treron, which appears to belong to a species hitherto unknown to naturalists. This bird, dedicated to a gentlemen, who has rendered so many services to science, has its next allied species in Treron psittacea from Timor and in Treron floris inhabiting the island from which its epithet is taken. Ornithologists will remember that I brought the two latter species in a separate subdivision, distinguished from some other allied species of which Treron aromatica is the most remarkable, by their somewhat more lengthened tail. This subdivision was characterized by me (Muséum des Pays-Bas, tome 4, Columbae, p. 58) in the following terms. “Queue un peu allongée. Teintes générales du plumage d’un vert jaune, passablement vif en arrière du manteau, légèrement lavé de grisâtre sur les autres parties et se répandant uniformément sur tout le dessous de l’oiseau. De larges <b>lisérés</b> jaunes aux couvertures alaires grandes et moyennes, plus étroites aux rémiges secondaires. Blanc grisâtre du dessous des rectrices clair et occupant plus du dernier tiers de leur longueur. Souscaudales vertes, mais très largement bordées de blanc roussâtre. ” We have seen by this general diagnosis of the two species, that the male and female are of the same coloring, or in other words, that the male has not, as in Treron aromatica and griseicauda, the shoulders dark grey, nor the shoulder-feathers and the mantle tinged with brownish red inclining to purple. Our new species showing this same color, only on the hindest part of the mantle and the hinder shoulder-feathers, this circumstance leads to an addition to the diagnosis of the subdivision, giving {{at the same time a}} very conspicuous characteristic to our new species...|$|R

40|$|U radu se predstavljaju dosad nepoznati antependij i gremijal krčkog biskupa Giovannija della Torrea (Venecija, oko 1556. – Padova, 1623.), koji se čuvaju u zbirci liturgijskog ruha u gornjoj sakristiji krčke katedrale. Antependij je izrađen od dviju vrsta tkanina različitog uzorka, tafta lancé sa srebrnom lamé potkom, od kojega je izrađen i gremijal, te lampasa lancé. Ukrašen je biskupovim grbovima i križevima, izvedenim od srebrnih i pozlaćenih niti raskošnom tehnikom veza – canutiglie. Na osnovi analize tekstilnih i vezenih dijelova, kao i arhivskih podataka, za vjerovati je da su nastali tijekom prvih pet godina 17. stoljeća kao dio kompleta predviđenog za pontifikalnu liturgiju. Riječ je o opsežnoj i skupocjenoj narudžbi zasigurno ostvarenoj posredovanjem samog biskupa, vrlo vjerojatno u Lombardiji. This paper {{focuses on}} the {{hitherto}} unknown parts of the pontifical ornate, namely the antependium and the gremial veil, of Giovanni della Torre (b. ca. 1555 in Venice – d. 1623 in Padua), bishop of Krk and the apostolic legate in Lucerne. They are preserved {{in the collection of}} liturgical vestments in the upper sacristy of the Krk cathedral. Based on an analysis of fabric and embroidery, as well as archival records, they can be dated to {{the first five years of}} the 17 th century, when they were produced as part of the ceremonial set intended for the pontifical liturgy. The antependium is divided into a central field, vertical rows, and an upper horizontal band, which ends with decorative tassels. This division is additionally accentuated by the use of fabrics with different patterns: taffeta lancé with a weft of lamé, which is also the fabric of the gremial veil, and lampas lancé, which is also the fabric of the vertical side rows and the upper horizontal field of the antependium. It is a multi-layered type of fabric consisting of two sets of base threads: the main one in red (crimson-purple) and the subsidiary (connecting) one in cream colour, as well as four sets of weft for the decoration. A special feature is the use of double silver tirà thread as one of the lancé wefts. The pattern of the lampas fabric, with gauge dimensions 16 × 14 cm, consists of a central motif of flower bouquet surrounded by two voluminous cornucopias with protruding ramified foliage, ending in a flower that resembles the acanthus bud. In terms of typology, the composition belongs to the group a maglie ovali a doppia punta. However, the Spanish-Moorish details typical of this group have here been replaced by motifs from Italian late Renaissance and Mannerist tradition, which allows for an association, especially in terms of ornament development, with fabrics a grottesche such as the lampas at Museo Poldi Pezzoli in Milan (inv. nr. 4547). Nevertheless, the lampas of Krk is closer to the group of luxurious fabrics of Lombard provenance in its specific pattern, with peculiarly interwoven, richly ramified foliage and vegetal or annular stylized floral motifs. Striking analogies are to be found in the colour gamut, where lighter hues are used for the base and the filling of motifs, emphasized by a border in a stronger tone. The base of such fabrics is often enhanced by means of metal weft threads, whereby a frequent use of weft featuring a full silver tirà thread can be observed. Similar fabrics include the lampas lancé (II Da 111) and lampas <b>liseré</b> lancé (II Da 114) from the Gandini collection at Museo Civico d’ Arte di Modena, as well as the lampas lancé broché of the mass garment at Santuario della Beata Vergine in Tirano. There are also considerable similarities with the lampas lancé of the humeral veil from the cathedral of Santa Maria in Novara. Another fabric in the antependium is taffeta lancé in its central field. The base is made of silk taffeta, whereby both the base and the weft are cream-coloured and the pattern is created by means of additional weft threads of metal lancé – silver lamé weft. The ornamental composition consists of four types of stylized branches and belongs to the a isolato type, which evolved in the 17 th century as a variant of the a mazze type. Two larger, S-shaped branches with triple floral endings alternate in the horizontal rows, changing their slant with each individual row. Their sequence creates empty spaces filled with two types of smaller, horizontally laid and curving branches. The antependium is additionally decorated with the bishop’ s heraldry and crosses, performed in silver and golden threads using a luxurious embroidery technique called canutiglie. The central field is dominated by a richly ornamented Greek cross, with two coats-of-arms of Bishop della Torre on either side. Three smaller, similarly ornamented Greek crosses are appliqued to the upper horizontal band of the antependium, as well as the gremial veil. Another precious element is the decorative tassels on the antependium and the gremial veil, which are of the same date as the fabrics and a rarity in the preserved textile heritage of Croatia. All this indicates that the fabrics and the embroidery of the Krk antependium were produced at the same time and by the same weaving workshop, which is also manifest in the same width of the fabrics (56 cm) and their identical edges (two thicker threads woven into the taffeta). The construction elements of the Krk fabrics, particularly details such as the use of a tirà thread, as well as the composition and the way of creating ornaments (by combining red, white, and yellow fields) are similar to numerous examples of Lombard fabrics, which has led the author to suggest the same provenance...|$|E
