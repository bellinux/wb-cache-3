Our empirical study leads to the three conclusions. First, trade openness has accelerated economic growth, though with some {{negative impact on the}} development of labor-intensive industries; Second, economic growth has had a positive effect on trade openness, but again negatively impacted the development of <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> Third, the expansion of <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> has had negative effects on both trade openness and economic growth...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} most foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) flows from developed to developed countries (North-North) in skilled <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> This paper builds a model that incorporates labor training into the proximity-concentration tradeoffs to analyze the entry mode of multinationals to a foreign country. Production requires both skilled labor and unskilled labor. A multinational pursuing FDI needs to provide training to some workers in the host country to equip them with skills that are specific {{to the production of}} the firm. Labor training and skill specificity lead to contract friction. It is shown that in skilled <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> FDI increases along with the economic development level of the host country, whereas in unskilled <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> the reverse is true. This paper provides a theoretical explanation for the empirical findings on the prevalence of North-North FDI in skilled labor-industries and North-South FDI in unskilled <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|The term de-industrialization {{crisis has}} been used to {{describe}} the decline of <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labor-intensive manufacturing. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labor-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to third world countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labor, such as industrial robots, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.|$|E

40|$|November 14, 2007 Preliminary and incompleteWe {{investigate}} how politics (party orientation, national elections, {{and strength of}} democratic institutions) affect stock market volatility. We hypothesize that <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> industries with larger exposure to foreign trade, industries whose operations require efficient contracts, and industries susceptible to government expropriation are more sensitive to changes in political environment. Using a large panel of industry-country-year observations, we show that politically-sensitive industries exhibit higher volatilities during national elections. Volatility is also higher for <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> under leftist governments. Moreover, governance-sensitive industries and industries under {{a higher risk of}} expropriation are more volatile when democratic institutions are weak. The rise in volatility is driven largely by systematic risk rather than firm-specific risk. The results are consistent with the 'peso problem' hypothesis that uncertainty about future government policies can increase stock market volatility...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how {{the garment}} {{industry}} escapes this vicious cycle and argues for {{the validity of}} <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> {{as a starting point}} for full-fledged industrialization, even though it might at first seem to be a digression from the path to an innovation-led economy. By examining original firm-level data on garment-producing firms collected in 2002 and 2008 in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Kenya and Madagascar, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) low wages, though still sufficient for poverty reduction, are the main source of competitiveness in low-income countries; (2) after the successful initiation of industrialization causes wages to begin to rise, there is still a possibility for productivity enhancement; and (3) skill bias in technological progress is not yet a major factor, implying that the garment industry is still a <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry.</b> In sum, <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> should not be discounted as a part of the development strategy of low-income countries...|$|E

40|$|Malaysia is {{a rapidly}} growing and resource-rich country that has been industrializing since the late 1960 s. Its {{industrialization}} has relied on the growth of <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> particularly the electronics and electrical-products industries, which have {{contributed significantly to the}} growth of the manufacturing sector. The growth and opening up of China has raised concerns about Malaysia's loss of competitiveness to China and the diversion of foreign direct investment to China. This paper examines the relative competitive position of Malaysia and China and explores Malaysia's responses and policy options, both international and national, to the challenges posed by China. The following policy recommendations for Malaysia are explored: working intensively with its partners in ASEAN to develop a common stand with regard to trade arrangements, forming bilateral free trade agreements with selected countries, restructuring Malaysia's manufacturing industries so they are far less dependent on <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> and improving the education and technological skills of Malaysia's labor force.

30|$|It has {{historically}} been argued that the modern textile industry including garment manufacturing is suited to early economies and {{plays a key role}} in the initial industrialization process. This is due to its labor-intensive demands plus a low prerequisite level of technology (Kelegama 2009). Using this <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry,</b> many developed countries have achieved their modern society and have become advanced countries. Korea is one of these countries that have a well-developed production, marketing structure, and a powerful export influence on global markets in the apparel sector (Son and Kenji 2013).|$|E

Without free international lending and borrowing it is known that, whereas the less (time-) patient country decumulates real capital, the more patient country accumulates real capital and eventually specializes in a capital-intensive industry. However, free trade of international financial assets causes a dramatic change in long-run specialization patterns. In this case the less patient country may well specialize in the capital-intensive industry and the more patient country in the <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industry.</b> Copyright (c) 2010 The Ohio State University. ...|$|E

This process takes two different forms: in <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> it leads to spatial fragmentation; in industries with strong input-output relations, agglomerations are conserved, although they shift toward the low labor cost country.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} China {{in the world}} trade raises important questions on its impact on importing countries. This paper studies how import competition from China has affected wages in the Chilean Manufacturing Industry. Using plant-level data for the period 1996 - 2005, we find that increasing imports from China have tended to depress real wages in manufacturing plants. This negative effect on manufacturing workers is heterogeneous. We find that firms in <b>labor-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> and smaller firms have been quantitatively more affected by Chinese competition. These results hold to correction for sample selection and alternative measures of import competition from low-wages countries. ...|$|R
