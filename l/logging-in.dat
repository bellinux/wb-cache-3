40|$|A microcomputer-based, net-lending {{interlibrary loan}} system was {{developed}} at Lane Medical Library, Stanford University. The system, designed {{to generate the}} monthly billing invoices and all necessary statistical reports, has reduced the time required for <b>logging-in</b> procedures and compilation of monthly, quarterly, and annual statistics. User menus, help screens, and choice fields were developed explicitly for library staff who {{have little or no}} computer experience. The program was written using the DataEase database management software running on IBM PC, XT, AT, or compatible with a minimum of 512 K RAM. Described are features of this automated interlibrary loan management system and its use in a net-lending interlibrary loan department. It focuses on data entry in the "Library Directory" and "ILL Log Sheet," details of billing invoices, and statistical reports, and flexibility in modifying tax rates, borrowing fees, and other parameters...|$|E
40|$|The SUERC Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory has {{recently}} replaced its spreadsheet-based record keeping {{with a new}} database program, custom designed to help laboratory staff manage the high throughput of nearly 5000 cathodes in the past year. The system can accept data {{from a variety of}} sources in addition to manual entry; experimental results can be uploaded from spreadsheets, while integration with graphitisation lines means that graphite yields are automatically recorded. The system is able to pass radiocarbon results directly to OxCal 4 for calibration, with the resulting plots incorporated into the dating certificates issued to submitters. There are also benefits to submitters, with electronic sample submission both eliminating transcription errors and speeding up the <b>logging-in</b> process which keeps turnaround times down. For bone samples, data on collagen yields are now stored electronically and are more readily obtainable from the laboratory. The new SUERC Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory database will make a significant contribution to maintaining the high quality of results produced by the laboratory, aiding staff in tracking sample progress and monitoring quality assurance (QA) samples going through the laboratory, eliminating transcription errors and making communication easier between laboratory staff and sample submitters...|$|E
40|$|From being a mere {{communication}} tool, {{mobile phones}} {{have become an}} indispensable gadget now-a-days. There are 864. 72 million mobile subscribers (Annual Report 2012 - 13) and thus the mobile telecommunications system in India is the second largest in the world. Over 18 million mobile connections are being added every month. The field of journalism is no exception to the trend as mobile phone has become an essential tool for working journalists in news reporting. By using the mobile phones one can gather and disseminate {{the information in the}} form of text (SMS), audio or video (MMS), or sometimes a combination of all these. An OB Van besides being expensive, it needs a crew of at least two and may amounts to spend a few thousands rupees for its operations. With software like Qik and a connected mobile phone, Journalists can broadcast live video within seconds by <b>logging-in</b> the programs on their phone. Even news feed in the form of footage and photos of major incidents- 9 / 11 WTO attack, Tsunami in 2004, Bombing of Taj Hotels in India’s financial capital- which were captured by the eye witness in their mobiles were largely used by the news organizations. A more recent mobile phone technology known as 3 G, for ―third generation, ‖ enables multi-media on mobile phones plus fast connections and audio-video options. This article analyses how the mobile phone is used for news gathering, whether it is useful in conflict-sensitive reporting, whether it can be useful in recording exclusive visuals in investigating reporting. Also, this paper investigates whether mobile phones have improved the working conditions for journalists...|$|E
40|$|Penelitian ini bertujuan menghasilkan: (1) model sistem inferensi dalam mengambil keputusan untuk memilih butir-butir tes yang tepat bagi siswa, (2) perangkat lunak Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) dengan algoritma logika fuzzy dalam mendeskripsikan kemampuan siswa. Penelitian dengan pen-dekatan Research and Development (R & D), terdiri atas dua bagian yaitu: (1) pengembangan program CAT, (2) pengujian program CAT pada siswa SMA Negeri 6 Yogyakarta kelas XII sebagai sampel, pada mata pelajaran Matematika dengan pokok bahasan Notasi sigma, barisan dan deret. Data dikumpulkan melalui observasi, dokumentasi, dan angket dan dianalisis secara deskriptif kuantitatif. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan program CAT: (1) mudah digunakan, tampilan interaktif, memiliki sistem keamanan, mudah diakses, dan mengacu standar kekinian, (2) dapat mengenali tiga macam pengguna saat proses login, (3) memiliki tiga macam basis data, (4) memiliki sembilan menu utama, (5) menggunakan model sistem inferensi algoritma logika fuzzy, (6) model tampilan program CAT, (7) dapat bekerja sesuai dengan fungsi dan jenis pengguna, dan (8) mampu mengelola: (a) bank soal, (b) mengemas butir-butir tes secara otomatis sesuai dengan kemampuan siswa, (c) pilihan jawaban dimunculkan secara acak, dan (d) menyimpan rekaman hasil tes secara individu maupun bersama-sama. Kata kunci: program CAT, bank soal ______________________________________________________________ DEVELOPING A COMPUTERIZED-ADAPTIVE TESTING WITH FUZZY LOGIC ALGORITHM Abstract The {{development}} of the Computerized-Adaptive Testing (CAT) aimed to investigate: 1) the performance of inference system in making decision to select the appropriate test items for the students, and 2) the performance of CAT program using fuzzy logic algorithm in describing the competence of students. This research and development (R&D) consists of two parts: (1) developing the CAT, (2) tested testing the CAT on mathematics at the topics of Sigma notation, sequence and series. Data were collected through observation, documentation and questionnaire and analyzed using quantitative descriptive technique. The result showed that: (1) the CAT user friendly, interactive, secure, accessible, and current and (2) able to recognize three types of users while <b>logging-in</b> three types of data bases, that nine options on the main menu {{it is able to}} work properly according to the function and the type of users, and administrered the bank and organize test items automatically, based on students’ competence, randomize the answer in the options, and record the result of the test simultaneously and individually.
