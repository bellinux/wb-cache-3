40|$|Biosafety {{refers to}} the efforts taken in {{ensuring}} {{the safety of the}} application of biotechnology, which necessitates for proactive steps to be taken to “reduce and eliminate the potential risks resulting from biotechnology and its products”. Modern biotechnology has enabled scientists to genetically and biochemically modify plants, animals as well as microorganisms. In the effort to increase crop production for the purpose of securing global food supply, the application of biotechnology in the agricultural sector must be carried out in a safe and sustainable manner. The recognition of the potential risks to {{human health and the environment}} must not be discounted and countries looking towards the application of biotechnology must ensure its safe application. The need for further regulations on biosafety was discussed in 1992, when the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted. Article 19 (3) of the Convention requires its members to consider the need for a protocol on “the safe transfer, handling and use of any <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> resulting from biotechnology that may have adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. ” This consequently led to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (CPB), which primarily regulates the trans-boundary movement of living modified organisms (LMOs) or alternatively known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs). In Malaysia, the Biosafety Act 2007 (BSA) was passed to regulate the release, importation, exportation and contained use of GMOs in order to protect inter alia human, plant and animal health as well as the environment and biological diversity. This paper highlights the issues pertaining to liability and redress, which provides for the legal obligation to compensate the damage especially to the environment accruing from the trans-boundary movement of the GMOs, as well as the position of the present Malaysian biosafety law. </p...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{production}} contributes {{for about}} 92 % {{of the food}} needs of humanity (Borlaug 2002). The unprecedented crop yield increases from the Green Revolution varieties have dramatically improved the level of food supply particularly to the world’s poor since the 1960 s. The roots of such crop yield increases lie in {{the advent of the}} science of genetics in the early 20 th century. Genetics continues to provide the knowledge base for the recombination of agronomic traits of economic importance through plant breeding. In recent decades, the incremental understanding of the molecular basis of genetics and associated sciences has yielded powerful tools and techniques collectively termed as biotechnology. Advances in biotechnology offer opportunities to improve crop productivity and to enhance crop product quality. Increased yields mean reduced environmental degradation brought about by agricultural land expansion, which is a common feature of African farming systems. In crop agriculture, biotechnology encompasses the production of genetically modified crops, micropropagation, marker assisted breeding, genomics and bioinformatics (DeVries and Toenniessen 2001). Of all these, advances in genetic modification came along with uncertainties this technology might entail on biodiversity, human health and socio-economic development. Cognizant of these potentials and pitfalls, Agenda 21 (Chapter 16) of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) detailed program of action to create enabling conditions, including technology transfer, for the safe application of biotechnology for sustainable development particularly in developing countries. UNCED explicitly noted the opportunity biotechnology offers for international partnership between biodiversity rich countries in the South and technologically proficient countries in the North. Modalities to enhance such partnership and avert inter-country disputes arising from expansion of biotechnology were further agreed in the succeeding Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and, more recently, the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the CBD.

However, the population of L. oratorius between transgenic and control were not significant different. There are three genera of generalist predator observed such as Paederus, Coccinella, and Cyrthorinus.

40|$|Nowadays, Dengue fever is one ofthe major {{epidemic}} {{diseases in}} urban, semi-urban, {{and rural areas}} in tropical and subtropical countries. This mosquito transmitted viral disease is considered as fastest transmitted mosquito disease and spread in over 100 countries. Based on WHO report in 2 QI 0, Southeast Asia (SEA) and Western Pacific (WP) regions bear nearly 75 % of current disease population. This disease is transmitted using two species of mosquitoes, the main vector Aedes aegypti (L.) and the less competent vector A. albopictus. For many years, controlling dengue disease is carried out through killing the mosquito larvae. This is usually carried out by using chemical methods which cause many enviromnental problems and human and animal toxicity. Another approach was developed by using the biological control agent Bacillus thuringiensisI var israelensis as specific and safe larvicidal agent. However, after many years application, some resistance varieties were developed and thus decrease the agent efficiency. More recently, based on the many years and innovative research in University of Florida in USA, a newly discovered protein called Trypsin Modulating Oostatic Factor (TMOF) showed strong larvicidal activity in aquatic Enviromnent. TMOF consist of 10 amino acid sequence ofthe hormone (YDPAPPPPPP) kuown as mosquito decapeptide. The hormone synthesized by the ovaries after the blood meal, circulates in the hemolymph, binds to gut receptor and stops trypsin biosynthesis. A unique primary and stable amino acid from gut proteolytic enzymes that can interferes with digestion of mosquito larvae, leading to their starvation by termination of trypsin biosynthesis in their midgut. No harm to humans or the enviromnent is expected from use of TMOF as a pesticide active ingredient. The genes for making TMOF have been inserted into yeast cells (Pichia pastoris) so the yeast cells make large amounts of the protein. The yeast cells are then killed by exposure to extremely high temperatures. Killed yeast cells containing TMOF are applied to bodies of water to control mosquito larvae. Once eaten by mosquito larvae, TMOF interferes with the production of trypsin, a critical enzyme needed by the larval digestive system. Exposed larvae are unable to digest food and therefore starve to death. Since late 2008, Institute of Bioproduct Development (IBD) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) is working in long term strategic partner for EntoGenex Co. (the TMOF technology owner) for technology transfer, bioprocess development, large scale production, and final product formulation. The IBD bioprocessing microbial platform is a complete integrated upstream/downstream platform to complete the process and production chain from microbe vial to finished product. IBD is currently the first and biggest bioprocessing facilities among Malaysian universities and the currently the only approved facility by Genetic Modification Advisory Committee (GMAC) under the Biosafety Act 2007 for running <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organism</b> (LMO) for large scale production up to 1500 L fermentation capacity.

This makes necessary to check every batch previous delivery to the recipient country. Several PCR protocols have been proposed to detect the presence of GMO DNA in a sample due to its sensitivity and independence of environmental and physiological influences. However, most of them are qualitative assays and dont give a good quantitative estimation of the detected signal. We developed a semi-quantitative method based on the comparison of the mass of the amplification product of the sample with the mass obtained from standard samples of known GMO concentration delivering an accurate estimation of the amount of GMO in a sample. At the same time the reaction is countersigned by an internal reaction control. A strict set up of the conditions is essential to control error-prone steps (like the quantification of the DNA template and of the DNA products and pipetting errors) that may bias the result.

The protocol makes clear that GMOs include all <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> (LMO) defined as "any living organism that possesses a novel combination of genetic material obtained {{through the use of}} modern biotechnology". This includes seeds, live fish, and other organisms intentionally obtained for release to the environment. It would seem that the common understanding about GMOs as referring to farm-to-table products is perforce expanded to embrace genetically modified farm animals and aquatic resources. Being a trade agreement, the Montreal accord primarily deals with the safety issues related to the transboundary movement of LMOs around the globe. The OECD conference on the other hand, called for an international body "to address all sides of the GM debate" in response to the public outcry, particularly in Western Europe, regarding the risks the new products pose to human health and the environment.

The adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol) contributes to the development of an international regulatory framework to enable international trade in environmentally sound applications of biotechnology. This book analyses the legal aspects of implementing the Cartagena Protocol. It provides a serious contribution to current legal and academic debates on biosafety by analysing key issues under the Cartagena Protocol that affect the design and implementation of national biosafety regulatory regimes, in a manner that takes the principles of sustainable development law into account, and can inform future evolution of the international regime.

Agricultural biotechnology provides a pertinent example following the negotiation of the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity to govern the trans-boundary movement of <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms.</b> This thesis explores the potential for overlapping jurisdiction between the specialised regimes of international environmental and trade law, with a particular focus on trade disputes involving agricultural biotechnology. This thesis initially considers the concept of fragmentation of international law and the consequences of the {{proliferation of}} judicial institutions. Next, the historical development of international environmental law and international trade law is explored, which has laid the foundation for potential parallel dispute proceedings before multiple judicial institutions. The thesis then analyses the principles of conflict of jurisdiction that may assist to resolve these disputes, and applies them to the case study of trade disputes involving agricultural biotechnology. The thesis concludes by considering the options available for addressing conflict of jurisdiction between the international trade and international environmental law regimes...|$|R
30|$|In 2010, EFSA {{published}} a guidance document for the ERA of GMOs [3]. The {{aim of this}} document was to further develop and update the guidelines of the ERA previously available [1]. In the guidance document, EFSA requires that the biological relevance of {{statistically significant differences between}} the GMO and the non-GM comparator should be assessed, also considering potentially hazardous environmental implications [3]. EFSA clearly recognises that such differences could be linked to morphological alterations or metabolic perturbations or may indicate unintended effects which may lead to environmental harm. Any identified potential adverse effects should be linked to assessment endpoints in order to quantitatively evaluate the potential environmental harm. These assessment endpoints are then translated into measurement endpoints for which a Limit of Concern (LoC) has to be defined. EFSA defines Limits of Concern as ‘the minimum ecological effects that are deemed biologically relevant and that are deemed of sufficient magnitude to cause harm’ [3]. By testing whether the observed effect falls within the LoC, the biological relevance of the observed effect is determined. According to EFSA, LoCs can be derived from literature data, baseline data, modelling, existing knowledge, or policy goals and shall be explicitly stated and justified by the applicant [3]. The setting of the LoC and the definition of environmental harm are therefore considered crucial for the ERA of a GMO and in particular also for the assessment of potential effects on non-target organisms [7]. The necessity to set thresholds when determining acceptability of risks has also been recognised in international guidelines for the risk assessment of <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> [8].|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{characterization}} {{technology in}} genetically <b>modified</b> <b>organisms,</b> {{in addition to}} how transgenic biotechnologies are developed now require full transparency to assess the risk to <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> and non-modified <b>organisms.</b> Next generation sequencing (NGS) methodology is suggested as an effective means in genome characterization and detection of transgenic insertion locations. In the present study, we applied NGS to insert transgenic loci, specifically the epidermal growth factor (EGF) in genetically modified rice cells. A total of 29. 3 Gb (~ 72 × coverage) was sequenced with a 2 × 150 bp paired end method by Illumina HiSeq 2500, which was consecutively mapped to the rice genome and T-vector sequence. The compatible pairs of reads were successfully mapped to 10 loci on the rice chromosome and vector sequences were validated to the insertion location by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The EGF transgenic site was confirmed only on chromosome 4 by PCR. Results of this study demonstrated the success of NGS data to characterize the rice genome. Bioinformatics analyses must be developed in association with NGS data to identify highly accurate transgenic sites...|$|R
50|$|Biotechnology {{involves}} <b>modifying</b> <b>living</b> <b>organisms</b> {{to serve}} human goals. Biological techniques {{are derived from}} a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few. In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms). As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members.|$|R
40|$|Biotechnology or the {{engineering}} {{of the genetic}} material of species can give way to avenues of possibilities {{for the benefit of}} people, fauna and flora but also has the potential of posing untold and undiscovered threats to human beings and other living organisms. One of the first attempts to legislate on international rules on biotechnology {{can be traced back to}} article 19 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1992. The CBD is indeed the first international legal instrument apart from the then European Community’s relevant directives to suggest that biotechnology is a matter of concern for the international community while providing a basis upon which more detailed procedures would be elaborated in the field of biosafety. While the CBD includes international rules on access to genetic resources, access to and the transfer of technology, the handling of biotechnology and the distribution of its benefits, it does not include a detailed regulation on genetically <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> (GMOs) and their possible adverse effects on the environment, human and animal health. It was only with the coming into existence of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol) to the CBD in 2000 that the safe transfer, handling and use of <b>living</b> <b>modified</b> <b>organisms</b> (LMOs) such as genetically engineered plants, animals, and microbes were at last being catered for, albeit leaving aside the broader categories of GMOs. Due to the need for the negotiators of this protocol to make compromises, there were still key issues on the international biosafety framework pertaining mainly to the scope of the GMOs to be covered by this protocol and by the Advanced Informed Agreement procedure; identification and traceability issues; and liability and redress issues. Nine years after the entry into force of the Cartagena Protocol the transboundary movements of GMOs have clearly increased with new categories of GMOs and genetically modified products to regulate. The debate on the safety of GMOs used for food and feed as well as the effects of GMOs on the receiving environment is still very lively throughout the world, amidst a lack of traceability of GMOs or epidemiological studies in the GMO-producing countries. However, there has been some progress on liability and redress with regard to damage resulting from the transboundary movement of LMOs with the adoption of rules and procedures for liability and redress in 2010 with the Nagoya-Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol "(hereafter the Nagoya SP) " to the Cartagena Protocol, which is yet to enter into force. There are also concerns on the harmonisation of national biosafety regulation, risk assessment and risk management standards, the interpretation of socio-economic considerations, and the monitoring of compliance with the provisions of the Cartagena The scope of the GMOs covered by the Cartagena Protocol is discussed first, which discussion is followed by the discussion of identification and traceability issues, the harmonisation of national biosafety regulation, the harmonisation of risk assessment and risk management standards, the scope of the relevant socio-economic considerations, implementation, and concerns about the settlement of disputes. ...|$|R
