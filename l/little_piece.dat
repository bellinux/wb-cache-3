500|$|For his London acts, Leno {{purchased}} {{songs from}} the foremost music hall writers and composers. One such composer was Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes. Other well-known composers of the day who supplied Leno with numbers included Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, Leno commissioned George Le Brunn to compose the incidental music to many of his songs, including [...] "The Detective", [...] "My Old Man", [...] "Chimney on Fire", [...] "The Fasting Man", [...] "The Jap", [...] "All Through A <b>Little</b> <b>Piece</b> of Bacon" [...] and [...] "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also provided the incidental music for three of Leno's best-known songs that depicted life in everyday occupations: [...] "The Railway Guard" [...] (1890), [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] and [...] "The Waiter" [...] (both from 1891). The songs in each piece became instantly distinctive and familiar to Leno's audiences, but his occasional changes to the characterisations kept the sketches fresh and topical.|$|E
500|$|Muir {{suggests}} that the feel of The Day After Tomorrow is [...] "a little more colourful (less minimalist) in colour and costume than Space: 1999s sterling [...] ", with such elements as Wadsworth's [...] "hard-hitting, hard-driving musical score" [...] livening up the proceedings. The music has also received praise from Law, who notes a [...] "dynamic pace", as well as Anderson himself. Muir summarises the final product as a [...] "Year One-style 'awe and mystery of space' narrative, but one conveyed in the more colourful-looking or -sounding [...] fashion", and a [...] "time capsule of once-state-of-the-art science fiction". To Law, it is [...] "half-forgotten experiment which is now perhaps only of interest to aficionados", but [...] "an interesting look at what might have been" [...] if Anderson {{had been able to}} produce a full series. Mills interprets it as a [...] "solid <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> of 70s juvenile sci-fi" [...] that is perhaps [...] "not quite as 'scientifically accurate' as it pretends to be, but fun".|$|E

500|$|In early 1875, Carte was {{managing}} London's Royalty Theatre. [...] Needing a short piece {{to round out}} an evening's entertainment featuring the popular Offenbach operetta La Périchole he brought W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan together. [...] On tour in 1871, Carte had conducted Arthur Sullivan's one-act comic opera Cox and Box, which received an 1874 London revival. [...] In 1873, W. S. Gilbert had offered a libretto to Carte about an English courtroom, {{but at the time}} Carte knew of no composer available to set it to music. [...] Carte remembered Gilbert's libretto and suggested to Gilbert that Sullivan write the music for a one-act comic opera, Trial by Jury, which was quickly composed and added to the Royalty's bill in March 1875. [...] The witty and [...] "very English" [...] <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> proved even more popular than La Périchole and became the first great success of Carte's scheme to found his school of English comic opera, playing for 300 performances from 1875 to 1877, as well as touring and enjoying many revivals.|$|E
500|$|It {{would be}} {{nearly four years}} after Thespis was {{produced}} before the two men worked together again. In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch libretto in Fun magazine entitled [...] "Trial by Jury: An Operetta". In 1873, Gilbert arranged with the theatrical manager and composer, Carl Rosa, to expand the piece into a one-act libretto. Rosa's wife was to sing {{the role of the}} plaintiff. However, Rosa's wife died in childbirth in 1874. Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to Richard D'Oyly Carte, but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the Royalty Theatre, and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to Offenbach's La Périchole. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and Trial by Jury was composed in a matter of weeks. The <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of La Périchole and being revived at another theatre.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> of the cake, but I get to show off really more. I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the first}} {{performance}} of Trial by Jury were uniformly glowing. [...] Fun magazine declared the opera [...] "extremely funny and admirably composed", while the rival Punch magazine wrote that it [...] "is the funniest bit of nonsense your representative has seen for a considerable time", only regretting {{that it was too}} short. [...] The Daily News praised the author: [...] "In whimsical invention and eccentric humour Mr. W. S. Gilbert has no living rival among our dramatic writers, and never has his peculiar vein of drollery and satire been more conspicuous than in a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> entitled Trial by Jury". [...] The Daily Telegraph concluded that the piece illustrated the composer's [...] "great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class". [...] Many critics emphasised the happy combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music. [...] One noted that [...] "so completely is each imbued with the same spirit, that it would be as difficult to conceive the existence of Mr. Gilbert's verses without Mr. Sullivan's music, as of Mr. Sullivan's music without Mr. Gilbert's verses. [...] Each gives each a double charm." [...] Another agreed that [...] "it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his music}} hall acts, Leno created {{characters}} based on observations mostly {{about life in}} London, including , grocer's assistants, beefeaters, huntsmen, racegoers, firemen, fathers, henpecked husbands, garrulous wives, pantomime dames, a police officer, a fireman and a hairdresser. [...] For his London acts, Leno purchased songs from the foremost music hall writers and composers, including Harry King, who wrote many of Leno's early successes, Harry Dacre and Joseph Tabrar. From 1890, George Le Brunn composed the music to many of Leno's songs and sketches, including [...] "The Detective", [...] "My Old Man", [...] "Chimney on Fire", [...] "The Fasting Man", [...] "The Jap", [...] "All Through a <b>Little</b> <b>Piece</b> of Bacon" [...] and [...] "The Detective Camera". Le Brunn also wrote the music for three of Leno's best known sketches that depicted life in everyday occupations: [...] "The Railway Guard" [...] (1890), [...] "The Shopwalker" [...] and The Waiter" [...] (both from 1891). Leno made 14 short films {{towards the end of}} his life, most as himself, and four as an actor. [...] He generally portrayed a bumbling buffoon who struggles to carry out everyday tasks, such as riding a bicycle. In An Obstinate Cork (1902), one of Leno's few surviving films, he struggles to pull a cork out of a champagne bottle while on a picnic with his wife Lydia.|$|E
500|$|... "Fix a Heart" [...] is a pop piano ballad with {{a length}} of three minutes and {{thirteen}} seconds. According to the digital sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, it is composed in the key of C major and has a tempo of 54 beats per minute. Lovato's vocals span from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. The singer performs the verses in a low register, while the chorus is sang in a higher note. Sputnikmusic's Raul Stanciu noted that the singer's voice [...] "never go full power, only for the chorus". Similarly, Rick Florino of Artistdirect wrote that the artist [...] "breaks from a whisper into [...] stadium-size refrain". The track {{has been described by}} some critics and the singer herself as a break-up song, which is demonstrated in the chorus, [...] "Baby, I just ran out of bandaids / I don't even know where to start / 'Cause you can bandage the damage / You never really can fix a heart". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy wrote that Lovato [...] "openly admits her weaknesses, including an ability to move on from a broken heart left behind by a former love". Regarding the line [...] "You never really can fix a heart", the artist told Glamour that, [...] "I think every time you get your heart broken, there's a <b>little</b> <b>piece</b> of it that chips away, and I don't think you ever get that piece back. But I think you're able to bandage it with time and with new people and other things that make you happy".|$|E
