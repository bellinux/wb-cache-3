5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse.

The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing {{the soul of the}} sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, <b>Litany</b> <b>of</b> Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulties}} with Garrard's election over Benjamin Logan in 1795 {{added to a}} <b>litany</b> <b>of</b> complaints about the state's first constitution.

Others opposed life terms for judges and other state officials. Still others wanted slavery excluded from the document, or to lift the ban on ministers serving in the General Assembly. In the aftermath of the disputed 1795 election, all parties involved agreed that changes were needed. The present constitution provided no means for amendment, however. The only remedy was another constitutional convention.|$|E
