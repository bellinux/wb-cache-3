40|$|We {{present a}} new {{algorithm}} for estimating the Personalized PageRank (PPR) between a source and target node on undirected graphs, with sublinear running-time guarantees over the worst-case choice of source and target nodes. Our work builds {{on a recent}} line of work on bidirectional estimators for PPR, which obtained sublinear running-time guarantees but in an average-case sense, for a uniformly random choice of target node. Crucially, we show how the reversibility of random walks on undirected networks can be exploited to convert average-case to worst-case guarantees. While past bidirectional methods combine forward random walks with reverse <b>local</b> <b>pushes,</b> our algorithm combines forward <b>local</b> <b>pushes</b> with reverse random walks. We also discuss how to modify our methods to estimate random-walk probabilities for any length distribution, thereby obtaining fast algorithms for estimating general graph diffusions, including the heat kernel, on undirected networks.

40|$|In {{the context}} of recent growth in UK self-employment, the {{relationship}} between self-employment choices and local economic and labour market conditions is investigated to address whether self-employment is associated with <b>local</b> ?<b>push?</b> or ?pull?. Empirical analysis is conducted using UK longitudinal data linked to local area unemployment and earnings data. Analysis shows that pull factors are more significant in driving transitions into self-employment. Self-employed business ownership appears not {{to function as a}} significant alternative to unemployment where paid employment demand is weak. Entrepreneurial activity prospers where local wages are higher and unemployment lower...|$|R

Basing our model on existing work, we note several problems associated with crowd density in an existing model and recommend solutions. Analysis of our model shows significant effects of force on the crowd, as well as significant effects of crowd density when measuring the number of agents still trapped inside the space after a fixed time...|$|R

40|$|Markup languages, representations, schemas, {{and tools}} have {{significantly}} increased {{the ability for}} organizations to share their information. Languages such as the Extensible Markup Language (XML) provide a vehicle for organizations to represent information in a common, machine-interpretable format. Furthermore languages, such as the Document Type Definition Language (DTD) and XML Schema Definition Language (XSD) allow organizations to share the schema and structure of their data. Though these approaches facilitate the collaboration and integration of inter-organizational information, {{the reality is that}} the schema languages are reasonably difficult to learn, and automated schema integration (without semantics or ontology mappings) is currently an open problem. We introduce an architecture to facilitate organizational collaboration.
