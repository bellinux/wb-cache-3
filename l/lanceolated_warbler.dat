500|$|A {{subcommittee}} {{was set up}} in 1997 {{to undertake}} a review of rare bird records from the years immediately prior to BBRC's establishment. The purpose of the review was to ensure that all records from 1950 onwards (the cut-off date for Category A of the BOU British List of birds) have been subjected to a similar level of scrutiny. Not all of the 1,100 records of species considered to be rarities at that time were assessed, but only those related to species not recorded more than 100 times by 1997, as well as a few records of less rare species under particularly unusual circumstances, which were termed [...] "sore thumbs". Much of the original documentation was unavailable for the review, as it had been lost, and so for many records, the review was based solely on published accounts of the birds. The most notable outcome of this review was the reidentification of a frigatebird record from Tiree in 1953. Previously identified as a magnificent frigatebird, the BBRC review concluded that the bird was in fact an Ascension frigatebird, the only individual of this species ever identified in Europe (Walbridge, Small & McGowan 2003). The full results of the review were published in 2006. Of the 126 records reviewed, 37 were rejected as unacceptable. These included a claimed white-tailed eagle, which broke into a chicken-run in a garden and stole a chicken, three little crakes, three European scops owls, the only late December record of tawny pipit, three black-eared wheatears, a record of two White's thrushes together in April, a spring <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler,</b> two moustached warblers and a pine grosbeak. Furthermore, issues were found with the identification of Britain's first western sandpiper, on Fair Isle in 1956, and these led the BOURC to reject this record. The western sandpiper has been recorded several times subsequently in Britain however, and remains on the national list. The subcommittee's final report also hints at the prospect that some records from immediately prior to 1950 may be incorrect; because these fell outside the timeframes of the review they were not reassessed.|$|E
50|$|On 22 September 2002 {{the first}} <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella lanceolata) {{recorded}} on the Isles of Scilly was found during {{a search for}} migrant birds. Also seen was two sedge warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) and four willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus).|$|E
50|$|The {{islands are}} also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, {{including}} the common rosefinch, Siberian rubythroat, bluethroat, <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler,</b> {{and the first}} North American record of the intermediate egret. Other animals in the Aleutian Chain include the Arctic fox, American mink, Porcupine caribou, northern sea otter, horned puffin, tufted puffin, Steller sea lion, spotted seal, ringed seal, northern fur seal and many more.|$|E
50|$|The Aleutians {{are home}} to many large colonies of seabirds. Buldir Island has 21 {{breeding}} seabird species, including the Bering Sea-endemic red-legged kittiwake. Large seabird colonies are also present at Kiska, Gareloi, Semisopochnoi, Bogoslof, and others. The islands are also frequented by vagrant Asiatic birds, including the common rosefinch, Siberian rubythroat, bluethroat, <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler,</b> and the first North American record of the intermediate egret.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler</b> (Locustella lanceolata) is an Old World warbler in {{the grass}} warbler genus Locustella. It breeds from {{northeast}} European Russia across northern Asia to northern Hokkaidō, Japan. It is migratory, wintering in south-east Asia. The genus name Locustella is from Latin and is a diminutive of locusta, [...] "grasshopper". This refers to {{the song of the}} common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific [...] lanceolata is Latin for [...] "spear-shaped" [...] and refers to the streaks on the breast.|$|E
50|$|Many {{rare species}} of bird {{have been found}} on the island, and it is {{probably}} the best place in western Europe to see skulking Siberian passerines such as Pechora pipit, <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler</b> and Pallas's grasshopper warbler. In spring 2008 a calandra lark was identified in April, and in May a Caspian plover was observed, only the fourth such record for the UK. On 6 June a citril finch was found and identified by islander Tommy Hyndman, a first record for Britain. September was highlighted by brown flycatcher, red-flanked bluetail and Siberian thrush.|$|E
5000|$|The landward-side mud flats are an {{important}} feeding ground for wading birds, and the area has a bird observatory, for monitoring migrating birds and providing accommodation to visiting birdwatchers. Their migration is assisted by east winds in autumn, resulting in drift migration of Scandinavian migrants, sometimes leading to a spectacular [...] "fall" [...] of thousands of birds. Many uncommon species have been sighted there, including a cliff swallow from North America, a <b>lanceolated</b> <b>warbler</b> from Siberia and a black-browed albatross from the Southern Ocean. More commonly, birds such as wheatears, whinchats, common redstarts and flycatchers alight at Spurn on their way between breeding and wintering grounds elsewhere. When the wind is {{in the right direction}} migrants are funnelled down Spurn Point and are counted at the Narrows Watchpoint, more than 15,000 birds can fly past on a good morning in autumn with 3,000 quite normal.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the autumn migration phenology of nine Siberian breeding songbirds: Thick-billed Warbler (Iduna aedon), Black-browed Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus bistrigiceps), Pallas’s Grasshopper Warbler (Locustella certhiola), <b>Lanceolated</b> <b>Warbler</b> (L. lanceolata), Yellow-browed Warbler (Phylloscopus inornatus), Arctic Warbler (Ph. borealis), Dusky Warbler (Ph. fuscatus), Radde’s Warbler (Ph. schwarzi), Two-barred Warbler (Ph. plumbeitarsus) and compared the migration dynamic characteristics with their European occurrence time. The study {{was carried out}} within the Amur Bird Project in the Russian Far East along the river Amur at Muraviovka Park between 2011 and 2014. The birds were caught with mistnets and ringed with individually numbered rings. For the characterization of the migration, we used timing, the intervals and the peaks of the migration, {{the percentage of the}} recaptures and the average time between the first and the last captures. The timing of migration in the studied species differed in the timing, the intervals (30 - 67 days) and the migration peaks (14 August - 17 September) ...|$|E
