In 2025, we will complete the first 100kW SPS demonstration at LEO; and in 2035, the 100MW SPS will have electric generating capacity.

[...] The article went on to state that [...] "Since SPS development {{will be a huge}} project, it will be considered the equivalent of an Apollo program for energy. In the last century, America's leading position in science and technology worldwide was inextricably linked with technological advances associated with implementation of the Apollo program. Likewise, as China's current achievements in aerospace technology are built upon with its successive generations of satellite projects in space, China will use its capabilities in space science to assure sustainable development of energy from space." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} that elite football players with the same anaerobic threshold calculated from the lactate performance curve during a field <b>level</b> <b>test</b> may have substantially different values describing endurance performance capacity determined from spiroergometric laboratory tests. A group of 28 male elite football players underwent a field <b>level</b> <b>test</b> and a spiroergometric laboratory test. A subgroup of players with the same anaerobic threshold was selected, and the endurance performance capacity obtained from spiroergometric measurements during treadmill <b>level</b> <b>tests</b> were compared descriptively within this subgroup. Among the three players with the same anaerobic threshold, test duration for the treadmill <b>level</b> <b>test</b> and consequently also the maximal lactate value achieved during the test varied substantially. The tests were aborted after 5 min at 4. 4, 4. 8 and 4. 0 m·s- 1 for players 1, 2 and 3, respectively. VO 2 -values at V 4 were 87 %, 75 % and 96 % of their personal VO 2 -peak, respectively. Maximum lactate concentrations were 8. 8, 9. 2 and 5. 3 mmol·L- 1, respectively. Peak relative VO 2 values were 55. 0, 61. 6 and 59. 7 ml·min- 1 ·kg- 1, respectively. The result of this study clearly show that conventional field <b>level</b> <b>tests</b> yield insufficient information on underlying physiological and metabolic mechanisms of endurance performance capacity.
