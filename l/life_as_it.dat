5|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe is {{the proposition}} that the conditions that allow life in the Universe can only occur when certain universal fundamental physical constants lie within a very narrow range, so that if any of several fundamental constants were only slightly different, the Universe would be unlikely to be conducive to the establishment and development of matter, astronomical structures, elemental diversity, or <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is understood. The proposition is discussed among philosophers, scientists, theologians, and proponents of creationism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of Justinian I's reign he had {{inherited}} a surplus 28,800,000 solidi (400,000 pounds of gold) in the imperial treasury from Anastasius I and Justin I. Under Justinian's rule, measures were taken to counter corruption in the provinces and to make tax collection more efficient. Greater administrative power was given to both {{the leaders of the}} prefectures and of the provinces, while power was taken away from the vicariates of the dioceses, of which a number were abolished. The overall trend was towards a simplification of administrative infrastructure. According to Brown (1971), the increased professionalization of tax collection did much to destroy the traditional structures of provincial <b>life,</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> weakened the autonomy of the town councils in the Greek towns. It has been estimated that before Justinian I's reconquests the state had an annual revenue of 5,000,000 solidi in AD 530, but after his reconquests, the annual revenue was increased to 6,000,000 solidi in AD 550.|$|E
5|$|The Capitoline Temple {{stands behind}} the {{basilica}} within what would originally {{have been an}} arcaded courtyard. An altar stands in the courtyard in front of 13 steps {{leading up to the}} Corinthian-columned temple, which had a single cella. The building was of great importance to civic <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> was dedicated to the three chief divinities of the Roman state, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars. The layout of the temple, facing the back wall of the basilica, is somewhat unusual and {{it has been suggested that}} it may have been built on top of an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 records that it was reconstructed in 218. It was partly restored in 1955 and given a more substantial restoration in 1962, reconstructing 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns. There were four more small shrines within the temple precinct, one of which was dedicated to Venus.|$|E

5|$|The first {{indications}} of a tropical cyclone developing were on August 17. A {{ship in the}} vicinity of the developing system reported winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) over 78 °F (25.5 °C) waters. Around 0000 UTC the next day, the system was classified as a modern-day tropical depression with sustained winds estimated at 30 mph (45 km/h). Roughly 18 hours later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm, the first of the season while located to the north-northeast of the Bahamas. Gradual intensification took place throughout most of the storm's <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> traveled towards the northeast until becoming a hurricane around 0600 UTC on August 20. About 30 minutes later, a ship recorded winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a pressure of 993.6 mbar (hPa), the lowest pressure recorded in relation to the small storm. Shortly after, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Increasing in forward motion, the storm became extratropical early on August 21 after turning towards the north.|$|E

25|$|While {{features}} of self-organization and self-replication are often considered {{the hallmark of}} living systems, there are many instances of abiotic molecules exhibiting such characteristics under proper conditions.
