5000|$|In 1997 came two shows, {{the first}} was [...] "Spirits of Sentosa", {{developed}} by <b>Laservision</b> Mega Media Pty Ltd. The second is Going Around the World, which has disputed origins. Spirits of Sentosa is the first show staged on the fountain, to use graphical imagery. It was developed by <b>Laservision</b> designers, Simon McCartney, Lloyd Weir and Richard Tan.|$|E
50|$|The VHD {{system had}} {{advantages}} over both the RCA Capacitance Electronic Disc {{system and the}} MCA/Philips <b>LaserVision</b> system. In active (CAV) mode (not available in CED) it had a greater capacity than <b>LaserVision.</b> It also {{had the ability to}} carry 99 randomly accessible 'chapters' (more than <b>LaserVision)</b> and had the same autostop capability. These two functions had to be programmed into the master tape from which the videodisc was made, along with the two-frame freeze frame function. This made videotape master editing a highly specialist operation requiring precise insertion of vertical interval codes into the video signal, and field accurate editing (most videotape editing required only frame accuracy).|$|E

50|$|Philips {{acquired}} Magnavox's {{consumer electronics}} division in 1974, to ensure nationwide distribution for their VLP (later renamed <b>LaserVision)</b> Videodisc technology.|$|E
5000|$|It was the {{original}} name of the [...] "Reflective Optical Videodisc System" [...] format later known as <b>LaserVision</b> or LaserDisc.|$|E
5000|$|After its {{introduction}} in Japan in 1981, the format {{was introduced in}} Europe in 1983 with the <b>LaserVision</b> name although Philips used [...] "VLP" [...] in model designations, such as VLP-600. Philips tried renaming the entire format in 1987 to [...] "CD-Video", and while the name and logo appeared on players and labels for years, the 'official' name of the format remained <b>LaserVision.</b> In the early 1990s, the format's name was finally changed to LaserDisc.|$|E
50|$|The show {{incorporates}} some of {{the most}} advanced and latest <b>Laservision</b> technology ever created. One such example is the Stella Ray.|$|E

5000|$|My Elegy is {{a concert}} video {{recording}} of the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin. It was released in Japan in 1984 by LaserDisc Corp. as a <b>LaserVision</b> video disk.|$|E
50|$|Wonder Full is a {{nighttime}} multimedia spectacular located at Marina Bay Sands, Marina Bay, Singapore. The show is {{designed by the}} Australian based multimedia company <b>Laservision</b> (who also designed Spirits of Sentosa).|$|E
50|$|The first laser disc, {{demonstrated}} in 1972, was the <b>Laservision</b> 12-inch video disc. The video signal was stored as an analog format like a video cassette. The first digitally recorded optical disc was a 5-inch audio compact disc (CD) in a read-only format created by Sony and Philips in 1975.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "CD Video" [...] and its logo {{were also}} used on some {{full-size}} (8- and 12-inch) LaserDiscs with digital audio (for movies {{as well as for}} music titles), to distinguish them from the previous <b>LaserVision</b> format with analog audio and, presumably, to leverage the consumer recognition of the successful CD-Audio format.|$|E
50|$|The show is {{organised}} by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and {{is displayed}} every night with good weather at 8 pm Hong Kong Time (UTC+8). An orchestration of music, decoration lights, laser light displays, and pyrotechnic fireworks, the multimedia {{light and sound}} show lasts for around 14 minutes and was conceptualised, created, and installed by <b>Laservision.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Rise of the Merlion" [...] is {{considered}} the first show to use laser animation and graphics at the 'Musical Fountain'. The show gave a 'revisionist' History of Singapore that included {{the outcome of the}} Merlion (country mascot). In 1994 the show's lighting was improved by <b>Laservision</b> Mega Media Pty Ltd, before the show was shut down a year later.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer Electronics also {{entered the}} optical disc market in 1977 as a 50/50 {{joint-venture}} with MCA called Universal-Pioneer and manufacturing MCA designed industrial players under the MCA DiscoVision name (the PR-7800 and PR-7820). For the 1980 {{launch of the}} first Universal-Pioneer player, the VP-1000 was noted as a [...] "laser disc player", although the [...] "LaserDisc" [...] logo displayed clearly on the device. In 1981, [...] "LaserDisc" [...] was used exclusively for the medium itself, although the official name was [...] "LaserVision" [...] (as seen {{at the beginning of}} many LaserDisc releases just {{before the start of the}} film). However, as Pioneer reminded numerous video magazines and stores in 1984, LaserDisc was a trademarked word, standing only for <b>LaserVision</b> products manufactured for sale by Pioneer Video or Pioneer Electronics. A 1984 Ray Charles ad for the LD-700 player bore the term [...] "Pioneer LaserDisc brand videodisc player". From 1981 until the early 1990s, all properly licensed discs carried the <b>LaserVision</b> name and logo, even Pioneer Artists titles.|$|E
50|$|The Master AIV (Advanced Interactive Videodisc) was {{essentially}} a Master Turbo model with a SCSI interface and a VFS (Videodisc Filing System) ROM added, and {{formed the basis of}} the BBC Domesday System. Although normally supplied as part of a Domesday System, with <b>LaserVision</b> player, Domesday videodiscs, monitor and trackerball included, an upgrade kit was also available to turn a normal BBC Master into a Domesday System.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, {{the film}} was issued on DVD by Alive/CMV <b>Laservision</b> in Germany. [...] Subtitled [...] "Let's Dance Tonight," [...] this version {{features}} a very clear full-screen print with German and English audio options, {{as well as the}} theatrical trailer and alternate opening/ending scenes. Although it's the same version as that released in the USA, the film runs a few minutes shorter as a result of PAL speedup.|$|E
5000|$|The {{project was}} stored on adapted laserdiscs in the <b>LaserVision</b> Read Only Memory (LV-ROM) format, which {{contained}} not only analogue video and still pictures, but also digital data, with 300 MB of storage space {{on each side}} of the disc. Data and images were selected and collated by the BBC Domesday project based in Bilton House in West Ealing. Pre-mastering of data was carried out on a VAX-11/750 mini-computer, assisted by a network of BBC micros. The discs were mastered, produced, and tested by the Philips <b>Laservision</b> factory in Blackburn, England. Viewing the discs required an Acorn BBC Master expanded with a SCSI controller and an additional coprocessor controlled Philips VP415 [...] "Domesday Player", a specially produced laserdisc player. The user interface consisted of the BBC Master's keyboard and a trackball (known at the time as a trackerball). The software for the project was written in BCPL (a precursor to C), to make cross platform porting easier, although BCPL never attained the popularity that its early promise suggested it might.|$|E
50|$|While the LaserDisc format {{was brought}} to market in the late 1970s, first {{with the name of}} DiscoVision and later as <b>LaserVision,</b> and despite {{persistent}} promises from the Music Corporation of America, a cheap method of recording LaserDiscs never surfaced. This lack made it exceedingly difficult and cumbersome to create the needed LaserDiscs for the EditDroid. Also at this time, the storage available on a hard disk was prohibitively small and extremely expensive.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer Electronics later {{purchased}} the majority {{stake in the}} format and marketed it as both <b>LaserVision</b> (format name) and LaserDisc (brand name) in 1980, with some releases unofficially referring to the medium as [...] "Laser Videodisc". Philips produced the players while MCA produced the discs. The Philips-MCA cooperation was not successful, and discontinued after a few years. Several of the scientists responsible for the early research (Richard Wilkinson, Ray Dakin and John Winslow) founded Optical Disc Corporation (now ODC Nimbus).|$|E
50|$|Philips and its {{subsidiaries}} eventually re-issued {{many of its}} pre-digital {{stereo and}} mono recordings on compact disc. Philips and DuPont partnered in four CD manufacturing plants in Hanover, Germany; Blackburn in the UK (formerly the Philips <b>Laservision</b> Disc factory); Kings Mountain in North Carolina, and Louviers in France. By the mid-1990s, Polygram Classics handled the classical labels (Philips, Mercury, Decca, Deutsche Grammophon) and Verve Music Group handled the jazz back catalogue (from Verve, Mercury, etc.) and new jazz releases. Mercury continues to manage the Philips pop back catalogue to this day.|$|E
50|$|The DiscoVision {{system was}} {{released}} in America in 1978. Developed by MCA and Philips of the Netherlands, it utilized an optical reflective system read by a laser beam. It was renamed several times, as VLP, <b>Laservision,</b> and CD Video. Finally, Japan's Pioneer Electronic Corporation trademarked it as LaserDisc, the name by which it is perhaps best known. The format struggled to gain wide acceptance in the consumer market, and Pioneer became the chief sponsor of the format when MCA, and later Philips, withdrew their support for it. The high cost of both players and discs was {{the main reason for}} its ultimate demise.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, the {{fountain}} underwent a major two-year restoration project directed by Fischer Media Group {{under the supervision}} of ECA2. During the restoration, the wooden plank with the old Sentosa logo from 1982 was replaced by a plaster sculpture for two reasons. Firstly, due to termite infestation and secondly as a prop for the Magical Sentosa show after it was commissioned in September 2002. The fountain's exterior design and the colonnades design was re-designed to the more attractive Neoclassical design. In addition, the seats in {{the fountain}}'s gallery were repainted to resemble the seven colours of a rainbow. The previously installed laser fixtures were draped in green fabric by <b>Laservision</b> Australia.|$|E
