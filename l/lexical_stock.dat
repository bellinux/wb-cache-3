We suggest that grammatical resources for natural language generation and lexical resources for lexical representations are not necessarily commensurate currently in their design and aims, although both contain information necessary for natural language generation. We therefore discuss methods by which heterogenous generation systems can be constructed in which large-scale lexical and grammatical components can be maintained separately but allowed to interact as is necessary for generation. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider some of the practical steps that we are taking in order to provide support for the integration of multilingual grammars designed for text generation and multilingual lexicons that describe the <b>lexical</b> <b>stocks</b> of a variety of natural lang [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, it {{is argued}} that the {{linguistic}} properties and affinities between the so-called Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages cannot be represented in terms of a family tree model. This means that the hypothesized genetic relationship between these languages is not sufficiently argued for. The early scholars of Finno-Ugric language comparison worked with word lists to proof genetic relationships. This was unmotivated, however. But also the sound laws that have been elaborated in Indo-Germanic linguistics cannot be copied one-to-one into Uralic/Finno-Ugric linguistics. The sound laws are not without exceptions in Uralic/Finno-Ugric and cannot be documented {{due to the lack of}} old documents. The <b>lexical</b> basic <b>stock</b> of Finno-Ugric cannot be isolated. There are substantial parallels with the Altaic languages, especially with (Old) Turkic. The number of lexical items of the basic vocabulary is not constant in the literature. This means that there is no methodologically well-established system to track down the items of the basic vocabulary. The morphological and grammatical domains display a number of serious divergences showing that a genetic relationship between the Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages is not very likely. From this it follows that the general, common features that certainly exist among the Uralic/Finno-Ugric languages (see the Appendix) can be explained the safest as a case of language contact. Such a theory of Sprachbund will not be elaborated in this paper, however...|$|R

Sinitic in his view fits a mainland south-east Asian typology. The sum effect of this hypothetical Zhou diffusion of their version of the lingua franca was, he argues, one of Tibeto-Burmanization, with a concomitant shift from a SVO morphological substrate to a language with an increasing tendency towards SOV structure. Linguist Paul K. Benedict also proposed that the Shang may have not been Sinitic speakers and that the Zhou invaders from the west were the bearers of proto-Sinitic languages.|$|E

Matrix method of investigating words denoting spiritual values in the modern Ukrainian language is proposed. Matrix is defined to be a two-dimensional structure which replaces oversimplified notation systems used in componential analysis. Matrix enables a researcher to study all the interconnections between the related meanings of different lexical units as well as between different meanings of a specific lexical unit. It consists of two axes – a vertical one indicates a <b>lexical</b> <b>stock</b> and a horizontal one means a seme stock of the collected language material. The application of matrix method in practice proves that the structural organization of axiovocabulary considerably becomes complicated; internal mechanisms and dynamics of semantic cooperations of axionomens are revealed under the influence of extra-linguistic factors. Matrix presentation of non-material values gives an opportunity to describe in detail the structure of axionouns’ lexical meanings which are not in chaotic order, but clearly organized, to distinguish the degree of their related semantics, to expose the functional character of semes forming definite structures within the framework of analyzed words.

Mubi-Toram is namely the last (26 th) Chadic group in the classification proposed by H. Jungraithmayr (Jungraithmayr — Ibriszimow 1994, Vol. II, p. xv).

The success of modern research on Chadic phonological and lexical reconstruction (initiated by V. M. Illič-Svityč and P.
