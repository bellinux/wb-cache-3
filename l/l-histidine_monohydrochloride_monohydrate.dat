40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to elucidate the mechanism of the increased thyroidal function caused by oral administration of (±) - 4 -diethylamino- 1, 1 -dimethylbut- 2 -yn- 1 -yl 2 -cyclohexyl- 2 -hydroxy- 2 -phenylacetate <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (NS- 21), a new drug for the treatment of urinary frequency and incontinence, in rats. Rats were given 500 mg/kg of NS- 21 orally for 13 weeks. Rats were also given 500 mg/kg of the drug and 15 μg/animal of thyroxine (T_ 4) in order to assess the influence of T_ 4 treatment. NS- 21 caused decreases in both total and free T_ 4 and increases in TSH and thyroxine uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (T_ 4 UDP-GT). Morphological examination of thyroid gland revealed stimulated follicles indicating heightened thyroidal function. The treatment of T_ 4 inhibited the stimulating effect of NS- 21 on thyroid gland. These results show that the administration of NS- 21 caused induction of T_ 4 UDP-GT, which resulted in a compensatory stimulation of the thyroidal function by the increased secretion of pituitary TSH in response to increased blood thyroid hormone metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Cis-diaminechloro-[2 -(diethylamino) ethyl 4 -amino-benzoate, N- 4]-chloride {{platinum}} (II) <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (DPR) {{is a new}} platinum triamine complex {{obtained from}} the synthesis of cisplatin and procaine. In this paper we analyzed, adopting a disease-oriented strategy, the tumour selectivity of this compound, its ability to induce apoptosis and its mechanism of interaction with DNA. The inhibition of cell proliferation was evaluated by the MTT assay using a panel of 51 tumour cell lines. Some of them were also evaluated for the induction of apoptosis by 4 '- 6 -diamidine- 2 '-phenylindole (DAPI) staining, Western blot of p 53 protein and agarose gel electrophoresis of ladder DNA. Finally, interstand cross-links (ISCL) were evaluated by ethidium bromide fluorescence technique. When evaluated by the MTT assay, DPR showed a high selective activity for neuroblastoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), ovarian cancer and leukemia cell lines. The comparison of mean graphs of DPR and cisplatin suggested that our compound possesses a mechanism of action similar to that, at least in part, of its parent compound. Moreover, DPR showed itself {{to be a good}} trigger of programmed cell death, as demonstrated by DAPI staining, activation of p 53 protein and agarose gel electrophoresis of ladder DNA. Finally, the study of the formation of ISCLs demonstrated that DPR, despite being a monofunctional platinum compound, is able to form bifunctional adducts through the release of procaine residue. Data presented here suggest that DPR is an antitumour agent able to trigger apoptosis, and that it is endowed with a peculiar mechanism(s) of action and a special selective activity against two tumours, namely neuroblastoma and SCLC, which are still characterized by a low incidence of long-term survivors...|$|R
40|$|MK- 383 (L-tyrosine, N-(n-butylsulfonyl) -O-[4 -butyl(4 -piperidinyl) ], <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate)</b> is {{a potent}} and {{specific}} platelet fibrinogen receptor antagonist that {{may be useful in}} preventing processes that lead to occlusive thrombus formation in the lumen of the blood vessel. Two placebo-controlled phase I trials were completed in 56 healthy volunteers to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of MK- 383 administered as 1 - and 4 -hour infusions in the presence and absence of aspirin. When administered to healthy male subjects by constant infusions up to 0. 4 microgram/kg/min over 1 hour or up to 0. 2 microgram/min over 4 hours, it provided a well-tolerated reversible means of inhibiting platelet function. At infusion rates of 0. 25 and 0. 15 microgram/kg/min for 1 and 4 hours, respectively, MK- 383 extended baseline bleeding time by 2. 0 - to 2. 5 -fold and inhibited adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet aggregation by at least 80 %. The pharmacokinetics of MK- 383 include a mean plasma clearance of 329 ml/min, steady-state volume of distribution of 76 L, and half-life of 1. 6 hours. The percentage of dose excreted in the urine was 37 %. Correlations between MK- 383 plasma concentration (C) and inhibition of platelet aggregation were examined by fitting with a sigmoid maximum-effect model. The plasma concentration yielding 50 % inhibition (C 50) for MK- 383 in healthy volunteers is approximately 13 ng/ml, with a Hill coefficient > 5. Based on a naive pooled analysis, an exponential empirical model best describes the MK- 383 C-extension of template bleeding time (BTE) relationship. The model indicates that the MK- 383 plasma concentration necessary to double BTE is approximately 30 ng/ml (i. e., 2. 5 -fold greater than the C 50 for ADP-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation). The pharmacokinetics of MK- 383 was unaffected by pretreatment with 325 mg aspirin 1 day before and 1 hour before infusion. Conversely, aspirin pretreatment reduced C 50 and increased bleeding time extension, suggesting that aspirin may have an additive effect with respect to inhibition of platelet function. Based on the putative role of the fibrinogen receptor in thrombotic processes and an acceptable human pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile, MK- 383 should be evaluated in patients with unstable angina. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. In Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, {{there is}} a marked decline in the {{function}} of cholinergic neurons in the brain. However, studies of treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors have produced conflicting results. We conducted a multicenter trial to evaluate whether the cholinesterase inhibitor tacrine (1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro- 9 -acridinamine <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate)</b> could improve cognition in patients with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. METHODS. Of 632 eligible patients with probable Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease, 215 improved while receiving tacrine during a preliminary crossover phase to determine responsiveness and the best dose. The 215 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either placebo or their best dose of tacrine (10 or 20 mg four times a day) in a six-week, double-blind trial. The primary measures of efficacy were the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease Assessment Scale and the Clinical Global Impression of Change scale; the secondary measures included the Mini-Mental State Examination and the assessment of the activities of daily living. RESULTS. At the end of the six-week trial, the patients receiving tacrine had a mean adjusted cognitive-subscale score of 30. 3 (Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s Disease Assessment Scale) as compared with 32. 7 in patients receiving placebo. This represents a smaller decline (by 2. 4 points) in cognitive performance in the tacrine group (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). There were no differences between the groups in their global-rating scores. The tacrine group had a significantly smaller decline in the activities of daily living. The results of the Mini-Mental State Examination favored tacrine, but the differences were small and not statistically significant (a score of 16. 0 with tacrine vs. 15. 3 with placebo; P = 0. 08). Gastrointestinal symptoms, elevation of aminotransferase levels, and headache were the most frequent side effects; all could be reversed by reducing the dose or discontinuing treatment. CONCLUSIONS. In this short-term study in patients with Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease who were selected for apparent responsiveness to tacrine, treatment with tacrine resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the decline of cognitive function, although this reduction was not large enough to be detected by the study physicians 2 ̆ 7 global assessments of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Cis-diaminechloro-[2 -(diethylamino) ethyl 4 -amino-benzoate, N 4]-chloride {{platinum}} (II) <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (DPR) is a monofunctional Pt triamine complex synthesized {{starting from}} cisplatin and procaine hydrochloride, {{characterized by a}} good antitumor activity coupled with low toxic effects and able to impair prenatal development of mice but at doses outside or just in the upper range of therapeutic doses. In the present paper the transplacental passage of DPRderived Pt was investigated in CD 1 mice on days 9, 13, 16 and 18 of pregnancy, 24 h after ip administration of 21 mg/kg DPR. For comparison, groups of mice were treated with an equivalent Pt-containing dose of cisplatin (10. 7 mg/kg). Similarly to cisplatin, small amounts of Pt were detected in fetuses on day 9. From day 13 of gestation the concentration of DPR- and cisplatin- derived Pt increased up to the highest fetal concentrations detected on day 16. On day 18 the concentration of Pt decreased. Most importantly, on days 13 – 18 of pregnancy cisplatin-derived Pt was always significantly higher than that assayed after DPR administration. In addition, on day 13 of pregnancy Pt exposure of fetuses was significantly higher when dams were treated with cisplatin (AUC 0. 5 – 24 = 3. 40 vs. 4. 95 lgÆh/g). Finally, {{it is worth noting}} that serum decay of Pt after DPR or cisplatin administration in adult female mice was similar with AUC 0. 13 – 2 h s of 7. 5 and 6. 6 lgÆh/ml, respectively. When we determined the concentration of Pt into the main organs of fetuses from dams treated with either DPR or cisplatin on day 18 of gestation, we observed a different organ distribution. In fact, while the concentration of DPR-derived Pt was greater in the heart (1. 08 ± 0. 30 vs. 0. 78 ± 0. 35 lg/g, p < 0. 10), an opposite situation was found in the kidney (0. 51 ± 0. 20 vs. 0. 69 ± 0. 22 lg/g, p < 0. 05). In conclusion, our data show that DPR may pass through the placenta with an efficiency significantly lower than that of cisplatin. This finding may represent one of the possible causes of the lower embryotoxic/teratogenic effect of DPR as compared to cisplatin...|$|R
40|$|When {{proteins}} and DNA interact, arginine and lysine {{are the two}} amino acids most often {{in close contact with}} the DNA. In order to understand the radiation damage to DNA in vivo, which is always associated with protein, it is important to learn the radiation chemistry of arginine and lysine independently, and when complexed to DNA. This work studied X-irradiated single crystals of L-lysine monohydrochloride dihydrate (L-lysine·HCl· 2 H 2 O) and L-arginine <b>monohydrochloride</b> <b>monohydrate</b> (L-arginine·HCl·H 2 O) with EPR, ENDOR, EIE techniques and DFT calculations. In both crystal types irradiated at 66 K, the carboxyl anion radical and the decarboxylation radical were detected. DFT calculations supported these assignments. Specifically, the calculations performed on the cluster models for the carboxyl anion radicals reproduced the proton transfers to the carboxyl group from the neighboring molecules through the hydrogen bonds. Moreover, computations supported the identification of one radical type as the guanidyl radical anion with an electron trapped by the guanidyl group. In addition, the radical formed by dehydrogenation of C 5 was identified in the L-arginine·HCl·H 2 O crystals irradiated at 66 K. For both crystal types, the deamination radicals and the dehydrogenation radicals were identified following irradiation at 298 K. Different conformations of main-chain deamination radicals were detected at 66 K and at 298 K. In L-lysine·HCl· 2 H 2 O, these conformations are the result of the different rotation angles of the side chain. In L-arginine·HCl·H 2 O, one conformation at 66 K has no O-H dipolar protons while the others have two O-H dipolar protons. In L-lysine·HCl· 2 H 2 O, two radicals with very similar sets of hyperfine couplings were identified as the result of dehydrogenation from C 3 and C 5. Two other radicals in low concentration detected only at 66 K, were tentatively assigned as the radical dehydrogenated from C 3 and the side-chain deamination radical. In L-argnine·HCl·H 2 O, the radicals from dehydrogenation at C 5 and C 2 also were identified. DFT calculations supported these assignments and reproduced conformations of these radicals. Finally, based on the radicals detected in the crystal irradated at 66 K and at 298 K, the annealing experiments from the irradiation at 66 K, and the previous studies on the irradiated amino acids, the mechanisms of the irradiation damage on lysinie and arginine were proposed...|$|R
