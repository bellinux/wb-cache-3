5|$|Before {{the opening}} of the Barlow Road, pioneers {{traveling}} by <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east followed the Oregon Trail to Wascopam Mission (now The Dalles) and floated down the Columbia River to Fort Vancouver, then a perilous and expensive journey. It was also possible to drive livestock over Lolo Pass {{on the north side of}} Mount Hood, but that trail was too rugged for vehicles and unsuitable for wagons.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E

5|$|After the Qing {{government}} {{defeated the}} Ming loyalist forces {{maintained by the}} Zheng family in 1683, parts of Taiwan became increasingly integrated into the Qing Empire. Qing forces ruled areas of Taiwan's highly populated western plain for over two centuries, until 1895. This era was characterized by a marked {{increase in the number}} of Han Chinese on Taiwan, continued social unrest, the piecemeal transfer (by various means) of large amounts of <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aborigines to the Han, and the nearly complete acculturation of the Western Plains Aborigines to Taiwanese Han customs.|$|E
5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who grabbed <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided them up and handed them over – allegedly without making a penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E

He gave {{the southern part of}} the land to the people of Birchington and dedicated it in memory of his three sons who had been killed in World War I.

5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some {{evidence}} to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and protections for vassals from ejection from the <b>land.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when the planting season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, Michael Palaeologus {{died and}} his son Andronicus II took power. The death of the old Byzantine Emperor came as a relief for the society at large; his policy of Latin {{appeasement}} to the Church in Rome, heavy taxation and military expenditure placed a severe burden on the people. As the Ottoman Turks began taking <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Empire, they were seen as liberators of Anatolians and many soon converted to Islam undermining the Byzantine's Orthodox power base.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the {{government}} pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> minority white population {{to the majority}} black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to {{a sharp decline in}} agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.|$|E

5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who would add to the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|Made up of two road {{bridges and}} a railway bridge located over {{a section of}} water known as The Narrows, located between Mill Point and Point Lewis, it connects the Mitchell and Kwinana Freeways, linking the city's {{northern}} and southern suburbs. The original road bridge was opened in 1959 and was the largest precast prestressed concrete bridge in the world. Construction of the northern interchange for this bridge necessitated the reclamation of {{a large amount of}} <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> river.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Karl Dean drafted {{plans for}} {{financing}} the stadium and acquiring the necessary <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state.

5|$|On 3 October, the troops, {{along with}} Colonel Alexander Evert Kawilarang, were tasked with {{capturing}} the rebel capital at New Victoria.

Rijadi's forces approached the city through mangrove swamps, a journey which took a month.

5|$|Roosevelt had {{withdrawn}} much <b>land</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public domain, including some in Alaska thought rich in coal. In 1902, Clarence Cunningham, an Idaho entrepreneur, had found coal deposits in Alaska, and made mining claims, {{and the government}} investigated their legality. This dragged on {{for the remainder of}} the Roosevelt administration, including during the year (1907–1908) when Ballinger served as head of the General Land Office. A special agent for the Land Office, Louis Glavis, investigated the Cunningham claims, and when Secretary Ballinger in 1909 approved them, Glavis broke governmental protocol by going outside the Interior Department to seek help from Pinchot.|$|E
5|$|Stokesay Castle {{was built}} in the 1280s and 1290s in the village of Stokesay by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant.

In 1241, Hugh de Say sold Stokesay to John de Verdon; John then left for the Eighth Crusade in 1270, mortgaging the land on a life-time lease to Philip de Whichcote. John died in 1274, leaving his rights to the property to his son, Theobald.|$|E
