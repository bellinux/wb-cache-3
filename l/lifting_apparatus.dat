50|$|The {{problems}} {{draining the}} mine continued into 1903, {{a major part}} of the problem being the ability to position pumps in the correct areas. The shafts were very restrictive in area, being approximately 4 ft x 4 ft in places, whilst in addition the shafts were croocked being generally at an angle of 15 degrees from the vertical and at a total depth of approximately 1000 ft from the surface. Eventually it was decided to carry out the operation using steam pumps, and an order was placed with Joseph Evans & Sons of Wolverhampton.A large pump with a capacity of 400 gallons per minute was fixed on a sliding cradle and lowered, together with its steam and water mains, on link chains so as to follow the water down as the level subsided. At intervals down the shaft there were fixed pumps placed at various levels so as to limit the suspended pump to a lift of no greater that 360 ft at any given time. In addition a fixed electrically powered pump was installed at the 255 fathom level which was capable of forcing the water up to the adit in one lift. Joseph Evans & Sons provided all the appliances in order for the work to be carried out, which included all the steam pumping mains, chains, <b>lifting</b> <b>apparatus,</b> steam capstan engines and three Lancashire boilers accompanied by a 100 ft stack. In order to accommodate the machinery new footings for the boilers (the largest on the Isle of Man) had to be constructed, with the machinery being hauled from Douglas to Laxey by a special traction engine which had been brought over for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|A {{full-scale}} ASTM E 1321 Lateral {{ignition and}} Flame Transport (<b>LIFT)</b> <b>apparatus</b> was constructed and {{compared with a}} Reduced scale Ignition and Flame spread Test apparatus (RIFT) adaptation of the cone calorimeter in the vertical position. The objective {{was to find a}} low cost and simple alternative to the <b>LIFT</b> <b>apparatus</b> for measuring opposed flow flame spread. Ignition tests were conducted using the LIFT, RIFT and ISO 5657 ignitability apparatus and flame spread experiments were conducted in the LIFT and RIFT. Nine different types of timber based products were tested for ignition and flame spread, and Quintiere's flame spread model was applied to the results to obtain material properties, such as thermal inertia, flame spread parameter and the minimum heat flux required for flame spread. These materials included plywood, medium density fibreboard (MDF), hardboard, particle board flooring, Melamine (Melteca) covered MDF, New Zealand Rimu, and Beech and New Zealand grown Macrocarpa and Radiata (Monterey) Pine. Further limited tests were conducted on Melteca covered particle board, and a second brand of particle board. The materials in the RIFT were tried with and without preheating to equilibrium. In addition, a view factor for the RIFT was developed, based on earlier work for the cone calorimeter element. The view factor equation was experimentally tested against measured values, and the calculated value was consistently lower than the experimental values, with similar flux profile. The standard procedure is for the material to be preheated before ignition, so that the surface is at equilibrium. The spread of the flame front past points on the sample surface after ignition is recorded, and from the flame front velocity and the model by Quintiere, material specific properties can be derived. The lack of preheating was found to affect the final results, by reducing the flame spread velocity and increasing the scatter in the experimental results. The RIFT gives comparable results to the same materials tested in the LIFT and to the published literature. The results the flame spread parameter and the minimum flux for flame spread are usually higher for the RIFT against the same material in the LIFT. There proved to be an effective limit on suitable materials able to be successfully tested in the RIFT to those that have a minimum flux for flame spread of less than 7 kW/m 2, with this limitation is dictated by the flux profile along the sample, and the lower resolution dictated by the smaller size.

40|$|The Forced Ignition and Spread Test (FIST) {{is being}} used to study the {{flammability}} characteristics of combustible materials in forced convective flows. The FIST methodology is based on the ASTM E- 1321, Lateral Ignition and Flame Spread Test (LIFT) which is used to determine the ignition and flame spread characteristics of materials, and to produce 'Flammability Diagrams' of materials. The <b>LIFT</b> <b>apparatus,</b> however, relies on natural convection to bring air to the combustion zone and the fuel vapor to the pilot flame, and thus cannot describe conditions where the oxidizer flow velocity may change. The FIST on the other hand, by relying on a forced flow as the dominant transport mechanism, can be used to examine variable oxidizer flow characteristics, such as velocity, oxygen concentration, and turbulence intensity, and consequently has a wider applicability. Particularly important is its ability to determine the flammability characteristics of materials used in spacecraft since in the absence of gravity the only flow present is that forced by the HVAC of the space facility. In this paper, we report work {{on the use of the}} FIST approach on the piloted ignition of a blended polypropylene fiberglass (PP/GL) composite material exposed to an external radiant flux in a forced convective flow of air.

40|$|A {{research}} program is currently underway {{with the final}} objective of developing a fundamental understanding of the controlling mechanisms underlying the flammability diagrams of solid combustible materials and their derived fire properties. Given {{that there is a}} high possibility of an accidental fire occurring in a space-based facility, understanding the fire properties of materials that will be used in such facilities is of critical importance. With this purpose, the flammability diagrams of the materials, as those produced by the Lateral Ignition and Flame Spread Test (<b>LIFT)</b> <b>apparatus</b> and by a new forced flow device, the Forced Flow Ignition and Flame Spread Test (FIST) apparatus, will be obtained. The specific objective of the program is to apply the new flammability apparatus, which will more accurately reflect the potential ambient conditions of space-based environments, to the characterization of the materials for space applications. This paper presents a parametric study of oxidizer flow effects on the ignition curve of the flammability diagrams of PMMA. The dependence of the ignition delay time on the external radiant flux and either the sample width (LIFT) or the flow velocity (FIST) has been studied. Although preliminary, the results indicate that natural and forced convection flow changes, affect the characteristics of the ignition curves of the flammability diagrams. The major effect on the ignition time appears to be due to convective transfer variations at the fuel surface. At high radiant fluxes or high flow velocities, however, it appears that gas phase processes become increasingly important, affecting the overall ignition delay time. A numerical analysis of the solid fuel heating and pyrolysis has also been developed. The theoretical predictions approximate the experiments well for conditions in which the gas phase induction time is negligible...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of an accidental fire in space-based facilities is a primary concern of space exploration programs. Spacecraft environments generally present low velocity air currents produced by ventilation and heating systems (of the order of 0. 1 m/s), and fluctuating oxygen concentrations around that of air due to CO 2 removal systems. Recent experiments of flame spread in microgravity show the spread rate to be faster and the limiting oxygen concentration lower than in normal-gravity. To date, {{there is not a}} material flammability-testing protocol that specifically addresses issues related to microgravity conditions. The present project (FIST) aims to establish a testing methodology that is suitable for the specific conditions of reduced gravity. The concepts underlying the operation of the <b>LIFT</b> <b>apparatus,</b> ASTM-E 1321 - 93, have been used to develop the Forced-flow Ignition and flame-Spread Test (FIST). As in the LIFT, the FIST is used to obtain the flammability diagrams of the material, i. e., graphs of ignition delay time and flame spread rate {{as a function of the}} externally applied radiant flux, but under forced flow rather than natural convection conditions, and for different oxygen concentrations. Although the flammability diagrams are similar, the flammability properties obtained with the FIST are found to depend on the flow characteristics. A research program is currently underway with the purpose of implementing the FIST as a protocol to characterize the flammability performance of solid materials to be used in microgravity facilities. To this point, tests have been performed with the FIST apparatus in both normal-gravity and microgravity conditions to determine the effects of oxidizer flow characteristics on the flammability diagrams of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) fuel samples. The experiments are conducted at reduced gravity in a KC- 135 aircraft following a parabolic flight trajectory that provides up to 25 seconds of low gravity. The objective of the experiments is to obtain data of ignition delay and flame spread rate at low flow velocities (0. 1 to 0. 2 m/s), which cannot be obtained under normal gravity because of the natural convection induced flows (approx. 0. 5 m/s). Due to the limited reduced gravity time, the data can only be obtained for high radiant fluxes, and are consequently limited in scope. These tests do, however, provide insight into the flammability diagram characteristics at low velocity and reduced gravity, and also into the implications of the flow-dependence of the flammability properties under environments similar to those encountered in space facilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{end of the}} 18 th century {{sees the}} decline of the late baroque and rococo in the {{decorative}} arts and the origin of the neoclassic essentiality.

40|$|THAT {{hydrotherapy}} is {{of value}} {{in the treatment of}} many locomotor dis-abilities has long been recognized. Two main methods are at present in use: (1) the deep pool and (2) the Hubbard tank. Both methods utilize the prin-ciple that a body weighs less when immersed in water, so that movements of weak limbs may be carried out more readily. Following the publication of a description of a modified Hubbard tank (Stewart, 1953), the Ministry of Health Working Party in Physical Medi-cine took an interest in the design of a tank suitable for general hospital use. Plans were drawn up and a prototype has been installed by the Swin-don Hospital Management Committee at a cost of £ 250. A hydraulically operated platform has now been designed for use in such a tank, by means of which it is possible for a patient to carry out exercises in the tank against progressively increased resistance. As the platform is very simply operated and is easily controlled by a physiotherapist, she can observe the effects of raising or lowering the patient during exercises and can, therefore, suit to the requirements of each individual case the amount of resistance to move-ment applied. Description The main features of the apparatus are illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 and Plate XXIX. For the sake of clarity in the working drawings the over-head <b>lifting</b> <b>apparatus</b> has not been included. The hoist is of the standard "King " pattern.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the prediction of}} opposed flow flame spread in the Fire Dynamics Simulator version 4 (FDS 4) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model by adapting the Lateral Ignition Flame Transport (LIFT) test procedure. It {{should be noted that}} FDS 4 was all that was available {{at the time of the}} analysis despite FDS 5 is now available for beta testing. This research follows on from previous work where LIFT experiments were conducted for various New Zealand timber and timber based products; those materials include Beech, Macrocarpa, Radiata Pine, Rimu, Hardboard, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), Melteca faced MDF, Plywood and Particle Board. The objective of this research is to investigate the accuracy of flame spread modelling in FDS 4; where the prediction of opposed flow flame spread parameters from FDS 4 were directly compared with the experimental results that were obtained experimentally. The standardised procedure for determining the material ignition and flame spread properties was followed and applied to simulate the LIFT test. The <b>LIFT</b> test <b>apparatus</b> was set up in FDS 4 with a domain size of 0. 9 x 0. 3 x 0. 3 metres in the x, y and z directions respectively. From the heat flux distribution along the calibration specimen, it indicated that calibration of the <b>LIFT</b> <b>apparatus</b> can be executed in FDS 4 where the percentage error is within 1. 2 %. This report also provides the thermal transport properties (i. e. thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity) of the tested New Zealand timber and timber based products. These were determined using a transient plane source technique and subsequently these properties were entered as the surface identifications in FDS 4. The ignition tests were not performed as part of the simulated LIFT test since a direct comparison with the results was required to give a more meaningful assessment. For this reason, the ignition parameters that were obtained from the previous experiments were employed to carry out the flame spread test. Due to the concept of a preheat time required by the standard test method and FDS 4 being not able to preheat specimens, the temperature immediately after the preheat time was calculated and implemented for the specimens. The heat transfer problem was solved using an explicit method; where specimens were divided into 11 different nodes. Different scenarios were investigated to see the effect that the selected combustion model has on modelling flame spread. The two analytical models tested were (1) thermoplastic fuels and (2) charring fuels model. Furthermore, the flame spread was visualised using either the Mixture Fraction or the HRRPUV model in Smokeview; where the rate of flame spread for each specimen was obtained. And lastly, three different absorption coefficients (0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 8) for each specimen were examined; this parameter contributed significantly to the rate of flame spread as it determines the amount of heat flux being absorbed by the specimen during the time of preheating. A study of the grid size was also performed to investigate the accuracy of the FDS 4 simulations with the grid size selected. It has been found that increasing the size of the grid cell does not greatly affect the flame spread results. Moisture content and heat of vaporisation input variables were also examined. From the flame spread data, moisture content does not have a significant role in modelling flame spread. However, it was indicated that the heat of vaporisation has an effect on the output of the flame spread parameters. It was determined from the sensitivity analysis that the most appropriate solid boundary condition to be used in predicting the flame spread would be thermoplastic fuels model with an absorption coefficient of 0. 8. By using this scenario as the basis, the plot of the arrival time against the distance along the specimen exhibits a similar trend of flame spread with the experimental results at first, but later on, the extinction of flame front actually occurred at a much earlier stage than the experimental results showed. In general, the analyses showed that FDS 4 cannot perform the LIFT test where the prediction of flame heating parameter and minimum heat flux for spread were out by more than 20 % shown by the direct comparison between experimental results. However, the prediction of minimum heat flux required for ignition seems to agree with the experimental results where the percentage error is within 20 %...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} a systematic methodology for predicting fire spread and growth and for a relative fire hazard classification of materials for any scale and fire environment. This methodol-ogy consists of three steps: (1) select laboratory test methods to perform flam-mability measurements; (2) based on these measurements, obtain key flamma-bility material properties which are precisely defined in this work; and (3) use these properties in a mathematical model of fire spread and growth to predict fire hazards. The complementary test methods we have selected and used are: (a) a general flammability test apparatus (such as NIST or FMRC) [1, 2] modified to also provide pyrolysis measurements in an inert N 2 atmosphere; (b) the Limited Oxygen Index (LOI) apparatus, which is used here as a tool for ob-taining properties needed for creeping flame spread and extinction, including vitiated environments; and (c) a solid material smoke-point height apparatus [8], which is used to characterize the smokiness of the burning material needed to determine the radiation and smoke yield for arbitrary fire situations (wall fires, pool fires or ceiling fires) [8]. The use and proper interpretation of the Limited Oxygen Index apparatus can replace the <b>LIFT</b> [10] <b>apparatus</b> for deter-mining in a more accurate and direct way the material properties required for creeping (vertical downward, lateral, horizontal) flame spread. The present methodology has been compared well with experiments in this work and else-where [9], and it has been used to predict critical conditions for fire spread [11], not empirically as it is usually done, but based on first principles of fire spread, fire growth and burning, together with material flammability properties syste-matically deduced from small-scale test measurements...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, {{flammability}} parameters {{associated with}} the igni-tion, combustion, and fire propagation processes and their usefulness {{for the development of}} fire resistant materials are discussed. The flammability param-eters discussed are: (a) Critical Heat Flux (CHF) and Thermal Response Param-eter (TRP), associated with ignition, (b) Heat Release Parameter (HRP) and Fire Propagation Index (FPI), associated with combustion and fire propagation. The CHF, TRP, and HRP values can be derived from the data measured in the most commonly used apparatuses: (1) the Ohio State University (OSU) Heat Release Apparatus, (2) the Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC) Flammability Apparatus, and (3) the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Flame Spread <b>Apparatus</b> (<b>LIFT)</b> and the Cone Calorimeter. The OSU and FMRC Apparatuses and the Cone Calorimeter generate very similar data for ignition and heat release rate for small horizontal and vertical samples under simulated fire conditions. The NIST LIFT and the FMRC Ap-paratuses generate very similar data for lateral, upward and downward fire propagation for slabs and cylinders under simulated fire conditions. The FMRC Apparatus is also used to perform Flame Radiation Scaling experiments to de-termine the range of flame radiative and convective flame heat fluxes trans-ferred to the surface during combustion in small- to large-scale fires, pertinent to the interior material fire scenarios leading to flashover.

40|$|To perform fire {{engineering}} analysis, data on how {{an object}} {{or group of}} objects burn is almost always needed. This data should be collected and stored in a logical and complete fashion to allow for meaningful analysis later. This thesis details {{the design of a}} new fire test Data Base Management System (DBMS) termed UCFIRE which was built to overcome the limitations of existing fire test DBMS and was based primarily on the FDMS 2. 0 and FIREBASEXML specifications. The UCFIRE DBMS is currently the most comprehensive and extensible DBMS available in the fire engineering community and can store the following test types: Cone Calorimeter, Furniture Calorimeter, Room/Corner Test, <b>LIFT</b> and Ignitability <b>Apparatus</b> Tests. Any data reduction which is performed on this fire test data should be done in an entirely mechanistic fashion rather than rely on human intuition which is subjective. Currently no other DBMS allows for the semi-automation of the data reduction process. A number of pertinent data reduction algorithms were investigated and incorporated into the UCFIRE DBMS. An ASP. NET Web Service (WEBFIRE) was built to reduce the bandwidth required to exchange fire test information between the UCFIRE DBMS and a UCFIRE document stored on a web server. A number of Mass Loss Rate (MLR) algorithms were investigated and {{it was found that the}} Savitzky-Golay filtering algorithm offered the best performance. This algorithm had to be further modified to autonomously filter other noisy events that occurred during the fire tests. This algorithm was then evaluated on test data from exemplar Furniture Calorimeter and Cone Calorimeter tests. The LIFT test standard (ASTM E 1321 - 97 a) requires its ignition and flame spread data to be scrutinised but does not state how to do this. To meet these requirements the fundamentals of linear regression were reviewed and an algorithm to mechanistically scrutinise ignition and flame spread data was developed.

The V-shaped funnel, as shown in Fig.  1 c, is used as one of the criteria for assessing the segregation resistance ability of SCC. In this test, the funnel was filled with SCC without rodding and then the bottom lid was opened. The time for the SCC to completely flow through the funnel was determined. The measured V-funnel time of 10.64  s is within the range for the JSCE’s 1 st class criteria (2005) and the results are listed in Table  5. The U-box test, illustrated in Fig.  1 d, is used to evaluate the self-compacting ability of SCC through an obstacle. SCC was filled in one section of the box and then the partition was pulled to allow the SCC to flow through the gaps between reinforcements (13  mm diameter) into the other section of the box. Fresh SCC with a filling height of over 300  mm can be judged as self-compacting in accordance with the 1 st class criteria of JSCE (2005). The filling height of SCC in the U-box test was above 300  mm. This satisfies the JSCE’s 1 st class criteria (2005) for self compacting ability, as listed in Table  5.|$|R
40|$|During {{the course}} of the Kennedy Space Center Summer Internship, two main {{experiments}} were performed: The Vacuum-Compacted Regolith Gripping Mechanism and Unmanned Flights via Quad-copters. The objectives of the Vacuum-Compacted Regolith Gripping Mechanism, often abbreviated as the Granular Gripper, are to exhibit Space Technology, such as a soft robotic hand, <b>lift</b> different <b>apparatuses</b> used to excavate regolith, and conserve energy while executing its intended task. The project is being conducted to test how much weight the Granular Gripper can hold. With the use of an Animatronic Robotic Hand, Arduino Uno, and other components, the system was calibrated before actually conducting the intended weight test. The maximum weight each finger could hold with the servos running, in the order of pinky, ring, middle, and index fingers, are as follows: 1. 340 N, 1. 456 N, 0. 9579 N, and 1. 358 N. Using the small vacuum pump system, the maximum weight each finger could hold, in the same order, was: 4. 076 N, 6. 159 N, 5. 454 N, and 4. 052 N. The maximum torques on each of the fingers when the servos were running, in the same respective order, was: 0. 0777 Nm, 0. 0533 Nm, 0. 0648 Nm, and 0. 0532 Nm. The maximum torques on the individual fingers, when the small vacuum pump was in effect, in the same order as above, was: 0. 2318 Nm, 0. 3032 Nm, 0. 2741 Nm, and 0. 1618 Nm. In testing all the fingers with the servos running, the total weight was 5. 112 N and the maximum torque on the all the fingers was 0. 2515 Nm. However, when the small vacuum pump system was used, the total weight was 19. 741 N and the maximum torque on the all the fingers was 0. 9713 Nm. The conclusion that was drawn stated that using the small vacuum pump system proved nearly 4 times more effective when testing how much weigh the hand could hold. The resistance provided by the compacted sand in the glove allowed more weight to be held by the hand and glove. Also, when the servos turned off and the hand still retaining its position, energy is being saved because the vacuum created the same resistance the running servos did without using power. The Unmanned Flights via Quad-rotors are built because multi-rotor dynamics are an important starting point and fair analog for space craft control systems and they make good terrestrial development platforms for various aspects of control for space crafts. The project is being conducted to see what the thrust response is going to be when a pulse width modulation command is sent to the control system since the quad-rotors are PWM controlled. A simulation environment in constructed so that one can quickly iterate and test different designs such as control systems, PID control vs. LDR control, and state estimation. Using two DIY Quad Kits, APM 2. 6, testing apparatus (called a data acquisition system) to test the quad-rotors, and a simulation program such as Simulink, two quad-rotors are built and controlled via a simulation program, which is designed to be as realistic as possible and not idealistic. Due to the quad-rotors not being completely built nor ready for testing, there are no results or conclusions to report...|$|R
