5|$|The boat chase {{was another}} scene that {{required}} very little CGI. Machine FX worked on replacing {{a few shots}} of visible stuntmen with a digital version of Craig's head, and recreated the boats Bond jumps over on his motorcycle {{to make it look}} more dangerous. Crowd creation was done for the Tosca scene by Machine FX, to make the performance <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had sold out. Forster edited the opera scene to resemble The Man Who Knew Too Much. In total, there are 900+ visual effects shots in Quantum of Solace.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order to block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode came from Matt Groening, who had wanted to do an episode in which Mr. Burns was shot, {{which could be used}} as a {{publicity}} stunt. The writers decided to write the episode in two parts with a mystery that could be used in a contest. It was important for them to design a mystery that had clues, took advantage of freeze frame technology, and was structured around one character who seemed to be the obvious culprit. While deciding who the culprit was, Oakley and Weinstein pitched Barney Gumble because he was a character that could go to jail and it could change the dynamic of the show. Mirkin suggested Maggie because he felt it was funnier and wanted the culprit to be a Simpsons family member. Oakley and Weinstein were initially unsure about having Maggie as the culprit, and it was decided that the episode would end with Maggie shifting her eyes and making it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was not a complete accident.|$|E

25|$|Louis XIV {{had promised}} {{to build a new}} church {{dedicated}} to Saint Genevieve, but it had never gotten underway. Louis XV laid the first stone for the new church on 6 September 1764. For the opening, a temporary portico of light materials was erected, to show what the church would <b>look</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> was not completed until 1790, {{at the time of the}} French Revolution of 1789, when it became the Panthéon.|$|E
25|$|Polish and {{symmetry}} are {{two important}} aspects of the cut. The polish describes the smoothness of the diamond's facets, and the symmetry refers to alignment of the facets. With poor polish, the surface of a facet can be dulled, and may create blurred or dulled sparkle. Often the surface of a poor polished diamond will have grain lines running across the facet. It may also constantly <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> needs to be cleaned. With poor symmetry, light can be misdirected as it enters and exits the diamond.|$|E

25|$|There can be {{some issues}} of undetected {{behaviors}} {{in the case of}} behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal behaviors that are discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, {{there would have to be}} either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless. Even if environment does play a role, the numbers would still be skewed.|$|E
25|$|Fan {{stated that}} every game {{he worked on}} had only him {{designing}} the prototype, adding {{that he used to}} draw a lot before he made games, where he made pixel art. The final designs of the zombies and the first plants are similar to how they were initially. After searching for an artist, they discovered Rich Werner, who Fan thought clicked with what he intended for the design. He attributed the intrigue of the design to its animation scheme; Tod Semple suggested that they animate it in Flash and export it into the game. Fan worried that this would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was cut out from paper, and would resemble South Park too much, but was satisfied in the end, attributing this to Semple and Werner's talents.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{the larger}} the format size, the longer a lens {{will need to be}} to capture the same framing as a smaller format. In motion pictures, for example, a frame with a 12 degree {{horizontal}} field of view will require a 50mm lens on 16mm film, a 100mm lens on 35mm film, and a 250mm lens on 65mm film. Conversely, using the same focal length lens with each of these formats will yield a progressively wider image as the film format gets larger: a 50mm lens has a horizontal field of view of 12degrees on 16mm film, 23.6degrees on 35mm film, and 55.6degrees on 65mm film. Therefore, because the larger formats require longer lenses than the smaller ones, they will accordingly have a smaller depth of field. Compensations in exposure, framing, or subject distance need to be made in order to make one format <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was filmed in another format.|$|E

25|$|The {{casting process}} {{was carried out}} in secret, with no script being sent out to candidates. With {{production}} estimated to have a budget of $30million, principal photography began in mid-June 2007 in New York. One cast member said that the film would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> cost $150million, despite producers not casting recognizable and expensive actors. Filmmakers used the Panasonic HVX200 for most of the interior scenes, and the Sony CineAlta F23 high-definition video camera to tape nearly all of the New York exterior scenes. Filming took place on Coney Island, with scenes shot at Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park and the B Carousel. The scenes of tanks firing at the creature while the main characters hide in a stairwell were filmed on Hennesy Street on Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, CA. Some interior shots were taped on a soundstage at Downey, California. Bloomingdale's in the movie was actually shot in an emptied Robinsons-May store that was under reconstruction in Arcadia, California. The outside scenes of Sephora and the electronics store were taped in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began on}} September 23, 2006. The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg {{was used for}} the {{interior}} of Neville's home, while Greenwich Village {{was used for the}} exterior. Other locations include the Tribeca section of lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier Intrepid, the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx, and St. Patrick's Cathedral. Weeds were imported from Florida and were strewn across locations to make the city <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> had been overgrown with them. The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, [...] "I don't think anyone's {{going to be able to}} do that in New York again anytime soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career." ...|$|E

Crime-scene photographs not {{made available to the}} original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body. The gun itself also appears to have moved. Former Lancashire Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell, shown the photographs by the Guardian and Observer, said in 2011: [...] "The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again to make it <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was originally.

500|$|The episode {{contained}} several {{scenes that}} were reminiscent of past episodes of the series. The shot in which Jim and Dwight survey {{the office was}} filmed {{to be similar to}} a scene that featured Dwight and Michael in the third season installment [...] "Gay Witch Hunt". In addition, Dwight pulling Angela over was filmed in a way that recalled the sixth season episode [...] "The Delivery". Although the scene wherein Jim gives advice to Dwight was shot in a similar manner to Jim's farewell to Michael in the seventh season episode [...] "Goodbye, Michael", it was not intentionally supposed to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> according to Rogers. In addition, the obstacle course was not a direct reference to the second season episode [...] "Office Olympics", although Rogers understood that there were similarities.|$|E
500|$|However, {{not all the}} sixth-season episodes were poorly received. The season's third episode, [...] "Triangle" [...] {{was largely}} lauded as a {{masterpiece}} by critics. The episode, which was shot in real time to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was filmed in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes, was called a [...] "classic" [...] standalone episode {{and one of the}} [...] "highlights of season six". The [...] "Two Fathers"/"One Son" [...] story-arc, which featured the destruction of the Syndicate, was called one [...] "of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run" [...] by one critic. Finally, the Duchovny-penned [...] "The Unnatural", which featured the story of an alien who fell in love with baseball, was praised by critics for its plot, directing, and originality. One review praised Duchovny's directing [...] "excellence" [...] while another referred to its ending as [...] "heartbreaking".|$|E
500|$|The Nazi German {{administration}} {{directed and}} supported the organized killing of Lithuanian Jews. Local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime carried out logistics for the preparation and execution of the murders under Nazi direction. Nazi SS Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker arrived in Kaunas on 25 June 1941 and gave agitation speeches {{in the city to}} instigate the murder of Jews. Initially this was in the former State Security Department building, but officials there refused to take any action. Later, he gave speeches in the city. In a report of October 15, Stahlecker wrote that they had succeeded in covering up their vanguard unit (Vorkommando) actions, and it was made to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was the initiative of the local population. Groups of partisans, civil units of nationalist-rightist anti-Soviet affiliation, initiated contact with the Germans as soon as they entered the Lithuanian territories.|$|E

500|$|Lovering {{appeared}} in the 2006 documentary loudQUIETloud, which covered the Pixies' 2004 reunion tour. His father died midway during the tour, and Lovering began drinking heavily as a result. According to Thompson, Lovering [...] "messed {{up a couple of}} songs" [...] during a number of live shows. [...] "It was all caught on film", said Thompson, [...] "but they re-edited this to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> happened in the middle of our tour and it looked like this whole tour careened into this drunken stupor with David. It really wasn't like that at all". He toured with the Pixies throughout 2005 and 2006, while performing at the Magic Castle on Friday nights with The Unholy Three. In 2007, Lovering played a benefit concert for Wally Ingram as part of The Martinis. Later that year, he formed a new band called The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, with Los Angeles musicians Amit Itelman and Oscar Rey.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{noted that}} the {{majority}} of the film was shot indoors, where oblong sets, corridors, and small spaces manifest constriction and tightness, in contrast to the usual emphasis on sweep and majesty in historical dramas. Hooper used wide shots to capture the actors' body language, particularly Geoffrey Rush, who trained at L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris and [...] "is consequently brilliant in the way he carries his body". Hooper widened his scope first to capture Rush's gestures, then full body movements and silhouettes. The approach carried over to Firth as well. In the first consultation scene, the Duke is squeezed against the end of a long couch framed against a large wall, [...] "as if to use the arm of the sofa as a kind of friend, as a security blanket?" [...] Martin Filler praised the [...] "low-wattage" [...] cinematography of Danny Cohen, as making everything <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has been [...] "steeped in strong tea".|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson's {{arrival in}} the House of Commons {{attracted}} considerable press comment, much of it related to her bright red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing. She informed MPs: [...] "I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world—I know I do not <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> but I do". The Woman's Leader [...] described her as a [...] "vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician". As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson achieved {{one of her first}} parliamentary victories in 1925, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill. She combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches, in March 1926, to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's ODNB biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while [...] "women's issues" [...] were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former.|$|E
