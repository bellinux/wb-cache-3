40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to managing the movement of the <b>lift</b> <b>installation</b> <b>work</b> by mechanical control. In order to establish movement patterns that provide the minimum dynamic load {{at the beginning of the}} movement mode is selected with a constant value leap. Depending on traffic patterns resulting pressure can establish geometric system of mechanical control system, which is reeling from a working body bitsylindro-parabolic profile. The new profile allows the drum to get moving on it as close theoretical flooring. ? ?????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ????? ????????????? ??????????. ? ????? ???????????? ??????????????? ????????, ??????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ??? ?????? ???????? ?????? ????? ? ?????????? ????????? ?????. ?????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ???????? ???????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????? ????? ??????????-?????????????? ????????. ???????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ?? ????????????? ????????...|$|E

40|$|The {{floating}} sheerlegs of SMIT {{are used}} for a large variety of tasks in sheltered, near shore as well as offshore environments. Generally the tasks vary from recovering operations (salvage) to inshore <b>installation</b> <b>work.</b> Originally, the usage of floating sheerlegs was driven by their robustness, needed for recovering work and shallow draft, needed for working near shore. In the past years the sheerlegs of SMIT became increasingly utilized for <b>installation</b> <b>work</b> offshore. As a result, {{the need for more}} detailed analysis showing the feasibility, related safety and reliability of operations emerged. In the engineering phase of such offshore installation projects these aspects are analyzed for each operational phase from load-out, towage to offshore <b>lifting</b> and <b>installation.</b> This paper addresses the crucial elements {{that need to be addressed}} when a floating sheerlegs is utilized for offshore <b>installation</b> <b>work.</b> The engineering topics that will be discussed in this paper are stability, strength and multi body dynamics. To demonstrate the relevance and validity of the discussed topics, an offshore installation project is analyzed in terms of measured motions and wave conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of a lift system is affected by dynamic phenomena and vibrations. This affects ride quality and results in {{a high level of}} dynamic stresses in the <b>lift</b> <b>installation</b> components. This paper demonstrates a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical <b>lift</b> <b>installations.</b> Subsequently, vibration modelling and simulation techniques for the prediction of their dynamic responses is discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques is demonstrated using the car – sling assembly as an example. Then, suitable strategies are described to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|R

40|$|Tall {{buildings}} {{are susceptible to}} large sway motions when subjected to earthquake excitations. They are particularly affected by long period earthquake ground motions. These low frequency seismic waves resonate with the fundamental mode of the building structure which in turn causes resonance interactions with long slender continua such as lift suspension ropes, compensating ropes and overspeed governor ropes deployed in modular <b>lift</b> <b>installations.</b> Damage due to large resonance motions of suspension/ compensating ropes and cables during earthquake {{are one of the}} most common modes of failure in high-rise <b>lift</b> <b>installations.</b> In this paper an analytical model to predict the dynamic responses of suspension/ compensating/ governor rope system installed in tall buildings under seismic conditions is presented. The model is then used to predict the dynamic performance of the system under long period earthquake excitations. The predictions can then be used to develop suitable mitigating strategies and protective measures to minimize the earthquake damage...|$|R
