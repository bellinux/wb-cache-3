Steering was achieved by the combined use of thrusters and ejectable balance masses. The ejectable balance masses shift the capsule center of mass enabling generation of a <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> during the atmospheric phase. A navigation computer integrated the measurements to estimate the position and attitude of the capsule that generated automated torque commands. This was the first planetary mission to use precision landing techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable ballast masses consisting of two [...] tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. The <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately [...] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more ballast mass consisting of six [...] tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.|$|E
50|$|By definition, lift is {{perpendicular}} to the oncoming flow. As the left wing moves up, its effective angle of attack is decreased, so its <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> tilts back. Conversely, as the right wing descends, its <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> tilts forward. The result is an adverse yaw moment to the left, opposite to the intended right turn.|$|E
50|$|As the tilting of the left/right <b>lift</b> <b>vectors</b> is {{the major}} cause to adverse yaw, an {{important}} parameter is the magnitude of these <b>lift</b> <b>vectors,</b> or the aircraft's lift coefficient to be more specific. Flight at low lift coefficient (or high speed compared to minimum speed) produces less adverse yaw.|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Let M be an n-dimensional Riemannian {{manifold}} and TM its tangent bundle. The conformal {{and fiber}} preserving vector fields on TM have well-known physical interpretations {{and have been}} studied by physicists and geometricians. Here we define a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian lift metric g on TM, which is in some senses more general than other lift metrics previously defined on TM, and seems to complete these works. Next we study the <b>lift</b> conformal <b>vector</b> fields on () TM g, and prove among the others that, every complete <b>lift</b> conformal <b>vector</b> field on TM is homothetic, and moreover, every horizontal or vertical <b>lift</b> conformal <b>vector</b> field on TM is a Killing vector...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{different}} from a biplane, in which the wings are stacked more or less vertically, one above the other, such that their <b>lift</b> <b>vectors</b> are very close together and a separate horizontal stabiliser surface is required, placed well forward or aft of the main wings; and from the canard or [...] "tail-first" [...] configuration in that the forward wing contributes {{a major part of}} the lift, typically more than 50%.|$|R
50|$|During an out-of-plane maneuver, the attacker's nose {{no longer}} {{points at the}} defender. Instead, the {{aircraft}} is rolled until its <b>lift</b> <b>vector,</b> (an imaginary line running vertically {{from the center of}} the aircraft, perpendicular to its wings), is aligned either ahead of, directly at, or behind the defender, using roll rate instead of turn rate to set the proper pursuit curve. The aircraft's velocity vector, (an imaginary line in the direction of motion) will be pulled in the direction of the <b>lift</b> <b>vector.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lift in {{the load}} factor is also {{intended}} {{as having a}} sign, which is positive if the <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> points in the same direction, or close to, as the aircraft's vertical axis, or negative if it points in the opposite direction, or close to opposite, to the vertical axis.|$|E
50|$|The Apollo Command Module reentered {{with the}} center of mass offset from the center line; this caused the capsule to assume an angled {{attitude}} through the air, providing a sideways lift {{to be used for}} directional control. Rotational thrusters were used to steer the capsule under either automatic or manual control by changing the <b>lift</b> <b>vector.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... as a {{field of}} endomorphisms of the tangent bundle, the Riemann {{curvature}} tensor.Since [...] is induced by the <b>lifted</b> <b>vector</b> field X* on E, {{the use of the}} vector fields Ui and V and their Lie brackets is more or less equivalent to this approach. The vertical vector field W=A* corresponding to the canonical generator A of [...] could also be added since it commutes with V and satisfies W,U1 = U2 and W,U2 = —U1.|$|R
5000|$|Adverse yaw is a {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} inclination of the <b>lift</b> <b>vectors</b> on the wing due to its rolling velocity and of {{the application of the}} ailerons. Some pilot training manuals focus mainly on the additional drag caused by the downward-deflected aileron and make only brief or indirect mentions of roll effects. In fact the rolling of the wings usually causes a greater effect than the ailerons. Assuming a roll rate to the right, as in the diagram, the causes are explained as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{connection}} {{can thus}} be {{described in terms of}} lifting paths in the manifold to paths in the tangent or orthonormal frame bundle, thus formalising the classical theory of the [...] "moving frame", favoured by French authors. Lifts of loops about a point give rise to the holonomy group at that point. The Gaussian curvature at a point can be recovered from parallel transport around increasingly small loops at the point. Equivalently curvature can be calculated directly at an infinitesimal level in terms of Lie brackets of <b>lifted</b> <b>vector</b> fields.|$|R
50|$|When an {{airplane}} is {{in a small}} to moderate bank (roll angle) {{a small amount of}} 'back pressure' is required to maintain height. This is required because the <b>lift</b> <b>vector,</b> which would be pointing vertically upwards in level flight, is now angled inwards so some of the lift is turning the aircraft. A higher overall amount of lift is required so that the vertical component remains sufficient for a level turn.|$|E
5000|$|During {{straight}} and level flight, the load factor is +1 if the aircraft is flown [...] "the right way up", whereas it becomes -1 if the aircraft is flown [...] "upside-down" [...] (inverted). In {{both cases the}} <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> is the same (as seen by an observer on the ground), but in the latter the vertical axis of the aircraft points downwards, making the lift vector's sign negative.|$|E
50|$|An aileron (French for 'little wing' or 'fin') is a hinged {{flight control}} surface usually forming part of the {{trailing}} edge of each wing of a fixed-wing aircraft. Ailerons are used in pairs to control the aircraft in roll (or movement around the aircraft's longitudinal axis), which normally results in a change in flight path due to the tilting of the <b>lift</b> <b>vector.</b> Movement around this axis is called 'rolling' or 'banking'.|$|E
5000|$|A tandem wing {{aircraft}} has {{two main}} wings, with one located forward {{and the other}} to the rear. Both wings contribute to lift. In cases where the rearmost tandem wing is smaller than the forward wing, such that it resembles an oversized tailplane, it is referred to as a [...] "Delanne wing" [...] - from Maurice Delanne, a French designer of tandem wing aircraft. In a tandem wing design the <b>lift</b> <b>vectors</b> on the two wings are spread far apart longitudinally, allowing them to act together to achieve stability and control.|$|R

5000|$|This [...] "universal lift" [...] then {{immediately}} induces <b>lifts</b> to <b>vector</b> bundles associated with E and hence allows the covariant derivative, and its generalisation to forms, to be recovered.|$|R
5000|$|A lag {{displacement}} roll, {{also called}} a [...] "lag roll", is a maneuver {{used to reduce}} the angle off tail by bringing the attacker from lead pursuit to pure, or even lag pursuit. The maneuver is performed by rolling up {{and away from the}} turn, then, when the aircraft's <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> is aligned with the defender, pulling back on the stick, bringing the fighter back into the turn. This maneuver helps prevent an overshoot caused by the high AOT of lead pursuit, and {{can also be used to}} increase the distance between aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterwards, the P.1101 {{was taken}} to the United States for study at Bell Aircraft, but because of missing {{documentation}} and structural damage, Bell decided against completing it. Instead, a close copy was constructed which featured wings that could adjust sweep angle in flight. One problem discovered while testing the Bell X-5 was that as the wing pivoted rearward, the <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> also moved to the rear, pushing the nose down. A system to compensate for this basic effect had to be added for any such design to be viable.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{high-speed}} aircraft have a wing that spends {{at least}} some of its time in the supersonic airflow. But since the shock cone moves towards the fuselage with increased speed (that is, the cone becomes narrower), the portion of the wing in the supersonic flow also changes with speed. Since these wings are swept, as the shock cone moves inward, the <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> moves forward [...] as the outer, rearward portions of the wing are generating less lift. This results in powerful pitching moments and their associated required trim changes.|$|E
40|$|We define affine {{transport}} lifts on the tangent bundle by associating a transport {{rule for}} tangent vectors with a vector {{field on the}} base manifold. The aim is to develop tools {{for the study of}} kinetic/ dynamical symmetries in relativistic particle motion. The transport lift unifies and generalises the various existing <b>lifted</b> <b>vector</b> fields, with clear geometric interpretations. We find the affine dynamical symmetries of free particle motion, and compare this to previous results and to the alternative concept of "matter symmetry". Comment: 6 pages Latex.

50|$|An {{unwanted}} {{side effect}} of aileron operation is adverse yaw—a yawing moment {{in the opposite direction}} to the roll. Using the ailerons to roll an aircraft to the right produces a yawing motion to the left. As the aircraft rolls, adverse yaw is caused partly by the change in drag between the left and right wing. The rising wing generates increased lift, which causes increased induced drag. The descending wing generates reduced lift, which causes reduced induced drag. Profile drag caused by the deflected ailerons may add further to the difference, along with changes in the <b>lift</b> <b>vectors</b> as one rotates back while the other rotates forward.|$|R
5000|$|ExoLance is {{an ingenious}} {{proposal}} that uses ground penetrating [...] "lances". Curiosity carries ballast {{in the form}} of two 75 kg tungsten weights, which it discards on arrival at Mars to help with the asymmetric trim of the aeroshell, to generate a <b>lifting</b> <b>vector.</b> That is how it manages to achieve higher precision than other missions to date. See MSL - guided entry. The idea is to put impact resistant instruments into these weights, and make them into ground penetrating [...] "missiles" [...] able to penetrate to a depth of a meter or so, where conditions may be more favourable for preservation of life.|$|R
5000|$|A lag {{displacement}} roll, or [...] "lag roll," [...] helps {{improve the}} firing {{position of the}} attacking aircraft, and helps to increase range. The attacker performs the roll during a hard, turning chase, rolling both up {{and away from the}} turn. Typically performed a little slower than a normal displacement roll, the attacker achieves the proper reduction in turn radius on, or just outside the defender's turn. Upon completing the roll, when the aircraft's <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> points directly at the enemy, the pilot pulls back on the stick, reentering the turn with the ability to achieve a better firing position.|$|E
5000|$|... {{hypersonic}} grid fins {{were added}} to the booster test vehicle design beginning on the fifth ocean controlled-descent test flight in 2014 in order to enable precision landing. Arranged in an [...] "X" [...] configuration, the grid fins control the descending rocket's <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> once the vehicle has returned to the atmosphere to enable a much more precise landing location. [...] Iteration on the design continued into 2017. Larger and more robust grid fins, made from forged titanium and left unpainted, were first tested in June 2017, and will be used on all reusable Block 5 Falcon 9 first stages starting in late 2017.|$|E

50|$|Connections on {{a surface}} {{can be defined}} {{in a variety of}} ways. The Riemannian {{connection}} or Levi-Civita connection is perhaps most easily understood in terms of <b>lifting</b> <b>vector</b> fields, considered as first order differential operators acting on functions on the manifold, to differential operators on the frame bundle: {{in the case of an}} embedded surface, the lift is very simply described in terms of orthogonal projection. Indeed the vector bundles associated with the frame bundle are all sub-bundles of trivial bundles that extend to the ambient Euclidean space; a first order differential operator can always be applied to a section of a trivial bundle, in particular to a section of the original sub-bundle, although the resulting section might no longer be a section of the sub-bundle. This can be corrected by projecting orthogonally.|$|R

40|$|An {{extensive}} research {{program has been}} underway at the NASA Langley Research Center to define and develop the technologies required for low-speed flight of high-performance aircraft. This 10 -year program has placed emphasis on both short takeoff and landing (STOL) and short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) operations rather than on regular up and away flight. A series of NASA in-house as well as joint projects have studied various technologies including high <b>lift,</b> <b>vectored</b> thrust, thrust-induced <b>lift,</b> reversed thrust, an alternate method of providing trim and control, and ground effects. These technologies have been investigated {{on a number of}} configurations ranging from industry designs for advanced fighter aircraft to generic wing-canard research models. Test conditions have ranged from hover (or static) through transition to wing-borne flight at angles of attack from - 5 to 40 deg at representative thrust coefficients...|$|R
50|$|The {{maneuver}} {{is performed}} when an overshoot is imminent and {{cannot be corrected}} with a normal displacement roll. Much more aggressive than a normal displacement roll, the maneuver begins by rolling slightly toward {{the direction of the}} defender's break, and then pulling up sharply. At roughly 30 degrees from the horizon, the pilot begins the barrel roll away from the defender's break, applying more elevator pressure than roll. When inverted, the pilot then uses the assistance provided by gravity combined with rudder control to bring the fuselages of both aircraft into alignment. As the nose passes through the horizon, the pilot will then align the <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> ahead of the defender, to bring the fighter back into the correct geometric plane, inside of the defender's turn.|$|E
50|$|The aerial vehicle {{combines}} {{static and}} dynamic lift, mirror or symmetric rotation flight modes and consequently uses functions commonly known from Balloon (aeronautics), Airplanes and Helicopters. It has a gas cell and two wings with a symmetric profile {{which can be}} twisted by 180° and one Electric motor {{at the end of}} each wing. As usual with balloons, the static <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> (buoyant gas) and the vector of payload with batteries are positioned opposed to each other. The cell does not resemble a cigar form but rather reminds of a rotation-symmetric Frisbee disc. The vectors of the carried components - unlike with airships - are not distributed over the total length of the body between prow, cabin and stern. Opposed to this hybrid universal aircraft shows high potentials to more efficient sustainable flight missions and therefore applications with longer abidance in the air.|$|E
50|$|Adverse yaw is {{the natural}} and {{undesirable}} tendency for an aircraft to yaw {{in the opposite direction}} of a roll. It is caused by the difference in profile drag between the upward and downward deflected ailerons, the difference in lift and thus induced drag between left and right wings, as well as an opposite rotation of each wing's <b>lift</b> <b>vector</b> about the pitch axis due to the rolling trajectory of the aircraft. The effect can be greatly minimized with ailerons deliberately designed to create drag when deflected upward and/or mechanisms which automatically apply some amount of coordinated rudder. As the major causes of adverse yaw vary with lift, any fixed-ratio mechanism will fail to fully solve the problem across all flight conditions and thus any manually operated aircraft will require some amount of rudder input from the pilot in order to maintain coordinated flight.|$|E
40|$|A {{canonical}} {{vector field}} on the tangent bundle is a vector field defined by an invariant coordinate construction. In this paper, a complete classification of canonical vector fields on tangent bundles, depending on vector fields defined on their bases, is obtained. It is shown that every canonical vector field is a linear combination with constant coefficients of three vector fields: the variational <b>vector</b> field (canonical <b>lift),</b> the Liouville <b>vector</b> field, and the vertical <b>lift</b> of a <b>vector</b> {{field on the}} base of the tangent bundle...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} lower bounds for the Bakry-Emery Ricci tensor of nonsymmetric diffusion operators by convexity of entropy on the L^ 2 -Wasserstein space, {{and define}} a curvature-dimension condition for general metric measure spaces {{together with a}} square integrable 1 -form {{in the sense of}} giglinonsmooth. This extends the Lott-Sturm-Villani approach for lower Ricci curvature bounds of metric measure spaces.
