5|$|In {{comparison}} to dogs, cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process, as {{the form and}} behavior of the domestic cat is not radically {{different from those of}} wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild. Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations, producing hybrids such as the Kellas cat. This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids, notably the Asian <b>leopard</b> <b>cat.</b> Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets. These traits include their small size, social nature, obvious body language, love of play and relatively high intelligence. Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} few {{targeted}} studies of small felids in Sumatra {{and there is little}} information on their ecology. As a result there are no specific management plans for the species on Sumatra. We examined data from a long-term camera trapping effort, and used Maximum Entropy Modeling to assess the habitat use and distribution of Sunda clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi), Asiatic golden <b>cats</b> (Pardofelis temminckii), <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis), and marbled cats (Pardofelis marmorata) in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park. Over a period of 34, 166 trap nights there were low photo rates (photo events/ 100 trap nights) for all species; 0. 30 for golden cats, 0. 15 for clouded leopards, 0. 10 for marbled cats, and 0. 08 for <b>leopard</b> <b>cats.</b> There is overlap in the predicted distributions of clouded <b>leopards,</b> golden <b>cats,</b> and marbled cats; indicating areas of high conservation importance for these species within the park. The predicted distribution of <b>leopard</b> <b>cats</b> was discrete from the other species which is important to consider in the development of conservation strategies. This study provides important documentation of small felid distribution in Sumatra, information for the development of management strategies within the park, and a basis upon which to develop future research for the species...|$|R
