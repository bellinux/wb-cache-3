5|$|Uzanne's {{bibliophile}} {{activity in}} the early 1880s coincided with the gradual abandonment of manual methods of printing illustrations kin favour of photomechanized methods. His collection of contemporary bibliophilic books was sold in 1894 by Hôtel Drouot. It contained {{some of the finest}} examples of late 19th-century French bookbinding, by binders <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Meunier, Lucien Magnin, Pétrus Ruban, Camille Martin, René Wiener and Victor Prouvé.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find who owned the land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E

5|$|Bowie studied art, {{music and}} design, {{including}} layout and typesetting. After Terry Burns, his half-brother, {{introduced him to}} modern jazz, his enthusiasm for players <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Mingus and John Coltrane led his mother {{to give him a}} Grafton saxophone in 1961; he was soon receiving lessons from a local musician. Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl. After a series of operations during a four-month hospitalisation, his doctors determined that the damage could not be fully repaired and Bowie was left with faulty depth perception and a permanently dilated pupil, which gave a false impression of a change in the iris' colour. Despite their altercation, Underwood and Bowie remained good friends, and Underwood went on to create the artwork for Bowie's early albums.|$|E
5|$|In his ghostly form, Frank {{confronts the}} Grim Reaper and discovers {{that he is}} the ghost of Johnny Bartlett, a {{psychiatric}} hospital orderly who killed twelve people 30 years earlier, before being captured, convicted and executed. Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever, showing pride at killing more than contemporaries <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Starkweather. Patricia Bradley, then a teenager, was accused as his accomplice, although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status. Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia. Unknown to them, Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly, homicidal terms with Bartlett's ghost, and eventually kills her own mother, who had been trying to monitor her daughter's behavior. Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett's spirit in his urn, which Patricia has kept. The pair make for the chapel of the now-abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett's ghost to Hell.|$|E

25|$|The queen liked {{physical}} {{sculpture and}} design too, and retained the designer Inigo Jones as her surveyor of works during the 1630s. <b>Like</b> <b>Charles,</b> Henrietta Maria was enthusiastic about garden design, although not horticulture itself. She employed the French gardener André Mollet {{to create a}} baroque garden at Wimbledon House.|$|E
25|$|Both Henrietta Ward and {{her husband}} were {{supporters}} of the cause of women's suffrage. The Wards traveled in an artistic circle that included figures <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Dickens and George Cruikshank.

Both brothers served in the Chemical Warfare Service in World War I and on the Manhattan Project.|$|E
25|$|Some states devised loyalty oaths {{designed}} to exclude Catholics {{from state and}} local office. The public support for American independence and the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by prominent American Catholics <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Carroll of Carrollton, the only Catholic signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his second cousins, Bishop John Carroll and Daniel Carroll, allowed Roman Catholics {{to be included in}} the constitutional protections of civil and religious liberty.|$|E
25|$|Theosophy {{was also}} an {{influence}} {{over a number of}} early pioneers of abstract art. The Russian abstract expressionist Wassily Kandinsky was very interested in Theosophy and Theosophical ideas about colour. The Dutch abstract artist Piet Mondrian was also influenced by Theosophical symbolism. Theosophical ideas were also an influence on the Irish literary movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, with writers <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Johnston, George Russell, John Eglinton, Charles Weeks, and William Butler Yeats having an interest in the movement.|$|E

25|$|A {{huge part}} of the {{economic}} life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to {{the headquarters of the}} North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the St. Rollox railway works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn.|$|E
25|$|Campbell was {{the only}} Canadian prime {{minister}} not to have resided at 24 Sussex Drive since that address became the official home of the Prime Minister of Canada in 1951. Campbell's predecessor Mulroney remained at 24 Sussex while renovations on his new home in Montreal were being completed. Campbell instead took up residence at Harrington Lake, the PM's summer and weekend retreat, located in rural Quebec, north of Ottawa, {{and she did not}} move into 24 Sussex after Mulroney left. <b>Like</b> <b>Charles</b> Tupper and John Turner, Campbell never sat in Parliament as Prime Minister, as her term was filled by the summer break and the election campaign.|$|E
25|$|Kent's {{only real}} {{downfall}} {{was said to}} be his lack of horticultural knowledge and technical skill (which people <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Bridgeman possessed – whose impact on Kent is often underestimated), but his naturalistic style of design was his major contribution to the history of landscape design. Claremont, Stowe, and Rousham are places where their joint efforts can be viewed. Stowe and Rousham are Kent's most famous works. At the latter, Kent elaborated on Bridgeman's 1720s design for the property, adding walls and arches to catch the viewer's eye. At Stowe, Kent used his Italian experience, particularly with the Palladian Bridge. At both sites Kent incorporated his naturalistic approach.|$|E

25|$|When World War II {{began in}} September 1939 with Germany's {{invasion}} of Poland and Britain and France's subsequent {{declaration of war}} upon Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily. Isolationist leaders <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Lindbergh and Senator William Borah successfully mobilized opposition to Roosevelt's proposed repeal of the Neutrality Act, but Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cash-and-carry basis. He also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in September 1939— the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them. Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in May 1940.|$|E
25|$|Many {{workplaces}} {{through history}} have been crowded, low-paying and without job security; {{but the concept}} of a sweatshop originated between 1830 and 1850 as a specific type of workshop in which a certain type of middleman, the sweater, directed others in garment making (the process of producing clothing) under arduous conditions. The terms sweater for the middleman and sweat system for the process of subcontracting piecework were used in early critiques <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty, written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the sweating system, a system of subcontracting in the tailoring trade were called sweatshops and might contain only a few workers or as many as 100 and more.|$|E
25|$|Driscoll {{adheres to}} Reformed or Calvinist theology, {{although}} he characterizes his position specifically as New Calvinism to differentiate {{himself from the}} more cessationist and non-missional aspects associated historically with Calvinism. Driscoll denies the orthodox Calvinist view of limited atonement and believes instead that Jesus died for all people in some sense, and for some people (the elect) in another sense. He thinks this position was what John Calvin believed, saying in a humorous tone: 'Calvinism came after Calvin... I {{will argue that the}} Calvinists are not very Calvin. I will argue against Calvinism with Calvin... What kind of Calvinist are you? I'm a Calvin, not a Calvinist, that came later'. Driscoll also believes that this position (or slight variations thereof) was held by men <b>like</b> <b>Charles</b> Spurgeon, John Bunyan, Martin Luther, and Richard Baxter.|$|E
