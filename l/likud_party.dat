5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel Ariel Sharon {{and members of}} the <b>Likud</b> <b>Party,</b> along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the <b>Likud</b> <b>Party</b> members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
5|$|While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the {{elections}} held in late-December, {{the release of}} the Agranat Commission's findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation's political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread public outrage. Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of Labor Party's unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem Begin and the <b>Likud</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the impact of {{economic}} ideologies on one important area of policy. We compare the periods of 1968 - 77 (Labor) and 1978 - 87 (Likud) to determine whether differences in the stated economic ideologies of the <b>Likud</b> and Labor <b>parties</b> are reflected in their privatization policies. Furthermore, we examine {{whether there are differences}} in the techniques used to privatize by the Labor and the <b>Likud</b> <b>parties.</b> Although Labor and Likud policymakers may both choose privatization as a policy, different political environments and political bases may affect such choices. We examine the impact of these differences on the design of the specific privatization techniques selected, assess whether differences in the techniques exist, and attempt to account for such differences. Our analysis reveals that both Labor and <b>Likud</b> <b>parties</b> undertook similar privatization policies. The empirical findings contradict the hypothesis that ideological differences between the two large parties in Israel will be reflected in significant variation in privatization policy. There are {{no significant differences between the}} two parties in number, type, or implementation of privatization policy. We find evidence that an important factor for all Israeli governments is budgetary pressure, operationalized as a deficit variable. We also find some difference between parties in the implementation of privatization, with Labor demonstrating a greater propensity to sell complete enterprises, and Likud engaging in more partial sales of state assets. We argue that this difference results from the differing ability of each party to negotiate with Israel's largest labor union. The fact that there were no significant differences in the number of actions taken by Likud and Labor administrations suggests that there are other barriers to this process. Two explanations for this process are indicated. ...|$|R

50|$|In July 2010, after a {{four-year}} trial for election bribery, fraud and breach of trust, a Jerusalem court cleared Hanegbi of all charges. However, the three-judge panel found him guilty of perjury. The case stems from Hanegbi's denial {{that he was}} behind an ad boosting his appointments of <b>Likud</b> <b>party's</b> political activists to positions in the Ministry of the Environmental Protection. The judges verdict cleared Hanegbi of any criminal wrongdoing, accepting the defense's argument that such appointments were not illegal prior to 2004, {{and that this was}} the common practice among all cabinet members in all the previous governments since Israel's independence. The court ruled that selectively prosecuting Hanegbi for what was a widespread and common practice was wrong and unfair. Hanegbi was urged by his legal team to appeal the perjury conviction to Israel's High court of Justice. Following the verdict, several prominent leaders and officials publicly defended Hanegbi. Former Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg who opposes Hanegbi politically, has called for the firing of the prosecutor by the Attorney General.|$|R
