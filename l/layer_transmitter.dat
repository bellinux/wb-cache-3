Each flit contains an 8-bit CRC generated by the link <b>layer</b> <b>transmitter</b> and a 72-bit payload. If the link layer receiver detects a CRC error, the receiver notifies the transmitter via a flit on the return link of the pair and the transmitter resends the flit. The link layer implements flow control using a credit/debit scheme to prevent the receiver's buffer from overflowing. The link layer supports six different classes of message to permit the higher layers to distinguish data flits from non-data messages primarily for maintenance of cache coherence. In complex implementations of the QuickPath architecture, the link layer can be configured to maintain separate flows and flow control for the different classes. It is not clear if this is needed or implemented for single-processor and dual-processor implementations.|$|E

A relay using such an independent scheduling strategy is undetectable by an eavesdropper and is referred to as a covert relay.

A randomized selection strategy to choose covert relays {{as a function of the}} routes is designed for this purpose. Using the analytical results for a single covert relay, the strategy is optimized to obtain the maximum achievable throughput as a function of the desired level of anonymity. In particular, the throughput–anonymity relation for the proposed strategy is shown to be equivalent to an information-theoretic rate–distortion function.

40|$|The {{wireless}} communication technologies {{has been found}} in all aspects of our social and economic life. However, the research on the wireless power transmission (WPT) has not been well established relatively. A strong driving force for the WPT technologies comes from the consumer electronics and the commercialization of electric vehicles (EV) recently. WPT provides a simple, unified and safe means to recharge the battery. With an extensive integration of this technique, the built-in battery size can be minimized to reduce system volume and cost. After performing a comprehensive review of the near-field WPT technologies, three major issues including unstable magnetic coupling, inflexible system architecture and susceptible power transmission are identified as the obstacles in extending the WPT technique into the dynamic application. To provide a stable magnetic coupling for power transmission, the optimal design of the magnetic coupler is studied. The power transfer efficiency and power transfer capability are first modelled by combination of circuit theory and finite element analysis (FEA) to provide a basic for subsequent design. A comparative study is then conducted to evaluate most of the design considerations for magnetic couplers. An optimal design method is finally introduced. A 30 × 30 cm single <b>layer</b> compound winding <b>transmitter</b> is proposed for charging the portable devices. The uniform magnetic coupling is targeted such that the power transmission is less sensitive to the relative position of the receiver. The system with multiple modular transmitter and receiver are proposed to provide a more flexible system structure. The interaction of the magnetic field between adjacent modular is first studied. The flux cancellation phenomenon is identified and found relative to the direction of the exciting currents. A comprehensive comparison of the system configuration is then conducted. The magnetic coupling and the power transfer capability are evaluated for two system topologies and six different configurations by FEA. Two most promising configurations are selected with either the most stable magnetic coupling or the most significant power transfer capability. To avoid the power transfer sensitivity to the magnetic coupling and load variations, a new prototype and corresponding control method are proposed. The load-independent operation modes for different compensation topologies are derived by circuit analysis. Then, one of the aforementioned modular transmitter topology is selected for stable magnetic coupling, such that the load-independent characteristics extends into the dynamic situations. As a result, the load-independent and free-positioning features are satisfied simultaneously. An experimental prototype has been built tentatively for the wireless LED lighting system. A constant output voltage is guaranteed on the receiver side when the receiver moves along the transmitter array or when the load changes. Additionally, due to the decoupled control between the primary side and the secondary side the requirement on communication is eliminated. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|ICASSP 2012 Tutorial number T- 3 (Half Day) The {{widely used}} OSI layered model {{partitions}} networking tasks into distinct protocol <b>layers.</b> At the <b>transmitter,</b> each <b>layer</b> adds some specific information (receiver address, type of signal, [...] .) to the transmitted packets. This facilitates network design, since a layer has {{not to be}} aware of the information introduced by other layers, allowing heterogeneous contents to be delivered via the same communication network. Moreover, upon reception, each layer extracts the required information at that level, while assuming that the lower layers behave perfectly. It then provides to the upper layers the required information. Therefore, error-detecting codes (CRC or checksums) protecting mainly headers (and sometimes the payload) are widely used at various places of the protocol stacks. They are combined with retransmission mechanisms (when feasible) for data packets deemed as corrupted. Moreover, since the layers work independently, but sometimes require the knowledge of identical (or correlated) information, some redundancy exists in the data extracted at each layer. This redundancy has been recognized and used for example in Robust Header Compression (RoHC) protocols for reducing the header lengths. Nevertheless, the existence of this redundancy can also be used (in a non exclusive manner) for other tasks, as outlined below The role of Joint Protocol and Channel Decoding (JPCD) is to make an efficient (and joint) use of the redundancy present in all protocol layers (including that introduced at Physical layer, e. g., by channel coding) in order to obtain optimal performance at a global level. A partial effort in this direction was already done under the framework of cross layer techniques, but JPCD intends to make full use of all properties of the signal that is transmitted. With this strategy, more reliable header recovery can be performed and aggregated packets can be more efficiently delineated. More recently, it has also been shown that channel decoding may benefit from the redundancy present in the protocol stack (protocol-assisted channel decoding). As a result, one can obtain at each layer packets that are more usable, i. e., contain fewer errors. Thus, JPCD allows one to obtain the best performance out of the received sequences without changing the structure of the transmitted signal. Clearly, since JPCD is performed within the receiver, the ability to use JPCD tools in the context of existing standards makes it potentially very practical. This tutorial explains in some details the required signal processing tools and their application to network layers, and provides examples of protocols for which this process has been implemented at all layers. This tutorial first presents some tools that are described in the book Joint Source-Channel Decoding. A Cross-Layer Perspective with Applications in Video Broadcasting over Mobile and Wireless Networks published in 2009 by Academic Press, and extends them in a comprehensive manner, providing missing ones, and giving many application examples. End-to-end simulations of applications concerning the reliable transmission of multimedia (video and html files) contents are finally provided. This set of simulations demonstrate that a truly permeable protocol stack can be implemented at decoder side, allowing the whole set of results already obtained under the name of Joint Source-Channel Decoding techniques to be practically used. Finally, this opens the floor for a true optimization of the redundancy allocation at the various layers of the protocol stack in order to obtain the best performance...|$|R
