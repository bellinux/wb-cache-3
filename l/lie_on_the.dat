5|$|Mantas {{evolved from}} bottom-dwelling stingrays, {{eventually}} developing more wing-like pectoral fins. M. birostris {{still has a}} vestigial remnant of a sting barb {{in the form of}} a caudal spine. The mouths of most rays <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> underside of the head, while in mantas they are right at the front. Manta rays and devil rays are the only ray species that have evolved into filter feeders.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake's history {{dates back}} to the 4th century BC. Numismatics, in the form of punched Greek and Kushan coins date the lake back to this time. The {{inscriptions}} found at Sanchi attest to the lake's existence to the 2nd Century BC. This suggests that Pushkar was a pilgrimage centre even if it did not <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trade route.|$|E

Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1995, the Pyxis {{globular}} cluster is a 13.3 ± 1.3 billion year-old {{globular cluster}} situated around 130,000 light-years distant from Earth and around 133,000 light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way—a region not previously thought to contain globular clusters. Located in the galactic halo, it was noted to <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same plane as the Large Magellanic Cloud and the possibility has been raised that it might be an escaped object from that galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae A is not {{a typical}} LBV. It is more {{luminous}} than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> S Doradus instability strip, although {{it is unclear what}} the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star actually is, and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and {{it has been estimated that}} the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.|$|E

5|$|Flatfish are {{demersal}} fish (bottom-feeding fish) that show {{a greater degree}} of asymmetry than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|Many species forage {{for food}} in the canopy of trees, taking {{advantage}} of serotiny (the storage of a large supply of seed in cones or gumnuts by plant genera such as Eucalyptus, Banksia and Hakea), a natural feature of the Australian landscape in dryer regions. These woody fruiting bodies are inaccessible to many species and harvested in the main by parrots, cockatoos and rodents in more tropical regions. The larger cones can be opened by the large bills of cockatoos but are too strong for smaller animals. Many nuts and fruits <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> end of small branches which are unable to support {{the weight of the}} foraging cockatoo, which instead bends the branch towards itself and holds it with its foot.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south of the house in 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle {{to the rest of the}} house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E

5|$|The {{completion}} of the central basin placed a waterway between Parliament House and the War Memorial and a landscaped boulevard was built along the land axis. Later, various buildings of national importance were built along the land axis in the late-1960s through to the early 1980s. The National Library was opened {{on the western side}} of the axis in April 1968. Building of the High Court and National Gallery occurred in the late-1970s and the buildings were opened in May 1980 and October 1982 respectively. The latter two buildings <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the axis and are connected by an aerial bridge. In 1988, the new Parliament House was built on Capital Hill, thereby completing the most important structure in the Parliamentary Triangle.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{appears to}} <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest {{ground in the}} area, {{although}} this is actually located to the south, within in the deer park. Visitors would have been funnelled {{around the edge of}} the park and by the town wall towards the south gate of the castle, a route dominated by the views of the keep and tower. The addition of the high tower had made the castle visible to anyone entering from Devon, framing it strikingly against the hills. The keep, park and town walls probably symbolised Richard's authority as earl, and the historian Andrew Saunders has argued that the keep and high tower were also intended to resemble Richard of Cornwall's crown in his role as the King of the Romans.|$|E

The school is the launch point for the annual Pleasanton Hometown Holidays Celebration Parade and the annual Fall Festival Parade, {{a part of the}} Alameda County Fair since the 1940s. The Fall Festival Parade, which features bands, floats, balloons, horses, and antique cars, starts on the Amador Valley parking lot, travels down Main Street, and ends near the fairgrounds.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{stations}} in the town, Bournemouth railway station and Pokesdown railway station to the east. Parts of western Bournemouth can also be reached from Branksome station. All three stations <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> South Western Main Line from Weymouth to London Waterloo. South Western Railway operates a comprehensive service along this line, which also serves Southampton, Winchester and Basingstoke to the east, and Poole, Wareham, and Dorchester South to the west. Before its closure in 1966, Bournemouth was also served by the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway which provided direct access to Somerset and the Midlands.|$|E
5|$|A {{qualitative}} {{justification for}} this extrapolation of his method {{has been suggested}} by Valluri, Wilson and Harper. According to their argument, Newton considered the apsidal precession angle α (the angle between the vectors of successive minimum and maximum distance from the center) to be a smooth, continuous function of the orbital eccentricity ε. For the inverse-square force, α equals 180°; the vectors to the positions of minimum and maximum distances <b>lie</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same line. If α is initially not 180° at low ε (quasi-circular orbits) then, in general, α will equal 180° only for isolated values of ε; a randomly chosen value of ε would be very unlikely to give α = 180°. Therefore, the observed slow rotation of the apsides of planetary orbits suggest that {{the force of gravity}} is an inverse-square law.|$|E
