The temperature effects on the phase velocity have been considered for four AlN/SiC-based electroacoustic coupling configurations, specifically addressing the design of temperature-compensated, enhanced-coupling, GHz-range electroacoustic devices. The gravimetric sensitivity and resolution of the four temperature-stable SiC/AlN composite structures are theoretically investigated with respect to both the AlN and SiC sensing surface.

40|$|Prenatal {{growth is}} {{sensitive}} to the direct and indirect effects of maternal dietary intake; manipulation can lead to behavioural and physiological changes of the offspring later in life. Here, we report on three aspects of how a high-salt diet during pregnancy (conception to parturition) may affect the offspring’s response to high oral salt loads: (i) dietary preferences for salt; (ii) response to salt and water balance and aldosterone and arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations after an oral salt challenge; (iii) concentrations of insulin and leptin after an oral salt challenge. We used two groups of lambs born to ewes fed either a high-salt (13 % NaCl) diet during pregnancy (S lambs; n = 12) or control animals born to ewes fed a conventional (0. 5 % NaCl) diet during pregnancy (C lambs; n = 12). Lambs were subjected to short- (5 min) and long-term (24 h) preference tests for a high-salt (13 % NaCl) or control diet, and the response to an oral challenge with either water or 25 % NaCl solution were also carried out. Weaned lambs born to ewes fed high salt during pregnancy {{did not differ in}} their preference for dietary salt, but they did differ in their physiological responses to an oral salt challenge. Results indicate that these differences reflect an alteration in the regulation of water and salt balance as the metabolic hormones, insulin and leptin, were not affected. During the first 2 h after a single salt dose, <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> had a 25 % lower water intake compared to the C <b>lambs.</b> <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> had, on average, a 13 % lower AVP concentration than the C lambs (P = 0. 014). The plasma concentration of aldosterone was higher in the <b>S</b> <b>lambs</b> than in the C lambs (P = 0. 013). Results suggest that lambs born to ewes that ingest high amounts of salt during pregnancy are programmed to have an altered thirst threshold, and blunted response in aldosterone to oral salt loads.

We {{present a}} {{detailed}} description of several experiments which have been previously reported in several letters: the determination of the 1 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift in hydrogen by a comparison of the frequencies of the 1 S{ 3 S and 2 S{ 6 S or 2 S{ 6 D two-photon transitions, and the measurement of the 2 S{ 8 S/D and 2 S{ 12 D optical frequencies. Following a complete study of the lineshape of the two-photon transitions, we provide the updated values of these frequencies which have been used in the 1998 adjustment of the fundamental constants. From an analysis taking into account these results and several other precise measurements by other authors, we show that the optical frequency measurements have superseded the microwave determination of the 2 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shift and we deduce optimized values for the Rydberg constant, R 1 = 109 737. 315 685 50 (84) cm− 1 (relative uncertainty of 7 : 7 10 − 12) and for the 1 S and 2 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shifts L(1 <b>S)</b> = 8 172. 840 (22) MHz and L(2 S{ 2 P) = 1 057. 8450 (29) MHz (respectively, 8 183. 970 (22) MHz and 1 059. 2341 (29) MHz for deuterium).

We find the 1 S- 2 S interval to be 2 466 061 414. 1 (8) MHz in hydrogen and 2 466 732 408. 5 (7) MHz in deuterium. By combining these results with recent measurements of the Rydberg constant we obtain the values 8172. 6 (7) and 8183. 7 (6) MHz for the 1 <b>S</b> <b>Lamb</b> shifts in hydrogen and deuterium, respectively.
