50|$|The extenders are {{constructed}} with metal bayonets, and engineered plastic ends. There are no moving parts, {{other than the}} lens <b>latch</b> <b>lock.</b> Three generations of the extenders exist: the older 1.4× and 2×, the 1.4× II and 2× II, and the 1.4× III and 2.0× III. The II versions have weather-sealing and anti-reflective surfaces inside the extender body. The optical construction of the 1.4× versions are of a five-element design. Both 2× versions use seven elements, although the optical formula of the II version is different to improve optical performance. The III versions of the extenders have improved autofocus performance as well increased image quality over the II, and their front and rear elements are coated with fluorine anti-smear coating to be easier to clean.|$|E
40|$|A new {{scheme for}} {{physically}} accessing tuples by multiple transactions is described for database systems using a shared memory buffer cache. Using this scheme, a transaction must first obtain logical permission to access a tuple, for example, {{by taking a}} lock on the tuple. Once logical permission has been granted, a page level latch is taken for the initial physical access to the tuple. However, {{by the introduction of}} a new primitive, hold, into the latching system which ensures that the tuple is not moved, a latch on the page is not required to subsequently read the tuple. This brings the physical level of concurrency closer to the logical level of concurrency. Our scheme is compared with other schemes which can be used for access control.

50|$|The NTSB {{learned that}} in Flight 811's case, the {{aircraft}} had experienced intermittent malfunctions of its forward cargo door in the {{months prior to the}} accident. Based on this, the NTSB concluded in its April 1990 report that these malfunctions had damaged the door locking mechanism in a manner which caused the door to show a <b>latched</b> and <b>locked</b> indication, without being fully <b>latched</b> and <b>locked.</b> Thus, the NTSB attributed the accident to human error by the ground crew. Based on this hypothesis of in-service damage, the NTSB also faulted the airline for improper maintenance and inspection due to its failure to identify the damaged locking mechanism. Focusing on damage to the door and maintenance procedures, the NTSB concluded that the accident was preventable human error, and not a problem inherent in the design or function of the aircraft's cargo door.|$|R

5000|$|There are no {{reasonable}} {{means by}} which the door <b>locking</b> and <b>latching</b> mechanisms could open mechanically in flight from a properly closed and locked position. If the lock sectors were in proper condition, and were properly situated over the closed <b>latch</b> cams, the <b>lock</b> sectors had sufficient strength to prevent the cams from vibrating to the open position during ground operation and flight. However, there are two possible {{means by which}} the cargo door could open while in flight. Either, the latching mechanisms were forced open electrically through the lock sectors after the door was secured, or the door was not properly <b>latched</b> and <b>locked</b> before departure. Then the door opened when the pressurization loads reached a point that the latches could not hold.|$|R
