The crystals, grown from seeded solutions by the temperature lowering method under conditions of low supersaturation, presented the well-developed forms: { 111 } dominant, { 100 } and { 110 }. Growth dislocations formed predominately during refacetting of the edges and corners of the seed, rounded during preparation and insertion into the supersaturated solution. From here they become refracted into the { 111 } sectors which proved to be the most defective. Smaller numbers of dislocations form at the { 111 }, { 100 } and { 110 } seed interfaces and propagate in these sectors. In crystals of inferior quality, a number of inclusions were found predominantly in the fast growing { 100 } sectors which become the source of additional dislocations. Dislocations present in the original seed did not propagate across the interface into the developing crystal. Dislocations of all characters were observed.

40|$|Abstract. As {{there are}} many voice systems, which can stand for user {{interface}} for visually impaired people, {{there is still a}} problem with explaining more complicated structures such as trees, etc. through speech. The output of such an interface is then crippled into a text reader. The problem is, that we have lost the (graphical) information about the structure. This paper will describe a solution to this problem, based on using more than one voice color to represent the described structure and position within it. 1. READING STRUCTURED INFORMATION Typical examples, in which the reading can be problematic, are mathematical and logical expressions. As the complexity of the expression increases, its vocal form becomes quite hard to understand. This is not a problem of the speech synthesis, it’s simply the fact that an utterance like „x times <b>left</b> <b>bracket</b> b plus <b>left</b> <b>bracket</b> c minus sinus <b>left</b> <b>bracket</b> d times <b>left</b> <b>bracket</b> … „ is quite complicated and hard to follow. From this example we can generalize the classes of information, which are hard to say: These are informations, which tend to have a clear structure, such as programming languages, expressions, or more clearly any information, which is hierarchically ordered.

40|$|There is {{a notion}} of non-commutative Lie algebra called "Leibniz algebra", which is {{characterized}} by the condition: <b>left</b> <b>bracketing</b> is a derivation. The {{purpose of this article is}} to introduce and study a new notion of algebra, called "associative dialgebra", which is, to the Leibniz algebras, what associative algebras are to Lie algebras. An associative dialgebra is a vector space equipped with two associative operations satisfying three more conditions. For instance, any differential associative algebra gives rise to a dialgebra. In this article we construct and study a (co) homology theory for associative dialgebras. The surprizing fact, in the construction of the chain complex, is the appearance of the combinatorics of planar binary trees (grafting and nesting). The principal result about this homology theory is its vanishing on free associative dialgebras. The Koszul dual (in the sense of Ginzburg and Kapranov) of the operad of associative dialgebras is the operad of "dendriform algebras". The dendriform algebras are characterized by two operations satisfying three linear conditions. The sum of these two operations defines a new operation which is associative. The free dendriform algebra can be described in terms of planar binary trees. As a consequence we give an explicitly description of strong homotopy associative dialgebras. This paper is part of a long-standing project whose ultimate aim is to study periodicity phenomenons in algebraic K-theory, as explained in ``Overview on Leibniz algebras, dialgebras and their homology".
