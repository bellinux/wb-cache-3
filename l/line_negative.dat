The algorithm is based on changing the position of the distance relay characteristic in such a way that the reactance effect is effectively compensated for. For this purpose the shift vector is determined in on-line relatively simple calculations. The delivered adaptive algorithm has been tested using current and voltage signals obtained from simulation of varies faults using the ATP-EMTP software program.

Industrial design (ID) is a fairly young and largely unknown profession in Turkey. Although significant developments have taken place in the field of ID in the past 15 years, the scope of scholarly attempts to analyze the sociological meaning of designing in the Turkish context is extremely limited. We use boundary work and professional ideology as salient concepts for a sociological understanding the ongoing professionalization process of Turkish industrial designers, who are developing professional identities and striving for recognition in the larger culture. This paper relies on 20 semi-structured interviews conducted with key players (i. e., ideologues) of the Turkish ID scene to analyze these boundary-work processes. We found that the positive collective identity of Turkish industrial designers is built on a formulation of negative others. These negative others are ideological antagonists that are pushed to the “other” side of the demarcation <b>line.</b> <b>Negative</b> others are especially dominant in the professional ideology of Turkish industrial designers because the perceived threats from these antagonists shape the collective consciousness. However, the construction of these others is an ambivalent process in which they also become ideological “friends. ” We also demonstrate that professional ideology plays a pivotal role in producing, reproducing, and legitimizing claims of professionalism...|$|E
40|$|Suntory Holdings Ltd has {{submitted}} {{an application}} for marketing (C/NL/ 09 / 02) of a genetically modified carnation line 26407 (Unique identifier: IFD- 26407 - 2). In this context, the European Union Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed (EU-RL GMFF) was asked {{to carry out a}} singlelaboratory validation of the performance of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based method for detecting and identifying the carnation GM line 26407, developed by the applicant. This report describes the results of this validation, carried out by the EU-RL GMFF with control samples provided by the applicant. The method is a duplex end-point PCR, where a carnation (taxon) target and a transgenic sequence are detected simultaneously. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method has been established to be at least 10 copies for the taxon-specific target and between 50 and 10 copies for the GM target, based on haploid genome copy number. The event-specificity of the method was assessed by the applicant as being sufficient. The EU-RL could verify that the taxon-specific primers correctly detect the endogenous gene target in genomic DNA of a conventional carnation <b>line</b> (<b>negative</b> control) and in the genomic DNA of the GM carnation line, while the GM target is detected by the GM specific primers only in genomic DNA of 26407 GM line (positive control).

This study aims at understanding the main factors controlling spatial patterns of piping in loess-derived soils under a temperate climate. To map the spatial distribution of piping and identify the environmental controls on its distribution, a regional survey was carried out in a 236 km 2 study area in the Flemish Ardennes (Belgium). Orthophotos taken at optimal field conditions (winter) were analyzed to detect piping in open landscapes and ground thruthing was systematically done through field surveys. In total, 137 parcels having 560 collapsed pipes were mapped. Dimensions of the sinkholes and local slope gradient were measured in the field and topographical variables were derived from LiDAR data. Land use plays an important role as 97 % of the sites with piping are found under pasture. The probability of piping increases rapidly on hillslopes with gradients exceeding 8 % and with a concave profile and plan curvature, enhancing subsurface flow concentration. The zones with soil profiles on shallow loess over a relatively thin layer of homogeneous blue massive clays (Aalbeke Member) are most prone to piping. Soil characteristics are of less importance to explain piping occurrence. Furthermore, the topographical threshold line indicating the critical slope gradient for a given contributing drainage area was determined. This threshold <b>line</b> (<b>negative</b> power relation) is similar to the threshold line for shallow gully initiation. JRC. H. 7 -Climate Risk Managemen...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether there is a difference in toxicity and loss of viability of three-dimensional (3 D) reconstructed human oral epithelium (RHOE) cell cultures induced by point-welded (PW), laser-welded (LW), and silver-soldered (SiS) orthodontic wires. Three types of soldered stainless steel (SS) wires: PW, LW, and SiS were prepared (n = 3) and subjected to multiple end-point analysis (MEA). Six pieces were cut from each wire. Each piece was placed on the triplicate cell cultures (RHOE model based on TR 146 cells). After 24 hours of topical exposure, the cell cultures were cut and stained with haematoxylin/eosin. Toxicity was assessed by evaluating the morphological changes and classifying these as mild, moderate, or severe. The in vitro cell cultures were subjected to a 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) 2, 5 - diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in order to quantify viability. Copper wires served as the control to determine severe toxicity and native cell cultures were used as a baseline. Untreated SS wire (0. 9 mm) was included for comparison with the welded wires. Histological evaluation with respect to toxicity and measurement of viability in the 3 D cell cultures showed no severe toxicity or loss of viability for any of the wires. The morphological ranking of the tested wires from mild to severe toxicity was: SS = PW = LW < SiS. MTT tests revealed the following mean viability values: native cell <b>line</b> (<b>negative</b> control) 98. 1 per cent, SS 96. 8 per cent, PW 95. 5 per cent, LW 95. 5 per cent, SiS 85. 7 per cent, and copper wires (positive control) 51. 2 per cent. Relative comparison between the different welding techniques tested on RHOE revealed, however, that LW and PW wires induced less toxicity/loss of viability compared with SiS wires. © The Author 2007.

All chicks tested {{in this experiment}} originated from parents divided into 3 groups. Each group included 864 hens from three genotypes (288 hens for each genotype) and 108 cocks from the genotype used in sire position (1 male: 8 females). Approximately 3600 unsexed day old chicks (400 chicks per combination) were used. At 28 days of age, chicks were sexed and result about 180 females per combination. Females (45 per pen) were weighed and assigned to their cross in 36 pens (4 pens per combination). At 126 days of age, 25 pullets per pen were housed {{until the end of}} experiment. The NH purebred had higher BW compared with WL or BR at all ages. BR x NH cross had heaviest BW at ages 28, 56, 84 and 112 days but not at sexual maturity which exhibited reduction in BW. The ASM in BR purebred was earlier (141. 25 days) than WL (153. 25 days) and NH (154 days) purebreds. The WL x NH cross and NH x WL reciprocal cross exhibited higher egg number than purebred or other crosses. The WL purebred achieved the highest Egg Weight (EW) than other purebred. The line heterosis is significant only at day old BW in WL breed (positive) and BR <b>line</b> (<b>negative),</b> whereas, the others ages was not showed any line heterosis. Average heterosis of BW was positive at all ages, except at day old which was negative and ranged from - 2. 03 at day old to 39. 58 at sexual maturity. The line heterosis of age at sexual maturity and egg weight was non significant, while, the line heterosis of egg production was significantly positive in NH line and was negative in BR line. All combinations (crosses or reciprocal) showed a positive heterosis in egg production ranged from 2. 77 to 8. 75 % with average heterosis is significant (3. 20). All combinations (crosses or reciprocal) showed a negative heterosis in egg weight from - 0. 15 to - 3. 66 with significant average heterosis (- 1. 21). Reciprocal effects were significant for BW and ASM and not in egg production or in egg weight. The GCA of BW was significantly greater and positive for NH breeds at all ages than WL and BR lines were exhibited significantly negative GCA. GCA for ASM, egg production and egg weight of WL breeds gave the highest (positive) significant values compared with the BR line which was exhibited lowest (negative) values of these traits. Maternal effects of BW and ASM were significant for WL and BR dams. There were non significant in egg production and egg weight due to maternal effect. The direct genetic effect on BW were negatively significant for WL and BR and positively significant for NH. Direct genetic effects on ASM and egg production were non significant and significant on egg weight. Estimations of SCA of BW, ASM, egg production and egg weight varied from positive to negative depended on cross type.

40|$|I {{have always}} been drawn to {{investigating}} the nature of ambiguous objects; objects whose role is unclear; objects that fall between distinct categories, and that exist in {{what appears to be}} transitional stages. The pieces I make provoke the imagination by building in experimental self-defined systems that refer to contemporary architecture, as well as comment on the ceramic and non-ceramic process. My pieces vary in form and intention just as the skyline carries changes in form and order. I want to make experimental objects that develop in front of me from the ground up, without a pre-planned result. Using fundamental elements and principles of design I use color, <b>line,</b> <b>negative</b> space, balance and composition {{to create a sense of}} tension, playful construction, and mysterious purpose in my work. The various apartments I’ve rented in Lincoln, Nebraska have all been ones with views of towers, cranes, and structures going up and coming down in all directions. The connection, or rather disconnect between interior and exterior when a building is structural and in progress is what interests me specifically. At this stage I am free to wonder what may become of this thing. What is it for? What is it going to become? These questions are answered only when the exterior is started and only if I am still able to watch the construction on a routine basis. Because of this relationship between interior and exterior I aim to construct work where facade and structure are indistinguishable. It is through this playful, unplanned process that a narration starts, showing the viewer each decision I’ve made throughout a piece down to the direction of each and every cut. However, I believe a piece is most successful when it asks the viewer to finish this story visually. The most intriguing objects both suggest and obscure their function simultaneously. I am asking questions about the conventions of ceramics through the use of shapes, surfaces, formats, and processes that come from outside of those conventions. To create, modify and manipulate material is as inherent as eating and breathing. Forever, man has modified conventions through the development and discovery of new processes and techniques. I have followed suit by using a combination of old and new building techniques in my own work. The orderly coils that create my work reflect both rigor and expression as I seek to describe my relationship with these constructions and the freedom I find within the design of an object. My work is, in part, defined by a combination of traditional and industrial ceramic applications as well as non-ceramic processes. Pieces speak to Ceramic tradition through the use of clay, glaze, and hand building techniques that refer to utility while I expand upon these traditions with additions of my own creations such as unique three-dimensionally printed dies that I combine with industrial processes such as the extruder or slip casting. Most builders and artists embrace new technologies. One of those technologies is the three dimensional printer which I use to produce the dies I extrude with as well as produce the prototypes from which I slip cast. This way of working allows me to modify and manipulate both material and technique. Color, scale, and presentation are carefully considered. I employ large areas of one color to contrast with another. These contrasting tonalities define both the elements and the structure of the sculptures. In industry, the colors of building materials are branding techniques for companies; I incorporate the same ideas looking for surfaces that are “mine” while reflecting those ideas. Unusually bright glazes or paints work adjacently to similar colors that are more dry and dull, which gives a viewer a sense of history to consider. All of the surfaces are integrated with their forms as if there is no relation between surface and form, but rather just one. The way in which I compose is directly related to the ideas found in avant-garde design. Relating ideas include building in original ways that transform the space the object rests in as well as making the viewer aware of the space they are inhabiting. Contemporary architectural feats, as evidenced in the Olympic building in China for example, drive me to build compositions with ideas relating to monumentality, remembrance, and landmark. Architects Jacques Herzog, Pierre de Meuron (Herzog 2 ̆ 6 de Meuron), Stefan Marbach, Li Xinggang and artist Ai Weiwei worked jointly on the stadium. They created something that is purely form and structure. The inside is the outside and the materials needed for the construction were used in ways never seen before. Like this landmark, I create compositions that stem from an obsession to construct in unique and precarious ways that I don’t often see. When translated to art objects, they become unconventional compositions for myself as well as viewers to investigate. I’ve become fixated on these quirky and idiosyncratic building processes, as well as the playful, unplanned assembly of each piece that gives my work a sense of remnant. These fixations relate inherently to the freedom I see in contemporary design and architecture that exists all around me. It is my intention that as I build imaginatively each piece is connected with these ideas I carry. Advisor: Peter Pinnell 12 photographs are attached (below) as supplemental files...|$|E
