40|$|The fencing of land {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the input cost for farmers in South Africa and approximately 240, 000 tons of wire is purchased annually. It is therefore {{in the interest of}} the consumer to ensure they obtain the most durable wire for the application they intend. The effect of environmental conditions on the longevity of wire is a factor that should be borne in mind. In order to advise especially the farming community on the suitability of wire fencing in different climatological areas, the Agricultural Engineering Institute of South Africa (AEI) initiated a long-term atmospheric exposure programme during December 1990. The project objective was to determine the environmental corrosion effect on five different wire types that were available at the time, at six different localities in South Africa. The wire types used comprised steel <b>wire</b> that was <b>light</b> <b>galvanized,</b> heavy galvanized, 95 %/ 5 % zinc/aluminium coated and aluminium coated. A locally produced rust resistant steel wire, with nominally 11 % chromium was also included. This report compares the performance of wires after an eleven-year period.
