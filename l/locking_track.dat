5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route setting frame was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no conflicting move had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, route <b>locking</b> <b>track</b> circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the plain line. The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|E

In the military this interest translates to low-probability-intercept (LPI) and anti-jam (AJ) communications systems. The receiver improves the signal -to-noise ratio so data can be reliably recovered. This improvement is usually accomplished by matched -filtering or by correlation. In this report correlation is used as a post-detection processing technique to derive a synchronous reference. The system considered in this experiment can operate noncoherently by means of a delay <b>lock</b> <b>tracking</b> loop at signal-tonoise ratios as small as - 5. 0 to - 7. 1 dB.

The client part is a hybrid system consisting of an untrusted software component and a trusted hardware component. This offers maximum flexibility, while keeping the hardware requirements low. I. INTRODUCTION Portable high-tech devices tend to be valuable, therefore attractive candidates for theft. A variety of theft-protection methods already exist, see Fig. 1.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the on-orbit performance to {{date of the}} three Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS's) in Fine Lock mode, with respect to acquisition success rate, ability to maintain lock, and star brightness range. The process of optimizing Fine Lock performance, including the reasoning underlying the adjustment of uplink parameters, {{and the effects of}} optimization are described. The Fine Lock optimization process has combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Computer models of the FGS have improved understanding of the effects of uplink parameters and fine error averaging on the ability of the FGS to acquire stars and maintain lock. Empirical data have determined the variation of the interferometric error characteristics (so-called 's-curves') between FGS's and over each FGS field of view, identified binary stars, and quantified the systematic error in Coarse Track (the mode preceding Fine Lock). On the basis of these empirical data, the values of the uplink parameters can be selected more precisely. Since launch, optimization efforts have improved FGS Fine Lock performance, particularly acquisition, which now enjoys a nearly 100 percent success rate. More recent work has been directed towards improving FGS tolerance of two conditions that exceed its original design requirements. First, large amplitude spacecraft jitter is induced by solar panel vibrations following day/night transitions. This jitter is generally much greater than the FGS's were designed to track, and while the tracking ability of the FGS's has been shown to exceed design requirements, losses of Fine Lock after day/night transitions are frequent. Computer simulations have demonstrated a potential improvement in Fine <b>Lock</b> <b>tracking</b> of vehicle jitter near terminator crossings. Second, telescope spherical aberration degrades the interferometric error signal in Fine Lock, but use of the FGS two-thirds aperture stop restores the transfer function with a corresponding loss of throughput. This loss requires the minimum brightness of acquired stars to be about one magnitude brighter than originally planned...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Integer {{ambiguity}} resolution at {{a single}} station can be preformed if the fractional-cycle biases are separated from the ambiguity estimates in precise point positioning (PPP). Despite the improved positioning accuracy by such integer resolutions, the convergence to an ambiguity-fixed solution normally requires {{at least a few}} tens of minutes. More importantly, such convergences can repeatedly occur on the occasion of losses of <b>tracking</b> <b>locks</b> for many satellites if an open sky-view is not constantly available, consequently totally destroying the practicability of real-time PPP. In this study, in case of such re-convergences, we develop a method in which ionospheric delays are precisely predicted to significantly accelerate integer ambiguity resolutions. The effectiveness of this method consists in two aspects: First, wide-lane ambiguities can be rapidly resolved using the ionosphere-corrected wide-lane measurements, instead of the noisy Melbourne-WÃ¼bbena combination measurements; second, narrow-lane ambiguity resolution can be accelerated under the tight constraints derived from the ionosphere-corrected unambiguous wide-lane measurements. In the tests at 90 static stations suffering from simulated total loss of <b>tracking</b> <b>locks,</b> 93. 3 % and 95. 0 % of re-convergences to wide-lane and narrow-lane ambiguity resolutions can be achieved within 5 s, respectively, even though the time latency for the predicted ionospheric delays is up to 180 s.

In addition to this, its low computational requirements make it attractive for low complexity receivers.

A comprehensive characterization of unambiguous BOC tracking algorithms is out of the scope of this paper. Additional material on the performance of BOC tracking techniques can be found in [4] and [11].
