50|$|Lead burning is {{not used}} as part of {{plumbing}} work for installed pipework. Lead piping has long been considered obsolete, owing to the health aspects. Even where lead piping, or lead-sheathed cable, {{still needs to be}} jointed, this is carried out with a wiped joint, rather than a burned joint. Wiping a <b>lead</b> <b>joint</b> is a soldering process, using plumber's solder (80% lead / 20% tin) and is carried out at low temperature, with a natural-draught propane blowtorch. Today, even wiped joints are rare and where an existing lead pipe must be connected to, a proprietary mechanical joint {{is more likely to be}} used.|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to report very {{comprehensive}} studies and analysis that I have carried out on different thermal aspects of a 6 T Cryogen-free Superconducting Magnet System (CFMS) which is designed and built at IUAC. One of important parameter for any superconducting magnet is to achieve the desired field homogeneity by choosing proper dimensional parameter. The role dimensional parameters for the 6 T NbTi magnet have been studied to achieve 0. 07 % field homogeneity at 10 mm diametrical spherical volume at the magnetic center. The stability of the 6 T NbTi magnet is greatly dependent by its operational margin which {{is determined by the}} current sharing temperature of the NbTi. The role of the operational load line has been discussed in determining the stability of the 6 T NbTi magnet. The current sharing temperature of the 6 T magnet has also been estimated. Two stage GM cryocooler is one of the critical components of the CFMS. The refrigeration load curves for both stages of SRDK- 415 GM cryocooler have been generated in a cryocooler based test rig. The refrigeration load curves for the 1 st stage of the cryocooler have been generated between 25 K and 65 K with 0 - 1. 5 W of load at the 2 nd stage of the cryocooler. Similarly, the refrigeration load curves for the 2 nd stage have been generated between 2. 4 K and 4. 4 K with 0 - 47. 5 W load at 1 st stage of the cryocooler. The magnetic field profile for 6 T solenoid magnet has been generated with the use of finite element magnetostatic simulation software (OPERA/TOSCA). Hybrid current lead is one of the crucial components of the CFMS. Thermal performance of inter-lead joint between hybrid lead and cold heads of the cryocooler plays a significant role in determining the stability of the NbTi magnet in the CFMS. A prototype <b>lead</b> <b>joint</b> has been characterized in the temperature range of 4 - 40 K in a test rig with different interfacial material (Aluminium nitride/ Kapton) to achieve thermally conducting and electrically isolated joint. The extensive FEM analysis has also done using ANSYS for different types of conduction-cooled leads, optimized for 102 A. Quenching is one of the important phenomenon for a superconducting magnet. The protection system for a superconducting magnet needs to be designed ingeniously. In this report, extensive FEM analysis has been done, using OPERA- 3 D/QUENCH for the 6 T NbTi magnet. The analysis has shown the hot spot temperature of the 6 T NbTi magnet would be 65 - 80 K, if quenched at 102 A. It has been compared with the experimental result. A detailed comparative studies have been done between different types of quench situation. Variable temperature inserts (VTI) is one of common feature integrated with each commercial CFMS to vary temperature on the sample space. The experimental studies have been performed on the gas gap heat switch (GGHS) integrated with CFMS. The feasibility of using GGHS as VTI has been studied up to 3 T magnetic field...|$|E

Jointing such cables could also require wiped <b>lead</b> <b>joints.</b> A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall <b>joint</b> wrapped in <b>lead</b> sheet and soldered.
