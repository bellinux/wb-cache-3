25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry {{back from the brink}} of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E
25|$|The {{son of the}} rector of Dallinghoo, Walford {{was educated}} at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a middle- or lower-order batsman, {{though it is not}} known whether he batted right- or left-handed. His two {{first-class}} matches came within a fortnight of each other in May 1860. In the first, scores of 7 and 25 for the Cambridge University team against the Cambridge Town Club were enough for the university team to want to take a second <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> he was duly picked for the MCC team to play against the university, a frequent ploy in university cricket at the time, but then failed to score in his only innings. Although he played in minor matches for the Cambridge team across the rest of the 1860 season, he was not picked for the University Match against Oxford University and played no further first-class games.|$|E

500|$|Steven Aoun of PopMatters {{applauded the}} way the episode [...] "focuses on two popular {{supporting}} characters, and foregrounds the relation between memory and identity." [...] Furthermore, the site noted that [...] "the sound that takes you by surprise may be your own crying." [...] Novelist Lev Grossman, {{in an interview with}} NPR, praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is [...] "psychologically plausible." [...] Grossman praised {{the way the}} series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: [...] "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> think this cartoon is about my father dying." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E
500|$|New Musical Express {{journalist}} Nick Kent jammed occasionally {{with the}} band, but left upon Lydon's recruitment. [...] "When I came along, I took one <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> said, 'No.That has to go,'" [...] Lydon later explained. [...] "He's never written {{a good word}} about me ever since." [...] In September, McLaren again helped hire private rehearsal space for the group, who had been practising in pubs. Cook, with a full-time job he was loath to give up, was making noises about quitting. According to Matlock's later description, Cook [...] "created a smokescreen" [...] by claiming Jones was not skilled enough to be the band's sole guitarist. An advertisement was placed in Melody Maker for a [...] "Whizz Kid Guitarist. Not older than 20. Not worse looking than Johnny Thunders" [...] (referring to a leading member of the New York punk scene). Most of the guitar players who auditioned were incompetent, but in McLaren's view, the process created {{a new sense of}} solidarity among the four band members. Steve New was considered the only talented guitarist who tried out and the band invited him to join. Jones was improving rapidly, and the band's developing sound had no room for the technical lead work at which New was adept. He departed after a month.|$|E

500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E

The Rabbis asked him whether he was not afraid of the evil eye for being so boastful. He replied that the evil eye has no power over the descendants of Joseph, citing the words of [...] "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine above the eye (alei ayin)."

2500|$|At {{nine years}} old Erik's mother begins {{to respond to the}} attentions of the handsome, new town physician, which upsets Erik. He uses his new-found {{abilities}} to hypnotize her into rejecting the physicians advances and keep her trapped in their home under his care, but his relationship with the villagers comes to a boiling point when they kill his beloved dog. Erik runs away from home believing this will make his mother's life easier. [...] After a week or so without food, he stumbles upon a Gypsy camp in the woods. He is discovered as a thief and is unmasked. [...] Upon seeing his face, a freak show showman named Javert decides to exhibit him as the [...] "Living Corpse" [...] and Erik is locked in a cage. The act involves a great deal of abuse including keeping his arms and legs tied down so that attendees can <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> the showman regularly beats him. Eventually, he gains some personal freedoms as he develops his show to include the illusions that he had begun to master as a child in Boscherville. [...] He travels around Europe with the Gypsies and masters their languages as well as their herbal remedies, remaining with the tribe until he is about 12 years old when the showman drunkenly attempts to force himself on him, at which point Erik kills him and is forced to once again flee.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was about}} to be {{released}} by WOR in 1956 for not being commercial, he did a commercial for Sweetheart Soap, not a sponsor, and was immediately fired. His listeners besieged WOR with complaints, and when Sweetheart offered to sponsor him he was reinstated. Eventually, he attracted more sponsors than he wanted—the commercials interrupted the flow of his monologues. Ex WOR engineer, Frank Cernese, adds: The commercials of that era were on [...] "ETs"—phonograph records about 14" [...] in diameter. Three large turntables were available to play them in sequence. However, Shepherd liked the engineer to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> listen when he told his stories. That left little time to load the turntables and cue the appropriate cuts. That's when he started complaining about [...] "too many commercials". His last WOR broadcast was on April 1, 1977. His subsequent radio work consisted only of short segments on several other stations, including crosstown WCBS, and occasional commentaries on NPR's All Things Considered. His final radio gig was the Sunday night radio show [...] "Shepherd's Pie" [...] on WBAI in the mid-1990s, which consisted of his reading his stories uncut, uninterrupted and unabridged. The show was one of WBAI's most popular of the period. In addition to his stories, his shows also contained, among other things, humorous anecdotes and general commentaries about the human condition, observations about life in New York, accounts of vacations in Maine and travels throughout the world. Among the most striking of his programs was his account of his participation in the March on Washington in August 1963, during which Dr. Martin Luther King gave his [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, and the program that aired on November 25, 1963—the burial day of President John F. Kennedy. However, his most scintillating programs remain his often prophetic, bitingly humorous commentaries about ordinary life in America.|$|E
