The languages in the polynomial hierarchy, PH, correspond to all of second-order logic. Thus, the question [...] "is P a proper subset of NP" [...] can be reformulated as [...] "is existential second-order logic able to describe languages (of finite linearly ordered structures with nontrivial signature) that first-order logic with <b>least</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>point</b> cannot?". The word [...] "existential" [...] can even be dropped from the previous characterization, since P = NP {{if and only if}} P = PH (as the former would establish that NP = co-NP, which in turn implies that NP = PH).|$|E

40|$|The modal mu-calculus. The modal mu-calculus {{was defined}} in 1983 by Kozen [8] and is {{obtained}} {{by adding the}} <b>least</b> and greatest <b>fixed</b> <b>point</b> operators to the basic modal logic. An overview of the modal mu-calculus {{can be found in}} the chapter by Bradfield and Stirling [4]. Canonical models and completeness results for the finitary and infinitary logics defined by Kozen were obtained by Ambler et al. [1], who introduce two types of algebraic semantics for the mu-calculus: mu-algebras of the first- and second kind. These are special types of Boolean algebras with operators. Specifically, mu-algebras of the first kind require the existence of all meets needed to calculate <b>least</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>points</b> of term functions. Mu-algebras of the second kind additionally require the existence of all joins needed to calculate <b>least</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>points</b> of term functions as ordinal unfoldings. Preservation under canonical extensions of mu-algebras. We investigate the canonicity of inequalities of the intuitionistic mu-calculus.
