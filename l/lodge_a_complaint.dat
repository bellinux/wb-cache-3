25|$|In October 1996, {{faced with}} {{constant}} delays and other irregularities {{in the domestic}} proceedings, the survivors instructed their legal representatives in both national and supranational proceedings, the Centro para Acción Legal en Derechos Humanos (CALDH), to <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The IACHR is the agency of the Organisation of American States charged with overseeing the American Convention on Human Rights, a continental human rights instrument that Guatemala ratified in 1978, and responsible for ensuring justice for victims {{of human rights abuses}} when domestic legal systems fail.|$|E
25|$|After the massacre, {{the village}} was {{practically}} abandoned {{for a number of}} years and the survivors were told that reprisals would follow if they spoke about the incident or revealed the location of the numerous mass graves they had helped to dig. With the gradual return to democracy that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, some of the survivors felt they could begin to talk about the killings without fearing for their lives. Accusations were filed with the authorities in 1992 and, in 1993, a criminal investigation was launched. However, faced with delays and other irregularities in the proceedings, and stonewalled by a National Reconciliation Law that granted amnesties to the suspected perpetrators, the survivors saw that Guatemala's domestic legal remedies were ineffective in this case and consequently decided to <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), the supranational human rights arm of the Organisation of American States, in 1996.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relations}} between the cadres and secretarial personnel have been marked by territorial grievance and rivalry, becoming at times heated enough to spill into the public sphere. A common grievance among IFS (A) officers is the practice of antedating the appointment of IFS (B) officers 8 years before the date of their actual promotion. This puts the IFS (B) officers, who are seen as less prestigious, ahead for promotions of IFS (A) officers who directly entered the service before them. In 2013, 6 IFS (A) officers {{went as far as}} to <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint,</b> against their foreign secretary as well as eight IFS (B) officers named as respondents, with the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for clogging the promotion pipeline and leading to [...] "demotivation and demoralisation among direct recruit officers".|$|E

2500|$|Igbo {{people were}} spread on {{plantations}} on the island's northwestern side, specifically the areas around Montego Bay and St. Ann's Bay, andconsequently, their influence was concentrated there. The region also witnessed {{a number of}} revolts that were attributed to people of Igbo origin. Slave owner Matthew Lewis spent time in Jamaica between 1815 and 1817 and studied the way his slaves organised themselves by ethnicity and he noted, for example, {{that at one time}} when he [...] "went down to the negro-houses to hear the whole body of Eboes <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> against one of the book-keepers". Olaudah Equiano, a prominent member of the movement for the abolition of the slave trade, was an African-born Igbo ex-slave. On one of his journeys to the Americas as a free man, as documented in his 1789 journal, Equiano was hired by a Dr. Charles Irving to recruit slaves for his 1776 Mosquito Shore scheme in Jamaica, for which Equiano hired Igbo slaves, whom he called [...] "My own countrymen". Equiano was especially useful to Irving for his knowledge of the Igbo language, using Equiano as a tool to maintain social order among his Igbo slaves in Jamaica.|$|E
2500|$|Raphael Patai {{reports that}} in central Arabia no {{relaxation}} of a man's {{right to the}} father's brother's daughter (FBD, or paternal female cousin) {{seems to have taken}} place in the past hundred years before his 1962 work. Here the girl is not forced to marry her paternal male cousin but she cannot marry another unless he gives consent. Among the Jews of Yemen this rule is also followed albeit not as rigidly. In northern Arabia the custom is very strong and any outsider wishing to marry a woman must first come to the paternal male cousin, ask his permission, and pay him what he wants, and a man who marries off his daughter without the consent of the paternal male cousin may be killed by family members. The right of the paternal male cousin is such that a shaykh {{may not be able to}} prevail against it. Among the Bedouin it can happen that a paternal male cousin can <b>lodge</b> <b>a</b> <b>complaint</b> after the marriage has taken place, compelling the father to reimburse the bride price or have the marriage annulled. If the paternal male cousin cannot marry his paternal female cousin immediately due to financial or other considerations, the paternal male cousin can also [...] "reserve" [...] her by making a public and formal statement of his intentions to marry her at a future date. A more distant relative acquires priority to marry a girl over her paternal male cousin by reserving her soon after her birth.|$|E

At 8 P.M. in the night, the house of Gurucharan Dhar, {{in the village of}} Noagram, only six miles from Sylhet was attacked. The next day at 7 A.M. in the morning, a heavily armed Muslim mob surrounded the village. About 1,500 Hindus who inhabited the village, fled to the nearby jungle.
