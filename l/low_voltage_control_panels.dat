40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage circuits on SiC has profound applications. SiC power devices have proved their superiority {{in terms of}} high temperature operation, faster switching frequencies and larger power densities when compared with Si power devices. The control of SiC power devices however, lies {{in the hands of}} <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> circuits built on Si. Thus, there exists a separation in the overall system between the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage side, which increases system cost, weight and reduces efficiency. With the advancement in <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC processing technology, <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> circuits can be made on the same die as power devices, and power systems will become compact, robust and more efficient.

50|$|<b>Low</b> <b>Voltage</b> {{propulsion}} <b>control</b> {{was coming}} into style {{around the time}} the earliest Standards were being delivered. Therefore, {{it was no surprise}} the Standards arrived with the feature. On earlier high <b>voltage</b> propulsion <b>control</b> systems, 600 volts ran through the motorman's control stand as well as through the train via the use of jumpers between cars. This had to be the case to make the electrical contacts to allow all of the motor cars of a train to draw power in a synchronized effort from the Third rail. However, this could be dangerous for motormen and shop personnel alike by creating an electrocution hazard. Even unpowered trailer cars had to carry the 600 volts through these jumpers, because it was necessary to pass on the voltage to motor cars behind the trailer so as to synchronize them with the lead car. However, <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> propulsion <b>control</b> utilized battery <b>voltage</b> (32 volts) to control the train's motors. This battery voltage was what would pass through the motorman's control stand and between cars. Tractive effort throughout the train was synchronized by the battery voltage in this way. Meanwhile, each car would respond individually to the battery voltage, by moving its own 600 volt contacts to direct power obtained locally by each car directly from the third rail toward the motors. Using 32 volts to control the propulsion in this way was a much safer proposition than the 600 volts associated with the older high voltage setup. This also meant that Standards crossing onto a dead section of third rail would not energize it by bridging the gap between it and the previous live section. This was especially beneficial to track workers who had requested third rail power off in performing their duties. All told, <b>Low</b> <b>Voltage</b> propulsion <b>control</b> tremendously improved safety for train crews, shop crews, and track gangs.|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The {{source of the}} 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed {{as part of the}} heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation. [...] A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. [...] This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. [...] A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating. A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.|$|R
