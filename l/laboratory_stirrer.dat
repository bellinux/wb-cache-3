40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was focused into the range of factors {{influencing}} the size of silver nanoparticles usable as antimicrobials prepared by Tollens method. This method is based on reduction reaction of silver salts or silver complexes with reduction agents. Mono-, oligo-, and polysacharides are regarded as the most useful compounds for this purpose {{with regard to their}} minimal toxicity and high biocompatibility. It was concluded that various hydrodynamic conditions realized via usual stirring by <b>laboratory</b> <b>stirrer,</b> or microwaves source action, or in relatively static conditions, don't influence the condensation process in the different extent. Temperature rising to 85 řC didn't influence the size of nanoparticles also. Polymers and oligomers, as polyvinylalcohol, starches, and polydextroses has been found as the very appropriate reduction agents. The prepared samples consisted of very fine nanoparticles, the size characteristics represented by intensity and volume diameters were in the order of units of nanometers, the polydispersity indexes were of very low values...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{composites}} of high filler content, such as nacre, {{a composite}} comprised of 95 - 99 % w/w aragonite layers, {{have been of}} interest due to their hardness, strength and toughness. High filler content composites have been prepared synthetically, although due to viscosity and processing requirements, the filler content was limited compared with natural systems. In this paper we describe hybrid high filler content composites prepared to be biomimetic of nacre. Development of processing conditions increased the filler content from 50 % w/w using a <b>laboratory</b> <b>stirrer</b> to obtain hybrid composites with 77 - 86 % w/w filler content, prepared by centrifugal deposition and hot compression molding techniques. Both methods were very different from natural formation from layer-by-layer (LBL) construction, however, the composites formed were of high filler content approaching the level in nature. The composites exhibited high modulus and strength, although deformation at break was low, consistent with highly filled materials. Glass transition of the resin phase was increased slightly, while damping was decreased by filler content. Surface morphology of the fractured composite showed a layered structure of well dispersed fillers with minute voids scattered evenly, indicating that the composite was effectively compacted...|$|E

Depending on the configuration, the rotation axis of the disk device can be either perpendicular or parallel to its radius, giving rise to two different mass transfer patterns when rotating-disk sorptive extraction is applied in liquid samples. In the perpendicular case (configuration 1), which is the typical configuration, the disk contains an embedded miniature stir bar that allows the disk rotation to be driven using a common <b>laboratory</b> magnetic <b>stirrer.</b> In the parallel case (configuration 2), the disk is driven by a rotary rod connected to an electric stirrer. In this study, triclosan and its degradation product methyl triclosan were used as analyte models to demonstrate the significant effect of the rotation configuration of the disk on the efficiency of analyte mass transfer from water to a sorptive phase of polydimethylsiloxane. Under the same experimental conditions and at a rotation velocity of 1, 250 rpm, extraction equilibrium was reached at 80 min when the disk was rotated in configuration 1 and at 30 min when the disk was rotated in configuration 2. The extraction equilibration time decreased to 14 min when the rotation velocity was increased to 2, 000 rpm in configuration 2. Because the rotation pattern affects the mass transfer efficiency, each rotation configuration was characterized through the Reynolds number; Re values of 6, 875 and 16, 361 were achieved with configurations 1 and 2, respectively, at 1, 250 rpm.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the potential environmental effects of offshore discharges of synthetic based drilling fluids (SBFs) and associated drilling cuttings, it is necessary to understand the physical transport mechanisms of SBFs associated with drilling discharges in the marine environment. The purpose of this work was to study the flocculation and settling properties of SBFs associated with drilling cuttings in both freshwater and seawater and provide more appropriate equations for existing transport models. [...] A digital imaging system was employed in this research to study the flocculation and settling processes. The effects of particle shape and size on the settling mechanism and the effects of salinity, fluid shear, discharge concentration and oily components on the rate of flocculation and the settling speeds of floes were studied. [...] The cutting sample for this study was collected from an exploration oil well in the east coast of Canada. The settling velocities of coarse particles from both untreated and thermally treated cuttings were measured in a 2. 5 m high and 14 cm inner diameter Plexiglas settling column using both freshwater and seawater. The flocculation of fine grain particles was performed using a <b>laboratory</b> paddle <b>stirrer</b> in both freshwater and seawater. The applied shears ranged from 25 to 200 s⁻¹, and the concentrations ranged from 25 to 200 mg/L. In order to study the effects of oily components on flocculation, a thermally treated sample was also used. From the experimental results it was shown that the untreated cuttings tend to clump together and settle fast while the treated cuttings settle as individual particles with relatively low speeds. The settling velocities of treated and untreated coarse particles were found to be functions of both particle sphericity and diameter following a power law. It was demonstrated by the flocculation tests that the steady state median floc size decreases as the shear stress and concentration increase, and the particles flocculate faster in seawater than in freshwater. For the same diameter and salinity, the flocs formed at high fluid shears have a higher settling velocity than do flocs formed at low shears. It was also shown that the flocs formed by untreated cuttings settle faster than flocs formed by thermally treated cuttings in the same conditions (shear rate and concentration) under which the flocs were produced...|$|R
30|$|The {{crude oil}} densities were {{determined}} with specific gravity bottles; viscosities were measured using the Ferranti portable viscometer. The viscosity units in poises {{were converted to}} mm 2 /s. In the urea-n-alkane adduction procedure, the weighed crude (Mettler H 315) was poured into a reaction vessel and diluted with a calculated volume of dichloromethane (CH 2 Cl 2) to obtain a viscosity of 1.5  mm 2 /s. The diluted samples were mixed at room temperature (30  °C) with an equal weight of urea activated with 4  % aqueous methanol (CH 3 OH). The mixture was stirred for 60  min at 1, 400 rpm using a mechanical <b>laboratory</b> <b>stirrer</b> (Heldolph RZ-RI n- 280 - 2200 / 35 - 250). The content was filtered with the suction pump. The residue, solid urea-n-alkane adduct was washed with benzene (100  ml) and then decomposed with warm water at 60  °C in a separatory funnel to give semi-solid/solid n-alkanes (upper layer) and an aqueous (lower) layer which was carefully drained off. The n-alkanes were melted, kept at 75  °C and mixed with 1  g of anhydrous granular calcium chloride (CaCl 2) to remove traces of water. The hot mixture was then centrifuged at 2, 000 rpm for 3  min to separate the n-alkanes from the CaCl 2 XH 2 O precipitate. The decanted n-alkanes were cooled and weighed.|$|E
