The project was created in part to overcome the problem in Namibia where girls miss {{an average of three}} school days every month due to lack of menstrual pads. Sister Namibia believes that no girl should have to stay home because she can’t afford pads. SisterPADS are made of cotton and waterproof polyurethane <b>laminate</b> <b>material</b> and are manufactured in the United States. The material is not only reusable, but soft, stretchy, flexible, and durable. A representative from Sister Namibia says: “they have no reports of discomfort or allergies.” Some of the girls in the SisterPADS program who previously used pillow stuffing and other materials prior to the implementation of the program are now attending school and engage in social activities without fear of embarrassment. SisterPADS has provided menstrual pad kits to approximately seven hundred and sixty girls in Namibia through donations and support across the globe and is anticipating to expand their reach.|$|E

50|$|While {{most of the}} {{fuselage}} is made of aluminium alloys, composite materials comprise more than 20% of the A380's airframe. Carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, glass-fibre reinforced plastic and quartz-fibre reinforced plastic are used extensively in wings, fuselage sections (such as the undercarriage and rear end of fuselage), tail surfaces, and doors. The A380 is the first commercial airliner to have a central wing box made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic. It is also the first to have a smoothly contoured wing cross section. The wings of other commercial airliners are partitioned span-wise into sections. This flowing continuous cross section reduces aerodynamic drag. Thermoplastics {{are used in the}} leading edges of the slats. The hybrid fibre metal <b>laminate</b> <b>material</b> GLARE (glass laminate aluminium reinforced epoxy) is used in the upper fuselage and on the stabilisers' leading edges. This aluminium-glass-fibre laminate is lighter and has better corrosion and impact resistance than conventional aluminium alloys used in aviation.

The application of GLARE on the A380 has a long history, which shows the complex nature of innovations in the aircraft industry.|$|E

40|$|Size {{effects in}} which there is an {{apparent}} increase in stiffness with reducing size scale are forecast in those heterogeneous materials that have constitutive behaviour described by more generalized continuum theories such as couple stress, micropolar or micromorphic elasticity.

The <b>laminate</b> <b>material</b> is apparently capable of exhibiting a diversity of size effects some of which are compatible with the predictions of generalized continuum theories while others are contradictory. Another heterogeneous material consisting of a periodic or regular array of voids within a classically elastic matrix is then considered.
