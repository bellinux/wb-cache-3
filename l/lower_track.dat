5|$|After Sebastian Vettel's {{surprise}} victory {{two weeks}} prior in Malaysia, {{eyes were on}} Ferrari whether {{they would be able}} to continue their good race pace in China and challenge the Mercedes for the win. As <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> temperatures were expected for the race, a serious competitiveness of Ferrari was cast into doubt, as they had benefited from lower tyre degradation in the heat of Malaysia. All ten teams taking part in the championship participated in the race, with Marussia hoping to finally be able to run both cars continually, after Will Stevens had failed to start in Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} of ballasted and slab track are used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> height reduces the cross-sectional {{area of the}} tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.|$|E
25|$|At the BMT half, {{the south}} track served subway trains to Manhattan and the BMT Broadway Line. Trains came from Manhattan {{on the upper}} level, {{continued}} north to a merge with the lower level, and then returned via the lower level. This configuration was in place by 1924; before that trains reversed direction using a double crossover south of the platforms. Until October 17, 1949, the Astoria and Flushing Lines hosted both IRT and BMT service. Since the platforms were IRT-size, the BMT used its own elevated cars to provide service on the lines, with a required transfer at Queensboro Plaza. Shuttles from Astoria came in {{on the west side}} <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> and then reversed direction to head to Flushing; Flushing trains came in on the upper track and reversed direction towards Astoria.|$|E

25|$|To {{connect the}} tunnel to Penn Station, {{extensive}} track modifications will be required. The profile of several tracks {{will have to}} be lowered so that they can meet the grade of the new tunnel tracks at the new portal within A Yard. The I Ladder track, which runs diagonal to the other tracks to provide connections to the platforms tracks, would be extended to connect to the new tracks from the tunnel, allowing trains to stop on Tracks 1 through 18. Some tracks within A Yard would be reconfigured. While construction takes place in A Yard, the three trains stored in A Yard and D Yard would be stored in other locations due to the unavailability of storage tracks in those yards. The Empire Line tunnel, near Tenth Avenue, will be modified–100 feet of that tunnel beneath Tenth Avenue will be lowered so that they can connect to the <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> profile in A Yard. This work will either be constructed during weekends over a 20-month period, or through a full closure of the Empire Line tunnel for two to three months. All of this work would take 21 months.|$|E
2500|$|During 1875, {{four members}} of the Camden and Atlantic Railroad board of {{directors}} resigned to build a second railroad from Camden, New Jersey, to Atlantic City by way of Clementon. Led by Samual Richards, an officer of the C for 24 years, they established the Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railway (P) on March 24, 1876. A 3-foot-6-inch narrow gauge was selected because it would <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> laying and operating costs. Work began in April 1877, and the track work was completed in a remarkable 90 days. On July 7, 1877, the final spike was driven and the [...] line was opened in time for summer tourism season. However, on July 12, 1878, the P Railway slipped into bankruptcy; on September 20, 1883, it was jointly acquired by the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) and the Philadelphia and Reading Railway for $1 million. The name was changed to Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railroad on December 4, 1883. The first major task was to convert all track to standard gauge, which was completed on October 5, 1884. The Philadelphia and Reading Railway acquired full control on December 4, 1885.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} whether the underachievement of boys in language {{at the end of}} secondary education is related to school-related attitudes. Data were drawn from the LOSO project, a longitudinal research project in secondary education. The results showed that there were gender differences in language achievement in favour of girls in the <b>lower</b> <b>tracks,</b> but not in the highest track. The underachievement of boys was associated with boys' less positive relationships with teachers, less positive well-being at school and less positive attitude towards schoolwork. Furthermore, the results showed that - in the <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> - boys who were the least attentive in the classroom, the least interested in learning tasks and the least motivated towards learning tasks achieved better than expected. Post-hoc analyses revealed that these are the more intelligent boys. Possible explanations of the demotivation of the more intelligent boys in the <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|These {{dilemmas}} {{were very}} common as students made transitions to new schools (e.g., elementary to middle school, middle to high school). The tracking of African-American students {{in elementary schools}} reflected remnants of early desegregation in which African-American secondary school teachers were demoted to teaching in lower grades (Haney, 1978). In these elementary schools, class-based tracking disproportionately placed African-American students in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> with African-American teachers, regardless of ability. In transitions to middle and high school, tracking by ability created a division among these students and stripped students in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> of their perceived academic efficacies.|$|R

5000|$|Studies on {{tracking}} {{groups within}} schools have also {{proven to be}} detrimental for minority students. [...] Once students are in these <b>lower</b> <b>tracks,</b> {{they tend to have}} less-qualified teachers, a less challenging curriculum, and few opportunities to advance into higher tracks. [...] There is also some research that suggests students in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> suffer from social psychological consequences of being labeled as a slower learner, which often leads children to stop trying in school. [...] In fact, many sociologists argue that tracking in schools does not provide any lasting benefits to any group of students.|$|R
50|$|As late as 2009, Childers (in press) {{found that}} in a {{successful}} Ohio high school that was majority African-American, students of color were still placed in <b>lower</b> academic <b>tracks</b> {{at a rate that}} did not reflect the student population. The argument for the proliferation of African-Americans in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> was student choice rather than racially based practices of administrators (Childers, in press).|$|R

40|$|This study investigates in {{the context}} of Flanders (Belgium) whether working parttime during the school year is more {{prevalent}} in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> than in higher tracks, and whether this might be due to an antischool culture and/or the less demanding nature of such tracks. Additionally, the study examines whether the higher tendency to fail and to drop out in <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> is associated with the fact that lower-track {{students are more likely to}} work. Multilevel analyses of data from 6, 373 students in 44 secondary schools show that a school’s futility culture explains lower-track students’ higher participation with paid work rather than the school’s demanding nature. The results do not show a relation between students’ employment and educational attainment. However, students working part-time are less inclined to plan high school completion...|$|R
50|$|Proponents of {{tracking}} {{would have said}} that students dropped out due to lack of ability, but Mickelson (2003) stated that students differed widely even within <b>lower</b> <b>tracks.</b> Even when students demonstrated high academic ability, it was virtually impossible to change their academic tracks without delaying high school graduation (Mickelson, 2003).|$|R

50|$|For {{students}} {{who remained in}} public schools, de facto segregation remained a reality due to segregated lunch tables and segregated extracurricular programs. Today, the pedagogical practice of tracking in schools also leads to de facto segregation within some public schools as racial and ethic minorities are disproportionately overrepresented in <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> classes and white students are disproportionately overrepresented in AP and college prep classes.|$|E
50|$|TRA's {{infrastructure}} {{might be}} described as making up for <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> miles with sidings. TRA operated single-track sections on busy mainlines until 1998. Double-track sections can accommodate trains at different speeds; passing movements don’t interference with opposing traffic, allowing scheduled throughputs of ~15 trains per hour per direction. Scheduling practices assume staff can respond tounforeseen delays and out-of-sequence trains by dynamically utilizing available infrastructure.|$|E
5000|$|Schools {{also tend}} to place {{students}} in tracking groups {{as a means of}} tailoring lesson plans for different types of learners. However, as a result of schools placing emphasis on socioeconomic status and cultural capital, minority students are vastly over-represented in <b>lower</b> educational <b>tracks.</b> [...] Similarly, Hispanic and African American students are often wrongly placed into <b>lower</b> <b>tracks</b> based on teachers’ and administrators’ expectations for minority students. Such expectations of a race within school systems are a form of institutional racism. Some researchers compare the tracking system to a modern form of racial segregation within the schools.|$|R

50|$|Teacher and {{counselor}} judgements {{have been}} shown to be just as inaccurate as standardized tests. Teachers and counselors may have a large number of students for which they are responsible for analyzing and making recommendations.

This leads to a disproportionate number of lower and minority children placed unfairly into <b>lower</b> <b>track</b> groups.|$|E
