The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E

5|$|Five police officers, {{who volunteered}} {{to carry out the}} execution, were each paid $300. The {{shooters}} used identical Winchester Model 94 rifles. One prison official selected each rifle at random from a table and handed them to another prison official sitting in a small room, out of sight. The second prison official would then <b>load</b> <b>the</b> rifle, and return it to the table. Four of the rifles were loaded with live ammunition. One was secretly loaded with a wax bullet so that none of the officers would be certain that they fired a deadly shot. The non-lethal cartridge was tested to ensure that the report and recoil was difficult to distinguish from a real cartridge.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to <b>load</b> <b>the</b> bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to <b>load</b> <b>the</b> bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{responded in}} the top of the 9th, scoring their only runs of the game. Kevin Tapani allowed {{successive}} singles to Brent Mayne and Mueller to open the inning before Terry Mulholland relieved him. Stan Javier singled to score Mayne and Ellis Burks then walked to <b>load</b> <b>the</b> bases. Bonds came to bat with the bases loaded for the second time in the game and lined out to deep right field, scoring Mueller on a sacrifice fly and Javier advanced to third base.
