These observations, together with chemical, meteorological, and dynamical analyses, suggest that a simple two-reservoir model, composed of the lower free troposphere (LFT), where photochemical processes are accelerated and removal via deposition does not occur, and the planetary boundary layer (PBL), where most precursor species are injected, may realistically represent the physics and chemistry of severe, multiday haze and O 3 episodes over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Correlations among O 3, potential temperature (u), the scattering A ˚ ngström exponent (a), and relative humidity (RH) suggest that high concentrations of O 3 and relatively large, internally mixed sulfate and black carbon (BC) particles were produced in the LFT.

40|$|Although a {{kinematic}} {{framework for}} diagnosing frontogenesis {{exists in the}} form of the Petterssen fron-togenesis function and its vector generalization, a similar framework for diagnosing airstream boundaries (e. g., drylines, <b>lee</b> <b>troughs)</b> has not been constructed.

The maximum growth rate of the separation vector is called the instantaneous dilatation rate and its orientation is called the axis of dilatation. Similarly, a maximum decay rate is called the instantaneous contraction rate and its orientation is called the axis of contraction. These expressions are related to the vector frontogenesis function, in that the growth rate of the separation vector corresponds with the scalar frontogenesis function, and the rotation rate of the separation vector corresponds with the rotational component of the vector frontogenesis function. Because vorticity can rotate air-parcel pairs out of regions of deformation, the instantaneous dilatation and contraction rates and axes may not be appropriate diagnostics of airstream boundaries for fluid flows in general. Rather, the growth rate and orientation of an airstream boundary may correspond better to the so-called asymptotic contraction rate and the asymptotic axis of dilatation, respectively.

SSDs {{have been reported to}} be associated with dust-storms and precipitation over northern Africa. This paper presents the first-ever systematic investigation of SSDs using re-analysis and satellite data. Depressions are identified and tracked objectively based on closed contours in 0000 UTC fields of 925 hPa geopotential height from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim re-analysis (1989 - 2008). To classify as potential SSDs, tracks must: (i) start to the south of 20 °N; (ii) intersect 15 °- 30 °N, 10 °W- 30 °E; (iii) cover a meridional distance of at least 10 ° latitude; and (iv) have a minimum lifetime of 24 hours. Even with a relatively low threshold of 4 gpm, only 50 potential SSDs are found (annual average 2. 5, monthly range 0 - 6). Lagrangian and Eulerian composite analyses reveal that the identified systems: (i) are mostly shallow <b>lee</b> <b>troughs</b> of the central Saharan and Atlas Mountains during the warm season without a well-defined cyclonic wind field; (ii) do not show the seasonal track variation described in the literature; (iii) mostly occur in association with high-pressure anomalies over the Mediterranean Sea; and (iv) are not associated with significant increases in dustiness and precipitation.

40|$|The Adélie Land {{coastal region}} of Antarctica {{is one of}} the most {{prominent}} cyclogenesis regions in the Southern Hemisphere, and is adjacent to the continent’s most intense katabatic wind regime. However, the physical mechanisms responsible for cyclogenesis are not known. A manual analysis of cyclogenesis for the 2003 – 2005 period using output from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) identifies two primary patterns of cyclogenesis near the Adélie Land coast. For “secondary development ” cyclones, enhanced low-level cyclonic vorticity and baroclinicity result from the combination of an existing synoptic-scale cyclone to the west, coastal barrier winds and katabatic winds. “Lee cyclogenesis ” occurs near 152 ◦E on the cyclonic-shear side of the Adélie Land katabatic jet, where a low-level warm potential temperature anomaly sets up a <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> that becomes mobile with the arrival of upper-level synoptic-scale forcing. The representation of both “secondary development ” and “lee cyclogenesis ” cyclones in an automated cyclone-tracking scheme is explored, where it is found that the automated scheme overestimates cyclogenesis for this region. The location of the Antarctic coastal cyclogenesis maximum near Adélie Land is due to the unique juxtaposition of the extraordinary katabatic wind regime and dissipating synoptic-scale cyclones to the west. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two intense {{cyclones}} {{over the}} North Atlantic during summer/autumn 2003 are investigated to determine atmospheric {{factors contributing to}} their development. One of the cases, in August 2003, led to heavy precipitation and flooding in Central Norway. The other event was a cyclone that caused heavy snowfall and wind exceeding 30 m/s over East-Greenland and strong winds and snowfall over North-Iceland on 20 - 21 September 2003. The cyclones have been simulated with the numerical model MM 5. For both cases sensitivity studies {{have been carried out}} to evaluate the significance of orography, latent heating and SST. In addition, the role of SST gradients are investigated in the September case and the role of surface albedo in the August case. This study shows that the September cyclone is strongly affected by the orography of Greenland. When orography is removed, a deep baroclinic low develops rapidly and moves eastward at 75 N. Conversely, in the control run, the evolution of the primary baroclinic low is greatly suppressed by the orographic retardation of the warm air ahead of and the cold air behind the low. At the same time, a secondary low off Greenland’s east coast at 68 N intensifies due to a coupling between an approaching upper level PV-anomaly and a lower level PV-anomaly generated from lee effects. The secondary cyclone is then transformed into a baroclinic low and moves eastward and causes the extreme weather conditions. In the August case the precipitation is strongly enhanced by orography due to the northely onshore winds. Removing the orography of Scandinavia leads to greatly reduced precipitation and a deformation of the cyclone. When the orography is present, a <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> is formed over SE-Norway. A simulation with increased albedo is conducted to determine the significans of thermal effects for the trough formation. The <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> weakened, but the impact of surface albedo was less than that of the mountain effect. In both cases, the simulations reveal that the release of latent heat had a major impact on the deepening of the cyclone in lower troposphere. In the August case, latent heating contributed to 40 % of the rapid deepening during the first 30 hours of the simulation. The August cyclone occurred during a period of anomalously high sea surface temperatures(SST). Numerical tests show however that the development of the cyclone is fairly insensitive to the SST. Neighter the September cyclone was significantly influenced by the SST. In the North-Atlantic there are gradients in the sea surface temperature due to the warm Norwegian Atlantic Current and the cold East Greenland Current. The simulations show however that SSTgradients contributed relatively little {{to the development of the}} September cyclone...|$|E

The observational analysis shows that a mesoscale low develops over the southeastern East Sea (Japan Sea) on 29 January 1995. Satellite imagery also indicates that a meso-b-scale vortex forms on the lee side of the northern Korean mountain complex (KMC), which is located in the northern Korean peninsula, and that a meso-a-scale cyclone develops over the southeastern East Sea at a later time. The mesoscale cyclone forms in the lower troposphere with strong baroclinicity and cyclonic circulation under the influence of an upper-level synoptic-scale cold vortex. Numerical simulation has captured major features of the observed cyclogenesis very well. The cyclogenesis occurs in a progressive manner. Basically, four distinctive stages of the cyclogenesis are identified. 1) First, a surface pressure trough forms on the lee side of the KMC under a northwesterly synoptic-scale flow that is deflected anticyclonically over the KMC. 2) Second, the <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> deepens further into a strong convergence zone and a meso-b-scale vortex. 3) Next, the meso-b-scale vortex develops into a meso-a-scale vortex as the vortex and the trough begin to move southeastward from the lee of the KMC. 4) Finally, the surface troug...|$|E

The evolution of the southerly low level jet during a return flow event is studied using output from the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale Model (Version 4). Three geographically different southerly low level jets (LLJ's) develop in the simulation: one over the southern Plains of the United States, a second near the Mexican Plateau southwest of Brownsville, Texas, and a third over the western Gulf of Mexico. The evolution of the lower troposphere over the southern Plains is much like the conceptual model for a severe storm environment produced by Carlson and Ludlam (1968). The LLJ over the Plains is found to form first as an inertial oscillation, and later as a response to <b>lee</b> <b>troughing</b> and to the shape of an elevated mixed layer that forms over the region. Over Mexico, the temperature structure over the Plateau is responsible for a pressure gradient that supports a LLJ east of the Plateau. The LLJ encompasses a smaller area than the LLJ over the southern Plains, and remains nearly stationary over two diurnal cycles. The LLJ over the western Gulf of Mexico results largely from topographic blocking of the low level southerly flow. An eastward protrusion in the model topography north of Veracruz, Mexico forces the low level flow to accelerate downstream of the obstacle. This simulation shows that the structure of the lower tropospheric air flow during a period of return flow is complex. When mid-level westerlies are weak, mesoscale processes govern the development of low level jets. As the westerly winds increase in response to an approaching upper level disturbance, synoptic influences overwhelm the mesoscale processes leading to a single larger scale low level jet...|$|R

For the other three cases, a blocking ridge existed over the Great Plains and the upper level flow is relatively weak. It is during these situations that the classic, diurnal oscillating LLJ was observed.

The analyses showed that an Appalachian <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> (APLT) played a vital role in this pattern. Mesoscale structures associated with the APLT that affected ozone formation and distribution included (1) south-southwesterly winds east of the trough, which favored accumulation of emissions in an airstream passing directly along the urban corridor, (2) west to northwesterly winds behind the APLT, which led to lower accumulation of emissions in that sector, (3) mixing depth contrasts across the APLT, which favored less dilution of primary and secondary pollutants to the east of the trough, and (4) low-level convergence and upward vertical velocities at the APLT, which led to the development of an elevated mixed layer over the planetary boundary layer on the east side of the trough, where pollutants could be trapped and transported for long distances by a low-level jet. 1...|$|E
40|$|Since {{numerical}} forecast models often err {{in predicting the}} timing and location of lee cyclogenesis, a physically based method to diagnose such errors is sought. A case of Rocky Mountain lee cyclogenesis associated with strong winds is examined to explore the transformation from a stationary <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> to a mobile midlatitude cyclone (hereafter, departure). Up to 12 h before departure, a pronounced surface pressure trough travels eastward across western North America at an average speed of 22 m s 21. Several methods are employed to examine the structure and evolution of the pressure field: total sea level pressure, time series at individual stations, isallobars, and bandpass filtering. Bandpass filtering of the observed sea level pressure data is useful for clarifying {{the movement of the}} mobile trough through the complex terrain. Quasigeostrophic height-tendency diagnostics show that the mobile pressure trough is related to the traveling mid- to upper-tropospheric vorticity maximum that is responsible for departure. At many stations, surface temperature changes associated with this pressure trough are not consistent with those commonly associated with surface frontal passages. To test the hypothesis that mobile pressure troughs are associated with departure, a five-winter climatology of 111 southern Alberta lee cyclones is constructed. Sixty-two percent of these events feature an upstream pressure minimum 3 – 9 h prior to departure, in a manner resembling the case study. Seventy-six percent of these 111 events are associated with reports listed in Storm Data, indicating the potential severity of these storms. 1...|$|E
40|$|A two-dimensional, hydrostatic, nearly {{adiabatic}} {{primitive equation}} model {{is used to}} study {{the evolution of a}} front passing across topography. Frontogenesis is forced by shearing deformation associated with the nonlinear evolution of an Eady wave. This study extends previous work by including an upper-level potential vorticity (PV) anomaly and a growing baroclinic wave in a baroclinically unstable basic state. Results for the Eady wave simulations show that the mountain retards and blocks the approaching front at the surface while the upper-level PV anomaly associated with the front moves across the domain unaffected. Warm advection ahead of the <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> forces convergence and cyclonic vorticity growth near the base of the lee slope. This vorticity growth is further encouraged by the approach of the upper-level PV anomaly. The upperlevel PV anomaly then couples with this new surface vorticity center and propagates downstream. The original surface front remains trapped on the windward slope. Thus when the upstream blocking is strong, frontal propagation is discontinuous across the ridge. This evolution occurs for tall mountains and narrow mountains, as well as weak fronts. For low mountains, wide mountains, and strong fronts, only weak retardation is observed on the windward slope. The surface front remains coupled with the upper-level PV anomaly. The front moves continuously across the mountain. The net result, regardless of mountain size and shape, is that the front reaches the base of the lee slope stronger, sooner, and with a decreased cross-front scale compared to the ‘‘no-mountain’ ’ case. Well downstream of the mountain, no position change of the surface front is observed. 1...|$|E

Three geographically different southerly LLJs develop in the simulation: one over the southern Plains of the United States, a second southwest of Brownsville, Texas, and a third over the western Gulf of Mexico. The LLJ over the Plains is found to form first as an inertial oscillation and later as a response to <b>lee</b> <b>troughing</b> and an elevated mixed layer that develops over the region. Over Mexico, the temperature structure over the Altiplanicie Mexicana (Mexican High Plain) is responsible for a locally intense low-level pressure gradient east of the High Plain which remains nearly stationary over two diurnal cycles. The LLJ over the western Gulf of Mexico results largely from topographic blocking of the low-level southerly flow by the eastern end of the Neovolcanic Cordillera northwest of Veracruz, Mexico. The evolution of the lower troposphere over the southern Plains resembles the Carlson and Ludlam conceptual model for a severe storm environment, but the structure of the return flow is complex. When midlevel westerlies are weak, mesoscale and boundary layer processes govern the development of LLJs. As the west and southwesterly winds increase with an approaching upper-level disturbance, synoptic influences overwhelm the mesoscale processes leading to a single, larger-scale LLJ.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there exist three {{singular}} points, U 2 c 5 6 f/k and U 5 c, where the corresponding levels will be called inertia critical levels (ICLs) and the classic critical level (CCL), in the equation governing a two-dimensional, rotating, continuously stratified, hydrostatic, back-sheared Boussinesq flow. Here U and c are basic wind and phase speed, respectively; f is the Coriolis force; and k is the wavenumber. The effects of these critical levels on flows over an isolated mountain ridge are investigated both analytically and numerically, based on a broad range of Rossby numbers (Ro) and Richardson numbers (Ri). Each wave mode generated from the isolated mountain with a continuous spectrum has its own ICL. To indicate the net effects of all ICLs, the authors define the effective ICL as the height above which the amplitude of the inertia-gravity wave mode is very small. The findings for linear flows are summarized as follows. Regime I is inertia-gravity waves. The flow behaves like unsheared inertia-gravity waves and the effective lower ICL plays a similar role as the CCL does in a nonrotating flow. Regime II is combined inertia-gravity waves and baroclinic lee waves. These waves behave like those in regime I below the lower effective ICL, and like baroclinic lee waves near the CCL. In this regime, the horizontal warm advection by the baroclinic lee wave {{plays an important role in}} the formation of the <b>lee</b> pressure <b>trough.</b> On the other hand, near the downslope of the mountain...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{atmospheric circulation}} around an idealized coastal cape during summertime upwelling-favorable wind conditions simulated by a mesoscale coupled ocean–atmosphere model. The domain resembles an eastern ocean boundary {{with a single}} cape protruding into the ocean {{in the center of}} a coastline. The model predicts the formation of an orographic wind intensification area on the lee side of the cape, extending a few hundred kilometers downstream and seaward. Imposed initial conditions do not contain a low-level temperature inversion, which nevertheless forms on the lee side of the cape during the simulation, and which is accompanied by high Froude numbers diagnosed in that area, suggesting the presence of the supercritical flow. Formation of such an inversion is likely caused by average easterly winds resulting on the lee side that bring warm air masses originating over land, as well as by air warming during adiabatic descent on the lee side of the topographic obstacle. Mountain leeside dynamics modulated by differential diurnal heating is thus suggested to dominate the wind regime in the studied case. The location of this wind feature and its strong diurnal variations correlate well with the development and evolution of the localized <b>lee</b> side <b>trough</b> over the coastal ocean. The vertical extent of the leeside trough is limited by the subsidence inversion aloft. Diurnal modulations of the ocean sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and surface depth-averaged ocean current on the lee side of the cape are found to strongly correlate with wind stress variations over the same area. Wind-driven coastal upwelling develops during the simulation and extends offshore about 50 km upwind of the cape. It widens twice as much on the lee side of the cape, where the coldest nearshore SSTs are found. The average wind stress–SST coupling in the 100 -km coastal zone is strong for the region upwind of the cape, but is notably weaker for the downwind region, estimated from the 10 -day-average fields. The study findings demonstrate that orographic and diurnal modulations of the near-surface atmospheric flow on the lee side of the cape notably affect the air–sea coupling on various temporal scales: weaker wind stress–SST coupling results for the long-term averages, while strong correlations are found on the diurnal scale...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of meteorological processes {{in two of the}} highest ozone (O 3) episodes within the last decade at monitoring sites in southern New Hampshire (NH), USA. The highest O 3 levels occurred on 14 August 2002 at Thompson Farm (TF) and 22 July 2004 at Castle Springs (CS). Ozone mixing ratios in the 2002 episode showed continual high values (> 100 ppbv) {{at the beginning of the}} episode, and reached 151 ppbv on 14 August. The 2004 episode consisted of one day of high O 3 (> 100 ppbv) on 22 July at CS with the peak level of 111 ppbv. Our analysis suggested that the August 2002 high O 3 event at TF occurred under stagnant synoptic high-pressure conditions that prevailed over the entire eastern USA for an unusually extended time period. The clear skies and stable meteorological conditions resulted in accumulation of pollutants in the boundary layer. At the same time, the mesoscale low-level-jet (LLJ) played an important role in transporting air masses from the polluted Mid-Atlantic areas to the Northeast. Local land-sea-breeze circulations also added to the impact of this event. Our examination showed that the unprecedented high levels of O 3 on 22 July 2004 at CS was driven by two mechanisms, stratospheric intrusion and the Appalachian <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> (APLT), which was not found during other O 3 episodes at the site in the decade long data record. This study demonstrated that unusually high O 3 levels at New England rural sites were driven by multi-scale processes, and the regional/local scale processes controlled the magnitude and timing of the local pollution episodes...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} {{analyses and}} surface observations {{are used to}} examine the structure and evolution of an lntermountain cyclone and its attendant surface fronts. The cyclone, known locally as the 2 ̆ 2 Tax Day Storm, 2 ̆ 2 produced the lowest sea level pressure on record and strongest cold frontal passage (based on the 2 h temperature fall) observed in the past 25 y at the Salt Lake City lnternational Airport (KSLC). Three surface features develop downstream of the Sierra Nevada prior to the incipient cyclogenesis. The first is a barrier parallel <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> that forms in response to strengthening cross-barrier flow. The second is a decaying elongated trough draped over the northern Great Basin. The third is a confluence zone that extends downstream over the Great Basin normal to the Sierra Nevada. Strong contraction (i. e., deformation and convergence) within this Great Basin Confluence Zone (GBCZ) forms an airstream boundary that is initially nonfrontal, but becomes the locus for surface frontogenesis as it collects isentropes and cooler air from northern Nevada. As the elongated trough rotates into phase with the GBCZ and developing surface front, cyclogenesis occurs as an upper-level cyclonic potential vorticity anomaly traverses the Sierra Nevada and quasi-geostrophic forcing for ascent spreads over the Great Basin. Differential diabatic heating further sharpens the front over northern Utah where dramatic frontal distortions are produced by the local orography. This analysis further establishes the critical role that the GBCZ plays in lntermountain frontogenesis and identifies it as an important mesoscale feature accompanying Nevada cyclogenesis. Recognition of this role may improve short-range forecasting and help advance our understanding of these cyclones and their attendant fronts, which are the primary source of cool season precipitation over the Great Basin...|$|E
40|$|This study uses a {{very high}} {{resolution}} numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to investigate the complex structure and behaviour of cold fronts along the New South Wales coast during the warmer months of the year, the complex interaction between the wind flow and coastlines and elevated areas {{as well as the}} lee-trough effect, particularly the way it affects waters off the east coast of Tasmania, The study also investigates the utility of the higher resolution NWP model to better predict wind fields compared to a lower resolution model. The University of New South Wales very high resolution model (HIRES), nested in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's coarse NWP model (GASP), was run at various horizontal resolutions (from 15 to 25 km) in order to investigate the above-mentioned features. It was found to bave very good skill in resolving the features and was also found to be very accurate in the prediction of surface wind fields for various yacht race events out to at least four days ahead. It can be concluded that there is considerable skill in the ability of high-resolution NWP models such as HIRES, to predict the major features of the wind fields over the ocean out to several days ahead. Moreover, it was also able to more accurately simulate the complex structure of the summer-time cool change as it progressed along the NSW coast than the lower resolution model runs. The influence of coastlines, particularly ones with complex topographical features, on the wind flow was demonstrated to a limited extent throughout the study. Finally the following concepts were also verified {{as a result of the}} study: - air flow takes the path of least resistance - the shape of topography can help generate local turbulence - the orientation of the wind flow to a mountain range is important in determining turbulent effects. - under certain airflow and stability situations, standing wave activity and a <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> can be observed in the lee of mountains, hills or even high coastal cliffs...|$|E
40|$|For years, basic mountain, sea breeze, and {{low-level}} jet (LLJ) circulations {{have been}} studied, usually in locations {{with a high}} frequency of occurrence, sharp gradients, or significant geographic prominence. However, {{there is evidence that}} similar circulations exist in non-classic locations with more mild topography and atmospheric gradients. One such understudied area is the U. S. Mid-Atlantic region. 	The Water Vapor Variability - Satellite/Sondes (WAVES) 2006 field campaign provided a contiguous 5 -day period of concentrated high resolution observations to examine fine-scale details of a weather pattern typical of the Mid-Atlantic summertime. These measurements presented an opportunity for an intensive modeling study to further investigate peculiar phenomena with verification against research-grade observations. 	The observations captured two significant events: an official LLJ and a cold front with a prefrontal trough. A pronounced diurnal cycle was revealed which can be categorized into three stages: (1) daytime growth of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), (2) flow intensification into a LLJ regime after dusk, and (3) interruption by downslope winds (DW) after midnight. The third stage is most interesting owing to the lack of literature documenting similar occurrences in the Mid-Atlantic, which can impact air quality forecasting. 	Prior to high resolution modeling of the case study, sensitivity studies were conducted examining four areas to which the model was believed most sensitive: (1) initial condition data, (2) cumulus schemes, (3) PBL parameterizations, and (4) initialization times. Results also revealed shortcomings in model precipitation and PBL profiles, model biases, urban anomalies, and tendencies for forecast convergence. 	High resolution regional modeling showed the evolution of these nocturnal events and were verified against WAVES observations. A hybrid solenoidal influenced afternoon and early evening circulation east of the mountains. Afternoon deepening of a <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> by an oscillating warm air band influenced low-level wind fields. Wind flow was further influenced by the thermal wind that originated over sloping terrain. Airflow traversed the Appalachian barrier and moved down the east flank of the Appalachians with katabatic and hydraulic contributions. This DW swept the LLJ regime off to the southeast. The prefrontal LLJ outflow in the Midwest strengthened DW events as the cold front approached...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Observational {{analyses}} and numerical simulations {{are used to}} investigate the interaction between frontal systems and the complex terrain of the western U. S. for both warm and cold seasons. The different characteristics of mesoscale phenomena resulting from the interaction for each synoptic condition are explored and compared. For the warm season event, synoptically driven offshore flow {{was associated with the}} northward development of an inland thermal trough. Strong thermal and pressure gradients across the coast, coupled with the subsequent weakening of the offshore flow, resulted in the onshore push of cool marine air approximately 12 h before frontal passage. Surface fluxes are important {{in the formation of the}} thermal trough and the prefrontal onshore push, and damming on the coastal mountains results in a mesoscale coastal ridge and alongshore southerlies. After frontal passage, a Puget Sound Convergence Zone (PSCZ) occurred to the east of the Olympic Mountains. The Olympics deflect the low-level onshore flow into two branches, one along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and another around the southern flank, and contribute to the formation of a <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> which induces convergence over the central Puget Sound. The Cascades deflect the northern and southern air streams into a more northerly and a more southerly directions, respectively. The two air streams converge and result in the PSCZ. It was also found that latent heat release enhances the PSCZ circulation and associated precipitation. For the cold season event, the front was associated with large temperature gradient and sharp windshifts offshore, especially along its northern portion. Before frontal landfall, strong coastal southerlies were enhanced by the coastal mountains as a result of down-gradient acceleration within a Rossby radius from the coast. Coastal ridging and lee troughing were evident on the windward and the lee sides of the coastal mountains. During landfall, the front was delayed and weakened by the Olympics, while it could advance inland to the north and the south. In addition, the over-water path along the Strait of Juan de Fuca allowed the front to maintain its integrity at low levels, in contrast to the distinct weakening over land...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of large-scale wave systems with the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is investigated by regressing pressure, potential temperature, winds, precipitation, and selected fluxes in winter onto the three components Toi of this massif’s mountain torque {{on the basis}} of the 40 -yr ECMWF reanalysis (ERA- 40) data. Events with respect to the equatorial “Greenwich” axis of the global angular momentum exhibit by far the largest torques (To 1,), which essentially represent north–south pressure differences across the TP. The axial torque To 3 peaks when the surface pressure is high at the eastern slope of the TP. The torque To 2 with respect to the 90 °E axis is closely related to To 3 with To 2 ∼ −To 3. The maximum (minimum) of To 1 tends to occur about 1 day earlier than the minimum (maximum) of To 2. All torque events are initiated by equivalent barotropic perturbations moving eastward along the northern rim of the TP. In general, the initial depression, for example, forms a southward-protruding extension at the eastern slope of the TP and a new high grows near Japan. Later, the perturbation near Japan moves eastward in To 2 events but extends northward in To 1 events. These flow developments cannot be explained by theories of topographic instability. The observed vertical motion at the lee slope is at best partly consistent with theories of linear quasigeostrophic wave motion along mountain slopes. These findings lead the authors to test the eventual usefulness of linear theories by fitting the linear terms of a novel statistical equation for the potential temperature θ to the observed changes of θ and the torque to the observations. This test indicates that the evolving regression patterns of θ can be explained by linear terms at least in specific domains. In turn, pressure tendency regressions at a selected level can be calculated {{on the basis of}} the linear θ tendencies above that level. The formation of the <b>lee</b> <b>trough</b> appears to be mainly caused by horizontal warm-air advection along the slopes, but changes of the potential temperature above the height of the TP also contribute significantly to the pressure changes in the lee. Cold-air advection aloft strengthens the Japan high. “Turbulent” transports appear to be mainly responsible for the decay of the perturbations but data accuracy problems impede the analysis. In particular, the noisiness of the vertical motion fields affects the skill of the linear calculations...|$|E
