5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, <b>labor</b> <b>cost,</b> material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. <b>Labor</b> <b>cost</b> depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{behavior}} of indirect production <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> using daily data for five years from seven production departments of a manufacturing firm. We address two questions: (1) Are indirect production <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> proportional to direct <b>labor</b> <b>costs,</b> the cost driver employed in the existing cost accounting system to allocate indirect costs? and (2) Are indirect production <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> associated with batch-related and product-sustaining cost drivers {{in addition to the}} unit-related driver, direct <b>labor</b> <b>costs?</b> Our empirical results reject the proportionality hypothesis for all seven departments.

A comparison of incandescent lamp operating cost with other light sources must include illumination requirements, cost of the lamp and <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> to replace lamps (taking into account effective lamp lifetime), cost of electricity used, effect of lamp operation on heating and air conditioning systems.

Marina Prieto-Carrón shows in her research in Central America that women in sweatshops are not even supplied with toilet paper in the bathroom everyday. The reason it costs corporations more is because people can not work to their full potential in poor conditions, affecting the global marketplace. Furthermore, when corporations decide to change manufacturing rates or locations in industries that employ more women, they are often left with no job nor assistance. This kind of sudden reduction or elimination in hours is seen in industries such as the textile industry and agriculture industry, both which employ a higher amount of women than men. One solution to mistreatment of women in the supply chain is more involvement from the corporation and trying to regulate the outsourcing of their product.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{technical}} problems, such as harvesting, {{are being}} addressed successfully by the industry, the high up-front investment of algae-to-biofuels facilities {{is seen by}} many as a major obstacle to the success of this technology. Only few studies on the economic viability are publicly available, and must often rely on the little data (often only engineering estimates) available in the public domain. Dmitrov examined the GreenFuel's photobioreactor and estimated that algae oil would only be competitive at an oil price of $800 per barrel. A study by Alabi et al. examined raceways, photobioreactors and anaerobic fermenters to make biofuels from algae and found that photobioreactors are too expensive to make biofuels. Raceways might be cost-effective in warm climates with very low labor costs, and fermenters may become cost-effective subsequent to significant process improvements. The group found that capital cost, <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> and operational costs (fertilizer, electricity, etc.) by themselves are too high for algae biofuels to be cost-competitive with conventional fuels. Similar results were found by others, suggesting that unless new, cheaper ways of harnessing algae for biofuels production are found, their great technical potential may never become economically accessible. Recently, Rodrigo E. Teixeira demonstrated a new reaction and proposed a process for harvesting and extracting raw materials for biofuel and chemical production that requires a fraction of the energy of current methods, while extracting all cell constituents.|$|E

40|$|This note {{shows that}} unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs,</b> {{the most widely}} used measure of competitiveness, are {{equivalent}} to the labor share in output multiplied by a price-adjustment factor. This has three main implications. First, unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> are not just a technical concept. They embody the social relations and institutional arrangements that influence the distribution of income between the social classes. Secondly, lower unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> should not necessarily be interpreted as implying that an economy is more competitive, i. e., that it will grow faster, and vice-versa. An increase in the wage share can accelerate growth through a number of channels. Hence, it is possible to find that countries with fast-growing unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> also show faster growth in exports or in gross domestic product (GDP). Third, one can define the concept of unit capital cost as a measure of competitiveness and shift the burden of lack of growth or loss of market share to capital. In this paper, unit labor and unit capital costs for the Philippines are calculated. It is shown that the decrease in competitiveness (i. e., increase in unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs)</b> in the Philippines is exclusively the result of increases in prices as the labor share has decreased. competitiveness, Philippines, unit <b>labor</b> <b>costs,</b> unit capital cost...|$|R
