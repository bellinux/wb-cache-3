50|$|Another Slovenian view advocating border changes was {{proposed}} by the first President of the Slovenian Parliament, the legal expert France Bučar. The Istrian peninsula was historically included in the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Austrian part, as was the territory of modern Slovenia; the majority of modern Croatian territory {{was included in the}} Hungarian part. Bučar asserted that the present Istrian peninsular division is thus <b>legally</b> unfounded and <b>irrelevant,</b> since this division has never been based on what he considers proper legal acts and especially not on the will of Istria's native population. Therefore, Bučar proposed that the border in Istria should be determined by referendums carried out in any territory both countries wish to claim. This proposal is, according to Bučar, based upon the legal principle of self-determination, the same principle on which both countries' 1991 Declarations of Independence were based. Such a border determination process was employed in the Carinthian Plebiscite to determine the Slovenian-Austrian border.|$|R

5000|$|Akin {{to modern}} tax avoidance, {{it was a}} legal loop-hole to avoid the {{suffering}} of the customary feudal incidents, namely the payment of feudal relief on an inheritance, the temporary loss of control of a fiefdom through wardship where the landholder was under the age of majority of 21, and the forcible marriage of a young heiress. Nor could the land-holding escheat, that is to say revert permanenly to the overlord, as was customary where the land-holder died without a legal heir. When the fiefdom was held by a group of feoffees, the death of the beneficial holder was <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to its continued holding by them. They simply allowed the lands to continue to be used by the deceased's heir. The feoffees were [...] "an undying corporation which never suffered a minority and could not be given in marriage" [...] (McFarlane, p. 146). The feudal overlord, the king himself if the land was held in-chief, was not entitled to exact feudal relief from the new beneficiary nor was he entitled to seize control of the lands and their revenues until such heir was of full-age, nor was he entitled to sell the heiress in marriage or to marry her to one of his own sons. This had a considerably deleterious effect on the royal finances, which state of affairs was rectified by the aggressive and imaginative new fiscal measures taken by King Henry VII after his accession in 1485.|$|E

40|$|Law may be {{perceived}} as consisting, ontologically, of a reflective relationship between two elements: norm and behaviour. Legal norms are set forth by human behaviour; their content is composed of models of behaviour. Norms are interpreted together with a real or imagined behaviour. But behaviour is also interpreted or assessed by reference to norms. This‘ontological dualism’of law cannot be disconnected, even though the different elements of law can, to a certain extent, be considered separately. Norms must refer to some form of behaviour, otherwise norms cannot be understood at all.

40|$|For {{almost all}} crimes, the {{appearance}} and behaviour {{of the victim}} are <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to a defendant's guilt or innocence. However, {{there is evidence that}} such extralegal victim characteristics can influence juror behaviour. This paper reports an experimental juror simulation which examined the effects on mock jurors' verdicts of three victim characteristics—facial disfigurement, precautiousness and physical attractiveness. Subjects were drawn from student populations in both the US and the UK. Under most experimental conditions, the defendant was less likely to be convicted when the victim took every reasonable precaution to avoid the crime than when the victim took no such precautions. The opposite effect resulted when the victim was both physically unattractive and facially disfigured prior to the crime. These results were interpreted in terms of Lerner's just world theory and the principle of comparative negligence. The degree of harm done to the victim was implicated as a key mediator of victim characteristic effects. The effects on verdicts were also related to subjects' verdict criteria (standards of reasonable doubt) and their perceived costs of committing the ‘Type II’ juridic error (i. e. acquitting a guilty defendant). Although several cross-cultural differences were obtained, the effects of the victim characteristics on subjects' verdicts were identical for the British and American samples...|$|E

Within this framework, three <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant</b> variables were also manipulated.

Of the 1064 psychiatrists in the Province of Ontario who were solicited to participate in this mail-out study, 318 individuals returned a completed response form.

40|$|This article makes six points. First, {{under any}} {{plausible}} normative perspective, {{the distinction between}} mistake (and ignorance) of criminal law and mistake of fact must at least sometimes be drawn. Second, the fundamental distinction is between a mistake about the state 2 ̆ 7 s authoritative statement of what is prohibited (2 ̆ 2 M Law 2 ̆ 2), and a mistake about whether that prohibitory norm is instantiated in a particular case (2 ̆ 2 M Fact 2 ̆ 2). Third, when an actor makes a mistake about an evaluative criterion whose content the fact-finder has discretion to elaborate, it is impossible both to allow this discretion and to faithfully realize a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s policy of treating M Fact and M Law differently. Fourth, the claim that every unreasonable M Fact is really a M Law elides important {{differences between the two}} kinds of mistake. Fifth, various borderline objections, such as the famous Mr. Fact/Mr. Law example, do not undermine the fundamental distinction, although in rare instances, they do constitute genuine counterexamples that do not effectuate the principles and policies that the distinction ordinarily serves; and even here, they are exceptions that prove (the rationale for) the rule. Sixth, specification or evolution of a criminal law norm, such as the criterion for nonconsent in rape law, can convert a legally relevant M Fact into a <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant</b> M Law. This phenomenon does not undermine the fundamental distinction between these types of mistake; to the contrary, it reveals the significance of that distinction...|$|E
40|$|Eventually, all law {{is about}} {{sovereign}} intervention. But public law {{is distinct from}} private law in that intervention is not only subsidiary. And it is distinct from criminal law in that intervention is undertaken with the intention to govern. This explains that taming sovereign powers features prominently in public law theory. In {{the second half of}} the 19 th century, the founding father of German administrative law, Otto Mayer, has developed the control of sovereignty to perfection. In his system, administrative law is all about form. Purpose is <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> The dynastic sovereign of his days was free to choose whatever purposes he deemed fit, provided he strictly respected legal form, and provided he got parliamentary approval whenever he intruded into freedom or property. In the meantime, all the preconditions for this definition of the discipline have disappeared. In Germany, Parliament is no longer the natural opponent of government. The constitution has reacted by material provisions that bind the legislator. The key topic of administrative law is purpose, not form. Administrative reality largely escapes legal formality. The legislator strives for social betterment, very broadly speaking, not just for providing citizens with an institutional framework for their dealings. Against this backdrop, the distinction between form and substance may no longer serve as the borderline between (administrative) law and the social sciences. This article offers an alternative demarcation. As in Otto Mayer's days, all law still is about the exercise of sovereign powers. But it also is about good governance. Both elements must be combined. Due to the first element, administrative law treats the second element in a way that differs from the approach in the social sciences. Specifically, administrative law is unable to precisely define the situation before it starts arguing about social betterment. It must permanently remain open to the unlikely features of the individual case...|$|E
40|$|In {{relation}} to the international personal traffic and tourism there are situations encountered in penal proceedings when defendants are pleading ignorance of the Polish penal law, on top of it, {{in some cases the}} ignorance is also fostered by different socio-cultural conditions, system of moral norms and ethical values. According to the ancient Roman principle everyone, including also aliens, must know the penal law, thus ignorance of the law cannot be treated as a circumstance precluding a penal responsibility. Yet, the aliens find themselves in much worse situations then the (locals, a question thus anises whether they could be offered more „priviledged" treatment {{in the context of the}} „ignorantia iuris nocet" principle. Art. 24 par. 2 of the Penal Code proclaims that ignorance of illegality of act cannot preclude penal responsibility under condition that a perpetrator was able to avoid his error. If he was able to avoid his ignorance as to illegality, and committed an intentional offence, then the court may apply the extraordinary mitigation of they of the penalty (par. 3). If an allien-defendant explains committing his unlawful act by a custom adopted in his home society the Polish courts cannot take it as a circumstance excluding penal responsibility in principle, nor as mitigating it- contrary to the British jurisdictions, according to which a court may renounce of inflicting a punishment. The effect of ignorance of the law exhibited by aliens ought to be discussed against the background of the division of offences into: mala in są and mala prohibita.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{literature}} revolving around the role of non-state actors in the international law-making process. The starting point {{of this article is}} that, although informal international law-making may not be legally binding, it would be unwise to dismiss it as <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> Informal law-making can be relevant with respect to conceptualising and applying existing law as well as guiding future regulation. The present discussion is placed in the context of cyberspace and, more specifically, the Internet standardisation bodies’ informal law-making functions when creating Internet protocols (by setting Internet standards). The article addresses the legitimacy and the ongoing work of the Internet Advisory Board and Internet Engineering Task Force in setting Internet standards with the aim to protect Internet users from mass surveillance and serious threats to privacy online. The article makes two main arguments. First, the effective protection of online privacy cannot be understood only in terms of compliance with legal frameworks but that – in practice - it also needs to be secured through technological means. Second, in the area of online privacy informal law-making and international law converge in a distinctive way. Internet standards should not necessarily be seen as “living a parallel life” to law or as displacing or merely complementing the law. Technical standards and international law can actively inform one another and converge in their application. The analysis explores the implications of the Internet’s technical features to policy-making and legal reasoning by discussing state and judicial practice. The article demonstrates how the technical perspective on privacy informs and enriches {{the manner in which the}} legal advisor argues about privacy, the legislator articulates the interests at stake and the judge and practitioner interpret and apply international human rights law...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the French Civil code, the German Civil code {{belongs to}} the group of {{so-called}} anti-causalistic codifications, since it explicitly does not govern the issue of purpose (cause) of contract. Due to this very reason, the delineation between abstract and causal juridical acts gains special importance in German law. The German Civil Code governs a number of juridical acts and other acts of legal importance that are abstract in their nature. Among them the abstract nature of the promise to fulfill an obligation (Schuldversprechung) and the acknowledgement of a debt (Schuldannerkennung) is traditionally considered the most prominent. However, the relation to the purpose for which they are concluded is not entirely interrupted, since in the case of frustration of their purpose, any asset given to the other party is subject to restitution under the rules of unjustified enrichment. The fact that the issue of purpose of contract is not explicitly governed in the German Civil Code, does not lead to the conclusion, though, that it is <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> It gains legal relevance in two different aspects: as a licit and as an illicit purpose. On the one hand, juridical acts concluded with the aim to achieve illicit purposes are considered void, for which the Code's sections on the general confines of the principle of freedom of contract serve the statutory basis - such juridical acts infringe the institution of 'good customs' (gute Sitten), usually referred to as public policy, while the performance of other factual or legal acts in order to achieve illicit purposes are sanctioned under the rules of unjustified enrichment. On the other hand, lawful purposes of the parties gain legal relevance in relation to a range of various institutions. Concerning some of them the Code itself contains formulations implying the necessity to ascertain the purpose of contract, while in other cases the case law and the doctrine have come to such conclusion. The determination of the purpose of contract in the context of these institutions either secures the fulfilment of the purpose of assumption of contractual obligation of one of the parties or rectifies the consequences of the frustration of the fulfilment of that purpose. In this range surely the most important institutions are the collapse of the basis of transac tion or frustration of purpose (Störung der Geschäftsgrundlage), a special case of discharge of contract due to impossibility, whereby the purpose of contract is realized without the performance of debtor's obligation, a special case of unjustified enrichment due to frustration of the result aimed by the purpose of the transaction and the invalidity of standard business terms that jeopardize the fulfillment of the purpose of contract...|$|E
40|$|This article {{challenges}} the legal rule {{according to which}} the victim’s conduct is irrelevant to {{the determination of the}} perpetrator’s criminal liability. The author attacks this rule from both positive and normative perspectives, and argues that criminal law should incorporate an affirmative defense of comparative liability. This defense would fully or partially exculpate the defendant if the victim by his own acts has lost or reduced his right not to be harmed. Part I tests the descriptive accuracy of the proposition that the perpetrator’s liability does not depend on the conduct of the victim. Criminological and victimological studies strongly suggest that criminal liability may be properly evaluated only {{in the context of the}} victim-perpetrator interaction. Moreover, criminal law itself has a number of doctrines, such as consent, self-defense and (to some degree) provocation, which include victims’ actions in the determination of perpetrators’ liability. Part II makes a normative claim that victims’ actions should reduce or eliminate the perpetrator’s liability in all appropriate cases and not merely in the context of a few distinct defenses. This claim draws on: (a) the just desert principle which requires that individuals be punished only for the amount of harm caused by them and not by the victim himself; (b) the efficiency principle, which requires that, in order to preserve the moral authority of criminal law, penal sanctions should not be overused and the law should develop in a dialogue with community perceptions of right and wrong; (c) the consistency principle, which mandates that punishment-justifying considerations be applied systematically; (d) the analysis of mitigating factors recognized at the penalty stage of a criminal trial; and (e) considerations of fairness underlying the comparative liability reform in torts. Part III proposes a basis for a theory of comparative liability in criminal law and suggests a method that makes it possible to distinguish between cases, in which the victim’s conduct should provide the perpetrator with a complete or partial defense, and cases, in which the victim’s conduct should be <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> The author offers a unitary explanation to the defenses of consent, self-defense and provocation. That explanation lies in the principle of conditionality of rights. Pursuant to this principle, the perpetrator’s liability should be reduced to the extent the victim, by his own acts, has changed the balance of rights between him and the perpetrator. The victim can do that either voluntarily, by waiving a right not to be harmed, or involuntarily, by forfeiting this right as a result of his unjustified attack on some legally recognized rights of the perpetrator. The article concludes with comparative analysis of factors that may affect the determination of the scope of the perpetrator’s liability. These factors include the magnitude of the affected rights of the perpetrator and the victim, the causative impact of their respective conduct, and their personal culpability...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2016. Major: Political Science. Advisor: Timothy Johnson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 139 pages. This dissertation is organized into three chapters. They are all {{centered around the}} theme of whether the law, as a psychological construct, can encourage people to engage in unbiased, neutral decision making. Many empirical accounts of legal actors – both of elites and the mass public – demonstrate that legal decisions are often driven by people’s political beliefs. There is, however, comparatively little empirical scholarship that rigorously tests the mechanisms of legal cognition and whether the law can induce more normatively desirable decision making. My dissertation tackles this {{gap in the literature}} head-on. In the first chapter, I analyze legal decision making in lay people and law students and argue that thinking “like a judge” makes people more open to information that challenges their beliefs and preferences. In three experiments, I test whether a simple legal frame primes subjects to engage in “bottom-up” reasoning and dampens the effects of “top-down” or motivated reasoning. The results consistently indicate that subjects who are asked to think “like a judge” are less driven by their personal preferences than subjects in control groups. I obtain conflicted findings as to whether sophistication moderates that relationship but very strong results suggesting that even small amounts of legal training make subjects much more receptive to legal primes and better able to identify and be persuaded by strong legal arguments. The overall results suggest that the law, as a concept, can motivate people to set aside their personal convictions {{in order to get the}} “right” answer. I explore these findings within the broader literature of social cognition and their implications for political science’s account of judicial behavior. In the second chapter, I conduct an experiment to determine if legal decision making insulates people from pervasive forms of cognitive bias. The first chapter establishes that legal decision making encourages subjects to pursue accuracy goals and to be open to information and arguments that run counter to their personal policy preferences. In this chapter I test whether subjects who are asked to think “like a judge” will be influenced by <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant,</b> affectively charged cues. I find that subjects in the legal treatment are just as influenced by a negative image prime as subjects in the control group, suggesting that while the law can encourage accurate decision making it is not a sufficient condition for engaging in “cool consideration. ” I explore the implications of these findings within the broader literature on social cognition and judicial behavior. In the final chapter, I analyze the psychology of elite decision making and argue that Supreme Court justices engage in similar cognitive processes as the mass public. In particular, I posit that they may be subconsciously influenced by irrelevant information. To test this hypothesis, I track incidents of laughter during oral argument and demonstrate that, while controlling for other politically and strategically relevant variables, this positive but irrelevant stimuli can influence the justices’ votes. While not going so far as to conclude that attorneys should hone their stand-up routines, or that law is what the “judge had for breakfast,” I argue that the persuasive effect of laughter is evidence that the justices engage in a degree of automatic, subconscious processing when deciding on their cases. This serves as preliminary evidence that cognitive processes common to members of the mass public may drive elite behavior as well...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{literature}} revolving around {{the role of}} non-state actors in the international law-making process and, more specifically, {{the question of whether}} processes and products of informal law-making {{should be included in the}} international lawyer’s scope of inquiry. The starting point of this paper is that informal international law-making may not be legally binding but it would be unwise to dismiss it as <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> The discussion is placed in the context of cyberspace and in light of the Internet’s standardisation bodies’ informal law-making functions when creating Internet protocols (via setting Internet standards). The paper argues that in the area of online privacy informal law-making and international law interlock in a distinctive way. Technical (Internet) standards should not necessarily be seen as “living a parallel life” to law or displacing or merely complementing the law. The paper shows how technical standards and international law actively inform one another and converge in their application with a view to protect privacy online. The standard-setting process as well as the technological artifacts (Internet protocols) redefine and reshape the legal concept of privacy and also determine how pertinent international human rights law will be applied and implemented. The discussion is structured into three parts. The first part introduces the important, albeit largely neglected work of the Internet’s technical standardization bodies – the Internet Advisory Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The Internet is regulated and managed by technical standards - the Internet standards - which are developed by private bodies. The design of the network and the Internet protocols by default encapsulate regulation and, hence, international informal law-making is instrumental to how, and to what extent, the individual right to online privacy can be protected. The analysis explains the legal value of the Internet standards from an international informal law-making point of view and assesses the great legitimacy that the standardisation bodies enjoy as the so-called “guardians of the network”. The second part examines the work in progress of these bodies with regard to specifically protecting online privacy. The bodies adopted a series of technical solutions for the effective protection of online privacy. Notably, technical standards are being informed by and, in turn, shape and nurture legal standards. The technical community employs legal definitions and texts in order to comprehend the right to privacy. Conversely, its work on studying the implications of, and dangers posed by, mass surveillance not only assists in understanding the value of online privacy but also provides insights to debated legal questions, such as whether metadata fall within the protective scope of privacy, what constitutes an interference with privacy and how we legally conceptualise privacy harms in the online environment. Finally, the third part makes an account of the contours of the technical standardisation paradigm vis-à-vis formal international law. The confines of both the technical standardisation and the human rights law approaches when standing alone are highlighted. The analysis finds that the Internet standardisation bodies work reinforces the human rights law point of view and provides creative technological solutions to current legal problems. The paper concludes by inviting international lawyers not to dismiss altogether non-formal law but - subject to the context under discussion - to explore its relevancy in conceptualising, applying, implementing and even revising formal law...|$|E
40|$|Copyright largely {{consists}} of alienable rights and correlative duties — rights of exclusion given to individuals, and correlative duties not-to-copy {{imposed on the}} public. This Article argues that such right/duty pairs arise out of authorial creation. A focus on creation is not very popular at the moment; a growing number ofcommentators take the position that copyright is “about” making publishing and other dissemination industries more efficient and stronger. The Article encourages the legal community instead to return to thefocus that the Supreme Court articulated in Feist Publications, namely, that copyright must serve creative authorship rather than noncreative labor. The Article explores history, legal doctrine, and economics to investigate whether Congress may, {{for the purpose of}} aiding publishers and other disseminator industries, impose on the public a set of duties-not-to-copy others’ speech. In Eldred v. Ashcroft and Golan v. Holder, the Court upheld expansions of copyright even in regard to already-created works, relying in part on the possibility that the legislative expansions might incentivize noncreative dissemination. In each case, the contested statutes eliminated what would otherwise have been a public domain status for the works involved. One argument seemed to be that publishers or entertainment companies might repair and reissue more of their stockpiled films, books, or sound recordings, if they owned or could purchase copyright in them, as compared to how many films, etc., the companies would repair and reissue if the works were in the public domain. But there are far more old works in circulation than hidden in basement stockpiles. It may be plausible that statutorily restoring or extending copyrights might generate some additional dissemination of affected works. It is far less plausible, however, to imagine that the increase might ever be large enough to match the increased dissemination that would have resulted from the public having liberties to copy those works. Of even more importance is the issue of relevance: much of the new provisions’ supposed pro-dissemination impact should have been <b>legally</b> <b>irrelevant</b> to the Court. The Article contends that noncreative dissemination provides legitimate grounds for expanding copyright only when the dissemination assists authorial creativity. (So, for example, a new copyright provision might enhance disseminator profit in a manner that also raised the royalties that authors received. Constitutionally speaking, that provision’s only relevant benefits should lie in its ability, if any, to encourage authorial productivity.) An approach that gives more importance than this to dissemination could lead to the one form of copyright ruled out by the Framers, namely, a copyright that lasts forever. In the economic realm, the Article argues, inter alia, that the significance of Arrow’s information paradox for the economics of authorship (as distinguished from its significance in the economics of inventorship) lies not in encouraging disclosure and dissemination but in encouraging creation of new work; that much of the pro-publisher economic argument either boils down to serving authorship or lacks persuasive power; and that the speech-restrictive powers that copyright confers are far less suitable tools for aiding disseminators than would be more conventional forms of Congressional aid. On the doctrinal and historical side, the Article shows how the Court in Golan misunderstood the role that “publication” played in federal law prior to the 1976 Copyright Act; the Article presents a descriptive account of early common law copyright that offers a distinctive explanation for the role of publication in state law; and the Article examines the language of the Constitutional clause that empowers Congress to grant federal copyright in the first place. The Article also offers a new explanation of the so-called “distribution right” that empowers copyright owners to sue anyone who unknowingly sells unauthorized copies. All these phenomena are shown to support the view that creativity constitutes the core of federal copyright. Finally, the Article asks whether its creativity-centered viewpoint can be maintained without contradicting the doctrine (which I have long supported) that some acts of noncreative copying and dissemination legitimately deserve shelter under the “fair use” doctrine...|$|E
