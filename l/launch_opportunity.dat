25|$|Icebreaker Life is a lander {{mission that}} {{proposed}} for NASA's Discovery Program for the 2021 <b>launch</b> <b>opportunity,</b> {{but it was}} not selected for development. It would have had a stationary lander that would be a near copy of the successful 2008 Phoenix and it would have carried an upgraded astrobiology scientific payload, including a 1-meter-long core drill to sample ice-cemented ground in the northern plains to conduct a search for organic molecules and evidence of current or past life on Mars. One of the key goals of the Icebreaker Life mission is to test the hypothesis that the ice-rich ground in the polar regions has significant concentrations of organics due to protection by the ice from oxidants and radiation.|$|E
25|$|The second launch {{attempt on}} 17 June 2009 was also {{scrubbed}} due to hydrogen leak issues {{seen from the}} Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate. Due to conflicts with {{the launch of the}} LRO, and due to a beta angle constraint, the next available <b>launch</b> <b>opportunity</b> was scheduled for 11 July 2009. A successful tanking test for leak checks was performed on 1 July 2009, with modified GUCP seals allowing launch preparations to proceed as scheduled. Because of lightning strikes near the launch pad during the evening of 10 July 2009, NASA scrubbed the launch for the third time and rescheduled for 12 July 2009. Due to a Return To Launch Site (RTLS) weather violation, NASA scrubbed the launch for the fourth time on the evening of 12 July 2009.|$|E

Today, it provides low-cost <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> to students, government, and business. The CubeSat program is able to provide these low-cost <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> by defining a common form factor and design guidelines. All satellites conforming to the regulations are able to be deployed from a standard, flight-proven deployment system called a PPOD. by adhering to the prescribed form factor and safety requirements, necessary documents and export licenses and more easily obtained.

40|$|As {{development}} of CubeSat based architectures increase, methods of deploying constellations of CubeSats {{are required to}} increase functionality of future systems. Given their low cost and quickly increasing <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities,</b> large numbers of CubeSats can easily be developed and deployed in orbit. However, as secondary payloads, CubeSats are severely limited in their options for deployment into appropriate constellation geometries. This thesis examines the current methods for deploying cubes and proposes new and efficient geometries using secondary <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities.</b> Due to the current deployment hardware architecture, only the use of different <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities,</b> deployment direction, and deployment timing for individual cubes in a single launch are explored. The deployed constellations are examined for equal separation of Cubes in a single plane and effectiveness of ground coverage of two regions. The regions examined are a large near-equatorial zone and a medium sized high latitude, high population density zone. Results indicate that simple deployment strategies can be utilized to provide significant CubeSat dispersion to create efficient constellation geometries. The same deployment strategies {{can be used to}} develop a multitude of differently dispersed constellations. Different <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> can be utilized to tailor a constellation for a specific region or mission objective. Constellations can also be augmented using multiple <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> to optimize a constellation towards a specific mission or region. The tools developed to obtain these results {{can also be used to}} perform specific analysis on any region in order to optimize future constellations for other applications...|$|R
40|$|Although {{progress}} {{within the}} Space Technology Community remains constant, {{the dilemma of}} demonstrating critical technologies needed for future Space capabilities still exists. While the U. S. Government has been investing in multiple aspects of space, demonstration of these technologies {{in a manner that}} provides distinct paths to acquisition programs is cursory at best, based on the availability of funding. This paper provides an overview of the Atlas launch vehicle’s role encompassing the past, present and future, in supporting space technology demonstrations. The Atlas program has developed a wide range of capabilities in support of critical space technologies that sustain future war-fighting requirements and science community goals, through the use of secondary payload opportunities on planned Atlas V launches. It is the intent of the authors to 1) describe the secondary <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> provided by the Atlas V vehicle, and 2) describe how utilizing existing <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities,</b> to demonstrate critical space technologies is cost effective and enables future space capabilities to mature in a more timely manner. Secondary payload <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> support the demonstration of both the critical U. S. Government space technologies and also the academic community, to demonstrate technology in a timely manner allowing researchers and students to observe the results of their work prior to graduation. The Lockheed Martin Atlas V Program is working with the U. S. Air Force to establish a routine schedule of launching secondary payloads on missions where sufficient payload margin exists. Multiple mechanisms of providing ride-share opportunities for secondary payloads, both orbital and sub-orbital, will be available each year. The critical decision within the research community is to either take advantage of the low cost, regular <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities,</b> or to wait for a dedicated launch. In today’s financial situation the U. S. Government, industry, and academia require new methods and approaches to maintain the U. S. technological advantage in space. Atlas V Secondary <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> provide such a capability to the space technology community. Utilization of Secondary <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> will accelerate operational space capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Small {{satellites}} {{are used}} throughout the United States to satisfy many experimental and, ever increasingly, operational mission requirements. Unfortunately, the costs of expendable launch vehicles, coupled with insufficient secondary <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities,</b> reduce the cost-effectiveness of delivering small satellites to space. Further, all US government payloads must be launched using US launch vehicles, which limits the affordable <b>launch</b> <b>opportunities</b> available for Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, and other government agency use.
