5|$|April brought further roster {{changes for}} the Hershey Bears, with Joel Rechlicz rejoining the team in {{exchange}} for Matt Clackson, and Stafford being traded for winger Dane Byers. Forward Michael Latta was also traded to Hershey, meaning the team had added seven new players to the roster via trades since January 31. The April trades were intended to add forward speed and depth to the team, but a late NHL trade deadline resulting from the lockout left only nine james to meld the new players into the line-up. After beating Syracuse 4–1 on April 5, Hershey fell into a four-game losing slump that briefly knocked them out of playoff contention. The first of those games, a 2-1 loss against Syracuse at home, drew a season-high attendance of 10,943. However, by April 12, a loss against Providence knocked them into ninth place, and <b>last</b> <b>place</b> in the East Division. Another loss {{the next day to}} Manchester left them tied with the Monarchs for <b>last</b> <b>place</b> at 75 points, a full four points behind Connecticut and Norfolk {{to get back into the}} running for the playoffs.|$|E

Among Sutter's first moves was to acquire goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, whom he had previously coached in San Jose, early in the 2003-04 season.
