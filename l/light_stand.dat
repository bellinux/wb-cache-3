60|$|The whole objection, however, of the immorality {{of poetry}} rests upon a {{misconception}} of {{the manner in}} which poetry acts to produce the moral improvement of man. Ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created, and propounds schemes and proposes examples of civil and domestic life: nor is it for want of admirable doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive, and subjugate one another. But poetry acts in another and diviner manner. It awakens and enlarges the mind itself by rendering it the receptacle of a thousand unapprehended combinations of thought. Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that it represents, and the impersonations clothed in its Elysian <b>light</b> <b>stand</b> thenceforward in the minds of those who have once contemplated them as memorials of that gentle and exalted content which extends itself over all thoughts and actions with which it coexists. The great secret of morals is love; or a going out of our own nature, and an identification of ourselves with the beautiful which exists in thought, action, or person, not our own. A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own. The great instrument of moral good is the imagination; and poetry administers to the effect by acting upon the cause. Poetry enlarges the circumference of the imagination by replenishing it with thought of ever new delight, which have the power of attracting and assimilating to their own nature all other thoughts, and which form new intervals and interstices whose void for ever craves fresh food. Poetry strengthens the faculty which is the organ of the moral nature of man, {{in the same manner as}} exercise strengthens a limb. A poet therefore would do ill to embody his own conceptions of right and wrong, which are usually those of his place and time, in his poetical creations, which participate in neither By this assumption of the inferior office of interpreting the effect in which perhaps after all he might acquit himself but imperfectly, he would resign a glory in a participation in the cause. There was little danger that Homer, or any of the eternal poets should have so far misunderstood themselves as to have abdicated this throne of their widest dominion. Those in whom the poetical faculty, though great, is less intense, as Euripides, Lucan, Tasso, Spenser, have frequently affected a moral aim, and the effect of their poetry is diminished in exact proportion to the degree in which they compel us to advert to this purpose.|$|E

50|$|The {{origins of}} the Christmas pyramids {{date back to the}} Middle Ages. In this period it was {{traditional}} in southern and western Europe to bring evergreen branches, for example boxwood, into the home and hang them in order to ward off moroseness in the dark and cold winter months. In northern and eastern Europe traditional candles were used to achieve this goal. The Christmas pyramid would eventually unify these two traditions and become a symbol of Christmas celebrations. The forerunner of the pyramid was a construction known as a Lichtergestelle (literally: <b>light</b> <b>stand)</b> which were very popular in the 18th century. They were constructions made of four poles, decorated with evergreen boughs, tied together at the top and lit with candles. In the large cities, the Christmas tree, now recognizable all over the world, gradually replaced the Lichtergestelle, but in the mountains, the people did not see a simple tree bedecked with lights, rather they were reminded of the capstans, which were commonly used in the mines of the Ore Mountains. To the pyramid shape was added the spinning motion of the capstan and the earliest Christmas pyramids were born.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A single {{experiment}} shows wave-quantum unity {{for the low}} intensity {{light and}} for moving electrons. Special Relativity & Quantum Theory, the two major current theories of <b>light</b> <b>stand</b> apart because the authors of both were admittingly unclear about the intrinsic wave-quantum unity of light and the medium propagating the light wave in space. In Unified Theory the electromagnetic radiation including light is propagated in the sharmon medium as a wave-quantum UNITY, which appears as Quantum Theory‚Äôs wave-orquantum DUALITY due to experimental limitation to observe {{only one of the}} two and not both at the same time. The Uncertainty Principle is reappraised and rejected as unrealistic. The 0 -spin sharmon-packet energy quantum per unit frequency cycle is propagated along a transverse electromagnetic wave in sharmon medium contiguously via 1 -spin sharmons, which do not physically move but provide a physical carrier. The propagating 1 -spin sharmon returns to its 0 -spin state on transferring the wave energy quantum to the contiguous neighbour in the medium and finally to the target. The 1 -spin photon as such is not emitted, absorbed or propagated. Energized 1 -spin sharmon replaces the 1 -spin photon, which with conventional properties does not exist. The photon-radius is inversel...|$|E
40|$|The {{complementary}} DNA {{strands of}} the nondefective adenovirus 2 (Ad 2) -simian virus 40 (SV 40) hybrid virus, Ad 2 +ND 1, {{were separated by}} isopycnic banding in a CsCl density gradient {{in the presence of}} synthetic polyribonucleotides. Separated strands were used in DNA-RNA hybridization reactions with RNA from cells productively infected by Ad 2 or SV 40, and with complementary SV 40 RNA transcribed asymmetrically in vitro. About five times as much Ad 2 RNA hybridized to the <b>light</b> <b>stand</b> of Ad 2 +ND 1 as to the heavy strand. Complementary RNA and early SV 40 RNA (RNA synthesized before viral DNA replication) had significant homology only with the light strand. Only half as much of a preparation of RNA synthesized before and after viral DNA replication (early-plus-late SV 40 RNA) hybridized to the light strand as to the heavy strand. These results indicate that templates for both late and early SV 40 RNA are present in Ad 2 +ND 1. Therefore, the small SV 40 segment within this virus (10 - 18 % of the SV 40 genome) must contain a transcription-control region. Ad 2 +ND 1 should thus be useful in the selective study of transcription as it occurs in cells infected by the oncogenic virus SV 40...|$|E

40|$|Humankind‚Äôs fascination and {{experimentation}} with light {{is as old}} as the built environment itself. Consciously or unconsciously, architecture and light share a distinctive relationship. This has created rich situations in the past and it can create new ones in the future as well. To address the potential of this relationship in a design thesis, one must realize that there is a crucial difference between an objective description of light and what we perceive. The measure of light can be quantitatively described in luminous flux, radiant energy, or even directionally in relation to time. This way of approaching light produces standard approaches to day-lighting based on design guidelines, energy strategies, and ultimately instrumentalization. This approach is not worthless, however, it diminishes the full significance of light in design. The heterogeneous building requirements of our age cannot be met by standardized ‚Äúone-sized-fits all‚Äù solutions. As a critique and compliment to instrumental day-lighting research, which assess the performance only in terms of quantitative illuminance goals and glare-based discomfort, my thesis attempts to re-establish a fuller understanding of day-lighting. To do this, I look to elevate the experience of light in order to disclose understanding of a different nature. In other words, natural light is a dynamic and ephemeral tool for expressing the qualities of architectural space, forms, and materials. This relationship can underpin architectural thinking as a way to connect the significance of light with the making and inhabitation of spaces. In short, the transformative powers of <b>light</b> <b>stand</b> at the threshold of vision and discovery. By looking carefully at the transformative properties of light in design, we may begin to realize the potential of light in both spatial and temporal variability. It supports our daily activities because we as humans evolved in the cyclical swing of day and night throughout the changes seasons and years. There is also a need for a deeper sensibility for light‚Äôs role in design as it relates to understanding people in their totality. Rather than employing generic and uncritical lighting strategies, we can look at buildings as domains of immaterial energies. To say this differently, by understanding our commodified world driven too frequently by control and optimization, this thesis wonders if the architect can re-animate architecture with a secular-sacred dimension through light. The secular-sacred is an environment that initiates a profound and sensitized encounter of the self in the world. This is an event of singularity, which surpasses the sphere of the everyday by raising up moments and architecturally framed activities. This is a direct challenge to an instrumentalized architecture that fails to sustain the immaterial and ideal totality of our lives...|$|E
