5|$|Interaction between {{nanotubes}} {{or between}} a nanotube and another material may quench or increase PL. No PL is observed in multi-walled carbon nanotubes.

However, DWCNTs produced by encapsulating fullerenes into SWCNTs and annealing show PL only from the outer shells. Isolated SWCNTs <b>lying</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> substrate show extremely weak PL which has been detected in few studies only.
