He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his <b>library</b> <b>classification</b> system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and Subject Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E

From the theoretical perspective, the lack of adherence of LCC to some fundamental canons for building <b>library</b> <b>classifications</b> defined by Ranganathan is also pointed out.

25|$|Metis is a Dewey-free <b>library</b> <b>classification</b> system {{developed}} and implemented in 2011 by Sue Giffard, Tali Balas Kaplan, Jennifer Still, and Andrea Dolloff, the librarians at the Ethical Culture School in New York City. The system places the thinking, interests, information needs and information-seeking behavior of children at its center. It was developed {{as an alternative}} to the Dewey Decimal Classification System and the practices which customarily accompany that system in school and public libraries in the United States: namely, the alphabetical arrangement of fiction by author, and the frequent arrangement of biographies in alphabetical order by biographee. The Metis system (named for Metis the Titan who was the mother of Athena in Greek mythology) was designed to encourage productive independent browsing by children, as well as allowing for successful catalog searching by elementary school students.|$|E

The Beowulf manuscript {{is known as the}} Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is [...] "British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own <b>library</b> <b>classification</b> systems. [...] "Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] translates as: the 15th book from the left on shelf A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{literature}} has approached {{the issue of}} <b>library</b> <b>classification</b> from a queer theory perspective. In her 2013 article [...] "Queering the Catalog: Queer Theory and the Politics of Correction," [...] librarian Emily Drabinski defines the relationship between LGBTQ identity and the library as a historically contingent one. For Drabinski, [...] "there can be no “correct” categorical or linguistic structures, only those that discursively emerge and circulate in a particular context." [...] Drabinski says that a queer approach to cataloging includes reference librarians and users, who can engage in dialogue about underlying biases and help dismantle oppressive language. In a 2014 article, Emily Drabinski, Amber Billey and K.R. Roberto criticized RDA Rule 9.7, which forces catalogers to assign a gender when creating authority records, leaving out non-binary and gender-fluid identities.

40|$|This thesis investigates how {{libraries}} {{can build}} a collection of doujinshi – Japanese fanzines – {{with a focus on}} the problematic connection between doujinshi, queer sexualities and pornography. Yonezawa Yoshihiro Memorial Library {{is one of the few}} libraries collecting and providing access to doujinshi, including those with extreme pornographic imagery. I conducted qualitative interviews with four library employees to study their views and attitudes towards collection, age regulations, shelving and classification of doujinshi. In addition, I apply queer theory to elucidate how sexual norms are reflected in the <b>library's</b> <b>classification</b> system. Findings show that informants consider the preservation of manga culture as the most important reason to collect doujinshi. Other functions of doujinshi, such as being a way for self-expression without social restrains, are also appreciated. Informants’ attitudes towards collecting and providing access to extreme pornographic doujinshi are not particularly negative, instead resisting censorship, but the fact that the library has extreme pornographic doujinshi is taken up as a reason for the library' s age limit. Moreover, I observe sexual norms surrounding women’s consumption of pornography and that women should link sex and love, and a lack of critical perspectives on such issues. Lastly, informants were open for changes of the <b>library’s</b> <b>classification</b> system for doujinshi, but showed reluctance toward user influence, such as social tagging. This is a two years master’s thesis in library and information science...|$|R
