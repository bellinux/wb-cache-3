30|$|Summary. The results fully {{meet the}} {{expectations}} and backup our theoretical analysis. We {{have shown that}} our initial assumptions allow fundamental improvements over previous suggestions. Experiments {{have shown that the}} EHT performs as theoretically expected. This makes the EHT highly predictable and allows easy configuration for target applications. The effects of parameters on counter distribution, bucket <b>load,</b> <b>counter</b> and bucket overflows can easily be predicted. Evaluation shows, which hardware configurations are required for specific parameter sets. The effect of Huffman compression is much harder to predict, since all possible combinations of counter values per word would need to be predicted which is impractical. However, evaluation shows the effect of Huffman compression compared to no compression and simple word-based encoding.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{reversible}} logic {{has considered}} as an efficient computing method having its applications in quantum computing, low power computing, nanotechnology and DNA computing. All of the Boolean functions {{can be implemented}} using reversible gates. In this paper, we propose a reversible 4 -Bit binary counter with parallel load. It has minimum complexity and quantum cost considerably. The proposed circuit is the first attempt of designing a 4 -Bit binary counter with parallel <b>load.</b> <b>Counter</b> is essentially a register that goes through a predetermined sequence of states. The reversible gates in the counter are connected {{in such a way}} as to produce the prescribed sequence of binary states. This counter receives a 4 -Bit data from input and delivers data to D Flip Flop in next cycle. Loading data from input is determined with Load property. The important reversible gates used for our reversible logic synthesis are Feynman gate, Peres gate and Fredkin gate. The proposed circuit becomes a robust design by our optimal method and using these gates. The proposed circuit has minimum number of the garbage outputs and constant inputs in reversible circuit. The proposed circuit is the first attempt and efficient state for a nanometric reversible 4 -Bit binary counter. More complex systems could be constructed using the proposed circuit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The role {{of shock}} wave loading profile is {{investigated}} {{for the failure}} processes in a brittle material. The dynamic damage response of ductile metals has been demonstrated to be critically dependent on the shockwave profile and the stress-state of the shock. Changing from a square to triangular (Taylor) profile with an identical peak compressive stress {{has been reported to}} increase the “spall strength ” by over a factor of two and suppress damage mechanisms. The spall strength of tungsten heavy alloy (WHA) based on plate impact square-wave loading has been extensively reported in the literature. Here a triangular wave loading profile is achieved with a composite flyer plate of graded density in contrast to the square-wave <b>loading.</b> <b>Counter</b> to the strong dependence in wave profile in ductile metals, for WHA, both square and triangle wave profiles the failure is by brittle cleavage fracture with additional energy dissipation through crack branching in the more brittle tungsten particles, largely indistinguishable between wave profiles. The time for crack nucleation is negligible compared to the duration of the experiment and the crack propagation rate is limited to the sound speed as defined by the shock velocity. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relative}} {{contribution of the}} triceps surae and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles to tension development with reference to voluntary plantarflexion at two articular positions of the knee joint (extended and flexed at 90 °) for various inertial loads. Subjects were instructed to perform plantarflexions at various sub-maximal and maximal velocities with no intention of stopping the movement. Whereas in one series of experiments the subjects were informed of the <b>load</b> <b>countering</b> the movement, in the other they were not. The average electromyographic (EMG) activity of the different muscles was recorded. The main results were that with loading: (a) greater maximal plantarflexion velocities were recorded in flexed as compared to extended-knee positions; (b) greater durations and amplitudes of agonist and antagonist EMG bursts were recorded; (c) the co-activation of the TA and triceps surae muscles was enhanced; (d) unexpected sub-maximal loads induced greater EMG activity and speed of movement. It is concluded that increasing the load during plantarflexion in humans brings about changes in neuromuscular strategies {{that contribute to the}} efficiency of contractile activity during rapid movements. The results also indicate that unexpected sub-maximal loading induces a potentiated neuromuscular activity which increases the speed of movement. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Background: Self-myofascial {{release is}} widely used by athletes but the {{scientific}} evidence of its supposedly positive effects is limited. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of foam rolling as a warm-up routine in comparison with a dynamic stretching routine and how it may affect the jumping performance among subjects familiar with weight training. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the acute effect of foam rolling vs. a standardized dynamic stretch warm-up routine on jumping performance. Method: Twelve subjects, mean (SD) age 25. 1 (± 3. 0) years, participated in a randomized, controlled, crossover study. All subjects completed a standardized foam rolling (FR) and a dynamic stretch (DS) warm-up routine on separate days of testing. Squat jump (SJ), counter movement jump (CMJ) and <b>loaded</b> <b>counter</b> movement jump (L-CMJ) all performed bilaterally and unilaterally were conducted to investigate the acute effect of the two warm-up routines. A dependent T-test was used to investigate differences between the warm-up routines. Results: A statistical significant difference in favor of the DS was found for SJ performed bilaterally among males (p = 0. 009). The mean (SD) jumping height for SJ FR was 35. 6 (± 4. 7) cm and for SJ DS 37. 9 (± 5. 2) cm. The male group also improved more in L-CMJ performed on the right leg with an external load of 54 kg after DS compared to FR. No other statistical significant differences were found between the two interventions. A near statistical significant difference was found for SJ performed bilaterally for the total sample (p = 0. 057) also in favor of the DS. The mean (SD) jumping height for SJ FR was 29. 3 (± 8. 7) cm and for SJ DS 30. 5 (± 9. 9) cm. Conclusion: Findings from this study supports a dynamic stretch warm-up routine prior to performing high intensity bilateral plyometrics instead of a foam rolling warm-up routine. However the data was inconsistent and more research with larger sample sizes is needed to further investigate the possible effects of foam rolling as a warm-up routine on jumping performance performed both bilaterally and unilaterally...|$|R

Voltage disturbances especially the voltage sag and swell are the most common power quality problems due to increased use of a large numbers of sophisticated and sensitive electronic equipment in industrial systems.

It is a series connected power electronic based device that can quickly mitigate the voltage sags in the system and restore the load voltage to the pre-fault value.
