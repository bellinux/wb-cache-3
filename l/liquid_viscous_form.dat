50|$|PCBs is in <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> at normal {{temperature}} {{and has a}} poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability.

The {{internal}} structure is complex, {{consisting of a}} mass of curled or folded fibre embedded in a viscid matrix which is in turn surrounded by a less viscous layer. This results in the low viscosity liquid flowing past the moth's scales to reach the cuticle below, while the more <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>forms</b> a bond to the thread to sustain the moth's weight. The folded thread inside the ball permits elastic elongations which extend the spider's striking range.|$|R

50|$|RUTFs are a “homogeneous {{mixture of}} lipid-rich and {{water-soluble}} foods.” The lipids used in formulating RUTFs {{are in a}} <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>form.</b> The other ingredients are in small particles and are mixed through the lipid. The other ingredients are protein, carbohydrate, vitamins and minerals. The mixture needs to be homogeneous {{for it to be}} effectively consumed. To do this, a specific mixing process is needed. The fat/lipid component of the RUTF is heated and stirred first. The heat should be maintained for the lipid to remain in the optimum form for mixing in the other ingredients. The powdered protein, carbohydrate, and vitamins and minerals are then slowly and gradually added to the lipid, while the lipid is being vigorously stirred. After all the ingredients are added and vigorous stirring is maintained, the mixture is then stirred with more speed and for several minutes. If the powdered ingredients have a particle size that is larger than 200 µm, the mixture starts to separate; the particle size needs to be maintained at less than 200 µm.|$|R
40|$|When {{a bubble}} of air {{rises to the}} top of a highly <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid,</b> it <b>forms</b> a {{dome-shaped}} protuberance on the free surface. Unlike a soap bubble, it bursts so slowly as to collapse under its own weight simultaneously, and folds into a striking wavy structure. This rippling effect occurs in fact for both elastic and viscous sheets, and a theory for its onset is formulated. The growth of the corrugation is governed by the competition between gravitational and bending (shearing) forces and is exhibited for a range of densities, stiffnesses (viscosities), and sizes – a result which arises less from dynamics than from geometry, suggesting a wide validity. A quantitative expression for the number of ripples is presented, together with experimental results which are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. 1 Every day, nature surprises us with structures and patterns of such beauty as to fill the scientist with wonder and the artist with envy.

After freeze-drying process, dry cell biomass for each sample were measured and recorded. Dried cell pellets were grinded until they gained the powder form and then transferred to falcon tubes. For the lipid extraction process, n-hexane solution (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to samples in 6 : 1 ratio (v/w). The cells were sonicated (three bursts of 20  s each) for further disruption of the samples. Then, falcon tubes were placed on a shaker at 150  rpm and incubated for 6  h at 27  °C.

40|$|Background. Postoperative peritoneal adhesions (PPAs) are an unsolved {{and serious}} problem in {{abdominal}} surgery. Method. <b>Viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> of soybean oil, octyl methoxycinnamate, flax oil, aloe vera gel, and glycerol were used in five experiments, using the same methodology for each. Liquids were applied in the peritoneal cavity before and after mechanical peritoneal trauma. Results were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Results. Compared with the control group, macroscopic and microscopic adhesion values before (P <. 001) and after (P <. 05) application of <b>viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> significantly reduced PPAs. Values were significantly lower when liquids were applied before rather than after peritoneal trauma (P <. 0001). Discussion. <b>Viscous</b> <b>liquids</b> injected into the peritoneal cavity before or after mechanical peritoneal trauma decrease PPA. Injection before trauma was more effective than after trauma. In surgical practice, PPA formation may be prevented or decreased by covering the peritoneal cavity with an appropriate <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> before abdominal surgery...|$|R

40|$|A major {{environmental}} problem in food, feed, and biodiesel industries {{is how to}} deal with their oily byproducts and wastes, which are in oily and <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> <b>form</b> and easy to be rancid. There are many food, feed and biofuel processing plants in the US, which produce million tons of the oily byproducts and waste every year. The oily wastes are usually disposed onto or into land, which causes environmental pollution. Another way is to use heat and separate the wastes into low-value fat materials in paste form for feed applications. Unfortunately the process is not cost effective and does not cover the processing costs. Also the paste fat materials need to be heated into low-viscosity liquid before the applications, which need more energy to be used. Manufacturers prefer to dispose these wastes as a low cost method, which is not a long-term solution both practically and environmentally. We have developed two novel encapsulated processes to encapsulate the non-polar materials in liquid and oily form and to convert into the dry fat products in non-oily and free-flowing form and {{to increase the number of}} applications for such as (1) fat energy products in solid form for dairy, pork, poultry and aquaculture feeds; (2) a binder for heating processes and (3) a stabilizer in plastic product production. The fat products in solid form are easily handled, delivered and applied with significantly added value. If the proposed methodology is used for the industries to convert the oily wastes into the solid fat products, this would resolve above problem and add more than hundred millions/year. Our research and scale up were done. We filed patent applications after demonstrating the feasibility of the technologies. Then commercialization was done with related manufacturer and customers. Now our facility in MO produces the value-added product in dry non-oily and free-flowing form from the oily materials in liquid form for resolving the problems and economic development.

5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid.</b> Typically, this <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|R

The growth of the bubble in the <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> {{is assumed to be}} controlled by momentum, heat and mass transfer. Using the integral method, the transport equations were transformed into ordinary differential equations, which were numerically solved. An analytical criterion of when it is justified to make the usual isothermal assumption is also derived. The relevance of this work to the processes of polymer melt devolatilization and the production of foamed plastics is discussed...|$|R
