40|$|This {{paper has}} three parts. First, we compile a new industry-by-industry data {{set of the}} Japanese economy in which {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) stocks are explicitly estimated and <b>labor</b> <b>inputs</b> are disaggregated with respect to age and education. Second, we investigate the effect of ICT on various <b>labor</b> <b>inputs</b> and discern for which <b>labor</b> <b>inputs</b> ICT is able to substitute. Third, we estimate the contribution of capital stocks, including ICT, and various <b>labor</b> <b>inputs</b> to the value-added growth of the Japanese economy in the 1980 s and 1990 s and explore the factors that determine technological progress. We find ICT capital stocks are an important substitute for young workers with low education levels. These results strongly suggest that ICT investment is {{an effective way to}} counter the prospective shortage of young workers in Japan. In contrast, we find no compelling evidence of productivity-enhancing ICT externality. On the contrary, our results suggest that ICT has a negative indirect effect on productivity. The past technological and managerial strengths of Japanese firms, which have been based on workers' learning by doing in the workplace, may no longer be advantages as knowledge management systems improve and become easily transferred across international borders.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} among patient characteristics, <b>labor</b> <b>inputs,</b> and improvement in glycosylated hemoglobin (A 1 C) level in a successful primary care-based diabetes disease management program (DDMP). STUDY DESIGN: We performed subanalyses to examine {{the relationships among}} patient characteristics, <b>labor</b> <b>inputs,</b> and improvement in A 1 C level within a randomized controlled trial. Control patients received usual care, while intervention patients received usual care plus a comprehensive DDMP. METHODS: The primary outcome was improvement in A 1 C level over 12 months stratified by intervention status and patient characteristics. Process outcomes included the number of actions or contacts with patients, time spent with patients, and number of glucose medication titrations or additions. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-three of 217 enrolled patients (88. 9 %) had complete 12 -month followup data. Patients in the intervention group had significantly greater improvement in A 1 C level {{than the control group}} (- 2. 1 % vs - 1. 2 %, P =. 007). In multivariate analysis, no significant differences were observed in improvement in A 1 C level when stratified by age, race/ethnicity, income, or insurance status, and no interaction effect was observed between any covariate and intervention status. Among intervention patients, we observed similar <b>labor</b> <b>inputs</b> regardless of age, race/ethnicity, sex, education, or whether goal A 1 C level was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Among intervention patients in a successful DDMP, improvement in A 1 C level was achieved regardless of age, race/ethnicity, sex, income, education, or insurance status. <b>Labor</b> <b>inputs</b> were similar regardless of age, race/ethnicity, sex, or education and may reflect the nondiscriminatory nature of providing algorithm-based disease management care...|$|R
