Each station has a number of component parts that assemble into the product. The goal is to complete as many jobs as possible during the allotted time. Students are assigned positions (operator, scheduler, material-handler, production control, inspector, or accountant) and perform tasks per work orders and routing slips associated with each job according to the parts list and prototypes provided. Operational problems are expected, and students must face them as they arise. Afterward, students answer questions about their experience and observations.

40|$|Mass {{customization}} production {{increases the}} difficulty of the production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning. The material distribution process for variety of parts is very complex, which greatly increases the cost of material handling and logistics. In response to this problem, this paper presents an approach of production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning based on complexity measurement. Firstly, by analyzing the influencing factors of equipment layout, the complexity model of production line is established by using information entropy theory. Then, the cost of the part logistics is derived considering different variety of parts. Furthermore, the function of optimization including two objectives of the lowest cost, and the least configuration complexity is built. Finally, the validity of the function is verified in a case study. The results show that the proposed approach may find the layout scheme with the lowest logistics cost and the least complexity. Optimized production <b>line</b> <b>layout</b> planning can effectively improve production efficiency and equipment utilization with lowest cost and complexity...|$|R

5000|$|When {{trying to}} {{document}} a layout with exact geometry one quickly notices {{that a lot}} of layouts one builds with real track do not work using a CAD system or some track layout program. This is due to the so-called [...] "vario system" [...] which allows some play when joining the tracks, so that with some wiggling around one can make <b>layouts</b> <b>line</b> up perfectly with no danger of derailing trains which do not use the exact geometry of the pieces. This is achieved by making the pegs somewhat smaller than the holes. Sometimes the round part of the hole is not an exact circle but rather an ellipse, allowing the tracks to connect with a small gap between them. Also, the neck gap does not have a sharp edge {{at the end of the}} track, but is carved round. This may have started as a production loss or to make it easier for small children to join the tracks. Some sources state that Eichhorn was the first to design connections using this system.|$|R
