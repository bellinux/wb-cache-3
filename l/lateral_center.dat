50|$|The {{engine exhaust}} is {{turned back to}} the {{longitudinal}} axis by a curved composite tailpipe. A composite tailpipe was to help get the gun recoil reaction closer to the aircraft <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of gravity (CG) location, the gun is sub-merged as deeply as practical into {{the right side of the}} fuselage. Also, the fuselage is not centered about the aircraft centerline, but is offset to the left by three inches. This results in the firing barrel of the gun being only about 18 inches from the lateral CG. This minimizes the yaw movement caused by the recoil of the gun.|$|E
50|$|In {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, lateral {{balance is}} often much less critical than fore-aft balance, simply because most {{mass in the}} aircraft is located very close to its center. An exception is fuel, which may be loaded into the wings, but since fuel loads are usually symmetrical about the axis of the aircraft, lateral balance is not usually affected. The <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of gravity may become important if the fuel is not loaded evenly into tanks {{on both sides of}} the aircraft, or (in the case of small aircraft) when passengers are predominantly on one side of the aircraft (such as a pilot flying alone in a small aircraft). Small lateral deviations of CG that are within limits may cause an annoying roll tendency that pilots must compensate for, but they are not dangerous as long as the CG remains within limits for the duration of the flight.|$|E

40|$|An {{extremely}} accurate {{method for}} {{the measurement of}} mass and the <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of mass of a spacecraft has been developed. The method was needed for the Voyager spacecraft mission requirement which limited the uncertainty in the knowledge of <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of mass of the spacecraft system weighing 750 kg {{to be less than}} 1. 0 mm (0. 04 in.). The method consists of using three load cells symmetrically located at 120 deg apart on a turntable with respect to the vertical axis of the spacecraft and making six measurements for each load cell. These six measurements are taken by cyclic rotations of the load cell turntable and of the spacecraft, about the vertical axis of the measurement fixture. This method eliminates all alignment, leveling, and load cell calibration errors for the <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of mass determination, and permits a statistical best fit of the measurement data. An associated data reduction computer program called MASCM has been written to implement this method and has been used for the Voyager spacecraft...|$|E

50|$|The {{colloidal}} probes {{are normally}} fabricated by gluing a colloidal particle to a tip-less cantilever with a micromanipulator in air. The subsequent rewetting of the probe {{may lead to}} the formation of nanosized bubbles on the probe surface. This problem can be avoided by attaching the colloidal particles under wet conditions in AFM fluid cell to appropriately functionalized cantilevers. While the colloidal probe technique is mostly utilized in the sphere-plane geometry, it can be also used in the sphere-sphere geometry. The latter geometry further requires a <b>lateral</b> <b>centering</b> of the two particles, which can be either achieved with an optical microscope or an AFM scan. The results obtained in these two different geometries can be related with the Derjaguin approximation.|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to study the}} distribution of loading over thick wings of various types. The unloading on the wing was determined by taking the pressure {{at a number of}} holes on both the upper and lower surfaces of a model wing in the wind tunnel. The results from these tests show, first, that the distribution of pressure over a thick wing of uniform section is very little different from that over a thin wing; second, that wings tapering either in chord or thickness have the <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of pressure, as would be expected, slightly nearer the center of the wings; and, third, that wings tapering in plan form and with a section everywhere proportional to the center section may be considered to have a loading at any point which is proportional to the chord when compared to a wing with a similar constant section. These tests confirm the belief that wings tapering both in thickness and plan form are of considerable structural value because the <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of pressure is thereby moved {{toward the center of the}} span...|$|E

40|$|A {{method of}} modifying {{existing}} correction factors of lifting-surface theory to account approximately {{for the effects}} of sweep was derived, and these factors were applied to existing lifting-line theories for the lift and damping in roll of swept wings.

The equation for lift is expressed entirely in terms of the geometric characteristics of the wing and the section-lift-curve; the necessity for any charts is thereby eliminated. The equation for the damping in roll, however, requires a chart for the determination of the effective <b>lateral</b> <b>center</b> of pressure for rolling moment due to rolling.
