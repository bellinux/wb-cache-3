40|$|In the future, the bio-geomorphological {{functioning}} of lowland floodplains {{is likely to}} be altered at an increasing pace. Together with increasing socio-economic demands, climatic changes are expected to increase the pressures on lowland rivers in developed countries. To cope with these pressures, integrated management plans have been developed for riverine areas across Australia, North America, and Europe (Brierley and Freyirs, 2008; Klijn et al., 2008). The choice and design of the measures proposed in these plans depends on the choices made in the decision making process, which in turn is strongly influenced by the value systems of the stakeholders. Planning of <b>landscaping</b> <b>measures</b> requires a long time horizon - decades to centuries - as the implementation is time-consuming and costly. Planning, therefore, involves scenario analysis to determine the feasibility and effects of potential <b>landscaping</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The multi-attribute choice evaluation method is presented here with an emphasis on the usefulness of this technique for evaluating a good such as the rural landscape.

40|$|Players of coevolutionary games may update {{not only}} their {{strategies}} but also their networks of interaction. Based on interpreting the payoff of players as fitness, dynamic landscape models are proposed. The modeling procedure is carried out for Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) and Snowdrift (SD) games that both use either birth [...] death (BD) or death [...] birth (DB) strategy updating. The main focus is on using dynamic fitness landscapes as a mathematical model of coevolutionary game dynamics. Hence, an alternative tool for analyzing coevolutionary games becomes available, and <b>landscape</b> <b>measures</b> such as modality, ruggedness and information content can be computed and analyzed. In addition, fixation properties of the games and quantifiers characterizing the interaction networks are calculated numerically. Relations are established between landscape properties expressed by <b>landscape</b> <b>measures</b> and quantifiers of coevolutionary game dynamics such as fixation probabilities, fixation times and network properties.

This poster reports the results achieved assessing biodiversity using landscape structural indicators. The main objective was to identify the <b>landscape</b> <b>measures</b> having a greater influence on the presence of avian communities in agrosystems located around Évora (South of Portugal). Birds were sampled along transects representing the different land use patterns occurring within the study area. Land use types/vegetation cover were mapped within buffers around those transects. The landscape indicators applied to each buffer are Shannon & Weaver’s Diversity Index (H’) (1962) for habitats biodiversity, Modified Simpson’s Index (E) (Romme & Knigth, 1982) for habitats heterogeneity, and organization pattern (D 1) (O’Neill et al. 1988). Avian diversity was also measured using the Simpson’s index. ArcView software was used to map the land cover features and to calculate the values for the selected indices.

40|$|Land cover maps provide {{essential}} {{input data}} for various hydromorphological and ecological models, {{but the effect}} of land cover classification errors on these models has not been quantified systematically. This paper presents the uncertainty in hydromorphological and ecological model output for a large lowland river depending on the classification accuracy (CA) of a land cover map. Using four different models, we quantified the uncertainty for the three distributaries of the Rhine River in The Netherlands with respect to: (1) hydrodynamics (WAQUA model), (2) annual average suspended sediment deposition (SEDIFLUX model), (3) ecotoxicological hazards of contaminated sediment for a bird of prey, and (4) floodplain importance for desired habitat types and species (BIO-SAFE model). We carried out two Monte Carlo (n = 15) analyses: one at a 69 % land cover CA, the other at 95 % CA. Subsequently we ran all four models with the 30 realizations as input. The error in the current land cover map gave an uncertainty in design water levels of up to 19 cm. Overbank sediment deposition varied up to 100 % in the area bordering the main channel, but when aggregated to the whole study area, the variation in sediment trapping efficiency was negligible. The ecotoxicological hazards, represented by the fraction of Little Owl habitat with potential cadmium exposure levels exceeding a corresponding toxicity threshold of 148 μg d− 1, varied between 54 and 60 %, aggregated over the distributaries. The 68 % confidence interval of floodplain importance for protected and endangered species varied between 10 and 15 %. Increasing the classification accuracy to 95 % significantly lowered the uncertainty of all models applied. Compared to <b>landscaping</b> <b>measures,</b> the effects due to the uncertainty in the land cover map are of the same order of magnitude.

40|$|Functional and aesthetical {{evaluation}} of landscape {{was used in}} the framework of Project QF 4061 Landscape Plan of a Microregion in connection with the proposal of <b>landscape</b> <b>measures</b> to be taken in an important watercourse. As a part of the project the methodology of functional and aesthetical {{evaluation of}} landscape was defined as a method of landscape spatial planning. The methodology consists in the creation of landscape “matrix” as a landscape network of a definite size. The criteria of evaluation of the particular squares of this landscape matrix were defined in the framework of methodology. The defined criteria are not invariable, but they are always related with the type of landscape to be evaluated. By the attribution of scores according to the defined criteria to the particular squares of landscape matrix these squares may be compared in a simple way. Such evaluation provides some categories of the aesthetic value of landscape that define the functional and aesthetic landscape spaces. Applying the result of this evaluation and other knowledge of the landscape we will get a more comprehensive view on landscape. The functional and aesthetic evaluation of landscape may substantially contribute to the more complex understanding of a given territory in which <b>landscape</b> <b>measures</b> are to be proposed in subsequent project documentation.

In an interview with agricultural entrepreneurs will be questions aimed at comprehensive land adjustment in general, on the proposed land adjustment and their willingness to embrace change. Of obtained responses by the interviewed subjects, we can state that depends only and only on the interests of farmers and sophistication of man, what is the view of the problems of land adjustment. Unfortunately, {{it is well known that}} the farmers of these arrangements often look very negatively. Comprehensive land adjustments complicate their work, but they are necessary; therefore, to look for tools those farmers attitudes have changed.

40|$|The {{methods for}} <b>measuring</b> <b>landscape</b> {{connectivity}} {{have never been}} compared or tested for their responses to habitat fragmentation. We simulated movement, mortality and boundary reactions across {{a wide range of}} land-scape structures to analyze the response of <b>landscape</b> connectivity <b>measures</b> to habitat fragmentation. <b>Landscape</b> connectivity was <b>measured</b> as either dispersal success or search time, based on immigration into all habitat patches in the <b>landscape.</b> Both <b>measures</b> indicated higher connectivity in more fragmented landscapes, a potential for problematic conclusions for conservation plans. We introduce cell immigration as a new <b>measure</b> for <b>landscape</b> connectivity. Cell immigration is the rate of immigration into equal-sized habitat cells in the landscape. It includes both within- and between-patch movement, and shows a negative response to habitat fragmentation. This complies with intuition and existing theoretical work. This method for measuring connectivity is highly robust to reductions in sample size (i. e., number of habitat cells included in the estimate), and we hypothesize that it therefore should be amenable to use in empirical studies. The connectivity measures were weakly correlated to each other and are therefore generally not comparable. We also tested immigration into a single patch as an index of connectivity by comparing it to cell immigration over the landscape. This is essentially a comparison between patch-scale and landscape-scale measurement, and revealed some potential for patch immigration to predict connectivity at the landscape scale. However, this relationship depends {{on the size of the}} single patch, the dispersal characteristics of the species, and the amount of habitat in the landscape. We conclude that the response of connectivity measures to habitat fragmentation should be understood before deriving conclusions for conservation management...|$|R

30|$|We {{provided}} {{an overview of}} several recent results obtained for dopant-atom transistors in which dopants are introduced by thermal-diffusion doping in nanoscale-channels of SOI-FETs. We presented direct observations of dopant-induced potential <b>landscapes</b> <b>measured</b> using a KPFM technique, which show how individual P-donors or “clusters” of closely-placed P-donors modulate the channel potential. Electrical characteristics measured at low temperature reveal that transport occurs in these devices by single-electron tunneling mechanism. The nature of the QD is basically controlled by doping concentration and channel design. Generally, in low-concentration regime, single-electron tunneling via single P-donors is the usual transport mechanism. In the high-concentration regime, tunneling transport occurs through QDs formed by “clusters” of several P-donors located close to each other, inducing a molecular-like energy spectrum. Access to these different regimes of inter-dopant interaction {{is a first step}} toward designing and implementing practical applications that utilize systems of one or multiple dopant-atoms. This approach can provide insights into functionalities arising from atomic and, respectively, molecular systems built into the conventional Si-based electronics platform.|$|R

We find that while this measure may correctly predict the degree of evolvability of a landscape, this does not necessarily correlate with the difficulty of problems. Some landscapes may show, for example, limited evolvability and yet be easy to solve because either solutions are already present in the initial population or the computational resources provided exceed evolvability obstacles.
