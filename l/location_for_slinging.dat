40|$|Purpose: Mid {{urethral}} slings {{are becoming}} the first line surgical treatment for stress urinary incontinence in women. We reviewed the complications of mid urethral sling placement and their potential pathophysiology. Materials and Methods: We conducted a literature search on MEDLINE from 1995 to 2007 using the key words sling, complications, mid-urethral slings, transvaginal tape, transobturator tape, trials, pathophysiology and complications. The Cochrane database was also searched. The results were summarized according {{to the type of}} mid urethral slings reported. Results: There were 928 MEDLINE citations <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> and complications, 279 <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> and complications and bladder, and 68 <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> and complications and voiding dysfunction. The reported complication rates ranged from 4. 3 % to 75. 1 % for retropubic and 10. 5 % to 31. 3 % for transobturator mid urethral slings. Complica-tions included bladder perforation, hemorrhage, bowel injury, vaginal extrusion, de novo urgency and urge incontinence, urinary tract infections and voiding dysfunction. Retropubic mid urethral slings led to a higher occurrence of complications such as bladder perforation and hematoma. In addition, the retropubic approach resulted in serious complications such as bowel injury, major vascular injury and death. Groin pain was more common after the transobturator approach. Experimental studies indicated that the potential mechanisms <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> complications may include vaginal dissection, denervation injury and bladder remodeling...|$|R

Webbing <b>for</b> <b>slings,</b> also known as tape, is sold off the reel, cut to length with a hot knife to prevent fraying, and tied as desired with a water knot.|$|R

50|$|Although lead is {{a common}} metal, its {{discovery}} had relatively little impact in the ancient world. It is too soft {{to be used for}} structural elements or weapons, {{except for the fact that}} it is exceptionally dense, making it ideal <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> projectiles. However, being easy to cast and shape, it came to be extensively used in the classical world of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome for piping and storage of water. It was also used as a mortar in stone buildings.|$|R

25|$|The staff sling has {{a similar}} or {{superior}} range to the shepherd's sling, and can be as accurate in practiced hands. It is generally suited for heavier missiles and siege situations as staff slings can achieve very steep trajectories <b>for</b> <b>slinging</b> over obstacles such as castle walls. The staff itself can become a close combat weapon in a melee. The staff sling can throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc than a hand sling. Staff slings were in use well into the age of gunpowder as grenade launchers, and were used in ship-to-ship combat to throw incendiaries.|$|R
50|$|Blasters {{are part}} of the Slugslinger's basic gear needed <b>for</b> <b>slinging</b> slugs. Blasters are used to shoot Slugs with enough force for them to reach {{velocity}} and transform. Blasters can be customized with accessories to enhance the blaster's or the slinger's performance, although most slingers stick with the basic components of their chosen model and let the Slugs do the work. Blasters can be temporarily disabled, permanently damaged or destroyed by slug attacks, misfire or improper blaster modifications. Even without a blaster, it is still possible for the slug to reach velocity using historical methods such as catapults or slingshots.|$|R

50|$|The 110 BA {{comes with}} a Magpul Industries PRS-G3 stock. The stock is {{considered}} a precision Rifle/Sniper stock. The stock includes an adjustable length of pull and an adjustable cheek rest for customization to the operator's requirements. The adjustments are achieved via rotating dials that incrementally move the butt plate and cheek rest respectively back and forth or up and down. The stock features a rubber recoil pad with an aluminum core for reduced fatigue and stainless steel adjustment shafts for corrosion resistance. Molded from nylon reinforced polymer. The stock includes an adapter <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> mounting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stock is}} made of Rynite. [...] Barrel length is 20 inches and weight is 4.5 pounds. The rifle has an {{integral}} scope mount rail.

Ramline briefly produced 25 round magazines for the Viper, but the rifle's introduction was only months before the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and the model 522 was dropped before the ban sunset in 2004. The stock did not include provision <b>for</b> <b>sling</b> mounts; these had to be added by the owner or a gunsmith.|$|R

There still remained a touch of anxiety caused by the recent fight on both countenances. It was dispelled, however, by a few words from Whitewing, who directed the younger woman to prepare for instant flight. She acted with prompt, unquestioning obedience, and at the same time the Indian went to work to pack up his goods with all speech.
