The machine delivers a proton beam of 0. 5 mA time-averaged current at a repetition rate of 30 Hz. The accelerator is designed to have radiation levels that allow hands-on-maintenance. However, the high beam intensity causes strong space charge fields whose effects may lead to particle loss and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>instabilities.</b> The space charge fields modify the particle distribution, distort the stable bucket area and reduce the rf linear restoring force.

50|$|The rushed {{introduction}} to service of poorly tested aircraft happened previously with another Tupolev project that had high political visibility and prestige: the Tu-104 passenger jet liner {{that was the}} first successful passenger jet airliner in service (the de Havilland Comet 1 was not considered successful because four of the original nine aircraft crashed). In a decision-making similar to the Tu-144 story, the Soviet government introduced the Tu-104 into passenger service before satisfactory stability and controllability had been achieved. During high-altitude and high-speed flight the aircraft was prone to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>instability,</b> and also at high altitudes, it had a narrow range of angle of attack separating the aircraft from stalls known as Coffin corner (aerodynamics).

40|$|Obtaining the {{shortest}} possible bunch length {{in combination with}} the smallest transverse emittances and highest bunch intensity â this is the wish list of the proton-bunch driven, plasma wakefield acceleration experiment AWAKE currently under feasibility study at CERN. A few measurement sessions were conducted to determine the achievable bunch properties and their reproducibility. To obtain a short bunch length, the bunches were rotated in longitudinal phase space using the maximum available RF voltage prior to extraction. Measurements were carried out in two optics with different transition energies. The main performance limitation is <b>longitudinal</b> beam <b>instability</b> that develops during the acceleration ramp. With lower transition energy, beam stability is improved, but the bucket area is smaller for the same voltage.

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{could also}} become unstable in flight if its {{center of gravity}} shifted due to improper cargo loading. This <b>longitudinal</b> <b>instability</b> arose from the aircraft's hasty conversion from bomber to cargo transport. Unlike a normal cargo transport, which was designed from the start with a contiguous cargo compartment with a safety margin for fore-and-aft loading variations, the bomb racks and bomb bays built into the B-24 design were fixed in position, greatly limiting the aircraft's ability to tolerate improper loading. This problem was exacerbated by wartime exigencies {{and the failure of}} USAAF Air Transport Command to instruct loadmasters in the C-87's peculiarities. The design's roots as a bomber are also considered culpable for frequently collapsing nosegear; its strength was adequate for an aircraft that dropped its payload in flight before landing on a well-maintained runway, but it proved marginal for an aircraft making repeated hard landings on rugged unimproved airstrips while heavily loaded.|$|E
50|$|Picking {{up where}} Lilienthal left off, Octave Chanute took up {{aircraft}} design after an early retirement, and funded {{the development of}} several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs many times at Miller Beach, Indiana, eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented his work and also photographed it, and was busy corresponding with like-minded researchers around the world. Chanute was particularly interested in solving the problem of aerodynamic instability of the aircraft in flight, which birds compensate for by instant corrections, but which humans would have to address either with stabilizing and control surfaces or by moving {{the center of gravity}} of the aircraft, as Lilienthal did. The most disconcerting problem was <b>longitudinal</b> <b>instability</b> (divergence), because as the angle of attack of a wing increases, the center of pressure moves forward and makes the angle increase yet more. Without immediate correction, the craft will pitch up and stall. Much more difficult to understand was the relationship between lateral and directional control.|$|E

50|$|On November 11, 1944, Republic {{received}} {{an order for}} three prototypes of the new XP-84. Since the design promised superior performance to the P-80 Shooting Star and Republic had extensive experience in building single-seat fighters, no competition was held for the contract. The name Thunderjet was chosen to continue the Republic Aviation tradition started with the P-47 while emphasizing the new method of propulsion. On January 4, 1945, even before the aircraft took to the air, the USAAF expanded its order to 25 service test YP-84A and 75 production P-84B (later modified to 15 YP-84A and 85 P-84B). Meanwhile, wind tunnel testing by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics revealed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>instability</b> and buckling of stabilizer skin at high speeds.

40|$|In the SPS {{spectrum}} {{measurements of}} very long single bunches {{were used in}} the past to identify sources of <b>longitudinal</b> microwave <b>instability.</b> Shielding of the identified objects significantly improved the beam stability.

Recently the same measurement technique was used again, revealing a strong high frequency resonance. During the slow de-bunching with the RF switched off, the presence of different resonant impedances leads to a line density modulation at the resonant frequencies. Longitudinal profiles of bunches of various intensities were acquired. For sufficiently high intensities their spectra show a fast growing and strong modulation at 1. 4 GHz. Measurements using two transverse optics with different transition energy are compared. Reproducing the measurements with numerical simulations, including the known SPS longitudinal impedances, allowed the parameter range of this unknown source to be determined.
