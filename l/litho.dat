5|$|By {{the fall}} of 1844, Thayer left the {{lithography}} business {{and was replaced by}} John Bufford, a lithographer who worked for Thayer in Boston from 1939 through 1844. Previously, from 1835 through 1839, Bufford owned his own firm in New York under the title Bufford Lithographer. By the end of 1844 through 1851, the Boston company name was changed to J. H. Bufford & Co. The next, third edition, listed Bufford Lithographer so the third edition must have been printed after the beginning of {{the fall of}} 1844 but before the end of 1844. J. H. Bufford & Co. printed other Ives' games but this third edition of Ives' The Mansion Of Happiness is the only Ives' game to list Bufford Lithographer. Green was again used on one of the <b>litho</b> stones but the end space was a green circle. The other <b>litho</b> stone printed black.|$|E
5|$|In Thayer's second print run, in 1844, he {{used the}} same <b>litho</b> stones as used in the first edition. Green was used instead of goldish brown and the endspace {{remained}} an octagon. By September 24, 1844, between 3000 and 4000 of the Thayer printed games were sold by its publishers, W. &. S.B. Ives.|$|E
5|$|Yet another Thayer printrun {{was needed}} in early 1853. Thayer {{was about to}} leave his Boston {{business}} for the final time, but finished the job for the Ives firm. This sixth edition resulted from another need to redraw the green printing <b>litho</b> stone. Green was removed from the banner and corners, and, only the blank spaces were printed in green.|$|E
5|$|When Thayer left, his brother-in-law, S. W. Chandler {{took over}} the {{business}} in late 1853. so a seventh edition was needed {{by the beginning of}} 1854. Two new <b>litho</b> stones were made. Chandler printed black using one stone and green with the other. The endspace was changed back to a green circle. There are at least two known copies of the Chandler edition, one was owned by deceased game historian Lee Dennis. Another is owned by a charter member of The American Game Collectors Association.|$|E
5|$|For {{its fifth}} album, Pearl Jam again worked with {{producer}} Brendan O'Brien, whom the band {{had worked with}} on its previous three records. Yield was recorded throughout 1997 in Seattle, Washington at Studio X and Studio <b>Litho,</b> the latter of {{which is owned by}} guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album would be the last collaboration with O'Brien for several years. They would not work with the producer again until he was brought on board in 2008 to remix their debut album Ten and to produce 2009's Backspacer.|$|E
5|$|The first 8 {{issues of}} Lobster are A5 paper size (148 × 210mm) format, growing to A4 (210 × 297mm) from Issue 9 in September 1985. The {{magazine}} was originally typewritten, reduced on a photocopier, pasted-up and printed on a Gestetner off-set <b>litho</b> duplicating machine. Around issue 17, {{the magazine was}} type-set on an Amstrad PCW using Wordstream and from Lobster 27, on an AppleMac with Claris Works. Lobster Issue 57 (Summer 2009) was the last hard copy issue. Issue 58 (Winter 2009/2010) was the first available without charge. The magazine is published from Ramsay's home in Hull.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one <b>litho</b> stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock. Because the paper of 1840's through 1890's included a lavish amount of fiber, often taken from mummy wrappings, it would not fade or decompose like the wood pulp paper used today. The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown. Like Laurie and Whittles game, Thayer used an octagonal end space.|$|E
5|$|Yield is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on February 3, 1998. Following a short promotional tour for its previous album, No Code (1996), Pearl Jam recorded Yield throughout 1997 at Studio <b>Litho</b> and Studio X in Seattle, Washington. The album was proclaimed as {{a return to the}} band's early, straightforward rock sound, and marked a more collaborative effort from the band as opposed to relying heavily on frontman Eddie Vedder to compose the songs. The lyrics deal with contemplative themes, albeit seen in a more positive manner compared to the band's earlier work.|$|E
5|$|William and Stephen Bradshaw Ives {{dissolved}} their partnership on April 24, 1854. William {{then put}} {{most of his}} time managing his newspaper, The Salem Observer. Stephen Bradshaw held the copyrights for the games and started a fancy goods importing business in Boston while overseeing the Salem business owned by a partnership of his youngest son, Henry P. Ives, and Henry's partner, Augustus Smith at the same business location. A new Mansion Of Happiness print run was needed but Chandler was no longer in business, With control of the copyright, the Ives family chose lithographer F.F. Oakleys. Consequently, Ives and Smith could sell The Mansion Of Happiness in Salem but had no right to the copyright. F. F. Oakleys needed to two new <b>litho</b> stones so the eighth edition was created. One stone was used to print black and the other to print green. The circle endspace was retained. In addition to continue publishing The Mansion of Happiness, H. P. Ives and A. A. Weeks published at least two new games: Experts and Tournament & Knighthood.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, Vic Greenhouse, {{head of the}} art {{department}} at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) invited King to join the group of printmakers, which included Fred Williams and Hertha Kluge-Pott, who were allowed to use its printing facilities on one day per week. The following year (1962), RMIT bought a lithography press. King {{was one of the}} few able to use it. From then on King concentrated on producing lithographs and creative monotypes. In 1965, he acquired a small off-set <b>litho</b> press (12 ins x 15 ins or about 30.5 x 38.1cm) for his studio at Warrandyte. Although this press was “a bit on the small side”, by designing for its limitations King could make larger prints. Some years later, he acquired a larger press which “gave him scope to wield a longer, wider brush-mark on the lithographic plate”.|$|E
25|$|Concord grew in {{prominence}} {{throughout the}} 18th century, {{and some of}} its earliest houses survive at the northern end of Main Street. In the years following the Revolution, Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a canal and lock system to allow vessels passage around the Amoskeag Falls downriver, connecting Concord with Boston by way of the Middlesex Canal. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government. The 1819 State House is the oldest capitol in the nation in which the state's legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for furniture-making and granite quarrying. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form Abbot and Downing. Their most famous coach was the Concord Coach, modeled after the coronation coach of King George III. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the railroad industry, with Penacook a textile manufacturing center using water power from the Contoocook River. Today, the city is a center for health care and several insurance companies. It is also home to Concord <b>Litho,</b> one of the largest independently owned commercial printing companies in the country.|$|E
500|$|Thayer then {{returned}} to his business in 1847. Ives needed another print run of The Mansion Of Happiness that year. So Thayer needed two new <b>litho</b> stones, resulting in the fourth edition. Thayer again printed one color in black and one color in green and changed the endspace back to a green octagon. The entire game board looked different from his first two print runs. Thayer's first and second edition <b>litho</b> stones were either no longer usable or ground down and redrawn for other lithographs. On the new [...] "black printing" [...] <b>litho</b> stone the position of [...] "Thayer and Company Lithographers" [...] was moved. The new [...] "green printing" [...] <b>litho</b> stone not only included green printing for unnamed spaces but also for corner decorations and to highlight {{the beginning of the}} banner.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{recording}} sessions {{took place}} from November 1995 to February 1996 at Studio <b>Litho</b> and Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington. Studio <b>Litho</b> {{is owned by}} Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. The band members produced the album themselves. On the choice of not working with a producer, frontman Chris Cornell said that [...] "a fifth guy is too many cooks and convolutes everything. It has to go down too many mental roads, which dilutes it." [...] Drummer Matt Cameron added that while working with Michael Beinhorn in Superunknown had good results, it was [...] "a little more of a struggle than it needed to be", and self-production would make the process go faster. Adam Kasper, who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on Superunknown, worked with the band as a production collaborator and mixed the album.|$|E
500|$|Another Thayer edition {{was needed}} between 1847 and 1853, so {{splitting}} the difference results in 1850. We {{know this because}} the lithography {{is different from the}} 1847 edition. The [...] "green printing" [...] <b>litho</b> stone had apparently been damaged or over used so the green printing {{at the beginning of the}} banner was removed.|$|E
500|$|Binaural was {{recorded}} in late 1999 and early 2000 in Seattle, Washington at Studio <b>Litho,</b> {{which is owned by}} guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was initially mixed at Sunset Sound Factory in Los Angeles, California with Blake; however, the band proved to be dissatisfied with how the mixes turned out. According to McCready, Blake's work complemented the slower tracks such as [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] well, but faced trouble with others, which the band wanted to sound heavier. For the heavier songs, the group brought in former producer O'Brien, who remixed the tracks at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. It was with O'Brien that the band determined the final sequencing of the album.|$|E
500|$|For {{its fourth}} album, Pearl Jam again worked with {{producer}} Brendan O'Brien, {{with whom they}} had worked on predecessors Vs. (1993) and Vitalogy (1994). No Code was the band's first album with drummer Jack Irons, who had joined the band as Vitalogy was being completed. Following the summer U.S. leg of the band's Vitalogy Tour, the band began work on No Code in Chicago, Illinois in July 1995 during the infamous Chicago heat wave. The Chicago sessions lasted {{a week at the}} Chicago Recording Company. During a break in a string of make-up dates for the 1995 tour the band went into the studio for a week-long session in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the band recorded [...] "Off He Goes". The rest of the recording took place {{in the first half of}} 1996 in Seattle, Washington at Studio <b>Litho,</b> which is owned by guitarist Stone Gossard. The album was then mixed by O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Work on {{the album}} began in July 1995. The band took a break to perform at festivals in Europe, where new {{material}} was road-tested. Afterward, the band did more songwriting {{for about a month}} and then recorded most of the album at Studio <b>Litho.</b> The overall approach to songwriting was less collaborative than with past efforts, with the individual band members having brought in most of the songs more completely written. The band sought to try things it had not done before and to use a greater variety of material. The band tried to create a live atmosphere for the album, and looked to leave in sounds that producers would normally try to clean up, such as feedback and out-of-tune guitar parts. The overall time spent working {{on the album}} was less than what the band had spent working on Superunknown. Cornell described the album-making process as [...] "way faster and way easier".|$|E
2500|$|... {{owner of}} Loosegroove Records, Gossard opened his own {{recording}} studio, the prestigious Studio <b>Litho,</b> in Seattle. Most of Gossard's production work {{was based in}} this studio, which still operates today, with Gossard as the owner.

2500|$|Until the 1970s, {{the rail}} yard area was {{generally}} industrial. The area {{was home to}} a printing plant for The New York Times between 1959 and 1975, as well as ABC television studios. At the same time, public housing extended to West End Avenue (across {{the street from the}} printing plant and the TV studios), and the Lincoln Towers redevelopment project extended to the rail yard boundary along Freedom Place. In 1962, the railroad proposed a partnership with the Amalgamated Lithographers Union to build a mixed-use development with 5,300 apartments, <b>Litho</b> City, on a platform over the tracks, with landfill in the Hudson River added for parks and docking facilities. <b>Litho</b> City was conceived as the centerpiece of a grandiose [...] "master plan" [...] for the entire Lincoln Square area.
