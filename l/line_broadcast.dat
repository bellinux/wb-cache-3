50|$|From the 1940s onward, {{improvements}} in technology allowed the US {{and the rest}} of Europe to adopt systems using progressively more bandwidth to scan higher line counts, and achieve better pictures. However the fundamentals of interlaced scanning were at the heart of all of these systems. The US adopted the 525 line system known as NTSC, Europe adopted the 625 line system, and the UK switched from its 405 line system to 625 to avoid having to develop a unique method of color TV. France switched from its unique 819 line system to the more European standard of 625. Although the term PAL is often used to describe the line and frame standard of the TV system, this is in fact incorrect and refers only to the method of superimposing the colour information on the standard 625 <b>line</b> <b>broadcast.</b> The French adopted their own SECAM system, which was also adopted by some other countries, notably Russia and its satellites. PAL has been used on some otherwise NTSC broadcasts notably in Brazil.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBroadcasting is {{the process}} of {{transmitting}} information from an originating node (processor) in a network to all other nodes in the network. A local broadcast scheme only allows a node to send information along single communication links to adjacent nodes, while a <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme allows nodes to use paths of several communication links to call distant nodes. The minimum time possible for broadcasting in a network of n nodes when no node is involved in more than one communication at any given time is ⌊ log n⌋ phases. Local broadcasting is not sufficient, in general, for broadcasting to be completed in minimum time; line broadcasting is always sufficient. An optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> is a minimum-time broadcast that uses the smallest possible total number of communication links. In this paper, we give a complete characterization of optimal line broadcasting in cycles, and we develop efficient methods for constructing optimal <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> schemes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractUnder {{the line}} {{communication}} protocol, calls {{can be placed}} between pairs of non-adjacent sites over a path of lines connecting them; only one call can utilize a line at any time. This paper addresses questions regarding the cumulative cost, i. e., sum of lengths of calls, of broadcasting under the line protocol in path networks. Let Pn be the path with n vertices, and Cn be {{the cost of an}} optimal, <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from a terminal vertex in path Pn. We show that a minimum-cost <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> scheme from any source vertex in Pn has cost no more than Cn and no less than Cn − n + 2 for any n ⩾ 2 and any time t > [log 2 n]. We derive a closed-form expression for the minimum cost of a minimum-time <b>line</b> <b>broadcast</b> from a terminal vertex in certain paths and relate this to costs from nearby sources...|$|E
40|$|P systems {{provide a}} {{computational}} model {{based on the}} structure and interaction of living cells [9]. A P system consists of a hierarchical nesting of cell-like membranes, which can be visualized as a rooted tree. Although the P systems are computationally complete, many real world models, e. g., from socio-economic systems, databases, operating systems, distributed systems, seem to require more expressive power than provided by tree structures. Many such systems have a primary tree-like structure completed with shared or secondary communication channels. Modeling these as tree-based systems, while theoretically possible, is not very appealing, because it typically needs artificial extensions that introduce additional complexities, nonexistent in the originals. In this paper we propose and define a new model that combines structure and flexibility, called hyperdag P systems, in short, hP systems, which extend the definition of conventional P systems, by allowing dags, interpreted as hypergraphs, instead of trees, as models for the membrane structure. We investigate the relation between our hP systems and neural P systems. Despite using an apparently less powerful structure, i. e., a dag instead of a general graph, we argue that hP systems have essentially the same computational power as tissue and neural P systems. We argue that hP systems offer a structured approach to membrane-based modeling that is often closer to the behavior and underlying structure of the modeled objects. Additionally, we enable dynamical changes of the rewriting modes (e. g., to alternate between determinism and parallelism) and of the transfer modes (e. g., the switch between unicast or broadcast). In contrast, classical P systems, both tree and graph based P systems, seem {{to focus on a}} statical approach. We support our view with a simple but realistic example, inspired from computer networking, modeled as a hP system with a shared communication <b>line</b> (<b>broadcast</b> channel). In Part B of this paper we will explore this model further and support it with a more extensive set of examples...|$|E
