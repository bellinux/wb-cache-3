40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} {{network reach}} and customer base of next-generation time and wavelength division multiplexed PON (TWDM-PONs) have necessitated rapid fault detection and subsequent restoration {{of services to}} its users. However, direct application of existing solutions for conventional PONs to TWDM-PONs is unsuitable as these schemes rely on the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> of upstream transmissions to trigger protection switching. As TWDM-PONs are required to potentially use sleep/doze mode optical network units (ONU), the loss of upstream transmission from a sleeping or dozing ONU could erroneously trigger protection switching. Further, TWDM-PONs require its monitoring modules for fiber/device fault detection {{to be more sensitive}} than those typically deployed in conventional PONs. To address the above issues, three survivable architectures that are compliant with TWDM-PON specifications are presented in this work. These architectures combine rapid detection and protection switching against multipoint failure, and most importantly do not rely on upstream transmissions for LOS activation. Survivability analyses as well as evaluations of the additional costs incurred to achieve survivability are performed and compared to the unprotected TWDM-PON. Network parameters that impact the maximum achievable network reach, maximum split ratio, connection availability, fault impact, and the incremental reliability costs for each proposed survivable architecture are highlighted...|$|E

The TLK 2701 supports an effective serial interface speed of 1. 6 Gbps to 2. 7 Gbps, providing up to 2. 16 Gbps of data bandwidth. The primary application of this chip is to provide very high-speed I/O data channels for point-to-point baseband data transmission over controlled impedance media of approximately 50 Ω. The transmission media can be printed-circuit board, copper cables, or fiber-optic cable. The maximum rate and distance of data transfer is dependent upon the attenuation characteristics of the media and the noise coupling to the environment. This device can also be used to replace parallel data transmission architectures by providing a reduction in the number of traces, connector terminals, and transmit/receive terminals. Parallel data loaded into the transmitter is delivered to the receiver over a serial channel, which can be a coaxial copper cable, a controlled impedance backplane, or an optical link. It is then reconstructed into its original parallel format. It offers significant power and cost savings over current solutions, as well as scalability for higher data rate in the future. The TLK 2701 performs data conversion parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel. The clock extraction function...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-recurrent {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve (NRLN) {{is a rare}} anatomical variant with {{a reported}} incidence of 0. 6 - 1. 3 %. It carries {{a higher risk of}} palsy during thyroid surgery. Its detection is mandatory in order to avoid such complication. METHODS: Systematic intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) was carried out for 806 consecutive nerve at risk (NAR) patients in two centers (Lille and Varese). In 402 patients surgery to the right side was performed with IONM. The IONM of the inferior laryngeal nerve (ILN) was conducted as recommended by international guidelines (V 1 /R 1 /V 2 /R 2). RESULTS: A NRLN was detected in 11 of 402 NAR (2. 7 %). In the first center (Lille) the incidence of NRLN was 6. 0 % (7 / 117). No <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> was reported in this group of patients. Postoperative laryngoscopy was normal in all patients with NRLN. CONCLUSIONS: The true incidence of NRLN may be higher than expected. Neurophysiology helps the surgeon to better understand the anatomy and function of nervous structures. Intraoperative neuromonitoring is a useful tool that should be systematically implemented in thyroid surgery to better understand the anatomy and physiology of the inferior laryngeal nerve. Its use may allow the surgeon to decrease the incidence of nerve palsy especially in case of NRLN. The IONM adjunct does not add significantly to the costs for thyroid surgery...|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{electromyography}} (EMG) recording methods were reported during intraoperative neural monitoring (IONM) of recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in thyroid surgery. This study compared two surface recording methods that {{were obtained by}} electrodes on endotracheal tube (ET) and thyroid cartilage (TC). This study analyzed 205 RLNs at risk in 110 patients undergoing monitored thyroidectomy. Each patient was intubated with an EMG ET during general anesthesia. A pair of single needle electrode was inserted obliquely into the TC lamina on each side. Standard IONM procedure was routinely followed, and EMG signals recorded by the ET and TC electrodes at each step were compared. In all nerves, evoked laryngeal EMG signals were reliably recorded by the ET and TC electrodes, and showed the same typical waveform and latency. The EMG signals recorded by the TC electrodes showed significantly higher amplitudes and stability compared to those by the ET electrodes. Both recording methods accurately detected 7 partial <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> and 2 complete LOS events caused by traction stress, but only the ET electrodes falsely detected 3 LOS events caused by ET displacement during surgical manipulation. Two patients with true complete LOS experienced temporary RLN palsy postoperatively. Neither permanent RLN palsy, nor complications from ET or TC electrodes were encountered in this study. Both electrodes are effective and reliable for recording laryngeal EMG signals during monitored thyroidectomy. Compared to ET electrodes, TC electrodes obtain higher and more stable EMG signals as well as fewer false EMG results during IONM...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDuring {{conventional}} intermittent intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) in thyroidectomy, recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) {{injury is}} detected by an electromyographic (EMG) <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> after the nerve dissection. Exclusive continuous monitoring during {{the phase of}} RLN dissection may be helpful in detecting adverse EMG changes earlier. A total of 208 RLNs at risk were enrolled in this study. Standardized IONM procedures were followed. We continuously stimulated the RLN at the lower exposed end with a stimulator to exclusively monitor the real-time quantitative EMG change during RLN dissection. Once the amplitude decreased by more than 50 % of the initial signal, the surgical maneuver was paused and the RLN was retested every minute for 10  minutes to determine amplitude recovery before restarting the dissection. The procedure was feasible in all patients. No LOS was encountered in this study. Nineteen RLNs had an amplitude reduction of more than 50 %. Eighteen nerves showed gradual amplitude recovery (16 nerves had a traction injury and two nerves had a compression injury). After 10  minutes, the recovery was complete (i. e., > 90 %) in eight nerves, 70 – 90 % in seven nerves, and 50 – 70 % in three nerves. Among these 18 nerves, only one nerve developed temporary vocal palsy because it was exposed to unavoidable repeated nerve traction after restarting the dissection. Another nerve showed no gradual recovery from thermal injury, and developed temporary vocal palsy. The temporary and permanent palsy rates were 1 % and 0 %, respectively. During intermittent IONM, exclusive real-time monitoring of the RLN during dissection is an effective procedure to detect an adverse EMG change, and prevent severe RLN injuries that cause LOS...|$|E
40|$|Background Operative {{traction}} of {{the thyroid}} lobe {{is a necessary}} component of thyroid surgery. This surgical maneuver can cause traction injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), and this complication {{has been reported to}} be the most common mechanism of nerve injury. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the electromyographic (EMG) signal pattern during an acute RLN traction injury and establish reliable strategies to prevent the injury using intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM). Methods Fifteen piglets (30 RLNs) underwent IONM via automated periodic vagal nerve stimulation and had their EMG tracings recorded and correlated with various models of nerve injury. Results In the pilot study, a progressive, partial EMG loss was observed under RLN tractions with different tension (n = 8). The changes in amplitudes were more marked and consistent than were the changes in latency. The EMG gradually gained partial recovery after the traction was relieved. Among the nerves injured with electrothermal (n = 4), clamping (n = 1), and transection (n = 1) models, the EMG showed immediate partial or complete loss, and no gradual EMG recovery was observed. Another 16 RLNs were used to investigate the potential of EMG recovery after different extents of RLN traction. We noted the EMG showed nearly full recovery if the traction stress was relieved before the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS),</b> but the recovery was worse if prolonged or repeated traction was applied. The mean restored amplitudes after the traction was relieved before, during, and after the LOS were 98 ± 3 % (n = 6), 36 ± 4 % (n = 4), and 15 ± 2 % (n = 6), respectively. Conclusion RLN traction injury showed graded, partial EMG changes; early release of the traction before the EMG has degraded to LOS offers a good chance of EMG recovery. IONM can be used as a tool for the early detection of adverse EMG changes that may alert surgeons to correct certain maneuvers immediately to prevent irreversible nerve injury during the thyroid operation...|$|E
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) in predicting postoperative nerve function during thyroid surgery and its consequent ability to assist the surgeon in intraoperative decision making. Materials and methods A total of 2365 consecutive patients were submitted to thyroidectomy by the same surgical team. Group A included 1356 patients (2712 nerves at risk) in whom IONM was utilized, and Group B included 1009 patients (2018 nerves at risk) in whom IONM was not utilized. Results In Group A, <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> was observed in 37 patients; there were 29 true positive, 1317 true negative, 8 false positive, and 2 false negative cases. Accuracy was 99. 3 %, positive predictive value was 78. 4 %, negative predictive value was 99. 8 %, sensitivity was 93. 6 %, and specificity was 99. 4 %. A total of 29 (2. 1 %) cases of unilateral paralysis were observed, 23 (1. 7 %) of which were transient and 6 (0. 4 %) of which were permanent. Bilateral palsy was observed in two (0. 1 %) cases requiring a tracheostomy. In Group A, 31 (2. 3 %) injuries were observed, 25 (1. 8 %) of which were transient and 6 (0. 4 %) of which were permanent. In Group B, 26 (2. 6 %) unilateral paralysis cases were observed, 20 (2 %) of which were transient and 6 (0. 6 %) of which were permanent; bilateral palsy was observed in 2 (0. 2 %) cases. In Group B, 28 (2. 8 %) injuries were observed, 21 (2. 1 %) of which were transient and 7 (0. 7 %) of which were permanent. Differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. Conclusions Our results show that IONM has a very high sensitivity and negative predictive value, but also good specificity and positive predictive value. For these reasons, in selected patients with LOS, the surgical strategy should be reconsidered. However, patients need to be informed preoperatively about potential strategy changes during the planned bilateral surgery. Future larger and multicenter studies are needed to confirm the benefits of this therapeutic strategy...|$|E

40|$|The {{in-flight}} exercise test {{performed by}} cosmonauts {{as part of}} the Russian Exercise Countermeasure Program is limited to 5 minutes due to communication restrictions. During a recent graded exercise test on a U. S. Shuttle flight, the test was terminated early due to an upcoming <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> with the ground. This exercise test was a traditional test where the subject's exercise capacity dictates the length of the test. For example, one crew member may take 15 minutes to complete the test, while another may take 18 minutes. The traditional exercise test limits the flight schedulers to large blocks of space flight time in order to provide medical and research personnel information on the fitness capacity (maximal oxygen uptake: VO 2 max) of crew members during flight. A graded exercise test that would take a finite amount of time and a set preparation and recovery time would ease this problem by allowing flight schedulers to plan exercise tests in advance of LOS. The Graded Universal Testing System (GUTS) was designed to meet this goal. Fitness testing of astronauts before and after flight provides pertinent data on many variables. The Detailed Supplemental Objective (DSO 608) protocol (6) is one of the graded exercise tests (GXT) currently used in astronaut testing before and after flight. Test times for this protocol have lasted from 11 to 18 minutes. Anaerobic capacity is an important variable that is currently not being evaluated before and after flight. Recent reports (1, 2, 5) from the literature have suggested that the oxygen deficit at supramaximal exercise is a measure of anaerobic capacity. We postulated that the oxygen deficit at maximal exercise would be an indication of anaerobic capacity. If this postulate can be accepted, then the efficiency of acquiring data from a graded exercise test would increase at least twofold. To examine this hypothesis anaerobic capacity was measured using a modified treadmill test (3, 4) designed to exhaust the anaerobic systems in approximately 45 to 75 seconds. Lactate concentration in the blood was analyzed after all tests, since lactate is the end-product of anaerobic energy production. Therefore, the peak lactate response is an additional indication of anaerobic capacity. A preliminary comparison of the GUTS and the DSO 608 suggests that the GUTS protocol would increase the efficiency of VO 2 max testing of astronauts before and after flight. Results for anaerobic capacity have not been tabulated...|$|E
40|$|As the International Space Station (ISS) {{has moved}} into a {{utilization}} phase, operations have shifted to become more ground-based with fewer mission control personnel monitoring and commanding multiple ISS systems. This shift to fewer people monitoring more systems has prompted use of semi-autonomous console tools in the ISS Mission Control Center (MCC) to help flight controllers command and monitor the ISS. These console tools perform routine operational procedures while keeping the human operator "in the loop" to monitor and intervene when off-nominal events arise. Two such tools, the Pre-positioned Load (PPL) Loader and Automatic Operators Recorder Manager (AutoORM), are used by the ISS Communications RF Onboard Networks Utilization Specialist (CRONUS) flight control position. CRONUS is responsible for simultaneously commanding and monitoring the ISS Command & Data Handling (C&DH) and Communications and Tracking (C&T) systems. PPL Loader is used to uplink small pieces of frequently changed software data tables, called PPLs, to ISS computers to support different ISS operations. In order to uplink a PPL, a data load command must be built that contains multiple user-input fields. Next, a multiple step commanding and verification procedure must be performed to enable an onboard computer for software uplink, uplink the PPL, verify the PPL has incorporated correctly, and disable the computer for software uplink. PPL Loader provides different levels of automation in both building and uplinking these commands. In its manual mode, PPL Loader automatically builds the PPL data load commands but allows the flight controller to verify and save the commands for future uplink. In its auto mode, PPL Loader automatically builds the PPL data load commands for flight controller verification, but automatically performs the PPL uplink procedure by sending commands and performing verification checks while notifying CRONUS of procedure step completion. If an off-nominal condition occurs during procedure execution, PPL Loader notifies CRONUS through popup messages, allowing CRONUS to examine the situation and choose an option of how PPL loader should proceed with the procedure. The use of PPL Loader to perform frequent, routine PPL uplinks offloads CRONUS to better monitor two ISS systems. It also reduces procedure performance time and decreases risk of command errors. AutoORM identifies ISS communication outage periods and builds commands to lock, playback, and unlock ISS Operations Recorder files. Operation Recorder files are circular buffer files of continually recorded ISS telemetry data. Sections of these files can be locked from further writing, be played back to capture telemetry data that occurred during an ISS <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>signal</b> (<b>LOS)</b> period, and then be unlocked for future recording use. Downlinked Operation Recorder files are used by mission support teams for data analysis, especially if failures occur during LOS. The commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files are encompassed in three different operational procedures and contain multiple user-input fields. AutoORM provides different levels of automation for building and uplinking the commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files. In its automatic mode, AutoORM automatically detects ISS LOS periods, then generates and uplinks the commands to lock, playback, and unlock Operations Recorder files when MCC regains signal with ISS. AutoORM also features semi-autonomous and manual modes which integrate CRONUS more into the command verification and uplink process. AutoORMs ability to automatically detect ISS LOS periods and build the necessary commands to preserve, playback, and release recorded telemetry data greatly offloads CRONUS to perform more high-level cognitive tasks, such as mission planning and anomaly troubleshooting. Additionally, since Operations Recorder commands contain numerical time input fields which are tedious for a human to manually build, AutoORM's ability to automatically build commands reduces operational command errors. PPL Loader and AutoORM demonstrate principles of semi-autonomous operational tools that will benefit future space mission operations. Both tools employ different levels of automation to perform simple and routine procedures, thereby offloading human operators to perform higher-level cognitive tasks. Because both tools provide procedure execution status and highlight off-nominal indications, the flight controller is able to intervene during procedure execution if needed. Semi-autonomous tools and systems that can perform routine procedures, yet keep human operators informed of execution, will be essential in future long-duration missions where the onboard crew will be solely responsible for spacecraft monitoring and control...|$|E
