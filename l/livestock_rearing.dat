5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, dairying is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, <b>livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E

25|$|<b>Livestock</b> <b>rearing</b> isn't a major {{occupation}} in Barbados, chiefly because good pasture {{has always been}} scarce & imported animal feed is expensive.The island must import large quantities of meat and dairy products. Most livestock is owned by individual households. Estimates for 1999 showed 23,000 head of cattle, 41,000 sheep, 33,000 hogs, 5,000 goats, and 4,000,000 chickens. Poultry production in 1999 included 9,000 tons of meat and 1,000 tons of hen eggs. Apart from self-sufficiency in milk and poultry, the limited agricultural sector means that Barbados imports large amounts of basic foods, including wheat and meat.|$|E
25|$|In 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service {{was set up}} {{to supply}} {{agricultural}} advice and information. The Hill Farming Act of 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The Act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act of 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the <b>Livestock</b> <b>Rearing</b> Act of March 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.|$|E

Gaseous fuels may be derived from municipal and industrial landfills (landfill gas) or from animal manure and solid biomass such as crop silage or the organic fraction of MSW (biogas). Both landfill gas and biogas are generated via anaerobic digestion, a multi-stage process whereby bacteria convert carbohydrates, fats, and proteins to methane (Evans 2001).

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 - 30 years European {{livestock}} farming and the {{spatial distribution of}} livestock across Europe have been largely shaped by reforms of the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Generally, for the coming years a decrease in livestock numbers is expected in regions that are characterized by high livestock densities. To this regards, most studies examined the influence of CAP changes at a regional level while literature encompassing {{a broader range of}} European regions is still scarce.

Karnataka, an Indian state lying in its Southern peninsular agro-ecological zone, has sheep as a socio-economically important <b>livestock</b> <b>reared</b> primarily as a source of mutton in rural areas. The state enjoys tropical monsoon type climate and hosts four well adapted sheep breeds viz. Bellary, Kenguri, Hassan and Mandya.

30|$|For the {{purposes}} of disease control, particularly foot-and-mouth disease which remains endemic in wild buffalo, Botswana is dissected by a network of veterinary cordon fences which divide the land into four: an export zone, buffer zone, vaccination/surveillance zone and a wildlife/foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) zone. Within these zones over 80 % of <b>livestock</b> <b>reared</b> for the commercial sector are grazed on communal land (Darkoh and Mbaiwa 2002). The remaining cattle are reared on fenced tribal lands (tribal grazing lands policy, TGLP) or freehold farms, with the privatised land of the latter covering a meagre 6 % of the country's total land area (Ndzinge et al. 1984). Elsewhere in southern Africa (Namibia, South Africa and formally Zimbabwe) a dualistic system exists whereby disease control, market infrastructure and support is focussed on the privatised ranching sector enclosed and protected from diseases endemic in communal areas by veterinary cordon fences (Scoones and Wolmer 2006).|$|R
40|$|In West Africa, crop-livestock {{mixed farming}} is {{emerging}} from the currently predominant nomadic pastoralism and agropastoralism. It is hypothesized that competitiveness between crop and livestock enterprises {{may be an important}} determinant of the pace of this evolution. A field study in the derived savanna of Southwest Nigeria shows that at the current stage of evolution, as a crop farmer adds livestock to his business, there is a small gain in the beginning, then an increasing rate of substitution between crop and livestock follow. As a <b>livestock</b> <b>rearer</b> engages in crop production, there is a decreasing rate of subsitution between livestock and crop. This situation derives from the fact that crop production is more intensive than llivestock production which depends principally on grazing natural pastures. Results indicate that, if increased population pressure and cropping intensity severely limit access to grazing land, farm and herds sizes will become smaller, then the degree of integration between crop and livestock will increase significantly...|$|R
