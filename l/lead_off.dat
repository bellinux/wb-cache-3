5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to <b>lead</b> <b>off,</b> {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to <b>lead</b> <b>off</b> the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens.

It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had stolen the <b>lead</b> <b>off</b> the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000.
