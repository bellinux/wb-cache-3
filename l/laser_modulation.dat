50|$|It is {{well known}} that optical {{interference}} often is a major problem in laser-based gas spectroscopy. In conventional laser-based gas spectrometers, the optical interference originates from e.g. etalon-type interference effects in (or between) optical components and multi-pass gas cells. Throughout the years, great efforts have been devoted to handle this problem. Proper optical design is important to minimize interference from the beginning (e.g. by tilting optical components, avoiding transmissive optics and using anti-reflection coating), but interference patterns can not be completely avoided and are often difficult to separate from gas absorption. Since gas spectroscopy often involves measurement of small absorption fractions (down to 10−7), appropriate handling of interference is crucial. Utilised countermeasures include customized optical design, tailored <b>laser</b> <b>modulation,</b> mechanical dithering, signal post-processing, sample modulation, and baseline recording and interference subtraction.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{knowledge}} of the linewidth enhancement factor (alpha(H) -factor) {{is very important to}} understand the performance of semiconductor lasers. It affects several fundamental aspects such as the linewidth, the laser's behavior under optical feedback, the chirp under direct modulation and the occurrence of the filamentation. The dramatic variation in the alpha(H) -factor that has been reported for quantum dot lasers makes them an interesting subject for optical feedback studies. In the particular case of QD lasers, the carrier density is not clearly clamped at threshold. The lasing wavelength can switch from the ground state to the excited state as the current injection increases meaning that a carrier accumulation occurs in the ES even though lasing in the GS is still occurring. The purpose of the paper is to show that the exploitation of the nonlinear properties arising from quantum nanostructure based semiconductor lasers operating under external optical feedback can lead, under specific conditions, to a bifurcation of the modulation properties. Starting from the generalized rate equations under optical feedback, the <b>laser's</b> <b>modulation</b> response is determined. Under the short external cavity assumption, calculations show that large variations of the alpha(H) -factor can contribute to improve the dynamical properties such as the relaxation frequency as well as the laser's bandwidth. On the contrary, assuming the long external cavity situation, numerical results show that even small reflections in the percent range when combined to significant variations of the alpha(H) -factor alter the <b>laser's</b> <b>modulation</b> response...|$|R

Laser-induced emission spectrometry (LIBS) uses the spectrally dispersed light emission of a plasma for the chemical analysis of solid and liquid materials. A collimated high-intensity laser beam, directed onto the material, produces the plasma. The interaction between the laser radiation of a Nd:YAG laser and the substrate (steel or steel melt) can be influenced in a definite manner by controlling the laser power output (<b>laser</b> <b>modulation).</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>modulation</b> enables plasma conditions to be created, which are advantageous in emission spectrometry.
