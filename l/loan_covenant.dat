40|$|This Article {{develops}} a unique theory of performance-sensitive debt {{and argues that}} certain revenue-stage startups may be missing out on {{an important source of}} capital from asset-based loans. Debt contracts are performance sensitive to the extent any of the borrower’s obligations adjust in response to the performance of the borrower. The three main types of performance sensitivity I identify are (1) a loan’s interest rate adjusting based on the performance of the borrower; (2) the amount of available credit adjusting based on the value of collateral; and (3) renegotiation following breach of a <b>loan</b> <b>covenant.</b> Conceptualizing performance sensitivity as a separate governance mechanism allows me to flesh out, and in some cases challenge, several distinct bodies of research, including incomplete contracting theory and the literature on capital structure. The focus of this Article is on the nature of one type of performance-sensitive debt in particular — asset-based loans. Asset-based loans are important because they are the only type of loan that adjusts the amount of credit available to a borrower based on the performance of its assets. Due to the protections asset-based loans provide to lenders, they are often the only type of loan lenders are willing to make to high-risk borrowers. Asset-based loans are often cheaper than other sources of capital, more borrower-friendly than other types of debt, and can be structured {{to meet the needs of}} a wide variety of borrowers. Because of these characteristics, I argue that certain revenue-stage startups, including those with intellectual property assets, may be better off raising capital with asset-based loans than other types of financing...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines three {{essays on}} U. S. mutual funds, focusing on mutual fund behaviors in managing fund size, trading on firms affected by credit events, and {{the replacement of}} fund managers. The first project introduces a new antecedent variable to the literature on performance persistence: mutual fund families&# 146; ability to adopt strategies to manage fund size across changes in the information environment. With mutual fund families using marketing and distribution expenses as tools to manage fund size, this study finds that higher 12 b- 1 fees are associated with lower subsequent performance and money flows, {{but only in the}} post- 2000 period, after the Regulation Fair Disclosure was introduced to remove large fund families&# 146; preferential access to information. The findings are not driven by funds&# 146; fee-setting activities, alternative mechanisms to managing fund size such as fund closures to new investment, or differences in distribution fee structures. The second project examines how local and distant mutual funds trade on firms affected by credit events such as <b>loan</b> <b>covenant</b> violations. This study finds local investors (i. e., local fund managers) achieve positive abnormal stock returns around covenant violation periods. Local investors appear to adjust their holdings at least three months prior to covenant violations and such actions are associated with higher fund performance. To identify possible information channels utilized by local investors, this study finds evidence of local investors&# 146; ability to mimic insider trades, but they do not appear to benefit from their involvement in syndicated loan networks. The overall findings suggest that local investors benefit from their geographic proximity to firms affected by credit events. The third project examines managerial replacement decisions made by mutual fund families. Using a unique dataset of 5, 242 managerial replacement events from 1990 to 2011, this study finds that managers of funds that are ranked at the bottom of fund families in terms of performance and fund flows {{are more likely to be}} replaced. More importantly, the replacement of top-performing managers generates negative spillover effects (for both performance and flows) on other funds in the family. Further tests show that the replacement of bottom-performing managers explains fund families&# 146; future performance and money flows, suggesting an economic value to the monitoring activities of mutual fund families...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} four published papers (the Papers) - {{three on}} accounting-based loan covenants {{and one on}} the going concern qualification (GCQ) - plus a linking essay. The essay focuses on the Papers' common subject matter of corporate control and on their common research methodology, positive accounting theory. The essay shows how the agency literature is closely bound up with problems of corporate control. It goes on to argue that certain features of positive accounting theory - its recognition of conflict and of institutional influences, and its focus on economic incentives - render it a particularly useful framework for research into loan covenants and the GCQ. The <b>loan</b> <b>covenant</b> papers address both the structuring of loan agreements ('ex ante' issues) and the subsequent functioning of such agreements, in particular breaches of covenant ('ex post' issues). Their chief contribution to the 'ex ante' literature is the first evidence they provide on the extent and incidence of covenants in the UK; their UK/US comparison, drawing on institutional differences to explain why accounting-based covenants in the UK, unlike the US, have a positive association with term but no association with gearing; and their analysis of the incidence of accounting-based covenants in convertible and secured debt agreements. The Papers' findings on 'ex post' matters contain early evidence on the costliness of covenant breaches, on the effectiveness of managerial opportunism in avoiding covenant violations and on the costliness of mandatory accounting changes. In the context of loan covenants the essay also provides a methodological critique of positive accounting theory, which it sees as a developing research programme. This is reflected both in the ambiguous relation between accounting-based covenants and the investment opportunity set (which is resolved in this research for a UK setting), and in the 'ad hoc' nature of many arguments put forward by the theory's proponents to explain existing practice. Finally, the essay argues that the positive accounting theory and the decision-usefulness views of accounting have more in common than is sometimes supposed. The going concern paper addresses important issues of independence and disclosure. The essay discusses several possible explanations for the low GCQ rate among failed companies, adducing evidence from more recent research. The GCQ paper itself shows that, although the self-fulfilling prophecy argument and differential audit firm size do not appear to prejudice independence, auditor switching may pose such a threat. The essay concludes by pointing at directions for future research, in particular in areas with public policy implications, and by suggesting that greater use of a case study methodology could deepen our understanding of these issues...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how the {{violation}} of <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> (technical default) impacts firm dividend policy. Using contract-level loan data for nonfinancial firms in the U. S., {{we find that the}} occurrence of a covenant violation significantly increases the likelihood of a dividend reduction in the subsequent quarter. Moreover, we find that the degree of creditor-shareholder conflict is an important determinant of dividend cuts upon technical default: firms near financial distress and firms with weak corporate governance practices are more likely to experience dividend cuts after technical default. In addition, we find that the tendency of dividend cuts upon technical default weakened after the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act. This is consistent with weakened bargaining power of creditors due to increased competition among banks, and increased conflict of interest due to combining commercial and investment banking businesses.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that operating lease capitalisation has on key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators of listed South African companies operating within five sectors (namely General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Food & Drug Retailers, General Retailers and Travel & Leisure), as well as whether the impact thereof is substantially {{the same as the}} new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases in terms of ED/ 2013 / 6 (IASB, 2013). Furthermore, the extent of lease usage in South Africa and whether the size of a company has a bearing on its extent of leasing is examined. Additional analysis is also performed investigating the materiality of straight-lining and onerous contract provisions relating to operating leases, as well as the impact of operating lease capitalisation on disclosed <b>loan</b> <b>covenants.</b> Based predominantly on the constructive operating lease capitalisation method developed by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991 & 1997), a refined constructive lease capitalisation model is developed in this study which incorporates aspects of current lease accounting rules not previously considered, namely provisions recognised in respect of the straight-lining of operating leases as well as onerous operating lease contracts. This model also incorporates the new proposed lease accounting rules which require the capitalisation of all leases (Type A and Type B). The results indicate that the capitalisation of future non-cancellable operating lease commitments {{have a significant impact on}} key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators, most notably leverage and other debt-related ratios. Furthermore, of the five sectors analysed, retailers were the most affected. When considering the new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases, the results indicate that operating lease capitalisation has substantially the same impact on key financial statement ratios and Altman‟s failure prediction models as the conventional operating lease capitalisation method, except for certain debt-related and profitability ratios. Further results indicate that operating leases are used extensively and substantially more than finance leases within South Africa. It was also found that operating lease usage was positively related to company size, while finance lease usage decreased as company size increased. Curvilinear relationships were also noted between a company‟s size and its extent of leasing. Further analysis revealed that recognised straight-lining lease provisions are substantially more material than recognised onerous lease contract provisions and are capable of distorting the analysis of operating lease capitalisation if ignored. When scrutinising <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> disclosed, it was established that none of the <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> were breached when capitalising operating leases; however, in each instance operating lease capitalisation negatively impacted all covenant related ratios...|$|R

40|$|T he classic {{moral hazard}} model studies {{the problem of}} how a princi-pal should provide {{incentives}} to an agent who operates a project forhim. In this model, the principal only observes the realized output and not the agent’s effort. Consequently, the agent must be induced to work hard with compensation that depends on performance. Because many con-tracts explicitly tie rewards and punishments to performance, the model is a workhorse of modern economics, with applications to insurance contracts, employee and executive pay, sharecropping contracts, corporate finance, and bank regulation, to name just a few. In the moral hazard model the exact dependence of compensation on performance depends on the relationship between the agent’s input and the project’s output. Most analysis takes this relationship, or technology, as given; that is, something that cannot be modified by the principal. There are many situations, however, where the principal has some control over this technology. For example, a principal can design a production process so some outcomes are more likely than others when certain inputs are applied. A production line can be designed so that if sufficient care is not supplied, it will break down. In agriculture, the fertilizer, the type of seed, and other inputs all effect the stochastic properties of production. Debt contracts frequently include <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> that put restrictions on the activities of a borrower, such as working capital requirements. 1 Financial regulation works similarly. Banks have limits on their activities. For example, a bank cannot lend more than a set fraction of its assets to a single borrower.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three chapters. In {{the first}} chapter, I investigate whether restrictive <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> disrupt or improve firm operating performance. Using an instrumental variables approach {{to address the}} endogenous relationship between covenant strictness and firms' efficiency, I find stricter <b>loan</b> <b>covenants</b> cause an increase in profitability {{and a reduction in}} operating cost. Stricter covenants improve performance only in firms with poor governance: those without large shareholder ownership, with weaker shareholder rights, facing softer competition in their product market, or with inside director dominated boards. The evidence is consistent with the view that the design of debt contracts can mitigate agency costs in firms that lack alternative governance mechanisms. The second chapter focuses on the relationships that banks develop with other lenders through syndicated loans, one of the largest sources of external finance for firms. A small number of interconnected banks increasingly dominate the syndicated loan market. In this chapter, I use measures from network analysis to test whether lender interconnectedness benefits borrowers through efficiency gains, or is harmful due to increased market power. Traditional measures of industry concentration are not relevant in the syndicated loan market because lenders share information and resources. Using bank mergers to identify exogenous variation in lenders' interconnectedness, I find that an increase in lender network centrality reduces firms' cost of borrowing. The effects are larger for borrowers with higher levels of information asymmetry, consistent with theories suggesting that facilitating information sharing increases lending efficiency. The third chapter examines whether creditor protection rights affect the structure of corporate debt. Improving legal protection of creditor interests may expand firms' access to debt markets, but also increases creditors' rights to intervene with firm policies. Using variation from legal rulings in Delaware, I find that increasing creditor protection leads to a reduction in senior secured debt and an increase in unsecured bonds, especially for firms close to bankruptcy. Reducing creditors' ability to sue managers for breach of fiduciary duty leads to a large increase in secured debt with more restrictive covenants. The results suggest that legal protection of creditor interests affects firms' choice of debt structure...|$|R
