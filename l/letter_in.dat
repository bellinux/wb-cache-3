5|$|Able and Baker are {{the first}} two letters of the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet, used from 1941 until 1956. Alpha and Bravo are their {{counterparts}} in the current NATO phonetic alphabet. Charlie is the third <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> both systems. According to eyewitness accounts, the time of detonation for each test was announced as H or How hour; in the official JTF-1 history, the term M or Mike hour is used instead.|$|E

5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr. Hamilton would also have been accused of recanting Cooper's letter out of cowardice. After a series of attempts to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France. Charles initiated contact with Sixtus through contacts in neutral Switzerland, and Zita wrote a letter inviting him to Vienna.

5000|$|Because Hebrew Braille {{derives from}} English Braille, {{there is not}} a {{one-to-one}} match between Hebrew <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> print and in braille. Most obviously, four consonants with the dagesh point in print have distinct <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> braille, but three others require a dagesh prefix [...] in braille. The different placements of the dot on the print letter shin also correspond to two different <b>letters</b> <b>in</b> braille.

Initially low letters were given to passenger classes, and high letters for goods classes, but from about 1916 this pattern was discarded. Within classes locomotives are individually numbered, in a continuous number block which is unique to the class. In some cases locomotives have been renumbered to keep number blocks continuous, {{and in some cases}} there is no correlation between the number blocks used for the steam and diesel locomotives of the same class <b>letter.</b> <b>In</b> addition, some classes start the number series with a 0, while others start with a 1.|$|E

5|$|A 1788 <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought {{election to the}} Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall that he could not win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of letters or letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E

5|$|As World War II neared its conclusion, Kimball {{and other}} LDS Church leaders {{constantly}} {{responded to the}} needs of the friends and families of LDS war casualties. Kimball's eldest son, Spence, was nearly killed in 1945 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier USS Franklin, when bombs dropped from Japanese airplanes damaged the ship and ignited its tanks of aviation fuel. In an attempt to give comfort to families of those killed in combat, Kimball drafted a well-known <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> which he wrote that sin, not premature death, was the only true tragedy in life. Kimball compared the death of young servicemen to the early death of Jesus Christ and stated that although such death is heartbreaking, from an eternal perspective, God's all-knowing purposes would be seen in their circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a <b>letter</b> <b>in</b> one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
