5|$|In 2011, after {{temporarily}} {{losing its}} Fox affiliation for WFFT-TV to a subchannel of WISE-TV {{due to a}} reverse compensation dispute, Nexstar (ironically, given its use of similar practices in other markets) filed an antitrust lawsuit against the station's managing partner, Granite Broadcasting, arguing that it had built a monopoly on <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> sales by having effective control of the outlets for five major networks (ABC and MyNetworkTV on WPTA, and NBC, Fox, and The CW on WISE-TV; owned by Malara Broadcast Group and operated under agreements by Granite). The lawsuit was settled in February 2013 via mutual agreement, after which the Fox affiliation was given back to WFFT.|$|E
5|$|The Hoots {{decision}} would again affect Burger King {{as it moved}} into the state of Texas. When Burger King expanded into the San Antonio area, it was prevented from utilizing the name of its signature product, the Whopper, in its <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> and stores due to a prior state registered service mark owned by a local chain known as Whopper Burger. The chain, owned by Frank and Barbara Bates, prevented the company from using the name in Bexar County for several years until Mrs. Bates, the CEO of Whopper Burger {{after the death of}} her husband in 1983, retired and sold the chain with its related trademarks to then-corporate parent Pillsbury in the mid-1980s.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E

25|$|Some smart TV {{platforms}} {{also support}} interactive advertising, addressable advertising with <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> insertion and targeted advertising, and other advanced advertising {{features such as}} ad telescoping using VOD and DVR, enhanced TV for consumer call-to-action and audience measurement solutions for ad campaign effectiveness. The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means that smart TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.|$|E

25|$|The NBC Radio Network also pioneered {{personal}} advice call-in national {{talk radio}} with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal financial advice), Bernard Meltzer (personal and financial advice) and Sally Jessy Raphael (personal and romantic advice). While never {{much of a}} ratings success, TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format. For affiliates, many of them struggling AM stations, TalkNet helped fill evening time slots with free programming, allowing the stations to sell <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming. Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to increasing control of radio content by networks and syndicators.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only did}} it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, but the new Now You See It faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like Now You See It seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> revenue from the talk shows, numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{affiliates}} that pre-empt poorer performing network programs, KYW-TV {{used the}} pre-emptions {{in order to}} gain an increase in <b>local</b> <b>advertising</b> rates which potentially come with ratings increases. This proved to be a very profitable decision at first, as KYW-TV was either first or second in the Philadelphia television ratings for most of the 1960s and 1970s. However, the station (and NBC) faltered in the late 1970s, and by 1980 KYW-TV was the lowest-rated network affiliate in Philadelphia. It stayed in the ratings basement even when NBC rebounded to become the nation's most-watched network by 1985. For the rest of its tenure as an NBC affiliate, KYW-TV was the network's lowest-rated major-market affiliate during a very prosperous period for NBC as a whole. It continued to heavily pre-empt NBC programming, much to the network's chagrin.|$|E
