40|$|This thesis {{would not}} have been {{possible}} without the amazing support of a lot of people. My family, first and foremost. I thank my father for not even <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> dropping all of this and spending the rest of my life working at McDonalds. I am still not sure if that {{would not have}} been the right choice. I would also like to thank my mother, who supported me the whole time, even when I wanted to drop all of this and go working for McDonalds. A special thank-you goes to my late grandfather, who was a major inspiration in my life, and without whom I might not have been able to finish this course. I would also like to thank my supervisors for the opportunity to do this thesis and their support. A special thank-you goes out to professor Eduardo Marques, for constantly changing the format of the VCC export, which in turn forced me to massively refactor the plugin, greatly improving the quality of the code. I also thank him for being there in the lab with his students whenever he could, helping even when I needed. I thank my friends for always brightening up my day with some good laughs, with a special thanks to Fernando Alves for actually taking the time to review my thesis and helping me improve it. Finally, I thank my girlfriend, for giving me the strength to pull through to the end, and somehow putting up with my incessant whining about every tool I use being terrible and nothing working right. I dedicate this thesis to you Solange, it wouldn’t have been finished without you. ii...|$|R

I get the second touch. I make it to four, My touches appear {{to me to be}} so skillful, so beautiful, that I say to myself, ‘I think I’m in the Zone, but I’m not sure. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> not <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it….’. Soon enough, as soon as the thought crosses my mind, the Frenchman gets two point on me. But I snatch the game right back. I get another touch and it’s 8-2. Then he gets 8-3, and 8-4. Even as he is gaining, I know the game is mine. All I gotta do is keep riding the tide, keep going with it. I get 9-4, and I finish him off 10-4. The Frenchman falls to his knees crying.” ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{someone does}} make a comment or suggestion, do not rush to {{discount}} their opinion or defend your own.

When asked in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly why he had {{changed his name}}, Starlite answered: <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> how I want to answer that question. Let me think for a moment. minute passes It’s very difficult because I’m very {{proud of the fact that}} I changed my name. It has meaning to me. I believe that people change, and that you are what you make of yourself. And that that is true. That’s true … I don’t want to, I don’t want to … The problem is that I feel like when I start talking about these things, I start to say things that I wouldn’t necessarily want to read myself saying. They might be too easily misinterpreted. So I think I’ll just leave it at that. I’m proud of the fact that I changed my name. I am what I make of myself.|$|E
