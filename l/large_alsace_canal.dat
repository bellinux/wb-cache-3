50|$|The Grand <b>Canal</b> of <b>Alsace</b> (Grand <b>Canal</b> d'Alsace, Rheinseitenkanal) is a canal {{in eastern}} France, {{channeling}} the Upper Rhine river. It is 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) long between Kembs and Vogelgrun, and {{provides access to}} the region from the Rhine River, Basel in Switzerland, and the North Sea for barges of up to about 5000 metric tons. The Grand Canal permits the navigation of more than 30,000 boats a year between Basel and Strasbourg.|$|R

50|$|With its 904 communes, Alsace {{has three}} times as many {{municipalities}} as Sweden, which has a much larger territory covering 449,964 km2 and yet is divided into only 290 municipalities (kommuner). Alsace has more than double the total number of municipalities of the Netherlands which, in spite of having a population nine times larger and a land area four times <b>larger</b> than <b>Alsace,</b> is divided into just 390 municipalities (gemeenten).|$|R
500|$|Sélestat ( [...] ; Alsatian: Schlettstàdt; German: Schlettstadt) is a commune in the {{northeast}} region of France. An administrative division (sous-préfecture) of the Bas-Rhin department, the town lies on the Ill river, [...] from the Rhine and the German border.

50|$|The {{predominant}} historical {{language of}} Alsace is Alsatian, a Germanic (mainly Alemannic) dialect also spoken across the Rhine, but today most Alsatians primarily speak French, {{the official language}} of France. The political status of Alsace has been heavily influenced by historical decisions, wars, and strategic politics. The economic and cultural capital as well as <b>largest</b> city of <b>Alsace</b> is Strasbourg. The city is the seat of several international organizations and bodies.|$|R
50|$|Visitors can {{distinguish}} two castles {{separated by a}} large ditch. The older part has the <b>largest</b> keep in <b>Alsace</b> with 13 metres a side. A renovated tower stands between the two keeps at {{the centre of the}} site. It was probably part of Grand-Greifenstein. From the terrace there is an unimpeded view of Saverne, the Château du Haut-Barr, the Château du Grand-Geroldseck, the valley of the Zorn and the Saint-Vit chapel.|$|R
50|$|The first {{tram line}} in Strasbourg, which was {{originally}} horse-drawn, opened in 1878. After 1894, when an electric powered tram system was introduced, a widespread network of tramways {{was built in}} the <b>largest</b> city of <b>Alsace,</b> including also several longer distance lines {{on both sides of the}} Rhine. The decline of the tramways system began in the 1930s, and ended with the retirement of the service in 1960. After a long drawn out communal political decision process, the tram was reintroduced in 1994. As part of the redevelopment of the city, a track of a total 33 km distance was built, on which 5 tram line services have been developed.|$|R
500|$|Among {{soldiers}} and civilians alike, Saint-Just repressed {{opponents of the}} Revolution {{but he did not}} agree to the mass executions ordered by some of the other deputies on the mission. He vetoed much of the deputies' work and had many of them recalled to Paris. Local politicians were even more vulnerable to him: even the powerful Eulogius Schneider, the revolutionary leader of <b>Alsace's</b> <b>largest</b> city and called the [...] "Marat of Strasbourg", was arrested by Saint-Just's orders and rapidly dispatched to the guillotine. Saint-Just worked closely only with General Charles Pichegru, a reliable Jacobin whom he respected. Under Saint-Just's unblinking surveillance, Pichegru and General Lazare Hoche ably secured the frontier and began an invasion of the German Rhineland.|$|R
50|$|The church {{furnishings}} {{were damaged}} from British and American bombing raids in August 1944, as well as, {{as far as}} the stained glass windows are concerned, from a violent hailstorm in 1958, incidentally the same hailstorm that destroyed most of the Botanical Garden's historical greenhouses. The most outstanding feature inside is the main tribune pipe organ of 1897 (modified in 1934 and restored several times since), also classified as Monument historique. This is, by the number of pipes and registers {{as well as by the}} sheer size of the organ case, one of the <b>largest</b> instruments in <b>Alsace</b> and most probably Eastern France. In 1976, a second pipe organ was installed in the transept.|$|R

50|$|The wine cellars, which {{date from}} 1395, are a tourist {{attraction}} in their own right. Over the centuries, many patients paid for their care by leaving parcels of land that have grown to constitute a vast area of vineyards. The 1716 fire that destroyed most of the hospital, spared the wine cellars. The cellars produce some 150,000 bottles a year of Gewürztraminer, Muscat, Riesling and Pinot Gris. The historic cellar is renowned {{for the quality of}} its wines but does no advertising and reinvests all its profits in the purchase of medical equipment.In the 18th century, the Hospital of Strasbourg was the <b>largest</b> Domaine in <b>Alsace,</b> making and selling wine as a side business. Patients were given two litres of wine a day.One of the barrels contains what is reputed to be the oldest wine on earth, dating from 1472.|$|R
50|$|The German Empire was a {{federation}} of monarchies {{and a few}} city-states. However, after the Franco-Prussian War, the newly created country annexed <b>large</b> parts of <b>Alsace</b> and Lorraine, two mostly German-speaking French territories which used {{to belong to the}} Holy Roman Empire. A large part of the local population was opposed to the transfer, meaning that granting statehood to the recently acquired territory would establish a state with a possible desire for secession which also was not used to German politics and German law. Incorporating the territory into Prussia, as it happened to Schleswig-Holstein and other states during the German Unification Wars, was opposed by the South German states which already felt diminished by Prussia. Hence, an annexation to Bavaria and Baden was also discussed, yet met with opposition by the military which opined that the crucial border territory had to be governed from Berlin. As a compromise, Otto von Bismarck successfully proposed to incorporate Alsace-Lorraine as a territory directly governed by the Imperial (federal) government, leading {{to the creation of the}} Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine (Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen). The territorial status, common in the US, was unique within mainland Germany, as all constituent states were self-governing.|$|R
