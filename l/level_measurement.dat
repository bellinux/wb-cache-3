25|$|A Weighting {{curve is}} a graph {{of a set}} of factors, that are used to 'weight' {{measured}} values of a variable according to their importance in relation to some outcome. An important example is frequency weighting in sound <b>level</b> <b>measurement</b> where a specific set of weighting curves known as A, B, C and D weighting as defined in IEC 61672 are used. Unweighted measurements of sound pressure do not correspond to perceived loudness because the human ear is less sensitive at low and high frequencies, with the effect more pronounced at lower sound levels. The four curves are applied to the measured sound level, for example by the use of a weighting filter in a sound level meter, to arrive at readings of loudness in Phons or in decibels (dB) above the threshold of hearing. (see A-weighting).|$|E

We introduced an arbitrary offset to the first <b>levelling</b> <b>measurement</b> to fit the PS-InSAR estimates of the time series to compare the relative variations between both techniques. The <b>levelling</b> <b>measurements</b> of sites 1 to 4 and site 8 began in 2011, with a second measurement in October 2013. During this time lapse, all of the sites were affected by an uplift that decreased with the distance to the geothermal site. The uplift was 1.7, 1.6, 0.7 and 0.1  cm for sites 4, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. The difference between the levelling results at these site locations (2011 to 2013) and the InSAR results (April 2012 to September 2013) is less than 0.3  cm. Further, the main displacement before September 2013 arguably occurred during July to September 2013 and could be linked with the geothermal site.

40|$|The Hanford site {{is home to}} 177 large, {{underground}} {{nuclear waste}} storage tanks. Safety and environmental concerns surround these tanks and their contents. One such concern is the propensity for the waste in these tanks to generate and trap flammable gases. This report focuses on understanding and {{improving the quality of}} retained gas volume estimates derived from tank waste <b>level</b> <b>measurements.</b> While direct measurements of gas volume are available for a small number of the Hanford tanks, the increasingly wide availability of tank waste <b>level</b> <b>measurements</b> provides an opportunity for less expensive (than direct gas volume measurement) assessment of gas hazard for the Hanford tanks. Retained gas in the tank waste is inferred from <b>level</b> <b>measurements</b> [...] either long-term increase in the tank waste level, or fluctuations in tank waste level with atmospheric pressure changes. This report concentrates on the latter phenomena. As atmospheric pressure increases, the pressure on the gas in the tank waste increases, resulting in a level decrease (as long as the tank waste is {open_quotes}soft{close_quotes} enough). Tanks with waste levels exhibiting fluctuations inversely correlated with atmospheric pressure fluctuations were catalogued in an earlier study. Additionally, models incorporating ideal-gas law behavior and waste material properties have been proposed. These models explicitly relate the retained gas volume in the tank with the magnitude of the waste level fluctuations, dL/dP. This report describes how these models compare with the tank waste <b>level</b> <b>measurements...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceModern Internet {{applications}} rely on rich multimedia contents {{making the}} quality of experience (QoE) of end users sensitive to network conditions. Several models were developed in the literature to express QoE {{as a function of}} measurements carried out on the traffic of the applications themselves. In this paper, we propose a new methodology based on machine learning able to link expected QoE to network and device <b>level</b> <b>measurements</b> outside the applications’ traffic. This direct linking to network and device <b>level</b> <b>measurements</b> is important for the prediction of QoE. We prove the feasibility of the approach in the context of Skype. In particular, we derive and validate a model to predict the Skype QoE as a function of easily measurable network performance metrics. One can see our methodology as a new way of performing measurements in the Internet, where instead of expressing the expected performance in terms of network and device <b>level</b> <b>measurements</b> that only specialists can understand, we express performance in clear terms related to expected quality of experience for different applications...|$|R
