50|$|The term {{de-industrialisation}} {{crisis has}} been used to describe the decline of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> in a number of countries and the flight of jobs away from cities. One example is labour-intensive manufacturing. After free-trade agreements were instituted with less developed nations in the 1980s and 1990s, labour-intensive manufacturers relocated production facilities to Third World countries with much lower wages and lower standards. In addition, technological inventions that required less manual labour, such as industrial robots, eliminated many manufacturing jobs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} {{significant}} variation in FDI spillover effects on local industry is obscured through the aggregation common in most studies. Breaking Chinese industrial data for 2001 down by category of ownership of foreign investor, local firm, and by host industry, we {{find evidence of}} greater positive spillovers from FDI in technology-intensive <b>industries</b> than in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> We also find that overseas Chinese affiliates from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (HMT) generate spillovers to locally owned enterprises (LOEs) in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industries,</b> in contrast to western affiliates, which positively impact {{on the performance of}} LOEs in technology-intensive industries. Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) benefit from the presence of both HMT affiliates in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> and of western affiliates in technology-intensive industries. Other LOEs (OLOEs), however, benefit only from HMT affiliates' presence in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industries.</b> These findings offer some support to host government policies offering generous incentive packages to attract foreign investors in high-technology industries. We find that some aspects of China's status as a transition economy [...] for example the considerable resources and effective control deployed by the state and SOEs [...] has helped its development process; however we argue that it is possible for non-transition developing economies to implement similar policies.

50|$|Steel is no {{more the}} <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> it used to be. Earlier, it was often {{associated}} {{with the image of}} huge work force living in a captive township. All that has changed dramatically. A modern steel plant employs very few people. In South Korea, Posco employs 29,648 people to produce 28 million tonnes. As a rule of thumb, one can put the direct employment potential at 1,000 per million tonnes. It could be less. However, steel being a basic industry, it generates substantial growth of both upstream and downstream facilities. According to some estimates one person-year of employment in the steel industry generates 3.5 person-years of employment elsewhere. Considering all these, total employment generation will be substantial.|$|E
50|$|The Netherlands did not {{industrialize}} {{as rapidly}} as Belgium after 1830, but it was prosperous enough. Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated {{the emergence of a}} national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads. However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.For example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late - after 1860 - because incentives to move to <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> were quite weak.However, the provinces of North Brabant and Overijssel did industrialize, and they became the most economically advanced areas of the country.|$|E

This is supported by low barriers to entry and the negative relationship between economic growth and entry rates. In contrast, entry in capital-intensive industries is unrelated to economic growth and it is characterized by significant barriers to entry, including capital, working capital, and proprietor experience. With the exception of <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industries</b> in rural areas, entry in all other small-enterprise industries is positively correlated with agricultural income.

40|$|Even {{though there}} have been many studies on the impact of trade {{liberalisation}} on labour standards, most of the studies are at national level, and {{there is a lack of}} research at industry level. This paper examines the impact of free trade on labour standards in capital- and labour-intensive industries in a developing country. For empirical findings, I take the case of the garment industry, representing <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry,</b> and automotive industry, representing capital-intensive industry, in Indonesia in the face of ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA). Since the garment industry is a women-dominated industry, while the automotive industry is a men-dominated industry, this paper also employs a feminist perspective. As such, this paper also investigates whether free trade equally affects men and women workers. Besides free trade, other independent variables are also taken into account. Employing quantitative and qualitative methods, empirical evidence shows that there is an indication that free trade has a negative relationship with labour standards in the garment industry, whereas a positive relationships with labour standards in the automotive industry. This implies that free trade might result in decreasing labour standards in <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry,</b> while increasing standards in capital-intensive industry. It can also be inferred that free trade unequally affect men and women workers, in that women workers bear the brunt of free trade. The results also show that other internal and external independent variables are indicated to have relationships with labour standards in the garment and automotive industries. Therefore, these variables need to be considered in examining the extent of the impact of free trade on labour standards in labour- and capital-intensive industries...|$|E
40|$|Construction is a <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry,</b> {{which places}} heavy {{reliance}} upon {{the skills of}} its workforce.

The declining {{number of young people}} available to enter employment, however, has considerable implications for the construction industry, particularly in the search for eligible recruits to train for future skill requirements. Against this background, this paper highlights how construction employers will need to adopt alternative training and recruitment strategies if they to avoid future skills shortages. These strategies will need to be tailored for a particular region, taking account of the demand for labour, brought about by growth in construction output and the availability of alternative sources of labour, including the long-tern unemployed, women and ethnic minorities...|$|E

It was found that this highly competitive and <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>industry</b> is largely dependent on cheap labour and the supply of solid waste from the local trade system. Its mostly informal nature results from the ‘unregisteredness’ of the materials. Consequently, government involvement is avoided as much as possible.
