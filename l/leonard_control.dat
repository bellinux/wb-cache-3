50|$|Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>Control,</b> {{also known}} as the Ward Leonard Drive System, was a widely used DC motor speed control system {{introduced}} by Harry Ward Leonard in 1891. In early 1900s, the control system of Ward Leonard was adopted by the U.S. Navy and also used in passenger lift of large mines. It also provided a solution to a moving sidewalk at the Paris Exposition of 1900, where many others had failed to operate properly. It was applied to railway locomotives used in World War I, and was used in anti-aircraft radars in World War II. Connected to automatic anti-aircraft gun directors, the tracking motion in two dimensions had to be extremely smooth and precise. The MIT Radiation Laboratory selected Ward-Leonard to equip the famous radar SCR-584 in 1942. The Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> system was widely used for elevators until thyristor drives became available in the 1980s, because it offered smooth speed control and consistent torque. Many Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> systems and variations on them remain in use.|$|E
50|$|Although only {{technical}} specialists {{are likely to}} be familiar with Ward Leonard systems, many millions of people have ridden in elevators powered by Ward Leonard drives. From the 1920s through the 1980s most electrically driven elevators used Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> and many systems remained in use {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E
5000|$|In {{underground}} mining a hoist or winder {{is used to}} raise and lower conveyances within the mine shaft. Modern hoists are normally powered using electric motors, historically with direct current drives utilizing Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> machines and later solid-state converters (thyristors), however modern large hoists use alternating current drives that are variable frequency controlled. There are three principal types of hoists used in mining applications: ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{discovered}} in the private room, Leonard and his business manager are all {{in it for the}} take—"Delos" [...] doesn't exist at all. But Leonard suddenly does speak in an ethereal voice, unbeknownst to him. Then, in a pre-interview with a television talk show, Leonard begins speaking in the voice again, saying that television takes advantage of the weak-minded. Leonard's business manager, Don, and the producer are shocked to hear this truth-telling voice coming out of Leonard. As Don and Leonard himself discover, although Delos is a contrived thing, this new voice is not under <b>Leonard's</b> <b>control.</b> The manager even suggests going to a psychiatrist.|$|R
5000|$|Harry Ward Leonard (February 8, 1861 [...] - [...] February 18, 1915) was an {{electrical}} engineer and inventor. He {{is best known for}} his invention, the Ward <b>Leonard</b> motor <b>control</b> system. Equipment based on this invention remained in service into the 21st century.|$|R
50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor is {{controlled}} by varying the voltage fed to the generator field windings, Vgf, which varies the output voltage of the generator. The varied output voltage will change the voltage of the motor, since they are connected directly through the armature. Consequently, changing the Vgf will control {{the speed of the}} motor. The picture on the right shows the Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> system, with the Vgf feeding the generator and Vmf feeding the motor.|$|E
50|$|The {{key feature}} of the Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> system {{is the ability to}} {{smoothly}} vary the speed of a DC motor, including reversing it, by controlling the field windings and hence the output voltage of a DC generator. As the speed of a DC motor is dictated by the supplied voltage, this gives simple speed control. The DC generator could be driven by any means, provided that also supplied a voltage source for the field windings. This 'prime mover' could be an AC motor, or it could be an internal combustion engine (its application to vehicles was patented by H.W. Leonard in 1903).|$|E

50|$|They also {{produced}} 100 petrol-electric locomotives for the War Department Light Railways. These locomotives weighed 7 tons {{and had a}} 45 hp Dorman 4JO four-cylinder petrol engine driving a 30 kW DC generator at 1000rpm. This supplied current at up to 500volts to 2 traction-motors driving the 32inch wheels via a 6.68:1 reduction gear. The motors had an hourly rating of 25 hp, allowing the locomotive to haul 100tons at 5.2 mph. The two motors were run in parallel, with speed control by altering the generator voltage, and either motor could be cut out in event of a failure. The generator also offered electric starting of the petrol engine by connecting to another locomotive, and the locomotives {{could also be used}} as mobile generators. In a parallel order 100 similarly rated locomotives were made by British Westinghouse, who were probably the original designers, though the DC generator/DC motor speed control mechanism is an early example of the application of a Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> system (Harry Ward Leonard patented its application to vehicles in 1903). The selection of this drive system was in part because the War Department had originally considered using overhead electric as an alternative way of powering the locomotives, but it was subsequently decided this was not practical.|$|E
50|$|A human {{operator}} anticipates errors, {{and can also}} compensate for known lags {{in the operation of}} the system. Mimicking of this behaviour had been achieved for electronic signals and low-power electromechanical systems, but gun control was on a completely different scale, with machinery weighing tons and having significant inertia needing to move at velocities of up to 30 degrees per second, and accelerations of 10 degrees per second2. In 1937, the Admiralty had placed an order with Metropolitan Vickers for a control system for an eight-barrel Pom-Pom gun. Pestarini had developed a similar system for the Italian navy. The original design used a single Metadyne to supply a constant current to the armatures of motors mounted on several guns. Each was then controlled by manually adjusting the field current. Tustin, who did most of the design work, found that the system had a large time constant, due to the inductance of the field windings. In order to improve its response, he supplied the field windings with a constant current, and used a partially compensated Metadyne to control the armature current of each motor. Tustin compared Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> systems, Metadynes and Amplidynes, and accepted that each had its merits, but favoured the Metadyne, of which he had several years experience from their use in traction control.|$|E
50|$|A Ward <b>Leonard</b> <b>control</b> {{is usually}} used for {{controlling}} a shunt or compound wound DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a speed-controlled motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} drive trawl winch, a {{thyristor}} <b>leonard</b> <b>control</b> system or a commutatorless motor {{system has been}} used. However, a current source inverter-squirrel-cage induction motor drive system {{will be used to}} drive trawl winch because of its full four-quadrant regenerative capability, fuseless short-circuit proof capability and overall ruggedness. In this paper, the current source inverter-induction motor system for trawl winch is designed and tested. A vector control algorithm which is described by a assembly language is run by the microprocessor V 20 (NEC). A DC machine driven by a chopper is used to simulate the speed-torque characteristics of the trawlnet. The armature current with some patterns is controlled by the chopper, so that the load torque of the induction motor is controlled also. The experimental results are shown to demonstrate the satisfactory speed control for the sine-wave change of load torque...|$|E

40|$|In the shrew-like {{marsupial}} Antechinus stuartii {{from eastern}} Australia, {{there is an}} abrupt and total mortality of males after a 7 to 10 -day mating period in August or September (Woolley, 1966; Wood, 1970). Males isolated in the laboratory before mating survive beyond the time of natural mortality (Wood, 1970). Barnett (1973) observed increased peripheral corticosteroid concentrations in males taken from natural populations in the last weeks of life. To test whether this change could be a cause of the mortality, exogenous cortisol was injected into laboratory-held males. Male A. stuartii were captured before the mating period in July 1973 and 1974 at Powelltown, Victoria, and caged singly under the natural Melbourne photoperiod. Their average initial body weight was 30 - 1 ± 3 - 6 g (= 38). In each year they were divided into three groups: two experimental groups received i. m. injections of 1 or 10 mg cortisol acetate (Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Rathway, New Jersey, U. S.

30|$|The {{study of}} {{extraction}} phenol from coal tar is mainly {{based on the}} properties of polarity and acid. The mature alkali wash method, which is widely used in industry, {{is based on the}} acid properties of phenol compounds. However, the alkali washing method has some obvious drawbacks, including easy emulsification, equipment corrosion problems and serious pollution (Liu and Qang 2001; Jia and Jia 2008; Ye et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2011). The solvent extraction method is based on the polarity property of phenol, which will be the developing direction of extraction phenol from coal tar, and it has many advantages, such as low price, nontoxic extraction agent, corrosion-free, moderate operation conditions, no waste water and no exhaust gas in the course of production (Tiwari and Sen 1991; Wu et al. 2001; Liu and Xie 2014). The extraction method has been used in industry (Zong et al. 2013), yet the most adopted solvent extraction equipment is the mixer-settler, which have obvious disadvantages of large liquid holdup, significant solvent loss, long mixing and refining time, large land occupied and only intermittent operation. In contrast, centrifugal extractor has many advantages, such as compact structure, high treatment capacity, low liquid holdup, high mass transfer effect, convenient for starting and stopping, remote automatic <b>control</b> (<b>Leonard</b> et al. 1997; Fu 2004; Li and Yuan 2007). With the above advantages, some chemical plants have begun to treat phenol waste water with the centrifugal extractor (Xu et al. 1999; Yu et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2001; Tang et al. 2012; Mishra et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|Peas (Pisum sativum L.) were inoculated with {{strains of}} Rhizobium leguminosarum having {{different}} levels of uptake hydrogenase (Hup) activity and were grown in sterile <b>Leonard</b> jars under <b>controlled</b> conditions. Rates of H 2 evolution and acetylene reduction were determined for intact nodulated roots at intervals after the onset of darkness or after removal of the shoots. Hup activity was estimated using treatment plants or equivalent plants from the growth chamber, by measuring the uptake of H 2 or 3 H 2 {{in the presence of}} acetylene. In all cases, the rate of H 2 evolution was a continuous function of the rate of acetylene reduction. In symbioses with no demonstrable Hup activity, H 2 evolution increased in direct proportion to acetylene reduction and the slopes were similar with the Hup− strains NA 502 and 128 C 79. Hup activity was similar in strains 128 C 30 and 128 C 52 but significantly lower in strain 128 C 54. With these strains, the slopes of the H 2 evolution versus acetylene reduction curves initially increased with acetylene reduction, but became constant and similar to those for the Hup− strains at high rates of acetylene reduction. On these parallel portions of the curves, the decreases in H 2 evolution by Hup+ strains were similar in magnitude to their H 2 -saturated rates of Hup activity. The curvilinear relationship between H 2 evolution and acetylene reduction for a representative Hup+ strain (128 C 52) was the same, regardless of the experimental conditions used to vary the nitrogenase activity...|$|R
