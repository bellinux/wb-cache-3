5000|$|Wireless {{ambulatory}} electrocardiography (ECG) {{is a type}} of ambulatory electrocardiography with {{recording devices}} that use wireless technology, such as Bluetooth and smartphones, for at-home cardiac monitoring (monitoring of heart rhythms). These devices are generally recommended to people who have been previously diagnosed with arrhythmias and want to have them monitored, or for those who have suspected arrhythmias and need to be monitored {{over an extended period of}} time in order to be diagnosed. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs work in a way similar to a regular ECG by measuring the electrical potential of the heart through the skin. The data is saved on an application on a Smart Phone, and then uploaded to a computer through Bluetooth or Cloud technologies. The information can also be sent through these technologies or through email to a doctor or cardiac technician. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs are able to provide voice alarm messages when cardiac abnormalities occur, such as bradycardia, and can record this information and provide a screen prompt for the patient to view the data. The devices can also store mass amounts of ECG data on the phone, replay the ECG readings at a high speed, and have a <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>alarm</b> function to not waste the battery life. These characteristics of the devices are seen as benefits in comparison to current ambulatory ECG monitoring equipment such as the Holter monitor.|$|E

40|$|L OW voltage of the QRS {{deflections}} in {{the standard}} limb leads has engaged the attention of many investigators {{since the early days}} of electrocardi-ography, and the significance attributed to it has undergone. many fluctuations. In recent years, since the use of precordial leads has become more widespread, various reports have appeared on <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> occurring in these leads. Several attempts have been made to show some correlation linking <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the two types of leads, but there has been little agreement among different writers as to whether any correlation of this kind exists. There is, furthermore, no con-sensus as to whether <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the precordial leads is of any important sig-nificance. The present study was undertaken partly to ascertain whether <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the precordial leads has, as a rule, the same or a different origin than <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> in the limb leads and whether it should be regarded as more, or less, important. Before proceeding to a consideration of our findings it may be profitable to review some of the earlier work on the significance of <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> occurring in the limb leads, in the precordial leads, or in both.

40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage circuits on SiC has profound applications. SiC power devices have proved their superiority {{in terms of}} high temperature operation, faster switching frequencies and larger power densities when compared with Si power devices. The control of SiC power devices however, lies {{in the hands of}} <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> circuits built on Si. Thus, there exists a separation in the overall system between the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> and high voltage side, which increases system cost, weight and reduces efficiency. With the advancement in <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC processing technology, <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> control circuits can be made on the same die as power devices, and power systems will become compact, robust and more efficient. A new <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> process in 4 H-SiC has been characterized and modeled. In order to design circuits with the <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> process, designers need accurate device models for simulation. Currently, there exist no compact models in the public domain for <b>low</b> <b>voltage</b> SiC MOSFETs. This work aims at filling that void, by providing a modified PSP model for SiC MOSFETs. In addition, a new compact model for SiC power MOSFETs has also been developed and validated with characterization data from a commercially available 1200 V, 20 A power MOSFET. A gate driver chip has been designed and fabricated in 4 H-SiC using the developed models.
