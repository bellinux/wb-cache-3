40|$|Background: Costs of {{inpatient}} days {{in hospitals}} are frequently the main drivers of total treatment costs, <b>and</b> their <b>unit</b> cost can markedly affect {{the outcomes of}} an economic evaluation. In many countries, the availability of unit cost data is <b>limited</b> <b>and</b> <b>unit</b> costs are often {{based on data from}} hospitals participating in clinical trials. Objective: To provide data about unit costs of inpatient hospital days in The Netherlands from a healthcare provider's perspective and to give an insight into the extent to which cost categories and total costs differ between hospitals. Design: Unit costs were collected from 22 wards and 11 intensive care units (ICUs) of general and university hospitals involved in clinical trials with `piggybacked' economic evaluations. Direct costs, such as costs of nursing and medical materials, were calculated by dividing the annual cost per category of the nursing department by the annual number of inpatient days. Indirect costs, such as overheads and accommodation, were allocated to the nursing departments by applying direct allocation. All costs were expressed in 1998 euros (EUR). Results: The mean costs per inpatient day were EUR 230 (range: EUR 154 -EUR 311) in general hospitals and EUR 323 (range: EUR 209 -EUR 400) in university hospitals. The mean costs per inpatient day in an ICU were EUR 1125 (EUR 919 -EUR 1560). Between 38 - 48 % of the total costs were made up of nursing costs. All cost categories showed wide variations between hospitals. Conclusions: The results of this study were used to develop standard costs for inpatient days in The Netherlands and may contribute to the comparability and generalisability of economic evaluations.

However, a controlled and closed console commercial game environment pose challenges to researchers interested in observing player activities, constructing player strategy models, and developing practical AI technology in them. Instead of setting up new programming environments or building {{a large amount of}} agent’s decision rules by player’s experience for conducting real-time AI research, the authors use replays of the commercial RTS game StarCraft to evaluate human player behaviors and to construct an intelligent system to learn human-like decisions and behaviors.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we enter the}} world of {{application}} development for modern smartphones with focus on declarative methods for designing user inter-faces combined with the orientation awareness feature. Software development tools are taking declarative user interface languages into use in order to separate the outer appearance from inner functionality. This is to facilitate user experience creation for the application and allow development of user interfaces independently of the functionality itself. Orientation awareness means that the device is able to detect if it is posi-tioned vertically or turned 90 degrees to maximize horizontal width. The function is a natural consequence {{of the fact that}} the screen real estate of a mobile device is severely <b>limited</b> <b>and</b> the <b>unit</b> is easily turned. The use case is an orientation aware calculator that gets added buttons for scientific functionality in landscape mode, much like the calculator bundled with Apple’s iPhone OS equipped devices. The chosen platforms for this research are Android by Google with its Eclipse based SDK, the iPhone by Apple with its Xcode development suite and Qt Quick by Nokia with its Qt Creator IDE. We find out that the paths chosen for the platforms are quite different from each other.

To date no definitive critical value limit recommendations have been produced regarding therapeutic drug monitoring. Some laboratories choose to publish critical value lists online. These publicly available values may be accessed and potentially utilized by laboratory staff, patient care providers, and patients. Materials and Methods: A web-based search of laboratories associated with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education pathology residency programs was initiated to determine which therapeutic drugs had critical values and to examine the degree of variation in published critical values for these institutions. Results: Of the 107 institutions with university-based pathology training programs, 36 had published critical values online for review. Thirteen therapeutic drugs were investigated {{and the number of}} institutions reporting critical value limits for the drug, as well as the median, range, standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation of critical value concentration limits for each drug were determined. A number of the online critical value limits were deemed to be erroneous, most likely due to incorrectly listed units of measurement. Conclusions: There was a large degree of heterogeneity with regard to the chosen critical value limits for therapeutic drugs. This wide variance in critical values appears to be greater than that observed in interassay proficiency testing. Institutions should reexamine the rationale for their current critical value parameters and ensure that critical value <b>limits</b> <b>and</b> associated <b>units</b> are accurately published online...|$|R
