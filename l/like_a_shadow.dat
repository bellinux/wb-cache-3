25|$|Troubled by this paradox, Gerard 't Hooft {{analyzed}} the emission of Hawking radiation in more detail. He noted that when Hawking radiation escapes, {{there is a}} way in which incoming particles can modify the outgoing particles. Their gravitational field would deform the horizon of the black hole, and the deformed horizon could produce different outgoing particles than the undeformed horizon. When a particle falls into a black hole, it is boosted relative to an outside observer, and its gravitational field assumes a universal form. 't Hooft showed that this field makes a logarithmic tent-pole shaped bump on the horizon of a black hole, and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> the bump is an alternative description of the particle's location and mass. For a four-dimensional spherical uncharged black hole, the deformation of the horizon is similar to the type of deformation which describes the emission and absorption of particles on a string-theory world sheet. Since the deformations on the surface are the only imprint of the incoming particle, and since these deformations would have to completely determine the outgoing particles, 't Hooft believed that the correct description of the black hole would be by some form of string theory.|$|E
500|$|Fellini's {{creative}} process for La Strada started with vague feelings, [...] "a kind of tone", he said, [...] "that lurked, {{which made me}} melancholy {{and gave me a}} diffused sense of guilt, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> hanging over me. This feeling suggested two people who stay together, although it will be fatal, and they don't know why". These feelings evolved into certain images: snow silently falling on the ocean, various compositions of clouds, and a singing nightingale. At that point, Fellini started to draw and sketch these images, a habitual tendency that he claimed he had learned early in his career when he had worked in various provincial music halls and had to sketch out the various characters and sets. Finally, he reported that the idea first [...] "became real" [...] to him when he drew a circle {{on a piece of paper}} to depict Gelsomina's head, and he decided to base the character on the actual character of Giulietta Masina, his wife of five years at the time: [...] "I utilized the real Giulietta, but as I saw her. I was influenced by her childhood photographs, so elements of Gelsomina reflect a ten-year-old Giulietta." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{she spread}} her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She swept over the garden <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> she sailed through the grove.|$|E
60|$|Started out early. Calm, cool, foggy morning; rather dark. Sea smooth, swelling, heaving. Mysterious, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadowed</b> opal. Long {{mounds of}} water waved noiselessly, wonderfully, ethereally from the distance, {{and the air}} was hazy, veiled, and dim. A lonely, silent vastness.|$|R
60|$|When the {{two friends}} rose to depart, Trumps sank noiselessly on the ground <b>like</b> <b>a</b> filthy <b>shadow,</b> but the quick eye of the lawyer caught sight of his leg.|$|R
60|$|Louis stood {{suddenly}} before us. We {{felt his}} presence <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cold <b>shadow.</b> The laughter died {{away from her}} eyes, and I found it difficult enough to address him civilly.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{she spread}} her brown wings for flight, and soared into the air. She {{passed through the}} grove <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> she sailed across the garden.|$|E
60|$|So {{the ghostly}} figure which has haunted these pages, as it haunted my life, goes {{down into the}} impenetrable gloom. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> she first {{came to me in}} the {{loneliness}} of the night. <b>Like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> she passes away in the loneliness of the dead.|$|E
60|$|The Assistant {{took his}} hat, and passed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> to the door.|$|E
6000|$|Lady {{of heaven}} most pure and holy, [...] Artemis, fleet as the flying deer, [...] Glide through the dusk <b>like</b> <b>a</b> silver <b>shadow,</b> [...] Mirror thy brow in the lonely mere.|$|R
60|$|She was on {{the point}} of turning, {{to get back to the}} road, when {{something}} on the dark surface of the field, which looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> darker <b>shadow,</b> became dimly visible. In another moment it seemed to be <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> that moved. She ran towards it. It looked <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man as she drew nearer. The man stopped.|$|R
60|$|When Miss Oliver {{had gone}} to her own room and Rilla was lying on her bed in the moonlight, praying desperately for a little strength, Susan stepped in <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gaunt <b>shadow</b> and sat down beside her.|$|R
60|$|MORRIS. A spry fellow, your friend. He {{slipped through}} my hands <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow.</b>|$|E
60|$|Some of {{the bandits}} uttered an exclamation. Then silently, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> Jim Cleve entered.|$|E
60|$|He drank up his coffee, and {{followed}} the nurse, who had dissolved <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow.</b>|$|E
60|$|On the way down, John {{rolled a}} big stone {{down the hill}} and as it went bounding, {{crashing}} into the forest below, a deer drifted out <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gray <b>shadow</b> and swept along the hillside and over the ridge.|$|R
60|$|Clouds of dust rose as they rummaged {{among the}} {{mouldering}} mass, setting them coughing and sneezing. Now {{and then a}} great gray rat would shoot out beneath their very feet, and disappear, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sudden <b>shadow,</b> into some hole or cranny in the wall.|$|R
60|$|Plashwater Weir Mill Lock looked {{tranquil}} {{and pretty}} on an {{evening in the}} summer time. A soft air stirred {{the leaves of the}} fresh green trees, and passed <b>like</b> <b>a</b> smooth <b>shadow</b> over the river, and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> smoother <b>shadow</b> over the yielding grass. The voice of the falling water, like the voices of the sea and the wind, were as an outer memory to a contemplative listener; but not particularly so to Mr Riderhood, who sat on one of the blunt wooden levers of his lock-gates, dozing. Wine must be got into a butt by some agency before it can be drawn out; and the wine of sentiment never having been got into Mr Riderhood by any agency, nothing in nature tapped him.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she broke}} away, called a low, hurried good-by, and stole <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> into the darkness.|$|E
60|$|Lilly {{was quickly}} at {{the centre of}} the affair, {{unobtrusive}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> different from the other people.|$|E
60|$|But Martin turned away, {{leaving him}} to tell it to the barkeeper, until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming in, {{accepted}} Martin's invitation. Martin dispensed royal largess, inviting everybody up, farm-hands, a stableman, and the gardener's assistant from the hotel, the barkeeper, and the furtive hobo who slid in <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> hovered {{at the end of}} the bar.|$|E
60|$|The stray cat {{vanished}} <b>like</b> <b>a</b> swift, invisible <b>shadow.</b> The Mino {{glanced at}} Ursula, then looked from her disdainfully to his master.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} Maqua had crossed, and glided in a stealthy, stooping {{position}} towards the camp, seeming more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> moving <b>shadow</b> than <b>a</b> real man. When pretty close he went down {{on hands and knees}} and crept forward, with his scalping-knife between his teeth.|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} when she rose. Siegmund {{was not in}} sight. She tidied herself, and rather frightened, went to look for him. She saw him <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thick <b>shadow</b> on the earth. Now she was heavy with tears good to shed. She stood in silent sorrow, looking at him.|$|R
60|$|The {{door opened}} and <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> Nas Ta Bega slipped in. He said {{something}} in Navajo to the trader.|$|E
60|$|His figure crept <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> {{down the}} bright, sun-lighted street, so cheerful yet so solemn {{in the early}} summer morning; and slowly passed away.|$|E
60|$|Thus we lay, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> on {{the still}} bosom of the ocean, while the night closed in, {{and all around}} was calm, dark, and silent.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} dark to me? Something passed away, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> black <b>shadow.</b> But as it went, and the sun--O the blessed sun, how {{beautiful}} it is!--touched my face, I thought I saw a light white cloud pass {{out at the}} door. Was there nothing that went out?" ...|$|R
60|$|That {{night we}} sailed for Alacranes. It {{was a white}} night of the tropics, with a million stars {{blinking}} in the blue dome overhead, and the Caribbean Sea <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadowed</b> opal, calm and rippling and shimmering. The Xpit was not a bark of comfort. It had a bare deck and an empty hold. I could not stay below in that gloomy, ill-smelling pit, so I tried to sleep on deck. I lay on a hatch under the great boom, and what with its creaking, and the hollow roar of the sail, and the wash of the waves, and the dazzling starlight, I could not sleep. C. sat on a coil of rope, smoked, and watched in silence. I wondered about him then.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Durgin called out, [...] "Come in, Jackson," [...] and Westover looked {{round and}} saw the elder son <b>like</b> <b>a</b> gaunt <b>shadow</b> in the doorway. [...] "I've just got where I've told Mr. Westover where I want Jeff should go. It don't seem to have ca'd him off his feet any, either." ...|$|R
60|$|The two lads spurred {{their horses}} and rode {{recklessly}} {{through the trees}} towards the great gray beast, who seemed to flit <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> past them.|$|E

60|$|She {{kissed him}} and broke from his clasp. Then silently, <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>shadow,</b> {{with the white}} dog close beside her, she {{disappeared}} {{in the darkness of}} the river trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see it--more unwillingly than I can say. To {{associate}} that forlorn, friendless, lost woman, even by {{an accidental}} likeness only, with Miss Fairlie, seems <b>like</b> casting <b>a</b> <b>shadow</b> {{on the future}} of the bright creature who stands looking at us now. Let me lose the impression again as soon as possible. Call her in, out of the dreary moonlight--pray call her in!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{tried the}} door, which yielded to his hand, and was flung wide open {{by a sudden}} gust of wind that passed, as with a loud sigh, from the {{outermost}} portal through all the passages and apartments of the new house. It rustled the silken garments of the ladies, and waved the long curls of the gentlemen's wigs, and shook the window-hangings and the curtains of the bedchambers; causing everywhere a singular stir, which yet was more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> hush. <b>A</b> <b>shadow</b> of awe and half-fearful anticipation--nobody knew wherefore, nor of what--had all at once fallen over the company.|$|R
60|$|Peter didn't say {{anything}} {{but he looked}} guilty, and Spooky once more chuckled as he spread his wings and flew away so soundlessly that he seemed more <b>like</b> <b>a</b> drifting <b>shadow</b> than <b>a</b> bird. Then Peter started for a certain swamp he knew of {{where he would be}} sure to find enough bark to stay his appetite.|$|R
