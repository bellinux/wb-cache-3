Complexes of high and low oxidation state metals from the s- and p-blocks were targeted and these comprise the content of the experimental chapters two through five. Chapter one serves as a general introduction to rationalise the intent of this work. Herein, focus is drawn to the nascent field of organometallic main group chemistry {{in the form of a}} discussion of its history using pertinent recent examples from the literature. Chapter two details the synthesis of an emerging class of versatile bis(NHC) carbazolide pincer ligands; bimcaR, and their complexation to s-block metals. The development of a new zwitterionic bis(imidazolium) carbazolide proligand is discussed, as well as the structural metrics of new lithium and magnesium bimcaR derivatives. Specifically, a new iodomagnesium complex is probed for its synthetic utility as a ligand transfer agent and catalytic precursor in conjunction with attempts to access a reduced Mg(I) derivative. Chapter three focuses on the stabilising effect of the flanking bis(NHC) moieties of bimcaR on high valent group 13 metals and thusly presents a series of exceptionally stable bimcaR supported diiodides from aluminium to thallium. The indium and thallium diiodides are subjected to iodide-hydride exchange reactions to assess the stability of the resulting dihydrides, whilst efforts are also made to access <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> heavy group 13 congeners.

40|$|Transition metal alkyls play an {{important}} role in organometallic chemistry. Thus, exploration of uranium alkyls, which are relatively rare, has a high potential for new transformations. Homoleptic uranium(IV) tetra(alkyls) are difficult to isolate, due to their notorious instability at room temperature. Recently, tetrabenzyluranium, U(CH 2 C 6 H 5) 4, was synthesized, characterized, and showed reductive elimination chemistry with the use of redox active α-diimine and iminoquinone ligands. A family of homoleptic tetra(alkyls) with different para- and meta-substituted benzyl ligands has been explored to determine the generality of the synthetic method and the effect of ring substitution on complex stability and reductive elimination capabilities. The kinetics of the reductive elimination reaction from the uranium(IV) tetra alkyls induced by redox active ligands has been measured to better understand the rates of this process. ^ While uranium(IV) alkyls are rare and interesting, <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> uranium(III) alkyls examples are even more uncommon. By using large tridentate hydrotrispyrazolylborate type ligands to stabilize the reactive uranium metal center a family of uranium(III) alkyls could be synthesized. These compounds feature benzyl type ligands which have been shown to bind in different hapticities. The increased hapticity of the ligand offers increased stability by creating a more coordinatively saturated metal center. These <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> uranium alkyls have the potential for unique reactivity and can be used as precursors to uranium multiple bonds, such as imidos, oxos and sulfidos. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} described {{within this}} thesis revolves around two central themes, the reactivity of phosphaalkynes towards various substrates, and the synthesis and further studies of novel <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> group 13 and group 14 element complexes. The first chapter provides a general introduction to important concepts and molecules {{pertinent to the}} studies discussed herein, and provides a brief overview {{into the history of}} phosphaalkynes. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of a series of 3 H- 1, 2, 3, 4 -triazaphospholes via a regiospecific pathway between phosphaalkynes and organic azides. Such [2 + 4] cycloadditions have shown marked similarities to Sharpless’s alkyne-azide click reactions, and had prompted interest in exploring them as high yielding routes in accessing new multidentate N/P ligands. Chapter 3 concentrates on coupling reactions between phosphaalkynes and amidinato stabilised group 14 element(I) dimers, as there were no examples of such reactions in the literature at the outset of this study. These reactions have typically yielded unusual systems, and some preliminary theoretical studies and experimental work has gone into understanding the electronic nature of these products.

40|$|The {{inspiration}} {{behind the}} synthesis and reactivity {{studies of the}} f-block metal complexes generally originated from several well defined basic purposes. The main goals {{in the field of}} lanthanide and actinide centered chemistry could be separated onto: (i) exploration of the fondamental chemistry of f-block elements with their reactivity and coordination behavior; (ii) understanding the nature of the bonding interactions between the metal centers and the ligands as well as between different metal centers within the same heterometallic complex; and finally, (iii) exploration of the possibility to use new complexes in catalytic or sensor related applications. This thesis is manly focused on the investigation of the preparation and the reactivity investigation of the several <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> compounds of Sm, Tm, U and Th with non-cyclopentadienyl ligands. Despite exceptionally high reactivity and rather unpredicted transformations demonstrated by some of the species in this class, an overall picture of the chemical activity remained rather scattered and considerably poorly investigated. In attempt to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} reactivity patterns in the field of f-block metal chemistry Chapter 2 of this thesis explored the chemical behavior of Sm complexes supported by the bulky aryloxides ligands. Application of the aluminum alkyls led to the appearance of a new coordination mode of aryloxide ligands to lanthanide, affording an unusually stable Sm(II) compounds. Attempted insertion reactions afforded several new complexes and provided more information about the stabilization influence of Lewis acids in zwitterionic compounds. The application of similar strategy to Sm(III) species resulted in the isolation of rare non-cyclopentadienyl single component ethylene polymerization catalyst. In Chapter 3 the reaction of Tm complexes supported by the combination of dimethyl-pyrrole with aluminum alkyl produced a very unusual product of C-H bond activation by the Tm metal center. Utilization of the Lewis acidic aluminum alkyls enforced the ligand to thulium pi-bonding and a formation of Zwitterionic structure. Upon treatment with hydrogen or PhSiH 3 as hydrogenating agent the initial species exhibited a series of very unusual transformations, leading to the isolation of rare case of SiH 3 coordination to thef-block metal center. Chapter 4 discovered unexpected reactivity of uranium complex with bulky amido-ligand in halogen replacement alkylation processes or during the reduction of the metal center. The alkylation reactions yielded extensive gamma-deprotonation and formation of cluster compounds. Two first structurally characterized uranium carbines were discovered and documented in the course of this exploratory work. Reduction of the mixed Uranium amido-halogenates proceeded with the formation of transient <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> species and immediate re-oxidation at the expense of the ligand, affording new amido-imino- or amido-alkyl-complexes of U(V). Multiple attempts of lowering the oxidation state of uranium metal center supported by new bis-amido-benzene ligand, presented in Chapter 5, resulted in the isolation of several new solvent fragmentation products. The reactivity displayed by the related ligand systems together with the additional support, provided by the isolation of complexes of this type, suggested the presence of highly reactive <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> synthons. Reduction reactions afforded the new uranium complex with the lowest reported oxidation state of the metal centers. However, the DFT calculations revealed that all the excessive electron density was situated on the ligand delocalized pi-systems, forcing the ligand to act as electron storage. Chapter 6 discussed the possibility of sterically enforcing pi-bonding ligands to stabilize the <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> oxidation state of Th metal center. Utilization of the bis-pyrrolide base ligand allowed the isolation of the thorium complex with significant pi-interaction of the metal center with the aromatic system of the ligand. Reduction of this system afforded the isolation of the rare example of Th(III) complex. Similarly to the complexes of U reported in the previous chapter, DFT calculation displayed significant presence of the electronic density on the pi-system of the ligand fragment. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated by the reactivity examples that stored electronic density could be delivered back to the metal center, initiating the transformations expected for <b>low</b> <b>valent</b> f-block element compounds...|$|R
