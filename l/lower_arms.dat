25|$|Coil spring {{independent}} suspension features {{by way of}} a MacPherson strut type with stabilizer and strut bar up front, and a MacPherson rear setup with parallel <b>lower</b> <b>arms.</b> Steering uses a rack and pinion design; braking hardware is made up of front ventilated discs and rear drums with a double proportioning valve to suppress lock-up. Innovatively, a sensor is fitted to detect worn-out brake pads, alerted by use of an audible chime.|$|E

The wrist joint assembly includes a yaw axis and a pitch axis. The pitch axis is disposed in a spaced relationship to the yaw axis such that the axes are generally perpendicular.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} suspension system and its <b>lower</b> <b>arm.</b> These analyses were specifically applied on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> to determine its vibration and stress behaviour during its operation. The suspension system {{is one of the}} most important components of vehicle, which directly affects the safety, performance, noise level and style of it. The main objectives are to have less stress on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system as well as to reduce imposed load by optimization. The optimization of imposed load on <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system is directly related to imposed force on the vehicle created by the road. This load has a direct effect on the value of imposed force on <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> where the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> force will be minimized by reducing the applied load. Hence, genetic algorithms for optimization and MATLAB optimization toolbar are used, as well as, specific M-file codes have been developed into MATLAB for optimization. By determining optimized design values of suspension system for reducing road force, it is possible to survey vibration condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> according to frequency respond of suspension system and its natural frequency. Therefore, frequency response of its acceleration has been determined according to the whole mass of suspension system. Using FFT technique and making transfer function for frequency response of suspension system, will present responded frequency of suspension system which is using for vibration analysis. For stress analysis, load condition of <b>lower</b> suspension <b>arm</b> system must be determined in advance. Hence, a typical model of McPherson suspension system has been selected for analysis. According to the road profile considered for analysis and the velocity of vehicle, it is possible to obtain both velocity and acceleration equations for whole components of McPherson suspension system. These values are used to determine dynamic force condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> suspension system during its operation. By using dynamic forces which are governing on <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> of suspension system, in ABAQUS, the stress condition of <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> can be determined during its operation...|$|R

25|$|The {{culmination}} of the FYOP is the obstacle course. The obstacle course lasts over 2 hours and consists of twelve obstacles built by each squadron located around the college grounds. Obstacles such as a 12-foot wall and rope bridge are designed to test teamwork and physical fitness of First Years. The First Year flights are judged on {{the time it takes}} to complete each obstacle. The completion of the obstacle course signals the end of FYOP. Afterwards, First Years are given a parade where they are officially welcomed into RMC and join the Cadet Wing. Cadets are then allowed to see their friends and relatives, and are allowed the freedom to leave college grounds. In previous years cadets were required to wear their College uniform when leaving the college grounds, but as of 2017 this rule has been modified; cadets can now wear civilian business casual clothes. When attending formal events, the college uniform worn is the number 4s. This form of dress consists of dark blue pants with a red stripe down the side and a dark blue tunic. Badges can be put on both arms once earned. The year is also represented on the <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> by red ribbon; however, second year is the first to have any red ribbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The transverse spring was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E

2500|$|Making a wayang kulit {{figure that}} is {{suitable}} for a performance involves hand work that takes several weeks, with the artists working together in groups. They start from master models (typically on paper) which are traced out onto skin or parchment, providing the figures with an outline and with indications of any holes that {{will need to be}} cut (such as for the mouth or eyes). The figures are then smoothed, usually with a glass bottle, and primed. The structure is inspected and eventually the details are worked through. A further smoothing follows before individual painting, which is undertaken by yet another craftsman. Finally, the movable parts (upper arms, <b>lower</b> <b>arms</b> with hands and the associated sticks for manipulation) mounted on the body, which has a central staff by which it is held. A crew makes up to ten figures at a [...] time, typically completing that number {{over the course of a}} week. However, unfortunately there is not strong continuing demand for the top skills of wayang craftspersons and the relatively few experts still skilled at the art sometimes find it difficult to earn a satisfactory income.|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{sensitive}} factors influencing the arterial wall compliance. Pulse transit time (PTT) is one simple way to assess arterial compliance changes. This study investigated the relationship between external cuff pressure and pulse transit time. The study was performed on 10 subjects with different cuff pressures (0, 10, 20 and 30 mmHg) on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> upper arm and whole arm (with two cuffs applied simultaneously on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and upper arm). The overall mean pulse transit time difference with the above different cuff pressures on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> compared with that without cuff pressure were 3. 3 ms, 6. 9 ms, 10. 1 ms. With the cuff on the upper arm, changes with increasing cuff pressure were greater, which were 3. 7 ms, 8. 5 ms and 13. 1 ms. And for the whole arm, the changes were 5. 6 ms, 11. 6 ms and 18. 0 ms, which were greater still. The mean PTT when the cuff pressure was applied to the whole arm was significantly larger (P< 0. 001) than the corresponding mean PTT when the cuff pressure was separately applied to the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> and upper arm. The mean PTT with the cuff on upper arm was also significantly larger than the corresponding mean PTT with the cuff on the <b>lower</b> <b>arm,</b> except with a cuff pressure of 10 mmHg. The sum of PTT changes with the cuff on the upper and the <b>lower</b> <b>arm</b> was significantly larger than that with the cuff on whole arm. A conclusion was made that when the external cuff pressure increased, arterial wall compliance increased, which was detected with increased pulse transit time. 1...|$|R
