On the night of the initial incident they reported that the only lights visible were from the Orford lighthouse. They attributed the indentations in the ground to animals. The Suffolk constabulary file on the case was released in 2005 under the UK’s Freedom of Information Act and can be accessed on their website. It includes a letter dated 28 July 1999 written by Inspector Mike Topliss who notes that one of the police constables who attended the scene on the first night returned to the site in daylight in case he had missed something. [...] "There was nothing to be seen and he remains unconvinced that the occurrence was genuine," [...] wrote Topliss.

50|$|The Colonial Marines gain credits {{by killing}} enemies and {{repairing}} atmosphere processors, and these credits {{can be put}} toward upgrading troop abilities and calling in new units via dropships that stop at nearby <b>landing</b> <b>beacons.</b> There are a diverse number of marine combat units, including pulse rifle-equipped infantry, flamethrower troopers, and smartgunners. The Marines also have three support units, one for healing and a synthetic which can deploy gun turrets and has a motion detector for picking up offscreen movement, the third unit, the commtech is the basic support unit, {{whose job it is}} to call for extra troops and repair atmosphere processors.|$|R

50|$|The colony {{is powered}} by {{free-standing}} solar panels which are located within the colony. These provide power in order to recharge the droid's shields and weapons {{as well as for}} the <b>landing</b> <b>beacon</b> (required when a spaceship is about to land). Unfortunately, the insects chew these to pieces as well and can devastate the colony's power supply if not checked. As with fencing, the droid can repair damaged panels at the correct storehouse as well as find replacements for destroyed panels.|$|E
50|$|Two dropships are {{deployed}} to the Primary Operations Complex (POC), {{but they are}} separated by hurricane winds and one is damaged, and {{they are forced to}} take a passage route to one of the abandoned landing beacons far away from the POC. It falls to Harrison to restore power and activate the <b>landing</b> <b>beacon.</b> When he tries to restore the local security grid, he awakens the Xenomorphs that had lain dormant following their conquest of the POC. Most of the Marines are able to evacuate, but Sgt. Hall is captured by the Aliens. Harrison tracks her to a part of the POC which has been converted to a Hive, but he finds that Hall has been impregnated with a Chestburster. She dies as Harrison finds her, and Harrison shoots her in the chest to prevent the Chestburster from coming out.|$|E
50|$|Harrison finds {{several members}} of White Team, but they are all killed by Xenomorphs and Predators before Harrison can {{activate}} the <b>landing</b> <b>beacon</b> for an incoming dropship. Harrison manages to kill a Predator himself before reaching the dropship. Tomiko transmits the coordinates of an old entry site to the Hive, and Harrison, now in his own Exosuit, proceeds after his fellow Marines whom Rykov has stranded. Along the way, he must clear an infestation from some ancient extraterrestrial technology. His Exosuit is damaged during a fall, and he must proceed {{the rest of the}} way on foot. He locates his team in a massive chamber where the fossilized remains of an Engineer reside. A Xenomorph Queen attacks the squad, but Harrison is able to repel the Queen so that he and the rest of the Marines can escape via dropship. The Queen tries to stop them, but the dropship bombards her with missiles, killing her.|$|E

50|$|In July 1944, {{the newest}} {{version of the}} Lichtenstein SN-2 VHF-band radar, and the Flensburg radar {{detector}} meant to find the mid-VHF emissions of the Monica tail warning radar systems of RAF bombers, fell into Allied hands when a fully equipped Ju 88G-1, of 7 Staffel/NJG 2, flew the wrong way on a <b>landing</b> <b>beacon</b> and landed at RAF Woodbridge by accident, with the crew not realizing the mistake {{until it was too}} late to destroy the radar or the aircraft's FuG 25a Erstling IFF gear - it was never fitted with the Naxos radar detector, which required a teardrop-shaped radome atop the Ju 88G's canopy for its motorized-rotation antenna. Interrogation of the crew revealed that the Flensburg system detected the RAF bombers' Monica radar units' emissions, and that it was actually useful as a homing system. This was all to the great relief of everyone involved; Monica was already being replaced by Fishpond systems on most aircraft, and any still equipped with Monica were told to turn it off. H2S remained in use for the rest of the war.|$|E

50|$|Once {{plenty of}} {{mushrooms}} have been grown and safely packed-away for pick-up the player {{can send a}} message to Earth to have a spaceship sent en route to the colony to pick up. The player can also order supplies (extra seeds, fencing, panels and other useful items) for the ship to deliver. The game provides an ETA for the ship which the player must keep an eye on. The ship requires the colony's <b>landing</b> <b>beacon</b> to be on when it arrives. If the beacon is on then the ship will land at the landing-bay (the player must not be on this screen at the time or the droid will be crushed!), drop off its crates of supplies there and pay for the mushrooms (the money can be used when next ordering supplies). If the beacon is not on, the ship will dump all the supplies at random in the surrounding desert and many of them will be lost to the aliens. The beacon drains the colony's power-supply quickly so it is important to only leave it on as long as necessary and also to ensure that the colony's power-storage is suitably high before activating it.|$|E
40|$|Design {{criteria}} and technology requirements {{for a system}} of radar reference devices to be fixed to the surfaces of the inner planets are discussed. Offshoot applications {{include the use of}} radar corner reflectors as <b>landing</b> <b>beacons</b> on the planetary surfaces and some deep space applications that may yield a greatly enhanced knowledge of the gravitational and electromagnetic structure of the solar system. Passive retroreflectors with dimensions of about 4 meters and weighing about 10 kg are feasible for use with orbiting radar at Venus and Mars. Earth-based observation of passive reflectors, however, would require very large and complex structures to be delivered to the surfaces. For Earth-based measurements, surface transponders offer a distinct advantage in accuracy over passive reflectors. A conceptual design for a high temperature transponder is presented. The design appears feasible for the Venus surface using existing electronics and power components...|$|R

5000|$|By late 1943, the Luftwaffe was {{starting}} to deploy the greatly improved FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, operating on a lower frequency of 90 MHz (lower end of the US VHF FM broadcast band) which was far less affected by electronic jamming, but this required the much larger Hirschgeweih (stag's antlers) antennas, with only eight dipole elements, looking like a much-enlarged version of what occupied the forward end of {{each one of the}} earlier quadruple Matratze masts. This aerial setup also produced tremendous drag and slowed the operating aircraft by up to 50 km/h (30 mph). The first SN-2 set had a problem with a huge minimum range of 500 meters, initially requiring the retention of a supplementary B/C or C-1 set with its full set of four Matratze masts, but the alarming drag that full sets of both types of antennas caused, from both radars being installed, later changed the requirement to only a [...] "one-quarter" [...] subset of the earlier Matratze array {{at the end of a}} single mast, centrally mounted on the nose of the aircraft when the BC or C-1 UHF radar remained installed. Improvements in early 1944 led to newer SN-2 versions with lower minimum range, which allowed the older UHF radar system to be removed entirely. In July 1944, the newest version of the SN-2 radar fell into Allied hands when a fully equipped Ju 88 G-1, of 7 Staffel/NJG 2, flew the wrong way on a <b>landing</b> <b>beacon</b> and landed in England by accident, with the crew not realising the mistake until it was too late to destroy the radar or IFF gear. This led to successful jamming of several frequency bands of the FuG 220 (I to III, 72, 81 and 90 MHz), and a partial adoption of the use of the low-to-mid VHF band FuG 216 and 217 Neptun radar — which used eight shorter-length dipoles in the same [...] "stag's antlers" [...] layout for its frequency ranges than the SN-2 did — but several other bands that the SN-2 used were still operational. After the Allied jammings the FuG 220 antenna setup was optimized for the still-operational bands, the 90-degree vertical dipole setup was changed to a 45-degree diagonal setup.|$|E

50|$|In the 17th century, {{the first}} <b>land</b> <b>beacons</b> were {{constructed}} at Thorskär, Söderarm. In 1839, the lighthouse was built {{and the island}} staffed. The light ran on colza oil, and mirrors reflected it. More houses and buildings were added during the 19th century. In 1882, a kerosone lamp replaced the old lamp, but the mirrors remained until 1928 when a third order lens and Gustaf Daléns AGA-light replaced the old equipment. In 1953, the light was finally electrified and automated. The station was, however, staffed until September 1997. In 1999, a small aerobeacon mounted on a metallic mast replaced the traditional light, which was deactivated and taken away by the Swedish Maritime Administration {{in the summer of}} 2007. Söderarm had been seen as a typical example of a lighthouse not needed for modern commercial shipping. However, the old lens and light equipment remains, and plans to reactivate the lighthouse have been discussed. The metallic mast was removed in the autumn of 2009. A conference company currently promotes activity in the old light station buildings. Overnight accommodations are available in the keeper's house. Söderam is frequently reported as a weather station in the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) shipping news. The lighthouse has been protected by Swedish law since 1935 as a culturally important building.|$|R
