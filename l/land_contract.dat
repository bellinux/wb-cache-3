While in some instances <b>land</b> <b>contracts</b> afford unscrupulous sellers the opportunity to take advantage of prospective homebuyers, they also provide an alternative avenue for home ownership. Low-income buyers, who might not otherwise receive conventional bank financing for purchasing a home, can receive seller financing and can have more influence in negotiating the terms of the agreement. The question still remains, are <b>land</b> <b>contracts</b> a viable route to homeownership or are they a risky venture that needs federal oversight to prohibit nontraditional buyers from being taken advantage of...|$|R

50|$|Although most <b>land</b> <b>contracts</b> can be {{used for}} a variety of reasons, their most common use is as a form of {{short-term}} seller financing. Usually, but not always, the date on which the full amount of the purchase price is due will be years sooner than when the purchase price would be paid in full according to the amortization schedule. This results in the final payment being a large balloon payment. Since the amount of the final payment is so large, the buyer may obtain a conventional mortgage loan from a bank to make the final payment. <b>Land</b> <b>contracts</b> are sometimes used by buyers who do not qualify for conventional mortgage loans offered by a traditional lending institution, for reasons of unestablished or poor credit or an insufficient down payment. <b>Land</b> <b>contracts</b> are also used when the seller is eager to sell and the buyer is not given enough time to arrange for conventional financing.|$|R

When third party lenders are involved, typically a lien, as part of a mortgage or trust deed, is placed on the property, in which the property serves as collateral until the loan is repaid.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>land</b> <b>contract</b> — often {{described}} by other terminology listed below — is a contract between the buyer and seller of real property {{in which the}} seller provides the buyer financing in the purchase, and the buyer repays the resulting loan in installments. Under a <b>land</b> <b>contract,</b> the seller retains the legal title to the property, while permitting the buyer to take possession of it for most purposes other than legal ownership. The sale price is typically paid in periodic installments, often with a balloon payment at the end to make the timelength of payments shorter than in the corresponding fully amortized loan (i.e., a loan without a final balloon payment). When the full purchase price has been paid including any interest, the seller is obligated to convey (to the buyer) legal title to the property. An initial down payment from the buyer to the seller is usually also required.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} for the {{installment}} payments {{of the purchase price}} to be similar to mortgage payments in amount and effect. The amount is often determined according to a mortgage amortization schedule. In effect, each installment payment is partial payment of the purchase price and partial payment of interest on the unpaid purchase price. This is similar to mortgage payments which are part repayment of the principal amount of the mortgage loan and part interest. As the buyer pays more toward the principal of the loan over time, his(her) equity (equitable title or equitable interest) in the property increases. For example, if a buyer pays a $2000 down payment and borrows $8000 for a $10000 parcel of land, and pays off in installments another $4000 of this loan (not including interest), the buyer has $6000 of equity in the land (which is 60% of the equitable title), but the seller holds legal title to the land as recorded in documentation (deeds) in a government recorder's office until the loan is completely paid off. However, if the buyer defaults on installment payments, the <b>land</b> <b>contract</b> may consider the failure to timely pay installments a breach of contract and the land equity may revert to the seller, depending on the <b>land</b> <b>contract</b> provisions.|$|E

30|$|Realizing that {{frequent}} land reallocation {{and abusive}} land requisition {{has led to}} the insecurity of the land-use rights of farmers, the government has taken various action to promote land tenure security (Tao and Xu 2007). In 2002, China passed the Rural <b>Land</b> <b>Contracting</b> Law (RLCL) into law (Li 2003). This law goes beyond previous attempts to secure the land rights of farmers. 1 The RLCL requires farmers and collectives be issued with written contracts and certificates to confirm their land-use rights. These <b>land</b> <b>contracts</b> have a duration of 30  years. The RLCL focuses on four areas, namely (i) a stricter definition of land rights as property rights rather than just private contracts, (ii) a ban on large-scale reallocations of land and limiting small-scale readjustments with clear conditions, (iii) permitting land transfer between households, and (iv) a commitment to issuance of land documents (Deininger et al. 2012).|$|R

By explaining the concepts and their mutual relations, we can readily perceive the essence of overall contract and distribution. ...|$|R
