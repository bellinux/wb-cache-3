Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can modulate primary motor cortex excitability, increasing (anodal stimulation) or decreasing (cathodal stimulation) excitability in underlying cortical tissue. The present study investigated whether lateralized differences in choice-RT would result from the concurrent modulation of <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> cortices using bi-hemispheric tDCS. Participants completed a choice-RT task requiring either a left or right wrist extension. In forced-choice trials an illuminated target indicated the required response, whereas in free-choice trials participants freely selected either response upon illumination of a central fixation. Following a pre-test trial block, offline bi-hemispheric tDCS (1 mA) was applied over the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> cortices for 10 minutes, which {{was followed by a}} post-tDCS block of RT trials. Twelve participants completed three experimental sessions, two with real tDCS (anode right, anode left), as well as a sham tDCS session. Post-tDCS results showed faster RTs for both right and left responses irrespective of tDCS polarity during forced-choice trials, while sham tDCS had no effect. In contrast, no stimulation-related RT or response selection differences were observed in free-choice trials. The present study shows evidence of an effector-independent speeding of response initiation in a forced-choice RT task following bi-hemispheric tDCS and yields novel information regarding the functional effect of bi-hemispheric tDCS...|$|E

Such an EEG-based braincomputer interface (BCI) can provide a new communication channel to replace an impaired motor function. It can be used by, e. g., patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to develop a simple binary response in order to reply to specific questions. Four subjects participated in a series of on-line sessions with an EEG-based cursor control. The EEG was recorded from electrodes overlying sensory-motor areas during <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> imagery. The EEG signals were analyzed in subject-specific frequency bands and classified on-line by a neural network. The network output was used as a feedback signal. The on-line error (100 %—perfect classification) was between 10. 0 and 38. 1 %. In addition, the single-trial data were also analyzed off-line by using an adaptive autoregressive (AAR) model of order 6. With a linear discriminant analysis the estimated parameters for <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> imagery were separated. The error rate obtained varied between 5. 8 and 32. 8 % and was, on average, better than the on-line results.

40|$|The {{capacity}} {{of the human brain}} to interpret and respond to multiple temporal scales in its surroundings suggests that its internal interactions must also be able to operate over a broad temporal range. In this paper, we utilise a recently introduced method for characterising the rate of change of the phase difference between MEG signals and use it to study the temporal structure of the phase interactions between MEG recordings from the <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> cortices during rest and during a finger-tapping task. We use the Hilbert transform to estimate moment-to-moment fluctuations of the phase difference between signals. After confirming the presence of scale-invariance we estimate the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). An exponent of > 0. 5 is indicative of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the signal. We find that LRTCs are present in the alpha/mu and beta frequency bands of resting state MEG data. We demonstrate that finger movement disrupts LRTCs correlations, producing a phase relationship with a structure similar to that of Gaussian white noise. The results are validated by applying the same analysis to data with Gaussian white noise phase difference, recordings from an empty scanner and phase-shuffled time series. We interpret the findings through comparison of the results with those we obtained from an earlier study during which we adopted this method to characterise phase relationships within a Kuramoto model of oscillators in its sub-critical, critical and super-critical synchronisation states. We find that the resting state MEG from <b>left</b> <b>and</b> <b>right</b> <b>motor</b> cortices shows moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase difference with a similar temporal structure to that of a system of Kuramoto oscillators just prior to its critical level of coupling, and that finger tapping moves the system away from this pre-critical state towards a more random state...|$|E
