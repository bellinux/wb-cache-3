40|$|The {{mineralogy}} of the sulphosalts is {{not well}} understood, principally because of the very wide variations in chemical composition of the natural examples and their common admixture with other sulphide mineral species. The synthesis of pure sulphosalt compositions {{is considered to be}} a valuable means of solving the problems involved. Changes in characteristic physical properties can then be measured as elements are substituted systematically into the structure. A typical sulphosalt, tetrahedrite, general formula (CuAg) (_ 10) (ZnFeCu) (_ 2) (SbAs) (_ 4) S(_ 13) was selected for study by synthesis in sealed evacuated silica glass capsules. The phase relations of the Cu-Sb-S: system were studied. Phases obtained were: tetrahedrite, Cu(_ 12) Sb(_ 4) S(_ 13); non-stoichiometric tetrahedrite, Cu(_ 13. 04) Sb(_ 3. 86) S(_ 13), which has high and low temperature cubic polymorphs; stibioluzonite, Cu(_ 3) SbS(_ 4); chalcostibite, CuSbS(_ 2); and Gu(_ 3) SbS(_ 3). Substitution of As for Sb in tetrahedrite (the tetrahedrite-tennantite series) was found to result in a decrease in cubic cell edge, increase in microhardness, decrease in reflectivity and slight changes in quantitative colour measurements. Non-stoichiometry of the series also affected these properties. Substitution of Zn and Fe for Cu in tetrahedrite resulted in an increase in cubic cell edge, increase in microhardness and increase in reflectivity. Substitution of Ag for Cu resulted in an increase in unit cell edge, decrease in microhardness and decrease in reflectivity.

40|$|Preharvest, harvest, and postharvest factor(s) were {{examined}} {{to identify the}} causes of premature quality loss during long term coolstorage of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). Investigation centred around the role of mechanical damage and calcium {{in the development of}} softening disorders, including soft patches (localised soft areas on fruit surface), premature softening, and <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>breakdown</b> (LTB) during storage. Kiwifruit were vulnerable to compression and impact from harvest onwards, with damage usually being expressed after a period of coolstorage. Physical damage normally just affected the fruit tissue in direct contact with the applied force. Impact damage, {{and to a lesser extent}} compression damage, depended on the size of the force and firmness of fruit when damaged. As kiwifruit softened, their susceptibility to soft patch development as a result of physical damage increased whereas the likelihood of flesh fracture in response to impact declined. These changes are attributed to the change in nature of the flesh, which is 'brittle' at harvest and 'viscoelastic' after softening. Physical damage to coolstored kiwifruit caused a slight drop in final firmness whereas there was no effect on firmness if it occurred at harvest. Fruit with softening disorders consistently had lower calcium contents (about 12 % less) than equivalent healthy fruit. Fruit with soft patches had a high phosphate content, low dry matter, and at harvest, a low soluble solids content. A causative role for calcium in soft patch development was demonstrated by preharvest calcium treatments that elevated calcium content of the harvested fruit. Other orchard factor(s) were probably the cause of a weaker relationship between calcium content at harvest and storage behaviour of fruit. Although firmness at harvest declined with later picking, after coolstorage, fruit harvested more mature had a higher firmness and lower incidence of LTB. Symptoms for LTB were consistent with chilling injury whereas soft patches appeared to be due to localised premature senescence and not low temperature. A conceptual model of key factor(s) which cause the initiation and development of softening disorders in kiwifruit is proposed. Implications of this model for further investigation of these phenomena and for commercial handling of fruit are discussed. Further development of this model to produce a predictive model of fruit storage potential would require further characterisation of other important influences in storage behaviou...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of current filaments in n-type GaAs {{due to the}} <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> impurity <b>breakdown</b> has been investigated in crossed electric and magnetic fields with a laser scanning microscope. In a highly compensated, low mobility, epitaxial layer the lateral displacement and stretching of a filament due to the Lorentz force has been observed at currents slightly larger than those required to form a filament between point contacts. The transverse elongation of the filament increases linearly with rising magnetic field strength until the filament is disrupted. In this case periodic current oscillations are generated by a repetitive filament ignition and extinction. The elongation decreases with rising current and finally vanishes even at high magnetic fields. This stiffening of a current filament is attributed to an increased electron temperature and mobility in the filament, which cause the charges of the Hall field to be accumulated at the filament borders {{rather than at the}} edges of the sample...|$|R

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{cause of}} <b>low</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>breakdown</b> (reduction disintegration) is reduction of hematite to magnetite, {{resulting in a}} volume expansion and stress relief through the formation of cracks. Serious reduction disintegration causes poor gas permeability, high flue dust production and scaffolding, poor gas distribution, higher fuel consumption and lower productivity. Northern Cape iron ore generally performs well when tested for reduction disintegration properties both for blast furnaces and Corex; nevertheless, significant breakdown is experienced when used in the Corex process (at Saldanha Steel). This study was hence conducted {{to determine the effects}} of the following on reduction disintegration: different ore types (from Northern Cape) initial particle size temperature range reduction gas composition Although disintegration is clearly triggered by reduction, no direct correlation could be established between the percentage reduction and the percentage fines generated. The results indicated that the presence of gangue minerals alone does not cause fractures to form, but does influence the direction and intensity of fractures to some extent. In many cases cracks form randomly, with no specific preference for either gangue minerals or iron oxides. For most of the samples, an incubation period was observed before the first cracks formed. No crack propagation was observed after initial cracking. This study indicates that the degree of reduction disintegration depends mostly on furnace conditions. Reduction disintegration increased with higher hydrogen percentages (> 5 %), higher temperatures (in the 500 ºC- 700 ºC range) and longer exposure. Disintegration of the samples decreased at temperatures higher than 750 °C. For particles smaller than 16 mm an inverse relationship was found between the average particle size and the percentage of fines generated, in line with the observation that most of the disintegration is due to spalling from particle edges rather than particles breaking into smaller clumps. The results indicate that it is important to manage the temperature in the top of the blast furnace and the COREX shaft, and the time spent at temperatures below 750 °C, to minimize the amount of fines generated.

40|$|The {{spread of}} {{invasive}} species through ships' ballast water is {{considered as a}} major ecological threat to the world's oceans. For that reason, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set performance standards for ballast water discharge. Ballast water treatment systems have been developed that employ either UV-radiation or 'active substances' to reduce the concentration of living cells to below the IMOs standards. One such active substance is a chemical mixture known as Peraclean (R) Ocean. The residual of Peraclean (R) Ocean is acetate that might be present at high concentrations in discharged ballast water. In cold coastal waters the breakdown of acetate might be slow, causing a buildup of acetate concentrations in the water if regularly discharged by ships. To study the potential environmental impact, microbial dynamics and acetate degradation were measured in discharge water from a Peraclean (R) Ocean treatment system in illuminated microcosms. In addition, microbial dynamics and acetate degradation were studied at 1, 4, 10, 15 and 25 degrees C in dark microcosms that simulated enclosed ballast water tanks. Acetate breakdown indeed occurred faster at higher temperatures. At 25 degrees C the highest bacteria growth, fastest nutrient and oxygen consumption and highest DOC reduction occurred. On the other hand, at - 1 degrees C bacterial growth was strongly delayed, only starting to increase after 12 days. Furthermore, at 25 degrees C the acetate pool was not depleted, probably due to nutrient and oxygen limitation. This means that not all acetate will be broken down in ballast water tanks, even during long voyages in warm waters. In addition, at <b>low</b> <b>temperatures</b> acetate <b>breakdown</b> in ballast water tanks and in discharged water will be extremely slow. Therefore, regular discharge of acetate enriched ballast water in harbors and bays may cause eutrophication {{and changes in the}} microbial community, especially in colder regions...|$|R
40|$|Losses of one {{naturally}} occurring cytokinin (zeatin) and one synthetic cytoknin (kinetin) were determined during purification of turnips (Brassica compestris) infected by Plasmodiophora brassicae (clubroot). A known amount of zeatin and 8 ‐ 14 C‐kinetin was added after homogenization of plant material in ethanol or water. The commonly used practice to purify the aqueous residues of the homogenate by partitioning with petroleum ether was omitted because of emulsion formation. Losses due to emulsion formation and occlusion of 8 ‐ 14 C‐kinetin into non‐water soluble plant material could be prevented by extractionof clubroot tissue with water instead of ethanol. To minimize enzyme activity the aqueous homogenate was kept at 100 °C for 5 min.
