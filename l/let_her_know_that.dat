500|$|In 1890, the Queen had Karim's {{portrait}} {{painted by}} Heinrich von Angeli. According to the Queen, von Angeli was keen to paint Karim {{as he had}} never painted an Indian before and [...] "was so struck with his handsome face and colouring". On 11 July 1890, she wrote to Lansdowne, and the Secretary of State for India Lord Cross, for [...] "a grant of land to her really exemplary and excellent young Munshi, Hafiz Abdul Karim". The ageing Queen did not trust her relatives and the Royal Household {{to look after the}} Munshi after she was gone, and so sought to secure his future. Lansdowne replied that grants of land were given only to soldiers, and then only in cases of long and meritorious service. [...] Nevertheless, the Viceroy agreed to find a grant for Karim that would provide about 600 rupees annually, the same amount that an old soldier could expect after performing exceptionally. [...] Victoria wrote to Lansdowne repeatedly between July and October, pressuring him on the land grant. Apart from wasteland, there was little government-controlled land near Agra; thus Lansdowne was having trouble finding a suitable plot. On 30 October, the Munshi left Balmoral for four months' leave in India, travelling on the same ship as Lady Lansdowne. On the same day, Lord Lansdowne telegraphed the Queen to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a grant of land in the suburbs of Agra had been arranged. Lansdowne made a point of informing the Queen: ...|$|E

500|$|... "'97 Bonnie & Clyde", {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{featured on the}} Slim Shady EP as [...] "Just the Two of Us", was rerecorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead {{told her that he}} would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, [...] "When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out." [...] Eminem also said, [...] "When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it." [...] The song [...] "Guilty Conscience" [...] contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted rapper Dee Barnes. [...] Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre [...] "fell out of his chair laughing" [...] upon hearing the lyric. [...] "Ken Kaniff", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. [...] After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.|$|E
500|$|Disagreements between female rapper Remy Ma and Minaj {{originated}} in 2007, when Remy {{took note of}} Minaj's freestyle record, nicknamed [...] "Dirty Money", from her mixtape Playtime Is Over (2007). In the record, Minaj recites: [...] "Tell that bitch with the crown to run it like Chris Brown/she won three rounds, I'ma need a hundred thou/like 'Chinatown' — bitches better bow down/oh you ain't know, betcha bitches know now/fuck I got a gun — <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I'm the one". When the two encountered each other at an industry party, Remy asked Minaj who she was dissing in the song. Nicki Minaj reportedly never confirmed or denied that the song was about Remy, however Remy Ma remarked in a 2010 interview, [...] "To this day I still feel like [...] is a stab at me; I'm gonna [...] back for that one". Since 2011, Remy Ma has stated that she supports Nicki Minaj and her success, [...] but added {{that she would be}} [...] "a problem" [...] to Minaj once she is released from prison. On March 3, 2017, during a visit to The Wendy Williams Show, Remy Ma affirmed that her option in releasing a blatant Minaj diss track titled [...] "Shether" [...] was considered after allegations were brought forward to Ma's camp about Minaj [...] "trying to keep [...] off of red carpets, trying to make sure awards don't go to [...] " [...] and [...] "trying to make people make bad reports about Plata O Plomo album sales." [...] Ma's opinion of Minaj not being a [...] "nice person" [...] and past incidents with Mariah Carey, Taylor Swift, and Lil' Kim were also factors in [...] "Shether"'s release.|$|E

Cristal admits she pulled a similar stunt to get cast in the lead of a show years before.

Nomi leaves Las Vegas and hitches a ride to Los Angeles, coincidentally with the same driver who earlier stole her possessions when she arrived. Nomi pulls her knife and says [...] "I want my fucking suitcase" [...] as they pass a billboard advertising Malone as the star of Goddess, and the film fades to credits.|$|E
