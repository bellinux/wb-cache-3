5|$|Greenlandic is a polysynthetic <b>language</b> <b>that</b> {{allows the}} {{creation}} of long words by stringing together roots and suffixes. Its morphosyntactic alignment is ergative, meaning that it treats (i.e. case-marks) the argument ("subject") of an intransitive verb like {{the object of a}} transitive verb, but distinctly from the agent ("subject") of a transitive verb.|$|E
50|$|Every regular {{language}} is context-free, every context-free {{language is}} context-sensitive, every context-sensitive language is recursive and every recursive language is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are not context-free and context-free <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are not regular.|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of crosscutting concerns {{can be observed}} in various representations of software artifacts (e. g., source code, models, requirements, and language grammars). Although much of the focus of AOP has been on aspect <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> augment the descriptive power of general purpose programming languages, there is also a need for domain-specific aspect <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> address particular crosscutting concerns found in software representations other than traditional source code. This paper discusses the issues involved in the design and implementation of domain-specific aspect <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are focused within the domain of language specification. Specifically, the paper outlines the challenges and issues that we faced while designing two separate aspect <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> assist in modularizing crosscutting concerns in grammars...|$|R

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic <b>language</b> <b>that</b> allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative <b>language</b> <b>that</b> relies on suffix chains in the verbal and nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|Standard Swedish, {{spoken by}} most Swedes, is the {{national}} <b>language</b> <b>that</b> evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established {{by the beginning of}} the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties descended from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and standardized.|$|E
40|$|The {{increasingly}} widespread {{availability of}} multicore and manycore computers demands new programming <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> make parallel programming dramatically easier and less error prone. This paper describes a semantics {{for a new}} class of declarative programming <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> support massive amounts of implicit parallelism...|$|R

40|$|One goal of {{programming}} language {{research should be}} to design <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> help programmers build better software. We argue <b>that</b> designing <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are flexible enough to integrate di#erent programming paradigms and expressive enough to allow the programmer to state his intention is a possible way toward this goal...|$|R
5|$|There {{are many}} {{regional}} varieties {{of the standard}} <b>language</b> <b>that</b> are specific to geographical areas of varying size (regions, historical provinces, cities, towns, etc.). In mass media {{it is no longer}} uncommon for journalists to speak with a distinct regional accent, but the most common pronunciation and the one perceived as the most formal is still Central Standard Swedish.|$|E
5|$|Tintin fans {{adopted the}} Syldavian <b>language</b> <b>that</b> {{appears in the}} story {{and used it to}} {{construct}} grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of Star Treks Klingon and J.R.R. Tolkien's Elvish.|$|E
5|$|When several {{languages}} {{are used in}} a film, the predominant one is always listed first; {{the names of the}} other {{languages are}} written in smaller typesize and placed between brackets. When a film's original title is in a <b>language</b> <b>that</b> uses a non-Latin script, it is first transliterated into the Latin alphabet and then written in its original script.|$|E
50|$|When {{languages}} are {{in contact with}} one another, either of them may influence the other through linguistic interference such as borrowing. For example, French has influenced English, Arabic has influenced Persian, and Chinese has influenced Japanese in this way. However, such influence does not constitute (and is not a measure of) a genetic relationship between the languages concerned. Linguistic interference can occur between <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are genetically closely related, between <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are distantly related (like English and French, which are distantly related Indo-European languages), and between <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> are not genetically related at all.|$|R

5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style. To say that code is pythonic is to say that it uses Python idioms well, that it is natural or shows fluency in the <b>language,</b> <b>that</b> it conforms with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language (ASL) is {{a natural}} <b>language</b> <b>that</b> serves as the {{predominant}} sign language of Deaf communities in the United States and most of Anglophone Canada. Besides North America, dialects of ASL and ASL-based creoles are used in many countries around the world, including much of West Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. ASL is also widely learned as a second language, serving as a lingua franca. ASL is most closely related to French Sign Language (LSF). It has been proposed that ASL is a creole language of LSF, although ASL shows features atypical of creole languages, such as agglutinative morphology.|$|E
5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has flourished in poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya <b>language</b> <b>that</b> is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

50|$|Zero copula is a {{linguistic}} phenomenon whereby {{the subject is}} joined to the predicate without overt marking of this relationship (like the copula 'to be' in English). One can distinguish <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> simply {{do not have a}} copula and <b>languages</b> <b>that</b> have a copula that is optional in some contexts.|$|R
5|$|Denial of {{responsibility}} via <b>language</b> <b>that</b> obscures awareness of personal responsibility. It {{is said that}} we deny responsibility for our actions when we attribute their cause to: vague impersonal forces ("I had to"); our condition, diagnosis, personal or psychological history; the actions of others; the dictates of authority; group pressure; institutional policy, rules, and regulations; gender roles, social roles, or age roles; or uncontrollable impulses.|$|E
5|$|English is a North Sea Germanic <b>language</b> <b>that</b> {{was first}} spoken in early medieval England {{and is now}} a global lingua franca. Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that {{migrated}} to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, especially French.|$|E
5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} how important the issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the <b>language</b> <b>that</b> required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E

5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian. By the New Kingdom {{and throughout the}} rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian became a classical <b>language</b> <b>that</b> was usually reserved for reading and writing in hieroglyphs. For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken language for more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into a <b>language</b> <b>that</b> is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.|$|E
5|$|Many {{authors have}} speculated that {{at the core of}} this {{symbolic}} explosion, and in tandem, was the development of syntactic <b>language</b> <b>that</b> evolved through a highly specialized social learning system providing the means for semantically unbounded discourse.
