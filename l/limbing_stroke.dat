40|$|Upper <b>limb</b> deficits post <b>stroke</b> affect up to 60 % {{of stroke}} survivors. The {{assessment}} of motor deficits post stroke {{is important for}} identifying rehabilitation goals and assessing treatment efficacy. Current clinical tools used to assess motor impairment utilize clinical observation to describe the performance of diagnostic motor tasks. However there are some concerns regarding the ability of these scales to fully describe the quality of performance, and detect small but important changes which reflect motor recovery. Kinematic analysis has been increasingly suggested to augment clinical assessment; however, current kinematic tools are not well suited to the time and financial constraints of a clinical environment. The objective of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of utilizing low-cost, depth sensing technology (Kinect sensor) to augment the current upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> assessment. Study one characterizes the accuracy of the Kinect sensor, and defines optimal markers and conditions for data collection. Results revealed sufficient ability to quantify metrics for the hand, and the trunk. Study two explored the feasibility of clinical use for the Kinect sensor, specifically its ability to distinguish kinematic performance between the affected and less-affected limbs within an individual, and differences in the affected limb between individuals. Results from study 2 indicated that the Kinect is able to identify interlimb differences and correlations with upper limb impairment scores for some kinematic metrics. Findings from this thesis suggest a potential use for the Kinect in a clinical environment for the purposes of upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> assessment; however, there are many factors and limitations which need to be considered prior to its use...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{inability}} to perform tasks involving reaching {{is a common}} problem following stroke. Evidence supports the use of robotic therapy and functional electrical stimulation (FES) to reduce upper limb impairments, but current systems may not encourage maximal voluntary contribution from the participant because assistance is not responsive to performance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate whether iterative learning control (ILC) mediated by FES is a feasible intervention in upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. METHODS: Five hemiparetic participants with reduced upper limb function who were at least 6 months poststroke were recruited from the community. No participants withdrew. INTERVENTION: Participants undertook supported tracking tasks using 27 different trajectories augmented by responsive FES to their triceps brachii muscle, with their hand movement constrained in a 2 -dimensional plane by a robot. Eighteen 1 -hour treatment sessions were used with 2 participants receiving an additional 7 treatment sessions. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary functional outcome measure was the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT). Impairment measures included the upper limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), tests of motor control (tracking accuracy), and isometric force. RESULTS: Compliance was excellent {{and there were no}} adverse events. Statistically significant improvements were measured (P <or=. 05) in FMA motor score, unassisted tracking for 3 out of 4 trajectories, and in isometric force over 5 out of 6 directions. Changes in ARAT were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using ILC mediated by FES for upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Worldwide 12. 6 {{million people}} live with {{moderate}} to severe disability following a stroke, and the number is increasing. Associated personal and societal care costs strongly motivate the development of effective low-cost technology for upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. In order to be therapeutically effective, rehabilitation devices must assist repeated performance {{of a range of}} functional tasks whilst promoting voluntary effort, thereby enabling motor re-learning. This specification encourages subjects to use their residual muscle strength to perform rehabilitation tasks, hence exploiting the neuroplasticity of the brain, which plays a key role for the relearning of motion skills in impaired subjects. An approach to provide therapy is using mechanical systems. However, non-conventional rehabilitation devices currently lack automatic adaptive mechanisms within low-cost designs. Hence improvements are needed, which should incorporate the assistance around individual joints that is provided by robotic exoskeletal designs and the lowcost design features of non-powered orthoses. Another affordable technology is Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), which helps patients perform rehabilitation tasks by stimulating specific muscles through electrical pulses. Whilst FES {{has been shown to be}} clinically effective, it must ideally be combined with a support device in order to provide support to all relevant joints. Combining the advantages of both mechanical and FES based modalities within a single affordable device would optimize the effectiveness of the rehabilitation therapy. Hence, in this thesis an innovative assistive device has been developed for upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. It comprises a low-cost passive adaptive arm support that combines with FES under a hybrid control scheme. The innovative design of the orthosis is based on the gravity balancing theory which allows the design of mechanical systems within an intrinsically affordable solution. A 3 D CAD model has been designed and structural analyses have been performed in order to assess its suitability to interact with impaired subjects. The implementation of the automatic adjustable system is explained in detail. The dynamic model of the orthosis, which plays a key role in the design of the controller, have been derived and the gravity balancing behaviour under dynamic effects have been tested in order to demonstrate its suitability for upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. Then the general design framework to combine both FES and orthosis under a hybrid control scheme have been developed and specific cases have been simulated in order to assess its functionality and feasibility. The novelty of the device presented and analysed in this PhD thesis is based on the design of a new rehabilitation system which combines the advantages of more expensive robotic systems with those of non-powered orthoses. This device is the first in the field of non-conventional rehabilitation to combine a passive orthosis with FES under a hybrid control scheme, within a low-cost design in which the ease of use for end-users has been taken into account. Moreover, the rehabilitation system designed and analysed in this thesis represents a substantial foundation for further development, combining different areas of engineering and health science, such as: robotics, mechanical design, control systems and physiotherapy. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and aim: Stroke is {{the leading}} cause of severe adult {{disability}} in the developed world [1] and functional recovery of the upper limb is particularly poor. With a shift from hospital to community-based rehabilitation [2], novel solutions are needed to deliver the amount of quality therapy that is required for optimum recovery. 3 D motion capture data can enhance a therapist's observational analysis of a patient's impairments however, clinically this is predominantly limited to use within a gait analysis laboratory. This study examined the use of portable motion capture technology and bespoke visualisation software to provide meaningful visual feedback of movement performance (Fig. 1) to patients, and their therapists, during upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> therapy sessions.

To address the lack of accuracy currently available in clinical practice, this paper develops a general framework based on iterative learning control, an advanced model-based approach that has been successfully employed in three clinical treatment trials. An upper limb model is first developed to encompass unconstrained movements of the upper arm, with, in line with clinical need, additional assistance incorporated via a general class of robotic support mechanism. An iterative learning scheme is then developed to enable a subset of joint angles to be controlled via stimulation of an arbitrary set of muscles. This scheme is the first ILC approach which explicitly addresses coupled multivariable nonlinear dynamics in rehabilitation, enforcing convergence over multiple repetitions of a reaching task.

Outcome measures taken prior to and after an intervention consisted of the Fugl- Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), isometric force and error tracking. The intervention for stroke participants consisted of eighteen sessions in which a similar range of tracking tasks were performed with the addition of responsive electrical stimulation to their triceps muscle. A question set was developed to understand participants’ perceptions of the ILC system.

40|$|We present two novel {{rehabilitation}} robots for stroke patients. For lower <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation, {{we present}} a novel self-aligning exoskeleton for the knee joint. The primal novelty of the design originates from its kinematic structure that allows translational movements of the knee joint on the sagittal plane along with the knee rotation. Automatically adjusting its joint axes, the exoskeleton enables a perfect match between human joint axes and the device axes. Thanks to this feature, the knee exoskeleton is not only capable of guaranteeing ergonomy and comfort throughout the therapy, but also extends the usable range of motion for the knee joint. Moreover, this adjustability feature significantly shortens the setup time required to attach the patient to the robot, allowing more effective time be spend on exercises instead of wasting it for adjustments. We have implemented an impedance-type concept of the knee exoskeleton, experimentally characterized its closed-loop performance and demonstrated ergonomy and useability of this device through human subject experiments. To administer table top exercises during upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation, {{we present a}} novel Mecanum-wheeled holonomic mobile rehabilitation robot for home therapy. The device can move/rotate independently on its unlimited planar workspace to provide assistance to patients.

The admittance-type robot is integrated with virtual reality simulations and can assist patients through virtual tunnels designed around nominal task trajectories. The holonomic platform with series elastic actuation {{eliminates the need for}} costly force sensors and enables implementation of closed loop force control with higher controller gains, providing robustness against imperfections in the power transmission and allowing lower cost drive components to be utilized. For contour following tasks with the holonomic platforms, we have synthesized passive velocity field controllers (PVFC) that ensure coordination and synchronization between various degrees of freedom of the patient arm, while letting patients to complete the task at their own preferred pace.

40|$|Background: Assistive Technologies (ATs), {{defined as}} "electrical or {{mechanical}} devices {{designed to help}} people recover movement", demonstrate clinical benefits in upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation; however translation into clinical practice is poor. Uptake is dependent on a complex relationship between all stakeholders. Our aim was to understand patients', carers' (P&Cs) and healthcare professionals' (HCPs) experience and views of upper limb rehabilitation and ATs, to identify barriers and opportunities critical to the effective translation of ATs into clinical practice. This work was conducted in the UK, which has a state funded healthcare system, but the findings have relevance to all healthcare systems. Methods. Two structurally comparable questionnaires, one for P&Cs and one for HCPs, were designed, piloted and completed anonymously. Wide distribution of the questionnaires provided data from HCPs with experience of stroke rehabilitation and P&Cs who had experience of stroke. Questionnaires were designed based on themes identified from four focus groups held with HCPs and P&Cs and piloted {{with a sample of}} HCPs (N = 24) and P&Cs (N = 8). Eight of whom (four HCPs and four P&Cs) had been involved in the development. Results: 292 HCPs and 123 P&Cs questionnaires were analysed. 120 (41 %) of HCP and 79 (64 %) of P&C respondents had never used ATs. Most views were common to both groups, citing lack of information and access to ATs as the main reasons for not using them. Both HCPs (N = 53 [34 %]) and P&C (N = 21 [47 %]) cited Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) as the most frequently used AT. Research evidence was rated by HCPs as {{the most important factor in}} the design of an ideal technology, yet ATs they used or prescribed were not supported by research evidence. P&Cs rated ease of set-up and comfort more highly. Conclusion: Key barriers to translation of ATs into clinical practice are lack of knowledge, education, awareness and access. Perceptions about arm rehabilitation post-stroke are similar between HCPs and P&Cs. Based on our findings, improvements in AT design, pragmatic clinical evaluation, better knowledge and awareness and improvement in provision of services will contribute to better and cost-effective upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. © 2014 Hughes et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R

The authors used diffusion tensor imaging to determine the degree of white matter integrity of the CFT (FA(AH/UH)) in chronic stroke patients and controls. The functional integrity of the corticospinal pathway was examined using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Recruitment curves and silent period duration were measured. The relationship between FA(AH/UH) and functional outcome of the upper limb was also assessed using a battery of upper limb function tests. RESULTS: In patients, FA(AH/UH) correlated positively with the slope of recruitment curves (RC(AH/UH)) and grip strength. FA(AH/UH) also correlated negatively with the silent period duration (SP(AH/UH)). According to the FA(AH/UH), patients were also classified into groups with minimal or extensive Wallerian degeneration (WD). Patients with more extensive WD had poorer grip strength, dexterity, and range of movement.

40|$|Successful stroke {{rehabilitation}} {{relies on}} early, long-term, repetitive and intensive treatment. Repetitions conducted during clinical rehabilitation are {{significantly lower than}} that suggested by physiotherapeutic literature to relearn lost motor capabilities. This leaves patients to achieve this quantity in their home environment. Exercises can be monotonous and repetitive, {{making it difficult to}} maintain patient motivation. Exergames have been promoted for use in the home to make rehabilitation entertaining, increasing patients engagement with their therapy. Marketed exergaming systems for lower limb rehabilitation are hard to find, and none as of yet, facilitate Strength for Task Training (STT), a novel physiotherapeutic method for lower <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation. Strength for Task Training involves performing brief but intensive strength training (priming) prior to task-specic training to promote neural plasticity and maximise the gains in locomotor ability. This research investigates how the design of a game controller for lower <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation can facilitate unsupervised STT to compliment clinical contact time. The game controller was developed as part of a complete exergaming system designed to specifically facilitate STT. This involved working closely with co-researcher Scott Brebner who designed the exergame media. A user centered design approach was followed to include clinicians and stroke patients in the design process. This ensured the design aligned with the functional requirements of STT and the contextual needs of the patient. Workshops with stroke clinicians and neurophysiologists pointed to the specific areas of STT that a designed system could address. An iterative design process was used to develop, compare and improve concepts through testing with participants and clinicians. User testing involved participants using the game controller to interact with the digital game. The final output was a prototype pair of smart shoes with an attachable weighted sole. The design used removable sensors to translate lower limb movement into ingame interactions. The design of the shoes and weighted sole provided a simple and safe way to engage in unsupervised STT. Research findings suggest that while not all of the STT therapy can be incorporated in an unsupervised and home-based exergame system, there are some essential elements that can. Adaptable hardware was found to be integral to facilitating intensive priming. Barriers to use can be reduced through considering the diverse physiological and cognitive abilities of stroke patients and aesthetic consideration can help create a meaningful game controller that promotes its use in the home...|$|R

Functional improvement (ARAT) was seen across all groups immediately post intervention although dexterity remained reduced (9 HPT). Those in IG reported the greatest increases in function (SIS). [Low numbers prevent significance testing] Conclusions: VF in upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation is feasible. Preliminary outcomes suggest it may improve gross movement but has less impact on dexterity, limiting fuller functional recovery. Further modifications are required to optimize the intervention before embarking on a larger RCT...|$|R
50|$|Ramachandran is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} mirror box and the introduction of mirror visual feedback as a treatment for phantom limb paralysis. Ramachandran found that in some cases restoring movement to a paralyzed phantom limb reduced pain as well. Small scale research studies using mirror therapy to treat phantom <b>limb</b> pain, <b>stroke,</b> and complex regional pain syndrome have produced promising results. However there is currently no consensus as to the effectiveness of mirror therapy in reducing pain.|$|R
40|$|Today {{neurological}} {{diseases such}} as stroke represent {{one of the leading}} cause of long-term disability. Many research efforts have been focused on designing new and effective rehabilitation strategies. In particular, robotic treatment for upper <b>limb</b> <b>stroke</b> rehabilitation has received significant attention due to its ability to provide high-intensity and repetitive movement therapy with less effort than traditional methods. In addition, the development of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has also demonstrated the capability of modulating brain excitability thus increasing motor performance. The combination of these two methods is expected to enhance functional and motor recovery after stroke; to this purpose, the current trends in this research field are presented and discussed through an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art. The heterogeneity and the restricted number of collected studies make difficult to perform a systematic review. However, the literature analysis of the published data seems to demonstrate that the association of tDCS with robotic training has the same clinical gain derived from robotic therapy alone. Future studies should investigate combined approach tailored to the individual patient's characteristics, critically evaluating the brain areas to be targeted and the induced functional changes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} Stimulation Assistance through Iterative Learning (SAIL), a novel stroke rehabilitation {{system for the}} upper <b>limb.</b> Five hemiparetic <b>stroke</b> participants with reduced upper limb function undertook 18, 1 hour training sessions. Participants completed 3 D tracking tasks in which they moved their impaired arm to follow a slowly moving sphere along a specified trajectory. The participants’ arm {{was supported by a}} robot. Functional electrical stimulation (FES), precisely controlled by advanced iterative learning algorithms, was applied to the triceps and anterior deltoid muscles to assist accurate tracking. For assessment, participants completed unassisted tracking tasks in each session, as well as clinical assessments (ARAT and FMA) pre- and post-intervention. Results show that unassisted tracking performance and FMA scores improved over the intervention, and the amount of FES required to produce accurate tracking reduced over the same period. The technology employed by the SAIL system was designed to help stroke patients train their upper limb muscles, leading to improved motor control. The results from this study suggest that SAIL can accurately assist upper <b>limb</b> movement in <b>stroke</b> participants. The feasibility and effectiveness of SAIL in reducing upper <b>limb</b> impairments following <b>stroke</b> was demonstrated...|$|R
