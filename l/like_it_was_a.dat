5|$|There {{was some}} criticism, {{as well as}} confusion, {{regarding}} {{the title of the}} film. Many reviewers, including James Rolfe, felt that it should have officially been titled Rocky VI, and that simply adding his last name to the end made it seem <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> remake of the original film rather than a sequel.|$|E

"Quiero Bailar" [...] (English: [...] "I Want To Dance") {{is a song}} by Puerto Rican reggaetón {{recording}} artist Ivy Queen, from the platinum edition of her third studio album, Diva (2003).

Wenders was also present to film the group's first performance with a full line-up in Amsterdam in April 1998 (two nights) and a second time in Carnegie Hall, New York City on 1 July 1998. The completed documentary was released on 17 September 1999, and included scenes in New York of the Cubans, some of whom had never left the island, window shopping and visiting tourist sites. According to Sight & Sound magazine, these scenes of [...] "innocents abroad" [...] were the film's most moving moments, as the contrasts between societies of Havana and New York become evident on the faces of the performers. Ferrer, from an impoverished background and staunchly anti consumerist, was shown describing the city as [...] "beautiful" [...] and finding the experience overwhelming. Upon completion of filming, Wenders felt that the film [...] "didn't feel really <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> documentary anymore. It felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> true character piece".|$|E

Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{said that the}} synthpop song [...] "sounded <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> leftover from [...] debut album" [...] because of its sonic similarity. Chuck Eddy, author of The Accidental Evolution of Rock'n'roll: A Misguided Tour Through Popular Music, compared the track {{to the sound of}} American new wave band, Tom Tom Club. Billboard magazine's dance music reviewer Brian Chin said that the song [...] "touched base" [...] with the Top-40 mainstream radio audience. For author Ira Robins, [...] "Sidewalk Talk" [...] was the [...] "best track" [...] on the EP, because of its [...] "lucidness".|$|E
500|$|By 1957, {{there was}} {{speculation}} that Ford, then age 31, {{might not make}} the Browns' roster. Ford arrived at training camp well above his playing weight, and rookie Bob Mischak was given Ford's spot in August. [...] When Mischak withdrew from the team, the spot was awarded to another rookie, Paul Wiggin. [...] Ford worked to shed pounds during training camp and worked to train the young defensive players, including Wiggin and Bill Quinlan. Rookie running back Jim Brown recalled that Ford pulled him aside during the 1957 training camp and gave him advice on dealing with the Browns' head coach Paul Brown. [...] Ford advised the rookie to {{keep his mouth shut}} and do as the coach set during practice and waiting until game day: [...] "Run it your way in the game and hope it works, and if it does, don't say anything.

Lasance also said they found much of their early screen time comical because [...] "one minute they're in bed, the next they're fighting in the diner." [...] Aden and Belle became so popular with viewers that they [...] "coined a phrase" [...] to name the couple, which was [...] "Adelle". Lasance said that [...] "The Adelle mayhem is crazy.

500|$|Television {{director}} Joe Wright {{was hired}} in early 2004, making Pride & Prejudice his directional feature film debut. He was considered a surprising choice for a film in the romance drama genre due to his past work with social realism. Wright's body of work had impressed the producers, who {{were looking for a}} fresh perspective; they sent him a script despite the fact that Wright had not read the novel. He commented that at the time, [...] "I didn't know if I was really all that interested; I thought I was a little bit more mainstream than this, a bit more edgy. But then I read the script and I was surprised I was very moved by it". He next read the novel, which he called [...] "an amazing piece of character observation and it really seemed like the first piece of British Realism. It felt <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> true story; had a lot of truth in it about understanding how to love other people, understanding how to overcome prejudices, understanding the things that separate us from other people... things like that." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bomb Squad {{listened to}} various music records and used {{devices such as}} the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and sampler, the Akai S900 sampler, and a Macintosh {{computer}} to arrange samples and sequence tracks. The sessions, which were recorded by Shocklee for future reference, had the group playing beats and records while collecting potential sample material. Chuck D has said that [...] "95 {{percent of the time}} it sounded like mess. But there was 5 percent of magic that would happen." [...] Shocklee compared their production to that of filmmaking, [...] "with different lighting effects, or film speeds, or whatever", while Chuck D found their intention to [...] "blend sound" [...] similar to a visual artist [...] "tak yellow and blue and come up with green". He said of their approach in a 1990 interview for Keyboard Magazine, [...] "We approach every record <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> painting. Sometimes, on the sound sheet, {{we have to have a}} separate sheet just to list the samples for each track. We used about 150, maybe 200 samples on Fear of a Black Planet." ...|$|E

Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it.

Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move. So often I thought, 'Boss, why don't you just cancel this tour and take a year off...?' I mentioned something once in a guarded moment. He patted me on the back and said, 'It'll be all right. Don't you worry about it.'" [...] Presley continued to play to sellout crowds.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{material}} was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Thayil's only contribution to the album was the song [...] "Never the Machine Forever", for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially {{came out of a}} jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that {{he had a lot of}} incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said, [...] "It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn't satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don't really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar." [...] Cornell said, [...] "By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long, hard haul.

500|$|Following the {{worldwide}} tour {{in support of}} Superunknown, the band began working on what would become their last studio album for over 15 years, choosing to produce the record themselves. However, tensions within the group reportedly arose during the sessions, with Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell's desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band's trademark. Cornell said, [...] "By {{the time we were}} finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering." [...] The band's fifth album, Down on the Upside, was released on May 21, 1996. It was notably less heavy than the group's earlier albums, and marked a further departure from the band's grunge roots. At the time, Soundgarden explained that they wanted to experiment with other sounds, including acoustic instrumentation. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric." [...] The overall mood of the album's lyrics is less dark than on previous Soundgarden albums, with Cornell describing some songs as [...] "self-affirming". The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Pretty Noose", [...] "Burden in My Hand", and [...] "Blow Up the Outside World". [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1997. Despite favorable reviews and modest sales, the album did not match the sales or critical praise of Superunknown.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
2500|$|Halas and Batchelor were {{approached}} by the Admiralty {{to create an}} instructional film for Royal Navy navigation trainees; according to Halas, the intent was to [...] "stop young people from driving a ship <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> car."
