They decide not to tell Manjula but while they are playing Badminton Homer and Marge act awkwardly with Manjula and Apu <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> trying not to give out hints Apu cheated on Manjula. They then confront Apu {{and he says he}} will break up with the Squishee Lady named Annette. However, he breaks his promise (as it gets his mind off the octuplets and she forces him). Later, Manjula watches the surveillance footage of Apu cheating and kicks him out. To help get them together, Homer and Marge invite them both to dinner, but do not tell them that the other one is coming. After a failed attempt with Bart and Lisa, Apu tries to promise to Manjula that he will change, but Manjula refuses to listen and demands a divorce.|$|E
25|$|Self-objectification can {{increase}} in situations which heighten {{the awareness of}} an individual’s physical appearance. Here, {{the presence of a}} third person observer is enhanced. Therefore, when individuals know others are <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> or will be <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> {{they are more likely to}} care about their physical appearance. Examples of the enhanced presence of an observer include the presence of an audience, camera, or other known observer.|$|E

Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{trademarks}} of Bull Curry was his “wildman” {{look with}} bushy eyebrows, maniacal facial expressions and insane eyes that could scare the crowd just by <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them.</b> In one case he scared a girl at ringside so badly {{she had to}} be carried from the ring in terror. The wild look coupled with his wild brawling style made Bull Curry one of the most hated rule-breakers in wrestling, he was so hated in places that riots broke out more than once as irate fans attacked Curry in the ring.|$|E
25|$|In Guugu-Yimidhirr, a {{traditional}} Australian Aboriginal language, special avoidance lexemes {{are used to}} express deference when {{in the presence of}} tabooed in-law relatives. In other words, speakers will either be completely prohibited from speaking to one’s mother-in-law or must employ “avoidance language” to one’s brother-in-law. The brother-in-law language involves a special set of words to replace regular Guugu-Yimidhirr words and the speaker must avoid words which could suggest reference to genitalia or bodily acts. This brother-in-law language therefore indexes a deferential social relationship of the brother-in-law to the speaker and is reflected in the appropriate social behavior of Guugu-Yimidhirr society. For example, one avoids touching tabooed in-laws, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> joking with them, and cursing in their presence.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to show that locally produced, well-made films could be profitable, the Dutch {{journalist}} Albert Balink, who had no formal film experience, produced Pareh (Rice) in 1935 in collaboration with [...] the ethnic Chinese Wong brothers (Othniel and Joshua), and the Dutch documentary filmmaker Mannus Franken. The film cost 20times {{as much as an}} average local production, in part because of Balink's perfectionism, and was ultimately a failure. The Indonesian writer and cultural critic Armijn Pane wrote that Pareh had performed poorly with native audiences as it was seen as <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> through European eyes. Pareh bankrupted its producers, and enabled The Teng Chun to dominate the industry– although with less traditional stories– for a further two years.|$|E
500|$|The school {{treated the}} {{incident}} seriously and called police {{to the school}} {{in the days after}} the noose incident. The principal called an assembly on September 6, 2006. The Jena Police Department asked Parish Attorney Walters to attend and speak at the assembly. Already pressed for time due to a case under preparation, Walters felt that the students were not paying proper attention to him. He warned them, [...] "I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. With the stroke of a pen I can make life miserable for you or ruin your life. So I want you to call me before you do something stupid." [...] Though black students say Walters was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> when he made the comments, Walters and school board member Billy Fowler, also present, deny it. Walters said that he was irritated at [...] "two or three girls, white girls, [...] were chit-chatting on their cellphones or playing with their cellphones".|$|E
500|$|After a {{neon sign}} reading [...] "Femme Fatale" [...] is {{lifted from the}} stage, the show begins with a video {{introduction}} in which Spears is arrested by the police after a chasing sequence. As she says [...] "I'm not that innocent", the video screens part and she appears sitting on a metallic throne in a silver costume to perform [...] "Hold It Against Me". She is accompanied by her back-up dancers in white and silver costumes. [...] "Up N' Down" [...] features Spears and her female dancers performing inside cages, with the male dancers <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> dressed as policemen. After walking to the B-stage in a conveyor belt, Spears puts on a white trench coat and a satin fedora to perform [...] "3". She then goes into [...] "Piece of Me" [...] while floating above the stage in a platform. This {{is followed by a}} video intermission that contains the beginning of the music video for [...] "My Prerogative", and in which a stalker reveals that Spears is a secret agent. The next section begins with Spears in a pink latex and lace jacket emerging from inside a bass to perform [...] "Big Fat Bass", while will.i.am appears in the backdrops. She removes the jacket to reveal a nude leotard for the performance of [...] "How I Roll", which features a pink convertible Mini Cooper-like car and her dancers wearing colorful outfits. This is followed by a segment in which Spears and her dancers select a male member from the audience. She then bursts into [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] and performs sensually for him. After a costume change, Spears goes into the song [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] while wearing a white skirt over a fan, recalling Marilyn Monroe's iconic scene in The Seven Year Itch (1955).|$|E

500|$|Robin Williams as The Genie, a comedic genie, with nigh omnipotent {{power that}} can only be {{exercised}} when his master wishes it. The Genie's supervising animator was Eric Goldberg. Clements and Musker wrote the part of the Genie for Robin Williams, and, when met with resistance, created a reel of Williams' stand-up to animation of the Genie. The directors asked Goldberg to animate a Genie over one of Williams' old stand-up comedy routines to pitch the idea to the actor. The resulting test, where Williams talking about schizophrenia was translated into Genie growing another head to argue with himself, made Williams [...] "laugh his ass off" [...] and convinced him to sign on for the role. Williams' appearance in Aladdin (despite his appearance along with Christian Slater and Tim Curry in the early 1992 animated film [...] ) marks the beginning of a transition in animated film to celebrity voice actors, rather than specifically trained voice actors in animated film. Williams provided many celebrity impressions during recording sessions, which were re-adapted into the fabric of the character. These included Ed Sullivan, Jack Nicholson, Robert De Niro, Groucho Marx, Rodney Dangerfield, William F. Buckley, Peter Lorre, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Arsenio Hall. Williams also voices the Peddler, a mysterious merchant who appears {{at the beginning of the}} film. After promoting useless goods to the audience, he reveals the magic lamp and begins the story of Aladdin. The scene was completely unscripted — the production left Williams a table with props covered with a sheet and asked him to pull out objects without <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> and describe them in-character. The double role originally led to the Peddler revealing to be the Genie disguised, but that idea was dropped later in development. Bruce Adler supplies the singing voice for the Peddler, with Williams singing as Genie.|$|E
500|$|Mirella D’Ancona {{argues that}} the image {{reflects}} Michelangelo’s views on {{the roles of the}} members of the Holy Family in human salvation and the soul’s immortality. The Virgin’s placement and emphasis is due to her role in human salvation. She is both the mother of Christ and the best intercessor for appealing to him. Michelangelo, who had been strongly influenced by the Dominican Fra Girolamo Savonarola in Florence, is using the picture to defend the Maculist point of view, a philosophy of the Dominican order rejecting the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary. The Maculist view is that the Virgin did not receive her sanctification at birth but at the moment of the incarnation of Christ; thus, the image depicts the moment of Mary’s sanctification by showing the Christ Child blessing her. Michelangelo depicts Christ as if he is growing out of Mary’s shoulder to take human form, one leg hanging limply and the other not visible at all, therefore making him a part of Mary. Moreover, his muscles and balance convey an upward movement, as if he is growing out of her, although he is above Mary, asserting his superiority to her. [...] Furthermore, she {{argues that the}} nudes are to be interpreted as sinners who have removed their clothes for cleansing and purification through baptism. The water, which separates the sinners from the Holy Family, just beyond the horizontal band in the middle of the painting, can therefore be seen as the “waters of separation” mentioned in the Bible. [...] She also argues that the five figures may represent the five parts of the soul: the higher soul (soul and intellect) on the left and the lower soul (imagination, sensation, and nourishing faculty) on the right, a visual depiction of the views of Marsilio Ficino, whom Michelangelo references in other works. [...] Additionally, in <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> as separate groupings, she suggest that the two figures on Mary’s right represents the human and divine natures of Christ, while the three on her left represent the Trinity.|$|E

When editing and sequencing the book, I wanted to resist any antique design conceits and, instead, present the images in a clean and direct manner." ...|$|E

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Michael Rosenthal described Gainsborough as [...] "one {{of the most}} technically proficient and, at the same time, most experimental artists of his time".

2500|$|A {{sculpture}} of Ethos by Tom Bass {{was commissioned by}} the National Capital Development Commission in 1959 and unveiled in 1961. [...] "The NCDC intended that the work would emphasize that Canberra is the non-political centre, the locale of commerce and of private enterprise in its best sense." [...] The sculpture was designed to represent {{the spirit of the}} community. Bass interpreted this in the figure which he intended [...] "the love which Canberra people have for their city to be identified with her...I want them to be conscious of her first as an image from a distance...then comes the moment when they become personally involved with her... they feel her <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them,</b> reflecting their love for the place".|$|E
2500|$|Born November 18, 1959 in Yellow Springs, Ohio, Blackman {{comes from}} a musical family, both her mother and {{grandmother}} were classical musicians and her uncle a vibist.

[...] Blackman's first introduction to the drums happened when she was seven years old in her hometown of Yellow Springs, Ohio and attending a pool party at a friend's house, she went to use the bathroom and saw a drum set and just hopped onto the set. [...] "It was incredible", says Blackman. [...] "Just <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> struck something in my core, and it was completely right from the second I saw them", says Blackman. [...] "And then, when I hit them, it was like, wow, that's me. That's completely natural for me. It's like breathing for me. It didn't feel awkward at all." ...|$|E

I was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>them</b> through my tears. Coming from our part of the world, you don't see that." [...] The younger Qupty observed that [...] "people were amazed all the time" [...] that he – a Palestinian – and a Jew could coexist, and Shapira Bar-Or said: [...] "It shows how simple the situation is.
