40|$|This paper details a {{formulation}} {{to create}} a fatigue <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> for the blade of a small wind turbine {{using a combination of}} detailed short-term aeroelastic and wind measurements and averaged long-term wind data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.

40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of a laboratory study on the stiffness of bituminous mixes determined by the Indirect Tensile Method, according to the EN 12697 - 26 Annex C standard. The testing, at the Experimental Road Laboratory of the University of Padova, was performed {{by means of the}} Nottingham Asphalt Tester, on high-performance bituminous mixtures, comprising high modulus mixes, stone mastic asphalt and porous asphalt. The purpose was to check the applicability of the above-mentioned standard to both dense graded as well as porous asphalt mixtures, at various temperatures, strain levels and rise times, and to compare the controlled strain with the controlled stress <b>loading</b> <b>procedure,</b> the latter not being included in the Annex C of the standard. The influence of other two important variables, i. e. the number of diameters across which the specimen is to be tested and the number of conditioning impulses before the test, have been evaluated and quantified. The results of this study demonstrate that the standard controlled strain <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> could have selective applicability depending on the mix being studied and testing temperatures. The controlled stress <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> results are necessary to evaluate the stiffness at extremely low and high testing temperatures and loading frequencies...|$|R

50|$|Centerless {{grinding}} {{is a form}} of grinding {{where there}} is no collet or pair of centers holding the object in place. Instead, there is a regulating wheel positioned {{on the opposite side of}} the object to the grinding wheel. A work rest keeps the object at the appropriate height but has no bearing on its rotary speed. The workblade is angled slightly towards the regulating wheel, with the workpiece centerline above the centerlines of the regulating and grinding wheel; this means that high spots do not tend to generate corresponding opposite low spots, and hence the roundness of parts can be improved. Centerless grinding is much easier to combine with automatic <b>loading</b> <b>procedures</b> than centered grinding; throughfeed grinding, where the regulating wheel is held at a slight angle to the part so that there is a force feeding the part through the grinder, is particularly efficient.|$|E
50|$|As Glacier Northwest {{claims that}} the usage of barges is not {{detrimental}} to the environment, those against the mine expansion, especially those from Preserve Our Island, disagree. They claim that the physical effects of the barge itself, and the side-effects of its <b>loading</b> <b>procedures,</b> can be detrimental to the near shore environment. It is estimated that the velocity of the prop wash from these barges can re-suspend about 90% of the ambient bed material in the shallow waters. This effect, contrary to Glacier Northwest's attempt at mitigation, would not be avoided even if the dock and loading site were extended into deeper waters as planned because of the likely possibility of aggregate falling {{over the side of}} the barge into the sound. The effect of this spillage could then raise the ambient bed as it is collected on the ocean floor, exposing it to the dangers of the barge's prop-wash. These effects would pose a more significant effect during low tides, as outlined in the continuing section on the remaining eelgrass beds. By using barge ships as their main form of transport, Glacier Northwest is also putting South Maury Island’s fragile habitat at an extremely high risk for oil spills. An oil spill would demolish the near shore habitat, which would affect the fish, birds, and sea mammals living throughout the Puget Sound.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} bolt actions {{which contain}} {{the firing pin}} centered in the bolt, the Palmer's bolt was machined from a solid block of tubular metal, which had screw type lands and grooves to lock the bolt in place via a short stubby handle. The hammer of the weapon (located {{on the right side}} of the receiver like all other percussion fired rifles of the time period) holds the firing pin at the tip. A tooled, milled slot is visible on the head of the bolt canted toward the right side allows a slight opening for the firing pin atop the hammer to strike the rim-fired cartridge, usually the 56-50 rim fire. The bolt was designed for single shot action, the cartridges were loaded one at a time. The design was quite revolutionary, and was seen at the time as a simple breach modification to weapons of the time period to accept metallic cartridges instead of the traditional powder, ball, wad, ram rod and percussion cap which consumed time during <b>loading</b> <b>procedures.</b> The designer understood that gunsmiths could hopefully modify current percussion rifles from the breach of the gun in the same way flintlocks were modified to percussion using a relatively simple process. The downfall of the rifle was the positioning of the hammer where the firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge, and the small space on the bolt where the two parts meet with the bullet rim when the trigger is pulled.|$|E

40|$|Scrape {{loading and}} {{sonication}} loading are two recently described methods of introducing macromolecules into living cells. We have tested {{the efficacy of}} these methods for transfection of mammalian cells with exogenous DNA, using selection systems based either on resistance to the drug G 418 (Geneticin) or on acquisition {{of the ability to}} utilize the salvage pathway of pyrimidine biosynthesis. These loading methods can be employed to generate cell lines that express the gene product of the transfected DNA molecules both transiently and stably. Optimal transfection is observed when the DNA is added to cells in physiological saline lacking divalent cations and containing K+ in place of Na+. DNA molecules 7. 1 to 30 kilobases long have been introduced by the scrape <b>loading</b> <b>procedure.</b> In addition, the scrape <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> has been employed for cotransfection and subsequent expression of nonselectable genes encoded on DNA molecules added in a mixture with DNA molecules whose expression is selected. Cell lines expressing oncogenes or proteins that are important for regulation of cell growth and division have been obtained by this <b>procedure.</b> The scrape <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> is also useful for studies of the cellular changes that occur upon expression of an exogenous gene. As many as 80 % of cells scrape loaded with the plasmid pC 6, which encodes the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, contained this protein in the nucleus between 1 and 5 days after transfection. Thus, scrape loading and sonication loading are simple, economical, and reproducible methods for introduction of DNA molecules into adherent and nonadherent cells, and these methods may be useful in the future for experimentation at both fundamental and applied levels...|$|R

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} {{is an important}} aspect of maintenance for bridge columns in areas of high seismic activity. In this project, recently developed piezoceramic-based transducers, known as smart aggregates (SA), were utilized to perform structural {{health monitoring}} of a reinforced concrete (RC) bridge column subjected to pseudo-dynamic loading. The SA-based approach has been previously verified for static and dynamic loading but never for pseudo-dynamic loading. Based on the developed SAs, an active-sensing approach was developed to perform real-time health status evaluation of the RC column during the <b>loading</b> <b>procedure.</b> The existence of cracks attenuated the stress wave transmission energy during the <b>loading</b> <b>procedure</b> and reduced the amplitudes of the signal received by SA sensors. To detect the crack evolution and evaluate the damage severity, a wavelet packet-based structural damage index was developed. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the SAs in structural health monitoring of the RC column under pseudo-dynamic loading. In addition to monitoring the general severity of the damage, the local structural damage indices show potential to report the cyclic crack open-close phenomenon subjected to the pseudo-dynamic loading...|$|R
