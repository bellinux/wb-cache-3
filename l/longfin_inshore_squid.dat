5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and <b>longfin</b> <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

40|$|Squid are {{important}} components of many marine ecosystems from the poles to the equator, serving as both important predators and prey. Novel {{aspects of their}} growth and reproduction mean that {{they are likely to}} play an important role in the changing oceans due to climate change. Virtually every facet of squid life-history examined thus far has revealed an incredible capacity in this group for life-history plasticity. The extremely fast growth rates of individuals and rapid rates of turnover at the population level mean that squid can respond quickly to environmental or ecosystem change. Their ‘life-in-the-fast-lane’ life-style allows them to rapidly exploit ‘vacuums’ created in the ecosystem when predators or competitors are removed. In this way, they function as ‘weeds of the sea’. Elevated temperatures accelerate the life-histories of squid, increasing their growth rates and shortening their life-spans. At first glance, it would be logical to suggest that rising water temperatures associated with climate change (if food supply remains adequate) would be beneficial to <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> populations and fisheries—growth rates would increase, life spans would shorten and population turnover would accelerate. However, the response of <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> populations to climate change is likely to be extremely complex. The size of hatchlings emerging from the eggs becomes smaller as temperatures increase and hatchling size may have a critical influence on the size-at-age that may be achieved as adults and subsequently, population structure. The influence of higher temperatures on the egg and adult stages may thus be opposing forces on the life-history. The process of climate change will likely result in squids that hatch out smaller and earlier, undergo faster growth over shorter life-spans and mature younger and at a smaller size. Individual squid will require more food per unit body size, require more oxygen for faster metabolisms and have a reduced capacity to cope without food. It is therefore likely that biological, physiological and behavioural changes in squid due to climate change will have far reaching effects...|$|R
40|$|The California market squid (Loligo opalescens Berry), {{also known}} as the {{opalescent}} <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> (FAO), plays {{a central role in the}} nearshore ecological communities of the west coast of the United States (Morejohn et al., 1978; Hixon, 1983) and it is also a prime focus of California fisheries, ranking first in dollar value and tons landed in recent years (Vojkovich, 1998). The life span of this species is only 7 − 10 months after hatching, as ascertained by aging statoliths (Butler et al., 1999; Jackson, 1994; Jackson and Domier, 2003) and mariculture trials (Yang, et al., 1986). Thus, annual recruitment is required to sustain the population. The spawning season ranges from April to November and spawning peaks from May to June. In some years there can be a smaller second peak in November. In Monterey Bay, the squids are fished directly on the egg beds, and the consequences of this practice for conservation and fisheries management are unknown but of some concern (Hanlon, 1998).

Experienced fishers, considered as experts, were selected during a pilot phase to participate in two sequential rounds of semi-structured interviews at 3 main landing sites and 12 coastal fishing communities. The issues addressed were: (1) spatial and seasonal occurrence of mature females and juveniles of the main commercial species, (2) fishing grounds and bycatch species for each type of fishing gear, and (3) fishers’ suggestions for local fisheries management (e. g. mesh and size of gillnets, closure seasons, gear restrictions by fishing area). It was possible to identify consensus rates on the spatial and temporal issues, as well as on fishers’ management suggestions. The former allowed the construction of maps representing fishing grounds and the local spatial distribution of different fishery stocks strata. We illustrate the output by focusing on five fishery stocks: the seabobshrimp Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, the whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri, the <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> Loligo spp, the white shrimp Litopenaeus schimitti and the blue runner Caranx crysos.

40|$|It was {{previously}} {{thought that the}} South African chokka squid Loligo reynaudi is exclusively an inshore, shallow water spawner. Although spawning mostly within shallow bays (< 60 m) the presence of squid eggs in trawls at depths up to 130 m indicates this species frequently makes use of deeper spawning areas on the mid-shelf. The extent of mid-shelf spawning (referred to as deep spawning) and the contribution to recruitment {{has yet to be}} assessed. Studies have shown mid-shelf bottom temperature to vary considerably from those <b>inshore,</b> suggesting chokka <b>squid</b> spawn in two very different oceanographic environments. Considering these apparent environmental differences, what leads to the mid-shelf environment becoming a suitable spawning habitat? Does a suitable benthic habitat, required for the attachment of egg pods, occur on the mid-shelf? These questions are not only important for determining the extent of deep spawning, but also to the understanding of factors “driving” deep spawning. The fate of deep spawned hatchlings is another unknown. It has been proposed that the main chokka <b>squid</b> <b>inshore</b> spawning grounds are positioned to exploit the net westward currents on the Eastern Agulhas Bank, i. e. paralarvae would be transported west from the hatching site to the cold ridge, an area of high primary and secondary productivity on the Central Agulhas Bank. This concept {{has come to be known}} as the Western Transport Hypothesis. Lagrangian ROMS-IBMs (regional ocean model system – individual-based model) predict the net westward transport of paralarvae from both the inshore and deep spawning grounds, to the cold ridge. These simulations were used to investigate the transport of hatchlings to the cold ridge feeding grounds before the exhaustion of yolk reserves. The fate of paralarvae on reaching the feeding grounds has not yet been investigated. This work has contributed new knowledge to our understanding of deep spawning and its role in recruitment. Specific aims of this study were to (1) determine the extent, range and importance of the deep spawning grounds relative to those inshore; (2) investigate the deep spawning ground habitat (Agulhas Bank mid-shelf) morphology and oceanographic environment; (3) determine the transport and survival of deep spawned hatchlings; and (4) investigate the origin and distribution of chokka squid paralarvae on the Agulhas Bank. The extent, depth range and importance of the deep spawning grounds, relative to those inshore was assessed using 23 years of demersal trawl survey data. Data for both the west and south coasts of South Africa were examined for egg capsules. No spawning was found on the west coast. Data showed that chokka squid preferred the Eastern Agulhas Bank for spawning. Spawning occurred not only inshore but also on the mid-shelf extending to depths of 270 m near the shelf edge. The majority of deep spawned eggs however, were found in the depth range 71 - 130 m. Squid egg density markedly decreased beyond 70 m, suggesting delineation between the inshore and deep spawning grounds. Total egg biomass calculations for depths shallower and deeper than 70 m indicated the coastal area to be strongly favoured, i. e. 82 vs. 18 %. These results contest the commonly accepted notion that chokka <b>squid</b> is an <b>inshore</b> spawner and redefine the spawning grounds to extend across the shelf. Apart from an initial study investigating bottom temperature on the mid-shelf, very little is known about the deep spawning habitat. St Francis Bay, a commonly used spawning location, was chosen as a demonstration area for further study. The deep spawning grounds (71 - 130 m) were mapped and benthic habitat described from underwater video footage. A study investigating cross-shelf bottom conditions was undertaken off Thys Bay. CTD data were used to compare seasonal bottom temperature and oxygen on the St Francis Bay inshore and deep spawning grounds. Squid movement between the two spawning habitats was assessed using filament tagging. Predation and fishing pressure across the spawning grounds was reviewed. The mid-shelf benthic habitat was found to be similar to that inshore and available for spawning. Despite the generally colder bottom temperatures on the mid-shelf, this study showed that bottom temperature in deeper waters can at times be warmer than inshore. Although mid-shelf warming events lasted from a few hours to a number of days, they resulted in similar conditions to those on the inshore spawning grounds. It is likely these events act to expand or shift spawning habitat. The movement of squid between the two spawning habitats makes it possible for them to seek patches of warm bottom water with appropiate substrate. This suggests they are spawning habitat opportunists. Predation and fishing pressure appear to be higher on the inshore spawning grounds. It is feasible that this also forces spawners to seek out more favourable habitat offshore. An individual-based model was used to predict the fate of mid-shelf and inshore hatched paralarvae. Within the model, both the highly productive cold ridge and inshore spawning grounds were considered feeding or nursery areas. Paralarvae were released from six inshore and six deep spawning sites, spanning the coast between Port Alfred and Knysna. All paralarvae not reaching the feeding areas before the exhaustion of yolk-reserves (≤ 5 days), not retained within the feeding grounds (≥ 14 days), and not retained on the Agulhas Bank after exiting the feeding grounds were considered lost. This work illustrated the dependence of paralarval transport success on both spawning location and time of hatching, as established in earlier studies. The current IBM has expanded on initial work, emphasizing the importance of the cold ridge and inshore spawning grounds as nursery areas for deep and inshore spawned paralarvae, respectively. This work has highlighted the complex interactions between processes influencing recruitment variability for chokka squid. Possible relationships between periods of highest recruitment success and spawning peaks were identified for both spawning habitats. Based on the likely autumn increase in deep spawning off Tsitsikamma, and the beneficial currents during this period, it can be concluded deep spawning may at times contribute significantly to recruitment. This is particularly true for years where the cold ridge persists into winter. Data on chokka squid paralarval distribution are scarce. Paralarval distribution and abundance, in relation to Agulhas Bank oceanography, was investigated using bongo caught paralarvae and corresponding oceanographic data. Individual-based models (IBMs) were used to predict the origin or spawning site of the wild caught paralarvae, with reference to inshore versus deep spawning. Although failing to predict realistic points of origin, this study provided evidence to support a number of scenarios previously assumed to influence chokka squid recruitment. First is the possible influence of coastal upwelling on the retention, and hence spatial distribution, of paralarvae on the inshore spawning grounds. The second factor thought to impact recruitment is the loss of paralarvae from the Agulhas Bank ecosystem. This study confirmed the removal of paralarvae from the Eastern Agulhas Bank due to Agulhas Current boundary phenomena and resultant offshelf leakage. In addition, data suggested that the formation of the cold ridge could enhance retention on the Central Agulhas Bank, and so prevent offshelf leakage from the Central and Western Agulhas Bank. A synthesis of the main conclusions is presented. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Having entered Cambridge in 1935, Huxley {{graduated}} with a bachelor's degree in 1938. In 1939, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin returned from the USA {{to take up a}} fellowship at Trinity College, and Huxley became one of his postgraduate students. Hodgkin was interested in the transmission of electrical signals along nerve fibres. Beginning in 1935 in Cambridge, he had made preliminary measurements on frog sciatic nerves suggesting that the accepted view of the nerve as a simple, elongated battery was flawed. Hodgkin invited Huxley to join him researching the problem. The work was experimentally challenging. One major problem was that the small size of most neurons made it extremely difficult to study them using the techniques of the time. They overcame this by working at the Marine Biological Association laboratory in Plymouth using the giant axon of the <b>longfin</b> <b>inshore</b> <b>squid</b> (Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii), which have the largest neurons known. The experiments were still extremely challenging as the nerve impulses only last a fraction of a millisecond, during which time they needed to measure the changing electrical potential at different points along the nerve. Using equipment largely of their own construction and design, including one of the earliest applications of a technique of electrophysiology known as the voltage clamp, they were able to record ionic currents. In 1939, they jointly published a short paper in Nature reporting on the work done in Plymouth and announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.|$|E
