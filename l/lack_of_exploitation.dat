40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe information {{revolution in military affairs}} (IRMA) {{has changed the}} way that wars are fought and won. Exploiting the revolution's core principles enables a net-centric, informationalized force to outmaneuver and defeat its adversaries. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) represent a critical advancement in intelligence collection capability, but are they as revolutionary a technology as one might expect? Is UAV acquisition without IRMA <b>exploitation</b> the equivalent <b>of</b> purchasing surface-to-air missiles without their radars? This thesis argues that IRMA exploitation is a necessary precondition for effective UAV employment, especially in the maritime domain. By examining the maritime UAV use of several countries across the IRMA exploitation spectrum, one can see that UAV deployment without an underlying information architecture undermines the utility of an unmanned asset. Southeast Asia is the world's fastest growing UAV market. While analysts have predicted that UAVs will disrupt the regional balance of power, this analysis finds that due to a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> IRMA <b>exploitation,</b> the chances <b>of</b> disruption are extremely remote. This thesis identifies the IRMA-related deficiencies of future UAV users, and provides recommendations for increasing the chance of effective UAV use and ultimately, combat efficiency.

40|$|Abstract — The latest {{multiview}} video coding (MVC) standards such as 3 D-HEVC and H. 264 /MVC normally encodes {{texture and}} depth videos separately. Significant amount of rate-distortion performance and computational performance are sacrificed due to separate encoding {{due to the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> of joint information. Obviously, separate encoding also creates synchronization issue for 3 D scene formation in the decoder. Moreover, the hierarchical frame referencing architecture in the MVC creates random access frame delay. In this paper we develop an encoder and decoder framework where we can encode texture and depth video jointly by forming and encoding 3 D cuboid using high dimensional entropy coding. The results from our experiments show that our proposed framework outperforms the 3 D-HEVC in rate-distortion performance and reduces the computational time significantly by reducing random access frame delay.

40|$|Abstract — Despite the {{availability}} of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT’s) infrastructure in central government in Botswana, there is evidence of <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> of the technology. There are several factors that hinder exploitation of information technology in Botswana. Botswana is classified as an upper medium income country because of the country’s high GDP. However, such wealth is derived from diamond mining which has few manufacturing activities. A new social divide is emerging between those who have access and those without access to ICT’s. This is a new social discourse that has a negative effect on the groups which are already disadvantaged, such as rural communities and the unemployed. With the massive investments that Botswana government has made towards ICT, it should now be getting some rewards. Lack of ICT infrastructure is often cited as a problem limiting ICT use in developing countries. Botswana’s situation shows that infrastructure does not necessarily leads to high levels of use...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} structure and dynamics of Leporinus acutidens (Valenciennes, 1837), upstream from Yacyretá Dam (Upper Paraná River, Argentina) were analyzed for {{their relation to}} age, condition factor, growth, mortality and fishery yield. The pre- (1990 - 94) and post- (1995 - 98) filling phases of the reservoir were compared with regard to age structure, condition factor, and the length/weight relationship of fish. Fish sampling was carried out at four sampling sites following a longitudinal gradient along the river. The catches took place monthly using eight monofilament gillnets (mesh 40 to 160 mm). The growth marks on the scales were annual (9 -year maximum). The study {{of the variation in}} the monthly averages of the scale marginal increments revealed that the period of the growth ring formation shifted from winter to spring in the post-filling phase. The length/weight relationship coefficient (b) was higher after dam closing. The condition factor increased before the reproduction period and during late summer, reaching maximum values in the post-filling phase, and especially at the sampling site placed within the reservoir region. The von Bertalanffy growth coefficient k for both sexes was 0. 16, and the asymptotic length L" reached 338 mm.

40|$|Many {{severely}} depleted {{populations of}} baleen whales (Mysticeti) have exhibited clear signs of recovery whereas {{there are few}} examples in toothed whales (Odontoceti). We hypothesize that this difference is due, at least in part, to social and behavioural factors. Clearly, a part <b>of</b> the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> resilience to <b>exploitation</b> is explained by odontocete life history. However, an additional factor may be the highly social nature of many odontocetes in which survival and reproductive success may depend on: (a) social cohesion and organization, (b) mutual defence against predators and possible alloparental care, (c) inter-generational transfer of “knowledge”, and (d) leadership by older individuals. We found little evidence of strong recovery {{in any of the}} depleted populations examined. Their relatively low potential rates of increase mean that odontocete populations can be over-exploited with take rates of only a few percent per year. Exploitation can have effects beyond the dynamics of individual removals.

For the general public, computer ownership is low as about 28 % of the population have computers at home. Despite availability of computers in the public service, members of the public experience delay when they seek service. Motivation and payment are biggest problem regarding employee relations. ICT support is satisfactory though this might be due to low level of ICT use. Fear of change is the main limiting factor to ICT exploitation in Botswana. It was found that maintenance cost of ICT infrastructure is in the order of 8 times the national average salary. A framework is proposed to help policy makers on how best to exploit existing ICT infrastructure. Botswana has remained at the first level of ICT exploitation for over 10 years.

In the present work, real-time interactions for a plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating were measured by a Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance (MP-SPR), and the results were compared with standard traditional cell viability in vitro assays. MP-SPR is proven to be suitable not only for measurement of molecule-molecule interactions but also molecule-material interaction measurements and cell interaction. Although SPR is extensively utilized in interaction studies, recent research of protein or cell adsorption on hydroxyapatite coatings for prostheses applications was not found. The as-sprayed hydroxyapatite coating resulted in 62. 4 % of crystalline phase and an average thickness of 24 ± 6 μm. The MP-SPR was used to measure lysozyme protein and human mesenchymal stem cells interaction to the hydroxyapatite coating. A comparison between the standard gold sensor and Hydroxyapatite (HA) -plasma coated sensor denoted a clearly favourable cell attachment on HA coated sensor as a significantly higher signal of cell binding was detected. Moreover, traditional cell viability and proliferation tests showed increased activity with culture time indicating that cells were proliferating on HA coating. Cells show homogeneous distribution and proliferation along the HA surface between one and seven days with no significant mortality. Cells were flattened and spread on rough surfaces from the first day, with increasing cytoplasmatic extensions during the culture time.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the University of Wolverhampton for the degree of Master of PhilosophyIn recent times, the development and manufacture of new products and the necessary tools required to carry out such activities has resulted in vast amounts of knowledge and information being generated. In product development there are no hard and fast rules determining the length of product development projects and quite often over a 10 -year period several hundreds of projects could come into being, quite often coinciding with huge advances in technology over the same period. This advancement in technology has often taken over the role of the designer who carries out calculations and attempt to provide solutions. This has resulted in certain cases with designers having very little to no understanding or practical experience of the manufacturing process and design expertise required to ratify product designs. The resultant loss of information and intent and the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>exploitation</b> of manufacturing constraints and product knowledge can quite often lead to difficulties resulting in product re-design and in some cases failure {{in the hands of the}} customer. In order to provide knowledge to support product development, there is a requirement to capture the knowledge of the manufacturing processes within the organization, which includes the process, materials, resource, design rules, capacity and other constraints that may limit the capabilities of the organization. The research presented in this thesis proposes a knowledge based framework to support product development Furthermore, the research includes the development of a knowledge based system in order to identify, capture, formalize, present and utilize knowledge within a product development environment. In this research, a knowledge based framework to support product development was developed in order to create an “AS-IS” process map of current product development practices within a case company from the cold roll forming industry.
