40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} if focusing attention externally produced faster movement times compared to instructions that focused attention internally or a control set of instructions that did not explicitly focus attention when performing an agility task. A second purpose of the study was to measure participants’ focus of attention during practice by use of a questionnaire. Participants (N = 20) completed 15 trials of an agility <b>L</b> <b>run</b> following instructions designed to induce an external (EXT), internal (INT) attentional focus or a control (CON) set of instructions inducing no specific focus of attention. Analysis revealed when participants followed the EXT instructions they had significantly faster movement times compared to when they followed the INT and CON set of instructions; consistent with previous research the INT and CON movement times were not significantly different from each other. Qualitative data showed when participants were in the external condition they focused externally 67 % of the time. When they were in the internal condition they focused internally 76 % of the time, and when they were in the control condition they did not use an internal or external focus of attention 77 % of the time. Qualitative data also revealed participants in the EXT, INT, and CON conditions switched their focus of attention at a frequency of 27 %, 35 %, and 51 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|In rugby league, {{individual}} playing positions {{require a}} wide range of physical performance qualities and offensive and defensive skills. This study investigated the physical performance, anthropometric, and skill characteristics of specific playing positions in sub-elite rugby league players. Ninety-eight sub-elite rugby league players (mean ± S. D. age, 22. 5 ± 4. 9 years) participated in this study. Players underwent measurements of anthropometry (height, body mass, and sum of four skinfolds), muscular power (vertical jump), speed (10 m, 20 m, and 40 m sprint), change of direction speed (<b>L</b> <b>run),</b> and maximal aerobic power (multistage fitness test). In addition, two expert coaches independently assessed the skill of players using standardised technical criteria. Hit-up forwards were heavier and had greater skinfold thickness than the adjustables and outside backs positional groups. Furthermore, hit-up forwards had significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) slower change of direction speed than outside backs, and slower 20 m and 40 m speed than both the adjustables and outside backs positional groups. Hit-up forwards had a significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) ability to ‘hit and spin’ than both adjustables and outside backs. The evasion skills (i. e. ability to beat a player and 2 versus 1 ability) of adjustables and outside backs were significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than hit-up forwards. Adjustables had significantly greater (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) skills under physiological game stress than hit-up forwards and better catching, ball carrying, and basic passing skills than the hit-up forwards and outside backs. These findings demonstrate that the physical performance, anthropometric, and skill qualities of sub-elite rugby league players vary according to playing position...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of skill-based conditioning games and traditional conditioning for improving speed, agility, muscular power, and maximal aerobic power in rugby league players. Sixty-nine subelite rugby league players performed either a skill-based conditioning games program (N 5 32) or a traditional conditioning (i. e., running activities with no skill component) program (N 5 37). Each player participated in a 9 -week in-season training program, performed over 2 competitive seasons. Players performed 2 organized field-training sessions each week. Players underwent measurements of speed (10 -m, 20 -m, and 40 -m sprint), muscular power (vertical jump), agility (<b>L</b> <b>run),</b> and maximal aerobic power (multi-stage fitness test) {{before and after the}} training period. Skill-based conditioning games induced a significant improvement (p, 0. 05) in 10 -m, 20 -m, and 40 -m speed, muscular power, and maximal aerobic power, whereas traditional conditioning activities improved 10 -m speed and maximal aerobic power only. No significant differences (p. 0. 05) were detected between the traditional conditioning and skill-based conditioning games groups for changes in 10 -m speed, agility, and maximal aerobic power. Both groups won 6 of 8 matches played within the training period, resulting in a win-loss ratio of 75 %. However, on average, the skill-based conditioning games group scored more points in attack (p, 0. 05) and had a greater (p, 0. 05) points differential than the traditional conditioning group. The results of this study demonstrate that skill-based conditioning games offer an effective method of in-season conditioning for rugby league players. In addition, given that skills learned from skill-based conditioning games {{are more likely to be}} applied in the competitive environment, their use may provide a practical alternative to traditional conditioning for improving the physiological capacities and playing performance of rugby league player...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{systematic}} review {{was conducted with}} the first objective aimed at providing {{an overview of the}} physiological characteristics commonly evaluated in rugby and the corresponding tests used to measure each construct. Secondly, the measurement properties of all identified tests per physiological construct were evaluated with the ultimate purpose of identifying tests with strongest level of evidence per construct. Methods: The review was conducted in two stages. In all stages, electronic databases of EBSCOhost, Medline and Scopus were searched for full-text articles. Stage 1 included studies examining physiological characteristics in rugby. Stage 2 included studies evaluating measurement properties of all tests identified in Stage 1 either in rugby or related sports such as Australian Rules football and Soccer. Two independent reviewers screened relevant articles from titles and abstracts for both stages. Results: Seventy studies met the inclusion criteria for Stage 1. The studies described 63 tests assessing speed (8), agility/change of direction speed (7), upper-body muscular endurance (8), upper-body muscular power (6), upperbody muscular strength (5), anaerobic endurance (4), maximal aerobic power (4), lower-body muscular power (3), prolonged high-intensity intermittent running ability/endurance (5), lower-body muscular strength (5), repeated high-intensity exercise performance (3), repeated-sprint ability (2), repeated-effort ability (1), maximal aerobic speed (1) and abdominal endurance (1). Stage 2 identified 20 studies describing measurement properties of 21 different tests. Only moderate evidence was found for the reliability of the 30 – 15 Intermittent Fitness. There was limited evidence found for the reliability and/or validity of 5 m, 10 m, 20 m speed tests, 505 test, modified 505 test, <b>L</b> <b>run</b> test, Sergeant Jump test and bench press repetitions-to-fatigue tests. There was no information from high-quality studies on the measurement properties of all the other tests identified in stage 1. Conclusion: A number of physiological characteristics are evaluated in rugby. Each physiological construct has multiple tests for measurement. However, there is paucity of information on measurement properties from high-quality studies for the tests. This raises questions about the usefulness and applicability of these tests in rugby and creates a need for high-quality future studies evaluating measurement properties of these physiological tests.

40|$|The coupled model LMDzORINCA {{has been}} used to {{simulate}} the transport, wet and dry deposition of the radioactive tracer 137 Cs after accidental releases. For that reason, two horizontal resolutions were deployed and used in the model, a regular grid of 2. 5 °× 1. 25 °, and the same grid stretched over Europe to reach a resolution of 0. 45 °× 0. 51 °. The vertical dimension is represented with two different resolutions, 19 and 39 levels, respectively, extending up to mesopause. Four different simulations are presented in this work; the first uses the regular grid over 19 vertical levels assuming that the emissions took place at the surface (RG 19 L(S)), the second also uses the regular grid over 19 vertical levels but realistic source injection heights (RG 19 L); in the third resolution the grid is regular and the vertical resolution 39 vertical levels (RG 39 L) and finally, it is extended to the stretched grid with 19 vertical levels (Z 19 L). The best choice for the model validation was the Chernobyl accident which occurred in Ukraine (ex-USSR) on 26 May 1986. This accident has been widely studied since 1986, and a large database has been created containing measurements of atmospheric activity concentration and total cumulative deposition for 137 Cs from most of the European countries. According to the results, the performance of the model to predict the transport and deposition of the radioactive tracer was efficient and accurate presenting low biases in activity concentrations and deposition inventories, despite the large uncertainties on the intensity of the source released. However, the best agreement with observations was obtained using the highest horizontal resolution of the model (Z 19 <b>L</b> <b>run).</b> The model managed to predict the radioactive contamination in most of the European regions (similar to Atlas), and also the arrival times of the radioactive fallout. As regards to the vertical resolution, the largest biases were obtained for the 39 layers run due to the increase of the levels in conjunction with the uncertainty of the source term. Moreover, the ecological half-life of 137 Cs in the atmosphere after the accident ranged between 6 and 9 days, which is in good accordance to what previously reported and in the same range with the recent accident in Japan. The high response of LMDzORINCA model for 137 Cs reinforces the importance of atmospheric modeling in emergency cases to gather information for protecting the population from the adverse effects of radiation...|$|E
