40|$|Background: Traditionally, a {{laparotomy}} wound {{is closed}} in layers co-opting the various layers anatomically. A new method of closure, namely single layer closure technique (mass closure technique) {{has come into}} vogue. Aims: This study aims to evaluate the benefits or otherwise between single layer closure and <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> after comparing it with studies available in literature. Settings and Design: This study was performed in a teaching institute in patients undergoing laparotomy, either planned or emergency. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 cases were selected at random and the study was carried out {{over a period of}} 2 years. The cases were equally divided into two groups of 40. In both groups, vertical midline incision was used. In the first group, abdomen was closed using the single layer closure technique. Continuous suturing with burial of the knots was done in 20 patients and interrupted mass closure was done in another 20 patients. In the other group, the abdomen was closed in layers. The patients were followed up for minimum 6 months. Patients who did not turn up for follow up were asked to notify the development of any wound complication through postal correspondence. Results: The time required for closure was considerably less when continuous suture technique was used. One patient in the mass closure group and four in the layered group developed post-operative wound infections. One patient in the <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> group developed a stitch sinus. There were two cases of burst abdomen with the <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> technique. Two patients in the <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> group developed incisional hernias 6 months post-operatively. Conclusions: Single layer closure technique offers certain definite advantage over the <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> technique with respect to the time required for closure of the incision, incidence of wound dehiscence and the incidence of incisional hernia. However, the true incidence of wound dehiscence (burst abdomen) and incisional hernia cannot be drawn since the study was of short duration and the number of cases was small without a long follow up...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Evaluation of the {{problems}} encountered during a voluntarily fistula campaign in a regional hospital of Niger (Africa). Materials and Methods: Women underwent basic gynecological examination, methylene blue testing, and/or direct cystoscopy as necessary. According to their clinical condition, women were informed and surgical options offered as appropriate. Operations were performed under spinal or epidural anesthesia. Immediate postoperative outcomes were followed during the stay of the surgical team in the country. Results: A total of 62 women were examined and 11 had causes of incontinence other than obstetric fistula. In 9. 8 % of the women, severe local infection precluding any surgical intervention was evident. In 58. 8 % of patients, the trigonal region and/or urethra were irreversibly damaged. A proportion of patients (9. 8 %) with large lesions and intact urethra that were offered vaginal <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> refused the intervention. Of the women that were operated on (21. 6 %), six underwent vaginal <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> with Martius fat flap and five women underwent a combined abdomino-vaginal approach.

However, the relationship between the methods of closure and the degree of thinning needs further elucidation. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether a LUS transverse cesarean section (CS) closure method in one or two layers affects subsequent scar thickness. Subjects and Methods: In this prospective study, 150 women were enrolled and randomly assigned to one- or two-layer closure of the LUS incision. Patients were divided into two groups.

30|$|In {{attempts}} to decrease adhesion formation, several authors have evaluated different surgical techniques. For example, Blumenfeld et al. [8] reported that single <b>layer</b> <b>closure</b> of the hysterotomy incision {{was associated with}} more bladder adhesions {{at the time of}} repeat Cesarean than double <b>layer</b> <b>closure.</b> There is also evidence that that non-closure of the peritoneum after Cesarean section is associated with more adhesion formation compared to closure [9]. Unfortunately, there are very few studies that have looked at adhesions after Cesarean delivery in the literature. Most studies evaluating post-surgical adhesion formation rely on second-look laparoscopy. However, the inconvenience of a second-look procedure especially in postpartum women contributes to the paucity of information on post-Cesarean adhesions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction The {{most common}} cause of parotid fistula is trauma, {{followed}} by malignancy, operative complications (parotidectomy or rhytidectomy) and infection. Acute suppurative parotitis can rarely produce parotid fistula. There are various treatment options available, however it is necessary to standardize the treatment according to the duration of history and the patient's general condition. Case report A 13 -year-old Indo-Caucasian girl presented to us with a two-year history of clear watery discharge from a wound just above and behind the angle of her right jaw. A diagnosis of salivary (parotid) fistula was made based on clinical examination and investigations. The parotid fistula was successfully managed. Conclusion Parotid fistula secondary to suppurative parotitis is rare and difficult to manage successfully.

40|$|The optimal {{strategy}} of abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy has remained {{an issue of}} ongoing debate. This study was undertaken to describe our own experiences with abdominal fascial closure following elective midline laparotomy and compare with what is described in literature. This was a descriptive prospective study of patients who underwent elective midline laparotomy at Bugando Medical Centre between March 2009 and February 2014. A total of 872 patients (M:FÂ =Â  2. 8 : 1) were studied. The median age was 38 Â years. The fascia closure was performed with a continuous and interrupted sutures in 804 (92. 2 %) and 68 (7. 8 %) patients, respectively. Mass closure and <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> were performed in 842 (96. 6 %) and 30 (3. 4 %) patients, respectively. Monofilament sutures were applied for fascia closure in 366 (42. 0 %) patients, multifilament sutures in 506 (58. 0 %) patients. Non-absorbable sutures were chosen in 304 (34. 9 %) patients, slowly absorbable sutures in 506 (58. 0 %), and moderately absorbable sutures in 62 (7. 1 %) patients. Sutures used for fascial closure were vicryl 464 (53. 2 %), nylon 250 (28. 7 %), prolene 62 (7. 1 %), PDSII 54 (6. 2 %) and silk 42 (4. 8 %). Sutures with the strength of 0 were used in 214 (24. 4 %) patients, with strength of 1 in 524 (60. 1 %) patients, and with strength of 2 in 134 (15. 4 %) patients.

40|$|Background: Calcaneal {{fractures}} {{are high}} energy injuries. There is some debate with {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of treating calcaneal fractures with open reduction and internal fixation based on surgical complication rates. Methods: We describe the management of 12 patients who presented to our emergency department with 14 closed intra-articular calcaneal fractures (7 Sanders Class III fractures, 7 Sanders class IV fractures). These 14 fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation. We describe a technique using platelet rich plasma and platelet poor plasma in the closing of the soft tissues after open reduction of calcaneal fractures. Results: While complications with open reduction of calcaneal fractures include poor wound healing and infection and can range between 26 and 60 percent, we observed no complications in our small series. Discussion: Wound complications are the most common and potentially threatening consequence of open reduction and internal fixation of calcaneal fractures. The purpose of this case study is to offer the addition of platelet rich plasma (PRP) and platelet poor plasma (PPP) in the treatment of these complicated injuries. The study also attributes the low complication rate to application of pre-operative bulky Jones type splinting, appropriate surgical timing, pre-operative intravenous antibiotic administration, extensile lateral subperiosteal approach and âhands off â retraction.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} biological mesh closure on perineal wound healing after extralevator abdominoperineal resection (eAPR). Background: Perineal wound complications frequently occur after eAPR with preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer. Cohort studies have suggested that biological mesh closure of the pelvic floor improves perineal wound healing. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to primary closure (standard arm) or biological mesh closure (intervention arm). A non-cross-linked porcine acellular dermal mesh was sutured to the pelvic floor remnants in the intervention arm, followed by a <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> of the ischioanal and subcutaneous fat and skin similar to the control intervention. The outcome of the randomization was concealed from the patient and perineal wound assessor. The primary endpoint was the rate of uncomplicated perineal wound healing defined as a Southampton wound score of less than 2 at 30 days postoperatively. Patients were followed for 1 year. Results: In total, 104 patients were randomly assigned to primary closure (n = 54; 1 dropouts) and biological mesh closure (n = 50; 2 dropouts). Uncomplicated perineal wound healing rate at 30 days was 66 % (33 / 50; 3 not evaluable) after primary closure, which did not significantly differ from 63 % (30 / 48) after biological mesh closure [relative risk 1. 056; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 7854 - 1. 4197; P = 0. 7177). Freedom from perineal hernia at 1 year was 73 % (95 % CI 60. 93 - 85. 07) versus 87 % (95 % CI 77. 49 - 96. 51), respectively (P = 0. 0316). Conclusions: Perineal wound healing after eAPR with preoperative radiotherapy for rectal cancer was not improved when using a biological mesh. A significantly lower 1 -year perineal hernia rate after biological mesh closure is a promising secondary finding that needs longer follow-up to determine its clinical relevance...|$|E

40|$|Background : Incisional hernia (IH) is {{a common}} {{complication}} of abdominal surgery. Its incidence has been reported as high as 39. 9 %. Many factors influence IH rates. Of these, surgical technique is the only factor directly controlled by the surgeon. There is much evidence {{in the literature on}} the optimal midline laparotomy closure technique. Despite the high level of evidence, this optimal closure technique has not met wide acceptance in the surgical community. In preparation of a clinical trial, the PRINCIPLES trial, a literature review was conducted to find the best evidence based technique for abdominal wall closure after midline laparotomy. Methods : An Embase search was performed. Articles describing closure of the fascia after midline laparotomy by different suture techniques and/or suture materials were selected. Results : Fifteen studies were identified, including five meta-analyses. Analysis of the literature showed significant lower IH rates with single <b>layer</b> <b>closure,</b> using a continuous technique with slowly absorbable suture material.

Idiopathic gastric rupture, beyond neonatal period, is extremely rare in childhood. Early diagnosis and surgery are mandatory to avoid fatal complications...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The commonest {{complication}} following hypospadias repair is {{occurrence of}} urethrocutaneous fistula. The smaller fistulas (2 mm) with good vascular surrounding skin require a local skin flap closure for avoiding overlapping suture lines. For the recurrent/larger fistulas with impaired local surrounding skin - incidence of recurrence is significantly reduced {{by providing a}} waterproofing interposition layer. Aims : To study the effect of size, location, number of fistulas and surrounding tissues in selecting the procedure and its outcome. To identify various factors involved in the recurrence and to formulate a management in the cases where recurrence has occurred. Patients and Methods: This study of 35 cases of urethrocutaneous fistula repair was done from July 2006 to May 2009 to achieve better results in fistula management following hypospadias surgery. Statistical analysis used: Ï 2 test and Fisherâ²s exact test. Results : The overall success rate for fistula repair at first attempt was 89 % with success rates for simple closure, <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> and closure with waterproofing layer being 77 %, 89 % and 100 %, respectively. The second attempt success rate at fistula repair for simple closure and closure with waterproofing layer were 33 % and 100 %, respectively. At third attempt the two recurrent fistulas were managed by simple closure with a waterproofing interposition layer with no recurrence. All the waterproofing procedures in this study had a success rate of 100 %. Conclusions: The treatment plan for a fistula must be individualized based on variables which {{has an effect on}} the outcome of repair and to an extent dictates the type of repair to be performed. The significantly improved success rates {{with the addition of a}} waterproofing layer suggests the use of this interposition layer should be done at the earliest available opportunity to prevent a reccurence rather than to reserve it for future options...|$|E
40|$|Vesicovaginal fistulas {{are among}} the most {{distressing}} complications of gynecologic and obstetric procedures. The risk of developing vesicovaginal fistula is more than 1 % after radical surgery and radiotherapy for gynecologic malignancies. Management of these fistulas has been better defined and standardized over the last decade. We describe in this paper the success rate reported in the literature by treatment modality and the guidelines used at our teaching hospitals, University of Rome Campus Biomedico and University of Miami School of Medicine. In general, our preferred approach is a trans-vaginal repair. To the performance of the surgical treatment, we recommend a minimum of a 4 - 6 week's wait from the onset of the fistula. The vaginal repair techniques can be categorized as to those that are modifications of the Latzko procedure or a <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> with or without a Martius flap. The most frequently used abdominal approaches are the bivalve technique or the fistula excision. Radiated fistulas usually require a more individualized management and complex surgical procedures. The rate of successful fistula repair reported in the literature varies between 70 and 100 % in non-radiated patients, with similar results when a vaginal or abdominal approach is performed, the mean success rates being 91 and 97 %, respectively. Fistulas in radiated patients are less frequently repaired and the success rate varies between 40 and 100 %. In this setting many institutions prefer to perform a urinary diversion. In conclusion, the vaginal approach of vesicovaginal fistulas repair should be the preferred one. Transvaginal repairs achieve comparable success rates, while minimizing operative complications, hospital stay, blood loss, and post surgical pain. We recommend waiting at least 4 - 6 weeks prior to attempting repair of a vesicovaginal fistula. It is acceptable to repeat the repair through a vaginal approach even after a first vaginal approach failure. In the more individualized management of fistulas associated with radiation, the vaginal approach should still be considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: Midline {{laparotomy}} is the commonest {{approach for}} abdominal operations. The techniques and sutures used for abdominal fascial closure following elective midline laparotomy differ among surgeons and among centres worldwide. Faulty techniques and/or suture materials used {{may lead to}} a wide range of complications, some with devastating outcomes. Objectives: This study was intended to determine the practices of abdominal fascial closure and related complications following elective midline laparotomy at MNH. Methods: This was a hospital based descriptive prospective study. It included patients who underwent elective midline laparotomy in the units of general surgery, urology and gynaecology between April 2011 and November 2011. All patients were followed up after surgery which lasted until January 2012. Results: One hundred and forty eight patients were eligible for analysis. Among these, 130 (87. 8 %) were females and 18 (12. 2 %) were males. The overall average age was 44. 7 (SD 13. 9) years and ranged from 15 to 90 years. Continuous fascial closure was performed in 147 (99. 3 %) patients while in only one patient interrupted closure was performed. Likewise, mass closure was favoured (99. 3 %) as opposed to <b>layered</b> <b>closure</b> (0. 7 %). Vicryl was the commonly used suture material, 78 (52. 7 %) patients; followed by prolene 46 (31. 1 %) patients and PDSII 24 (16. 2 %). Sutures with size number 1 were used in all patients except one where suture with size number 0 was used. Duration of follow up after surgery varied from 2 months to 9 months; mean duration being 5. 8 months (SD 2. 0 months). Twelve (8. 1 %) patients encountered complications; 11 patients had one complication each while one patient had two complications. Complications reported were persistent wound pain (6), wound sepsis (5) and stitch sinus (2). The use of prolene was associated with persistent wound pain, p-value = 0. 026; and in fact had higher overall complication rates, p-value = 0. 002 vii Conclusion and Recommendations: Uniformity on the techniques of fascial closure after elective midline laparotomy does exist among surgeons in MNH; however the use of different sutures to serve this purpose reflects lack of consensus. Prolene use is associated with persistent wound pain. Factors influencing selection of sutures should be addressed. Long term follow up is crucial for patients who undergo midline laparotomy to assess the occurrence of incisional hernia...|$|E
