The mode of failure of an individual component does not necessarily reflect the mode of failure of the system.” But the standard does not continue to further the understanding required regarding test methods, the components that should be deemed as part of the system, the various modes of failure, and the interpretation of test results for each failure mode.And further in AS3850, “The strength limit state capacity shall be determined by a statistical analysis from the test results in accordance with Paragraph A4.5.” and assuming the test data is taken from a statistically valid test method, the data is to be determined via statistical means to derive the Load resistance model, for the anchor.There are adequate <b>load</b> <b>case</b> coefficients available to estimate sling angle load amplification, suction from the casting bed, and various dynamic transportation load estimates.Load resistance factors of safety, FOS, set out in the Australian Code would typically denote a FOS of 5.0 for re-usable lifting equipment and an FOS of 2.5 for a lifting anchors.The rigging arrangements can influence the applied anchor load, where statically indeterminate systems are not necessarily a design consideration, but can be used in practice. The determination of the loads through the rigging system must be a consideration whilst calculating the load resistant model, refer to the examples shown in Figure 3.|$|E

40|$|The Delft Cylinder Hand {{and similar}} body powered hand {{prostheses}} require an input {{force that is}} too high for daily tasks. The force is perceived as uncomfortable and leads to {{a high rate of}} users abandoning their prosthesis. Reducing the input force by increasing the mechanical advantage of the system is not feasible, as this would unfavourably increase the required input displacement to close the prosthetic hand. The goal of the research is to significantly reduce the input force, without exceeding the input displacement limit by designing a variable mechanical advantage (VMA). The VMA is specifically designed for the Delft Cylinder Hand. The input force, when applying a 30 N pinch force, should always be lower than 50 ± 4 N, without compromising the 53 mm maximum input displacement. Two load cases are used to determine the VMA properties, the worst-geometry <b>load</b> <b>case</b> and the realistic-pinch <b>load</b> <b>case.</b> Calculations show that a VMA design is feasible for the Delft Cylinder Hand. In the case of the worst-geometry <b>load</b> <b>case,</b> a design is only feasible when friction losses are excluded, while for the realistic-pinch <b>load</b> <b>case</b> the friction losses can be included. Simulations confirm that the designed VMA mechanism is able to pinch an object with 30 N, with an input force lower than 50 ± 4 N for the feasible loading conditions. Practical testing was too inconclusive to validate the simulation. Biomechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
