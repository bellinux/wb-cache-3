50|$|For a cornice molding two running {{rules are}} usual, {{one on the}} wall, {{the other on the}} ceiling, upon which the mold is worked to and from by one workman, while another man roughly <b>lays</b> <b>on</b> the <b>plaster</b> to the shape of the molding. The miters at the angles are {{finished}} off with joint rules made of sheet steel of various lengths, three or four inches (102 mm) wide, and about one-eighth inch thick, with one end cut to an angle of about 30°. In some cases the steel plate is let into a stock or handle of hardwood.|$|R
50|$|However, due to none of these, cracks may yet ensue by the {{too fast}} drying of the work, caused through the <b>laying</b> of <b>plaster</b> <b>on</b> dry walls which suck from the {{composition}} the moisture required to {{enable it to}} set, by the application of external heat or {{the heat of the}} sun, by the laying of a coat upon one which has not properly set, the cracking in this case being caused by unequal contraction, or by the use of too small a proportion of sand.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Objectives: The {{accuracy}} and reliability of plaster models and digital models acquired with two different surface laser scanners were tested by means of three methods: measurement with calipers, digital measurement with proper software and superimposition of the digital models. Methods: Thirty plaster models with permanent dentition that met the inclusion criteria were selected and scanned with two laser scanners (R 700 and Xcad). Three examiners measured distances <b>on</b> <b>plaster</b> models with a digital caliper and on digital models using Ortho Analyzer software. The digital models were also compared by means of superimposition of the models using the Geomagic Qualify software. The intra and inter-examiner reliability of the measurements were evaluated using the ICC. Paired t {{test was used to}} test the accuracy of the measurements <b>on</b> digital and <b>plaster</b> models. Results: The measurements <b>on</b> <b>plaster</b> and digital models acquired by two different scanners showed high values for the ICC. Although statistically significant differences between the measurements <b>on</b> <b>plaster</b> and digital models have been found, these discrepancies were not considered clinically relevant. The superimposition method with Geomagic Qualify software showed that the two digital models were not significantly different. Conclusions: Digital models created from scanned plaster models using the R 700 or Xcad scanners were clinically accurate according to the two methods of comparison used...|$|R

And what I says speaking as I find of those new metal chimneys all manner of shapes (there's a row of 'em at Miss Wozenham's lodging-house lower down {{on the other side}} of the way) is that they only work your smoke into artificial patterns for you before you swallow it and that I'd quite as soon swallow mine plain, the flavour being the same, not to mention the conceit of putting up signs on the top of your house to show the forms in which you take your smoke into your inside.|$|R
