Following complaints from Greyhound and Peter Pan, and a requirement for all intercity services {{to move into the}} South Station terminal, Eastern left the Boston and competed in the New York City-Washington, D.C. market, with most trips servicing the Baltimore Travel Plaza.

25|$|Despite this distinction, {{the use of}} {{gunpowder}} {{weapons against}} the castle proved devastating. It was captured after only eight hours when Sir Thomas Wyatt besieged it in January 1554 during his unsuccessful rebellion against Queen Mary. His attack badly damaged the castle, and it was subsequently abandoned and allowed to fall into disrepair. A farmhouse and outbuildings were constructed among the ruins a century <b>later.</b> <b>Today</b> the farmhouse {{is the home of}} the musician Jools Holland, while the nearby barn is used as a wedding venue.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, NBC {{canceled}} Sunrise {{and created}} two brand extensions for Today. One was Early Today (not {{to be confused}} with the earlier incarnation); the program originally was produced by CNBC and focused on business and financial news before switching to general news under the same production staff as MSNBC First Look; it continues to air on many NBC affiliates. Also in the fall of 1999, <b>Later</b> <b>Today,</b> a talk show that was intended to air immediately following the then two-hour Today, was launched with hosts Jodi Applegate, Florence Henderson and Asha Blake. Sagging ratings for that show caused its cancellation in August 2000; it was replaced two months later by the current third hour of Today.|$|E
25|$|On April 12, 1999, {{as part of}} a shakeup of the network's daytime {{and early}} morning {{schedules}} (in which NBC also cancelled NBC News at Sunrise – with newcomer Early Today replacing it as the network's early-morning newscast – and picked up the daytime talk show <b>Later</b> <b>Today,</b> a short-lived spinoff of Today), NBC announced that it would not renew Another World, ending the series' run after 35 years once the show's previous renewal agreement ended that June. Many reasons abounded for Another World cancellation, one of the more notable events occurred in the summer of 1998: the network's San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (now a MyNetworkTV affiliate) – at the time one of NBC's highest-rated stations – stopped airing the show altogether, leaving Days of Our Lives and Sunset Beach as the only NBC soaps that the station cleared on its schedule; the move resulted in Another World being unavailable in around two million television households within the large San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose market, resulting in additional erosion of the program's already below-mediocre ratings (it was later picked up by smaller independent station KICU-TV).|$|E

500|$|Compsognathus ( [...] ; Greek kompsos/κομψός; [...] "elegant", [...] "refined" [...] or [...] "dainty", and gnathos/γνάθος; [...] "jaw") is a genus of small, bipedal, {{carnivorous}} theropod dinosaurs. Members of its single species Compsognathus longipes {{could grow}} {{to the size}} of a turkey. They lived about 150million years ago, the Tithonian age of the late Jurassic period, in what is now Europe. Paleontologists have found two well-preserved fossils, one in Germany in the 1850s and the second in France more than a century <b>later.</b> <b>Today,</b> C. longipes is the only recognized species, although the larger specimen discovered in France in the 1970s was once thought to belong to a separate species and named C. corallestris.|$|E
