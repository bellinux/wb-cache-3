50|$|Deployment of BPL has {{illustrated}} {{a number}} of fundamental challenges, the primary one being that power lines are inherently a very noisy environment. Every time a device turns on or off, it introduces a pop or click into the <b>line.</b> <b>Switching</b> power supplies often introduce noisy harmonics into the line. And unlike coaxial cable or twisted-pair, the wiring has no inherent noise rejection.|$|E
5000|$|Each <b>line</b> <b>switch</b> in this first, mixed bay {{has nine}} lines on nine of its {{vertical}}s, the tenth vertical being reserved for test purposes. In {{addition to the}} 90 <b>lines</b> on these <b>switches,</b> each LLF {{has at least one}} simple <b>line</b> <b>switch</b> bay, with ten more <b>line</b> <b>switches</b> carrying 200 <b>lines.</b> Thus the minimum size of a LLF is 290 lines for a line concentration ratio of 2.9:1. Optionally it has still another frame, with ten more switches and another 200 lines, and so forth, up to a maximum line concentration ratio of 5.9:1 since they all shared the same hundred line links. The line circuit is much like that in 1XB with a line relay for alerting the exchange to a trip condition, and the vertical off-normal contacts of the switch vertical serving as cutoff relay.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—To {{enhance the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of the distribution automation system (DAS), this paper proposes the immune algo-rithm (IA) to derive the optimal placement of switching devices by minimizing {{the total cost of}} customer service outage and invest-ment cost of <b>line</b> <b>switches.</b> The reliability index of each service zone defined by the boundary switches is derived to solve the expected energy not served due to fault contingency, and the customer inter-ruption cost is then determined according to the customer type and power consumption within the service zone. To demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of proposed IA methodology to solve the optimal place-ment of <b>line</b> <b>switches,</b> a practical distribution system of Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) is selected for computer simulation to explore the cost benefit of <b>line</b> <b>switch</b> placement for DAS.

5000|$|In 1971, a new {{telephone}} exchange and trunk line building was erected {{to take place}} of the existing manual exchange and provide automatic trunk <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> facilities to surrounding district exchanges. A building to house this was building erected on site adjoining the Post Office with access from Crescent Street and there are easements between the two sites. In 1994 the building was sold into private ownership and now operates as the Childers Heritage Shop although some post office services are also continued. In 1999 alterations were carried out to allow the operation of a coffee shop in a former bedroom by opening the verandah on the residence and creating a roof deck section between the verandah and eastern porch of the post office. Paving and landscaping were also carried out to a forecourt area.|$|E
50|$|The San Francisco {{cable car}} system {{features}} three areas with gauntlet tracks where the outer rail {{of the inner}} track is shared as the inner rail of the outer track for two sections of tracks: on Washington Street between Mason Street and Powell Street, on Powell Street (north of Washington Street) onto Jackson Street {{to the point of}} divergence of the Powell Street lines at Jackson Street and Mason Street, and on Hyde Street between Jackson Street and Washington Street. On Washington Street, the gauntlet track begins at a manual switch mid-block where Powell Street cable cars travel {{the right side of the}} gauntlet track and turn right onto Powell Street towards Market Street. Cable cars making non-revenue runs (such as those entering or leaving the car barn) normally bear left onto the left side of the gauntlet track which then turns left onto Powell Street heading north. On Powell and Jackson Streets, the gauntlet track also begins at a manual switch located mid-block on the northbound side of Powell Street north of Washington Street. This is where the two Powell Street lines diverge on a downhill section of Powell Street, with the Powell-Hyde <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> to the left side and the Powell-Mason line proceeding straight onto the right side. From there, the cable cars run on gauntlet track which turns left onto Jackson Street, continuing uphill for one block until the Mason line turns right onto Mason Street. On Hyde Street, the gauntlet track is located on the southbound side where California Street cable cars coming from the barn use the right side (forward-facing) of the gauntlet track to access their revenue tracks on California Street to begin their revenue service.|$|E

At 8:19 am, just as the guard was walking back to his brake van after checking doors on the last two carriages, the Perth express crashed into the rear of the local at a speed of 50 - 60 mph. It had passed a colour light signal at caution and two semaphore signals at danger, and had burst through the trailing points of the crossover from the slow lines, which were still set for the local train. The collision completely destroyed the three wooden bodied coaches {{at the rear of the}} local train (where most of the casualties occurred), telescoping them into the length of one coach, and drove the entire train forward 20 yd. The leading two vans and three coaches of the Perth train piled up behind and above the locomotive.The wreckage from the first collision was spread across the adjacent down fast line. A few seconds after the first collision, the northbound express to [...] passed through the station on this line in the opposite direction at approximately 60 mph. The leading locomotive of this train struck the derailed locomotive of the Perth train and derailed itself. The two locomotives from the Liverpool train were diverted left, mounting the platform, which they ploughed across diagonally before landing on their side on the adjacent DC electric line, one line of which was short circuited by the wreckage; the other line had its electric current quickly switched off by the signalman, thus preventing any further collisions. The leading seven coaches, plus a kitchen car from the Liverpool train, were carried forward by momentum, overriding the existing wreckage and piling up above and around it. Several of these coaches struck the underside of the station footbridge, tearing away a steel girder.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> cannot be overemphasized {{as they are}} used to connect and disconnect substations to and from a distribution grid. At the cradle of technology <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> was achieved via the use of manual switches or fuses which could endanger life as a result of electrocution when expose during maintenance. This ill prompted the development of automated <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> using relays and contactors. With time this tends to fail as a result of wearing of the contact which is as a result of arcing and low voltage. To avert all these ills this paper presents Arduino based Radio Frequency Identification RFID <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> using Solid State Relay SSR. This is {{to ensure the safety of}} operators or technologist and to also avert the problem associated with relays and contactors using SSR. This was achieved using RFID RC- 522 reader ardriuno Uno SSR and other discrete components. The system was tested and worked perfectly reducing the risk of electrocution and eliminating damage wearing of the contacts common with contactors and relays...|$|E

In order to avoid excessive conservatism in static timing analysis, it is important to determine if aggressor lines can potentially switch simultaneously with the victim. In this paper, we present a comprehensive ATPG-based approach that uses functional information to identify valid interactions between coupled lines. Our algorithm accounts for glitches on aggressors that can be caused by static and dynamic hazards in the circuit. We present results on several benchmark circuits that show the value of considering functional information to reduce the conservatism associated with worst-case coupled <b>line</b> <b>switching</b> assumptions during static timing analysis...|$|E
5000|$|Line link frames (LLFs) are {{tiers of}} 10x20 {{crossbar}} switches {{in two or}} more bays. The switches in the first bay have their horizontal multiples, or [...] "banjo wires", cut in half, effectively dividing each <b>switch</b> into a <b>line</b> <b>switch</b> and a <b>line</b> junctor <b>switch.</b> Each of the ten junctor switches have ten junctors on its ten verticals, and each of its ten levels was wired as a line link, {{to one of the}} ten <b>line</b> <b>switches</b> of the LLF. Thus, the line link frame terminates 100 Junctors. Each junctor has full availability to however many hundreds of lines there are, via the hundred line links. The number of lines, thus the line concentration ratio (LCR), was engineered for the expected occupancy.|$|R
