40|$|The paper {{provides}} an example of a method to get insight into workload changes over time, executed tasks and situation awareness (SA) in complex task environments. The method is applied to measure the workload of a helicopter crew. The method has three components: 1) task analysis, 2) video recordings of the tasks and 3) analysis of the video tapes by the crew members. A computer program was developed for the third part of the method. The crew members had to indicate the tasks that were executed during the mission and they had to indicate the workload during the mission at fixed time intervals. The results showed, among others, that the relation between number of tasks that were executed concurrently and the workload was low for the crew members of which the tasks were mainly cognitive demanding. Workload for these crew members were more related to the level of SA. The workload was high during periods of low SA. Workload for the crew member of which the tasks were <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demanding</b> was more related to the number of tasks that were executed concurrently and less by the level of SA...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} it is {{investigated}} whether Intelligent leg prostheses {{are better than}} conventional leg prostheses. In the 1990 s the Intelligent prostheses were developed. Nowadays the intelligent prostheses conquer the prosthetic market. Intelligent Prostheses {{are said to be}} the future. But are they really? The main question is answered trough a few paragraphs. Advantages and disadvantages of intelligent prostheses (IP) in literature are examined. Disadvantages of the IP are almost not found in literature, while advantages are numerously found. From comparison studies between intelligent prostheses and conventional prostheses it appeared that intelligent prostheses have a lot of advantages. They can improve gait and balance, show less oxygen consumption, and you’re able to walk down/ up stairs and ramps. Also the users preferences go to the intelligent leg. Negative points to the intelligent leg prosthesis aren’t really there, or at least not in literature. However the intelligent prosthesis is not found to be <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demanding</b> as said in comparison to mechanical prostheses. It is also presumably that the intelligent prosthesis are much more expensive than the mechanical ones. Altogether you can see {{there are a lot of}} advantages towards Intelligent leg prostheses compared to conventional prostheses. The conclusion of this thesis is that the Intelligent Prostheses are indeed better than conventional prostheses. And will probably be even better in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Conventional {{techniques}} to measure health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL) in a single value or index are complex, require abstract reasoning skills, and are prone to biases (e. g., adaptation). A possible alternative that requires <b>less</b> <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> is Thurstone scaling. The present explorative study investigates the feasibility and concurrent validity of using Thurstone scaling to elicit health-state values in patients with dementia and their proxies. Methods: The participants {{in the present study}} were 145 pairs, consisting of community-dwelling persons with dementia and their proxies. We administered the prototype of the dementia quality-of-life instrument (DQI), a dementia-specific HRQoL index instrument, to both patients and proxies. The patient's health state as defined by the DQI was placed randomly among nine other DQI health states and these were ranked from best to worst. These rankings were used for Thurstone scaling. After ranking, the health states were placed on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Results: Thurstone scaling had a completion rate of 37 % for patients and 88 % for proxies. Thurstone scaling showed a high correspondence with VAS values. In addition, we identified a trend that shows that patients value most of the evaluated health states systematically lower than proxies. Conclusions: Thurstone scaling proved to be unfeasible for most patients, but feasible for proxies. Its concurrent validity was supported and new insights into patient-proxy discrepancies were discovered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|This mixed methods study {{examines}} secondary school {{mathematics and science}} teachers’ understanding of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> and the challenges in implementing tasks {{at different levels of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> The conceptual framework for this study is grounded on the conception of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> proposed by Stein, Smith, Henningsen, and Silver (2000), which includes the following levels: memorization (level 1), procedures without connections (level 2), procedures with connections (level 3), and doing mathematics and science (level 4). The study attempts to address the following research questions: 1) To what extent are secondary mathematics and science teachers able to recognize, solve and construct tasks at different levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand?</b> 2) Are there relationships among teachers’ ability to recognize, solve, construct, and implement tasks at different levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand?</b> and 3) What are secondary mathematics and science teachers’ challenges in recognizing, solving, constructing, and implementing cognitively demanding tasks (CDTs) ? CDTs are considered tasks at level 3 and 4. We used a <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> survey to test teachers’ (N= 58) ability to recognize, solve, and construct tasks at different levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> We employed semi-structured interviews and classroom observations to examine a subset of teachers’ (n= 13) challenges in implementing cognitively demanding tasks in mathematics and science classrooms. Correlation and inferential methods were used to analyze data in response to quantitative research questions whereas meaning coding technique was employed to analyze qualitative data. Main results suggest that teachers had challenges distinguishing between the levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> related to procedures with and without connections. Teachers also had challenges solving tasks {{at the highest levels of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> and constructing tasks at the levels of procedures with connections. From the correlation analysis, we found statistically significant associations between recognizing a task at level 2 with recognizing a task at level 3 as well as between recognizing a task at level 3 with recognizing a task at level 4. Analysis of the teachers’ interviews revealed challenges related to students’ knowledge, teachers’ knowledge, and external factors. The reported teachers’ challenges may result in declining the <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> level into procedures without connections. Implications for professional development are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess {{accommodation}} as a possible indicator of changes in the autonomic balance caused by altered <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> Accounting for accommodative responses from a human factors perspective may be motivated by the interest of designing virtual image displays or by establishing an autonomic indicator that allows for remote measurement at the human eye. Heart period, pulse transit time, and the pupillary response were considered as reference for possible closed-loop accommodative effects. <b>Cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> was varied by presenting monocularly numbers at a viewing distance of 5 D (20 cm) which had to be read, added or multiplied; further, letters were presented in a "n-back" task. Results Cardiovascular parameters and pupil size indicated a change in autonomic balance, while error rates and reaction time confirmed the increased <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> during task processing. An observed decrease in accommodation could not be attributed to the <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> itself for two reasons: (1) the <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> induced a shift in gaze direction which, for methodological reasons, accounted for a substantial part of the observed accommodative changes. (2) Remaining effects disappeared when the correctness of task processing was taken into account. Conclusion Although the expectation of accommodation as possible autonomic indicator of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> was not confirmed, the present results are informative for the field of applied psychophysiology noting that it seems not to be worthwhile to include closed-loop accommodation in future studies. From a human factors perspective, expected changes of accommodation due to <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> are of minor importance for design specifications – of, for example, complex visual displays. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the Study: Problem-based {{learning}} is a student-centered approach to teaching mathematics that helps students to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills while learning the mathematics content. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explore how teacher actions and beliefs impact the level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> in a problem-based setting. Procedure: In order to examine how teacher actions and beliefs impact the level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> of a problem, this study compares the implementation of a high level problem by two secondary mathematics teachers. Each teachers' implementation of the problem was observed, recorded, and analyzed in order to find evidence of factors that have been found to maintain a high level <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> A pre- and post-implementation survey was also administered in order to better understand the beliefs and actions of the teacher. Findings: Analysis of the implementation of the problem revealed that both teachers struggled to consistently maintain a high level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> throughout the lesson, although both teachers exhibited strengths and challenges. The teacher who demonstrated more evidence of the factors associated with high levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> had beliefs and goals for student learning that were more aligned with a problem-based approach. Conclusions: Both teachers had mixed results in terms of maintaining a high level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> When implementing a problem-based approach, teachers need opportunities to collaborate and receive feedback on their practice in order to gain a better understanding of the strategies for maintaining a high level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> Additional research is also needed to understand how teacher beliefs are formed and how those beliefs impact student performance...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{students}} achieved higher standardized test scores in mathematics and gained more positive attitudes towards mathematics after learning from reform curricula.

40|$|Car head-up {{displays}} (HUDs), which portray {{information in}} the form of a virtual image reflected off a combiner, allow the viewing of complex information, such as route guidance, without the need for the driver to look away from the road ahead. The <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> required by the HUD task may distract drivers from the outside world scene and cause reaction times to slow. Cognitive capacity also decreases with age. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> and age on the use of a car HUD. Subjects (young, middle or older age drivers, each group n = 8) performed a HUD-assisted driving task, with three levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand,</b> whilst accommodation was simultaneously measured using a dynamically recording infra-red optometer.

We then seek to identify a good measure of the <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> imposed by MT output on the post-editor, {{as opposed to the}} cognitive effort actually exerted by the post-editor during post-editing. Measuring <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> is closely related to measuring MT utility, the MT quality as perceived by the post-editor.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between attention to student thinking during lesson planning {{and the level of}} <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> at which tasks are implemented for six pre-service teachers enrolled in a teacher education program that focuses on attention to student thinking during planning and instruction. Lesson plans were examined for attention to student thinking using two coding schemes, and samples of student work were examined to assess the level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> at which tasks (associated with the enacted lesson plans) were implemented during instruction. Other planning related data sources were qualitatively drawn upon to support the extent to which pre-service teachers focused on student thinking with regard to planning. One of the lesson planning coding schemes provides numerical scores indicating different degrees of attention to six elements of student thinking. The level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand</b> of task implementation for each lesson was able to be coded as high or low. In particular, the quantitative analysis suggested a trend that as overall attention to student thinking during lesson planning increases the odds of high level task implementation become greater compared to the odds of low level task implementation. Given a small sample size the quantitative results need to be considered within their limitations. Qualitative analysis examining attention to student thinking during planning and task implementation supports the quantitative trend. In particular, the qualitative analysis suggests three findings. The first finding is that the two pre-service teachers who demonstrated the most attention to student thinking with regard to planning were the only pre-service teachers who implemented all of their tasks at a high level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> The second finding is that when receiving specific planning based support for a lesson as part of a university assignment, all the pre-service teachers were able to implement the task at high level of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand.</b> The third finding is that a large majority of lessons using tasks accompanied by detailed planning support sources were implemented at high levels of <b>cognitive</b> <b>demand...</b>|$|R

In 130 people with PD, gait performance was quantified in the home using accelerometers allowing estimates of single and dual task walking speed and interference (difference between dual and single task). Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} explore the effect of 12 characteristics representing four domains (personal, motor symptoms, cognitive, affective) on gait outcomes. Thirty-seven percent of variance in single task speed was explained by increased fear of falling, sex, age, disease severity, and depression; 34 % of variance in dual task speed was explained by increased fear of falling, disease severity, medication, and depression; 12 % of variance in interference scores was explained by greater disease severity and impaired executive function. Personal, motor, affective, and cognitive characteristics contribute to walking speed and interference, highlighting the multifactorial nature of gait.
