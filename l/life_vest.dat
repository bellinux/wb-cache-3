5|$|Tragedy did strike Marblehead {{though in}} November 1942. As her {{whaleboat}} was being hoisted back aboard, a sailor from her landing party fell overboard {{and failed to}} ever resurface. The sailor had a newly issued style of <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> on that required being inflated by mouth. This incident brought Captain Chandler to order that Omahas boarding party's return to wearing the older style life jackets that had proven themselves effective {{even though they were}} more cumbersome and bulky.|$|E
5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> and jump off the ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was required to}} have ten <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> installed. However, the divers {{who participated in the}} recovery mission stated that they found no <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> inside the aircraft. The NTSB investigators inspected ten <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> that the airline claimed had been recovered from the wreckage. Four were found to have loose CO₂ gas cylinders, used for inflation of the vests. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later examined all of Vieques Air Link's <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> and found that about 40 percent of them had loose inflation cylinders.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> as {{approved}} by the Norwegian authorities {{turned out to be}} flawed. They were donned by putting the head through an opening and then tightening the sides. However, upon entering the water, the <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> slipped off over the passengers' head. As a consequence of the investigation, all <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> on Norwegian passenger ferries were changed to a model that includes an extra strap that needs to be passed between the passengers' legs.|$|R
25|$|Dehydration from {{prolonged}} exposure to hypertonic salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam {{in the lungs}} that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a <b>life</b> <b>vest.</b>|$|E

Typhoon lost a crewmember when Engineman 2nd Class Douglas Bolles was lost at sea after falling overboard from a rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) off Cape Henry on 7 November 2003 and subsequently found to have removed his <b>life</b> <b>vest.</b> Bolles body was recovered 22 November 2003.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{dry suit}} users can face a similar {{inversion}} problem. The problem is more acute when {{not wearing a}} personal flotation device (<b>life</b> <b>vest)</b> over the dry suit. For surface dry suit users, the inversion can be much more critical if no one is nearby to assist, since the wearer may be held upside down and unable to breathe, and may also have water run down into their nose while inverted.|$|E

5000|$|Since, by regulation, (subsequently changed) the Pensacola to Mobile {{portion of}} the flight was not an {{extended}} overwater flight, the passenger briefing {{did not include the}} location and use of water survival equipment. Therefore many passengers were not aware of the location of the <b>life</b> <b>vests,</b> how to don them, how to use them, and the location and use of the <b>life</b> <b>vest's</b> emergency lights. Those passengers who knew or were told that the <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> were stowed in compartments beneath the seats had difficulty extracting them. Rising water in the cabin compounded the problems of locating and removing the vests from the underseat compartments.|$|R
25|$|On June 5, 1990, Jesse Sharp, a {{whitewater}} canoeist from Tennessee paddled {{over the}} falls {{in a closed}} deck canoe. He neglected to wear a helmet to make his face more visible for photographs of the event. He also did not wear a <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> because he believed it would hinder his escape from the hydraulics {{at the base of}} the falls. His boat flushed out of the falls, but his body was never found.|$|E
25|$|Bahia Bakari (born 15 August 1996) is a French {{woman who}} was the sole {{survivor}} of Yemenia Flight 626, an Airbus A310, which crashed into the Indian Ocean near the north coast of Grande Comore, Comoros on 30 June 2009, killing the 152 other people on board. Bakari, who could barely swim and had no <b>life</b> <b>vest,</b> clung {{to a piece of}} aircraft wreckage, floating in heavy seas for over nine hours, much of it in pitch darkness, before being rescued. Her mother, who had been traveling with her from Paris, France, for a summer vacation in Comoros, died in the crash.|$|E
25|$|After {{asking a}} flight {{attendant}} for permission to move to seat 26K, saying {{he could get a}} better view from that seat, Yousef moved to that seat and tucked the assembled bomb into the <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> pocket under that seat. He exited the aircraft in Cebu. Philippine domestic Flight Attendant Maria De La Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats {{during the course of the}} Manila to Cebu flight and got off the plane in Cebu with the domestic cabin crew, but did not pass the information along to the international flight crew that boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. 25 other passengers also got off the plane at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.|$|E

25|$|On 13 January, a Bell Jet Ranger {{helicopter}} {{that had}} been waterbombing the fires in the forests west of Canberra crashed into Bendora Dam with one person, pilot Duncan Patrick, injured. The pilot was reloading waterbuckets from the dam {{at the time of}} the crash. ACT Chief Minister Jon Stanhope and ACT Chief Fire Control Officer Peter Lucas-Smith were reviewing the fires nearby during a routine bushfire surveillance flight in the Snowy Hydro SouthCare helicopter. The unconscious pilot had been pulled from the sinking wreckage by a SouthCare rescue helicopter medical crewman Euan McKenzie, but due to the weight of his clothes and lack of <b>life</b> <b>vest,</b> was unable to be dragged from the water. The pilot of the Southcare chopper cautiously positioned his aircraft to allow Stanhope, Lucas-Smith and a paramedic on board to dive into the dam and bring the injured pilot about 60 metres to shore for resuscitation by Lucas-Smith and McKenzie. The pilot had head injuries and underwent emergency surgery at Canberra Hospital.|$|E
500|$|Other couples {{refused to}} be separated. Ida Straus, the wife of Macy's {{department}} store co-owner and {{former member of the}} United States House of Representatives Isidor Straus, told her husband: [...] "We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go." [...] They sat down in a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.|$|E
500|$|At around 8:30 AM on September 20, {{a man was}} presumed {{drowned in}} Lake Catouatchie, {{southwest}} of New Orleans. The man had been shrimping in the lake in choppy waters caused by the storm, and dove into the water without a <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> to untangle a net from his boat's propeller. [...] After he freed the propeller, the boat was carried away by the current in the lake, and he was last seen swimming after the boat. [...] After the disappearance, the Coast Guard launched a search with rescue boats and search dogs but could not locate him. His body was eventually found {{on the morning of}} September 22. Captain Pat Yoes, of the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office, said that the storm [...] "obviously... played a part" [...] in the man's death, but Lieutenant Commander William Brewer of the United States Coast Guard told the press that he did not [...] "think it was directly storm-related." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{the engine}} failed, the captain did not warn or brief the {{passengers}} concerning <b>life</b> <b>vests,</b> emergency exits, or the developing situation. Consequently, no passengers {{made use of}} the <b>life</b> <b>vests</b> stored under each seat. Additionally, the captain failed to extend the flaps and failed to turn the plane into the wind. Those failures resulted in the plane impacting the ocean with almost twice the kinetic energy {{that would have been}} otherwise generated, causing the plane to break up and rapidly sink.|$|R
500|$|McCain's plane {{went into}} a {{vertical}} inverted spin. McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; {{the force of the}} ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious. McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms. Eventually, he was able to inflate his <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> using his teeth. Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore. [...] A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area. He was then transported to Hanoi's main Hỏa Lò Prison, nicknamed the [...] "Hanoi Hilton" [...] by American POWs.|$|E
500|$|Conscience was {{a factor}} in Peter Galbraith's {{criticism}} of fraud in the 2009 Afghanistan election despite it costing him his United Nations job. Conscience motivated Bunnatine Greenhouse to expose irregularities in the contracting of the Halliburton company for work in Iraq. Naji al-Ali a popular cartoon artist in the Arab world, loved for his defense of the ordinary people, and for his criticism of repression and despotism by both the Israeli military and Yasser Arafat's PLO, was murdered for refusing to compromise with his conscience. The journalist Anna Politkovskaya provided (prior to her murder) an example of conscience in her opposition to the Second Chechen War and then-Russian President Vladimir Putin. Conscience motivated the Russian human-rights activist Natalia Estemirova, who was abducted and murdered in Grozny, Chechnya in 2009. The Death of Neda Agha-Soltan arose from conscience-driven protests against the 2009 Iranian presidential election. Female Muslim lawyer Shirin Ebadi (winner of the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize) has been described as the 'conscience of the Islamic Republic' for her work in protecting the human rights of women and children in Iran. The human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng, {{often referred to as the}} 'conscience of China' and who had previously been arrested and allegedly tortured by the Chinese regime for defending members of the Falun Gong, was abducted by Chinese security agents on 4 February 2009 and has not been seen since. 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in his final statement before being sentenced by a closed Chinese court to over a decade in jail as a political prisoner of conscience stated: [...] "For hatred is corrosive of a person’s wisdom and conscience; the mentality of enmity can poison a nation’s spirit." [...] Sergei Magnitsky, a lawyer in Russia, was arrested, held without trial for almost a year and died in custody, as a result of exposing corruption. On 6 October 2001 Laura Whittle was a naval gunner on HMAS Adelaide (FFG 01) under orders to implement a new border protection policy when they encountered the SIEV-4 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel-4) refugee boat in choppy seas. After being ordered to fire warning shots from her 50 calibre machinegun to make the boat turn back she saw it beginning to break up and sink with a father on board holding out his young daughter that she might be saved (see Children Overboard Affair). Whittle jumped without a <b>life</b> <b>vest</b> 12 metres into the sea to help save the refugees from drowning thinking [...] "this isn't right; this isn't how things should be." [...] In February 2012 journalist Marie Colvin was deliberately targeted and killed by the Syrian Army [...] in Homs during the 2011–2012 Syrian uprising and Siege of Homs, after she decided to stay at the [...] "epicentre of the storm" [...] in order to [...] "expose what is happening." [...] In October 2012 the Taliban organised the attempted murder of Malala Yousafzai a teenage girl who had been campaigning, despite their threats, for female education in Pakistan. In December 2012 the 2012 Delhi gang rape case was said to have stirred the collective conscience of India to civil disobedience and public protest at the lack of legal action against rapists in that country (see Rape in India) In June 2013 Edward Snowden revealed details of a US National Security Agency internet and electronic communication PRISM (surveillance program) because of a conscience-felt obligation to the freedom of humanity greater than obedience to the laws that bound his employment.|$|E
