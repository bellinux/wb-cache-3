40|$|We study {{phase locking}} in the Kuramoto model of coupled {{oscillators}} {{in the special}} case where the number of oscillators, N, is large but finite, and the oscillators' natural frequencies are evenly spaced on a given interval. In this case, stable phase-locked solutions are known to exist {{if and only if}} the frequency interval is narrower than a certain critical width, called the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold.</b> For infinite N, the exact value of the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold</b> was calculated 30 years ago; however, the leading corrections to it for finite N have remained unsolved analytically. Here we derive an asymptotic formula for the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold</b> when N ≫ 1. The leading correction to the infinite-N result scales like either N^- 3 / 2 or N^- 1, depending on whether the frequencies are evenly spaced according to a midpoint rule or an endpoint rule. These scaling laws agree with numerical results obtained by Pazó [Phys. Rev. E 72, 046211 (2005) ]. Moreover, our analysis yields the exact prefactors in the scaling laws, which also match the numerics. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the scaling {{properties of the}} order parameter and the largest nonvanishing Lyapunov exponent for the fully locked state in the Kuramoto model with a finite number N of oscillators. We show that, for any finite value of N, both quantities scale as (K-K_L) ^ 1 / 2 with the coupling strength K sufficiently close to the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold</b> K_L. We confirm numerically these predictions for oscillator frequencies evenly spaced in the interval [- 1, 1] and additionally find that the coupling range δ K over which this scaling is valid shrinks like δ K ∼ N^-α with α≈ 1. 5 as N →∞. Away from this interval, the order parameter exhibits the infinite-N behavior r-r_L ∼ (K-K_L) ^ 2 / 3 proposed by Pazó [Phys. Rev. E 72, 046211 (2005) ]. We argue that the crossover between the two behaviors occurs because at the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold,</b> the upper bound of the continuous part of the spectrum of the fully locked state approaches zero as N increases. Our results clarify the convergence to the N →∞ limit in the Kuramoto model. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} {{transport equation}} for {{the evolution of}} toroidal rotation in tokamak plasmas is developed from the two-fluid momentum equations taking account of the constraints imposed by faster time scale processes. In addition to the usual collision-induced and microturbulence-induced transport processes, the plasma toroidal rotation equation includes the effects of 3 D non-axisymmetric (NA) magnetic field components produced by external fields and MHD-type instabilities in the plasma. Non-resonant NA fields produce a toroidal torque throughout the plasma that relaxes the toroidal flow to an “intrinsic ” ion-temperature-gradient diamagnetic-type flow in the direction counter to the plasma current. A NA resonant field error causes a toroidal torque localized near its rational surface. The combination of resonant and non-resonant non-axisymmetric field components is found to predict scalings for error field penetration and mode <b>locking</b> <b>thresholds</b> that are in closer agreement with empirical data from tokamak plasmas. 1...|$|R

In this paper, we study the feasibility of event recognition when object tracks are fragmented. By changing the <b>lock</b> score <b>threshold</b> controlling track termination, different levels of track fragmentation are generated. The effect on event recognition is revealed by examining the event model match score as a function of <b>lock</b> score <b>threshold.</b> Using a Dynamic Bayesian Network to model events, it is shown that event recognition actually improves with greater track fragmentation, assuming fragmented tracks for the same object are linked together.

40|$|HARRIS, under {{contract}} with NASA Lewis, {{has developed a}} hard decision BCH (Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem) triple error correcting block CODEC ASIC, {{that can be used}} in either a bursted or continuous mode. the ASIC contains both encoder and decoder functions, programmable <b>lock</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and PSK related functions. The CODEC provides up to 4 dB of coding gain for data rates up to 300 Mbps. The overhead is selectable from 7 / 8 to 15 / 16 resulting in minimal band spreading, for a given BER. Many of the internal calculations are brought out enabling the CODEC to be incorporated in more complex designs. The ASIC has been tested in BPSK, QPSK and 16 -ary PSK link simulators and found to perform to within 0. 1 dB of theory for BER's of 10 (exp - 2) to 10 (exp - 9). The ASIC itself, being a hard decision CODEC, is not limited to PSK modulation formats.

Mode locking could be robustly produced by an applied m = 1 field error, which is resonant with the core tearing modes. A dominantly m = 0 field error did not produce locking.

40|$|We {{present a}} case study of how {{topology}} can affect synchronization. Specifically, we consider arrays of phase oscillators coupled in a ring or a chain topology. Each ring is perfectly matched to a chain with the same initial conditions and the same random natural frequencies. The only difference is their boundary conditions: periodic for a ring, and open for a chain. For both topologies, stable phase-locked states exist if and only if the spread or "width" of the natural frequencies is smaller than a critical value called the <b>locking</b> <b>threshold</b> (which depends on the boundary conditions and the particular realization of the frequencies). The central question is whether a ring synchronizes more readily than a chain. We show that it usually does, but not always. Rigorous bounds are derived for the ratio between the locking thresholds of a ring and its matched chain, for a variant of the Kuramoto model that also includes a wider family of models.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new systematic, low cost and {{real-time}} adaptive algorithm to automatically set the loop filters parameters of the phase lock loops or delay lock loops used in synchronization systems like GPS. The aim of this method is to compute the loop filter coefficients which minimize the power of the thermal noise within the total tracking error, to improve the pseudorange measurements accuracy on each locked channel. Method is based on real-time estimations of the dynamics and signal-to-noise ratio of the incoming signals, which are used to compute the better compromise between the equivalent noise bandwidth and the steady state error factor of the loops. Estimates of signal parameters are obtained in real-time from observations of the error signal delivered by the dicriminator. From these estimates and from the knowledge of the equivalent linear model of the loop, an optimization function is built that gives the pole position of the loop transfer function that minimizes the equivalent noise bandwidth keeping a fixed probability that the error signal becomes greater than the <b>lock</b> <b>threshold.</b> This solution is evaluated by an iterative method with an update rate of 50 Hz or less, depending on the velocity of the variation of the dynamics and on the hardware constraints. The Fast Adaptive Bandwidth Lock Loop (FAB-LL) results in a real-time optimal use of the loops because it minimizes the power of the pseudorange measurement thermal noise with respect to the imposed error due to dynamics. Practical and theoretical approaches have shown the method is operational and robust...|$|R
40|$|The microstructures and the {{rheological}} behaviour of synthetic magmatic suspensions {{in the range}} of 0 % to 80 % solid fraction have been investigated in torsion experiments. The liquid phase is a haplogranitic melt (HPG) with 2. 5 Wt % H 20. The solid phase is composed of a sieved fraction (45 Μm<Φ< 90 Μm) of crushed alumina grains that avoid any chemical interaction with the melt such as dissolution/crystallisation during synthesis of the suspension and during the experiments. Four analogous suspensions with respectively 0, 20, 60 and 80 % solid fraction were synthesised at 100 MPa and 950 °C during one month ensuring a homogeneous repartition of water in the melt. Torsion experiments were performed in a high-pressure, high temperature Paterson apparatus at 300 MPa confining pressure, temperatures ranging from 475 °C to 1000 °C and shear strain rates from 2. 1 x 10 - 3 to 2. 0 x 10 - 5 s- 1. Pure melt was deformed up to Γ= 8. 8. Steping tests at various shear strain rates yielded a stress exponent of ~ 1. 1 with an apparent viscosity ~ 1010. 9 Pa. s at T= 475 °C and a stress exponent of ~ 1. 0 with an apparent viscosity ~ 1010. 3 Pa. s at T= 500 °C. These results confirm the Newtonian character of pure haplogranitic melts at high pressure. The 20 % solid fraction suspension departs from Newtonian behaviour with a stress exponent n= 1. 4 and an apparent log viscosity varying from 11. 5 (T= 500 °C) to 10. 6 (T= 600 °C) both at a strain rate ~ 2. 10 - 4 s- 1. Shape Preferred Orientations (SPO) of alumina grains and shapes and orientations of initially spherical (22 Μm in diameter) residual air bubbles were analysed using the inertia tensor method on polished sections normal to the shear direction. For Γ= 2. 6 the solid fraction developed a strong SPO with a mean direction Α= 2 ° anticlockwise from the shear direction and bubbles passively deformed with a mean long axis orientation 24 ° anticlockwise and a mean aspect ratio R= 2. 07. For Γ= 17. 5, the SPO of the alumina grains became significantly weaker but still homogeneous in orientation with Α= 6 ° anticlockwise while long axis of bubbles were oriented 17 ° anticlockwise with R= 2. 13. For the 60 % solid fraction suspension, shear softening behaviour is evidenced by a stress exponent n= 2. 2 for T= 550 °C and n= 2. 0 for T= 600 °C. Measured apparent viscosities from 1010. 1 Pa. s to 1011. 6 Pa. s are four orders lower that predicted by theoretical models. From Γ= 8. 8 to 21. 3, SPO of the alumina phase determined by the intercept method is composed of two mean heterogeneously developed directions respectively ~ 10 ° anticlockwise and ~ 25 ° clockwise from the shear direction. These two associated directions that match S/C structures are locally disturbed by strain localisation developing synthetic R and P Riedel shear bands that suggest granular flow-like behaviour of the solid suspension. This strain localisation with possibly melt enhanced weakening in strain localised domains is a possible cause of low apparent viscosities recorded in these experiments. For 80 % solid fraction, the samples were too strong to be deformed in the stress range of the apparatus. This behaviour implies a rheological threshold between 60 % and 80 % solid fraction that matches with the Particle <b>Locking</b> <b>Threshold</b> suggested by theoretical models...|$|E

40|$|OAK A 271 MULTI-MODE ERROR FIELD CORRECTION ON THE DIII-D TOKAMAK. Error field {{optimization}} on DIII-D tokamak plasma discharges has routinely {{been done}} {{for the last ten}} years {{with the use of the}} external ''n = 1 coil'' or the ''C-coil''. The optimum level of correction coil current is determined by the ability to avoid the locked mode instability and access previously unstable parameter space at low densities. The locked mode typically has toroidal and poloidal mode numbers n = 1 and m = 2, respectively, and it is this component that initially determined the correction coil current and phase. Realization of the importance of nearby n = 1 mode components m = 1 and m = 3 has led to a revision of the error field correction algorithm. Viscous and toroidal mode coupling effects suggested the need for additional terms in the expression for the radial ''penetration'' field B{sub pen} that can induce a locked mode. To incorporate these effects, the low density <b>locked</b> mode <b>threshold</b> database was expanded. A database of discharges at various toroidal fields, plasma currents, and safety factors was supplement 4 ed with data from an experiment in which the fields of the n = 1 coil and C-coil were combined, allowing the poloidal mode spectrum of the error field to be varied.

40|$|The {{property}} of a neuron to phase-lock to an oscillatory stimulus before adapting its spike rate to the stimulus frequency {{plays an important}} role for the auditory system. We investigate under which conditions neurons exhibit this phase <b>locking</b> below rate <b>threshold.</b> To this end, we simulate neurons employing the widely used leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model. Tuning parameters, we can arrange either an irregular spontaneous or a tonic spiking mode. When the neuron is stimulated in both modes, a significant rise of vector strength prior to a noticeable change of the spike rate can be observed. Combining analytic reasoning with numerical simulations, we trace this observation back to a modulation of interspike intervals, which itself requires spikes to be only loosely coupled. We test the limits of this conception by simulating an LIF model with threshold fatigue, which generates pronounced anticorrelations between subsequent interspike intervals. In addition we evaluate the LIF response for harmonic stimuli of various frequencies and discuss the extension to more complex stimuli. It seems that phase <b>locking</b> below rate <b>threshold</b> occurs generically for all zero mean stimuli. Finally, we discuss our findings in the context of stimulus detection. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{functioning}} of standard phase locked loops (PLL), including those used to track radio signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), {{is based on}} a linear approximation which holds in presence of small phase errors. Such an approximation represents a reasonable assumption in most of the propagation channels. However, in presence of a fading channel the phase error may become large, making the linear approximation no longer valid. The PLL is then expected to operate in a non-linear regime. As PLLs are generally designed and expected to operate in their linear regime, whenever the non-linear regime comes into play, they will experience a serious limitation in their capability to track the corresponding signals. The phase error and the performance of a typical PLL embedded into a commercial multiconstellation GNSS receiver were analyzed in presence of simulated ionospheric scintillation. Large phase errors occurred during scintillation-induced signal fluctuations although cycle slips only occurred during the signal re-acquisition after a loss of lock. Losses of lock occurred whenever the signal faded below the minimum C/N 0 threshold allowed for tracking. The simulations were performed for different signals (GPS L 1 C/A, GPS L 2 C, GPS L 5 and Galileo L 1). L 5 and L 2 C proved to be weaker than L 1. It appeared evident that the conditions driving the PLL phase error in the specific case of GPS receivers in presence of scintillation-induced signal perturbations need to be evaluated in terms of the combination of the minimum C/N 0 tracking <b>threshold,</b> <b>lock</b> detector <b>thresholds,</b> possible cycle slips in the tracking PLL and accuracy of the observables (i. e. the error propagation onto the observables stage) ...|$|R

The parameter range of the MAST confinement database has been extended and it now also includes pellet-fuelled discharges. Good pellet retention has been observed in H-mode discharges without triggering an ELM or an H/L transition during peripheral ablation of low speed pellets. Co-ordinated studies on MAST and DIII-D demonstrate a strong link between the aspect ratio and the beta scaling of H-mode energy confinement, consistent with that obtained when MAST data were merged with {{a subset of the}} ITPA database. Electron and ion ITBs are readily formed and their evolution has been investigated. Electron and ion thermal diffusivities have been reduced to values close to the ion neoclassical level.

40|$|Abstract—A {{method for}} {{acquisition}} of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signals {{based on a}} minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receiver is presented. An adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE), operating at the chip rate, uses the known spreading code as training data. A fixed number of un-modulated code periods is transmitted for acquisition purposes. An arbitrarily chosen initial code timing is hypothesized, and this timing is used to adapt the DFE and despread the chip estimates at its output. When the despreader output exceeds a <b>threshold,</b> <b>lock</b> is declared, and the receiver switches from acquisition to tracking mode. If the threshold is not exceeded during a prespecified amount of time, a different initial timing is hypothesized, and the receiver is re-initialized. The locally generated code can be advanced by a number of chips that is proportional to the length of the feedforward equalizer filter. The MMSE receiver also automatically acquires and tracks the Doppler shift that results from source-receiver motion using a phase-locked loop and integrated sample-rate interpolation. Code acquisition is demonstrated using experimental data with length 63 Kasami sequences transmitted at a chip rate of 10 kHz for a resulting data rate of 150 bps.

40|$|OAK-B 135 This paper {{investigates the}} {{formation}} and breakup of the ''slinky mode'' in an RFP using analytic techniques previously employed to examine mode locking phenomena in tokamaks. The slinky mode is a toroidally localized, coherent interference pattern in the magnetic field which co-rotates with the plasma at the reversal surface. This mode forms, {{as a result of}} the nonlinear coupling of multiple m = 1 core tearing modes, via a bifurcation which is similar to that by which toroidally coupled tearing modes lock together in a tokamak. The slinky mode breaks up via a second bifurcation which is similar to that by which toroidally coupled tearing modes in a tokamak unlock. However, the typical m = 1 mode amplitude below which slinky breakup is triggered is much smaller than that above which slinky formation occurs. Analytic expressions for the slinky formation and breakup thresholds are obtained in all regimes of physical interest. The locking of the slinky mode to a static error-field is also investigated analytically. Either the error-field arrests the rotation of the plasma at the reversal surface before the formation of the slinky mode, so that the mode subsequently forms as a non-rotating mode, or the slinky mode forms as a rotating mode and subsequently locks to the error-field. Analytic expressions for the <b>locking</b> and unlocking <b>thresholds</b> are obtained in all regimes of physical interest. The problems associated with a locked slinky mode can be alleviated by canceling out the accidentally produced error-field responsible for locking the slinky mode, using a deliberately created ''control'' error-field.
