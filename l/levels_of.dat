40|$|This {{paper is}} about using prosody to {{automatically}} detect {{one aspect of}} a speaker’s internal state: their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty. While past work on classifying <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty used the perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty as the value to predict, we find that this quantity often differs from a speaker’s actual <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty as gauged by self-reports. In this work we build models to predict a speaker’s self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty using prosodic features. Our data is a corpus of single-sentence utterances that are annotated with (1) whether the statement is correct or incorrect, (2) the perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, and (3) the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty. Knowing the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, {{in conjunction with the}} perceived <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, allows us to assess what we will refer to as the speaker’s transparency. Knowing the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty, in conjunction with the correctness of the answer, allows us to assess what we will refer to as self-awareness. Our models, trained on prosodic features, correctly classify the self-reported <b>level</b> <b>of</b> certainty 75 % of the time.
