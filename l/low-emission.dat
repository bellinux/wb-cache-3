40|$|Australia’s {{efforts to}} {{transition}} to a <b>low-emissions</b> economy have stagnated following the successive defeats of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This failure should not, however, {{be regarded as the}} end of Australia’s efforts to make this transition. In fact, the opportunity now exists for Australia to refine its existing arrangements to enable this transition to occur more effectively. The starting point for this analysis is the legal arrangements applying to the electricity generation sector, which is the largest sectoral emitter of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. Without an effective strategy to mitigate this sector’s contribution to anthropogenic climate change, it is unlikely that Australia will be able to transition towards a <b>low-emissions</b> economy. It is on this basis that this article assesses the dominant national legal arrangement – the Renewable Energy Target – underpinning the electricity generation sector's efforts to become a <b>low-emissions</b> sector...|$|R

40|$|Key points The cost of {{effective}} global and Australian mitigation will be materially lower if opportunities for innovation in <b>low-emissions</b> technologies are fully utilised. There is too little private investment in innovation generally {{in the absence}} of public fiscal support. The urgency of the adjustment task and the large change in incentives derived from carbon pricing justify a large transitional increase in public support for innovation related to <b>low-emissions</b> technology. Global public expenditure on research, development, demonstration and commercialisation of <b>low-emissions</b> technologies increased {{in the aftermath of the}} Great Crash of 2008, reversing several decades of decline in investment in innovation in alternative energy and energy saving technologies. The increased global effort has accelerated progress in cost reductions in low emissions energy across several technologies. Substantial increases in investment in innovation are still warranted. A new feature of the global innovation effort is a substantial contribution from China and then India. Australia should do its proportionate part as a developed country in the global innovation effort: in basic research focusing on areas where we have comparative advantage in research capacity and strong national interest in application; in commercialisation, following business priorities backed by investment commitments; and reducing other costs of innovation by expanding relevant high-level education and removing regulatory and legal barriers to new activities. Australian policy on research, development, demonstration and commercialisation has evolved in productive ways since the Review. New general mechanisms for supporting commercial research and development can play a productive role in delivering additional support for <b>low-emissions</b> innovation at the commercialisation end of the chain. To ensure the optimal level of innovation in Australia in the transition to a <b>low-emissions</b> economy, I propose a package of measures including: increasing support for public and private basic research; market-led support for private demonstration and commercialisation; the <b>Low-Emissions</b> Technology Commitment on total funding, leading to roughly a doubling of research, development and commercialisation expenditure to $ 2 - 3 billion per annum; and strong and independent governance arrangements. The scheme should be administered by an independent authority, taking important decisions on advice from independent expert bodies...|$|R

40|$|Lean {{combustion}} concepts {{for aircraft}} engine combustors {{are prone to}} combustion instabilities. Mitigation of instabilities is an enabling technology for these <b>low-emissions</b> combustors. NASA Glenn Research Center s prior activity has demonstrated active control to suppress a high-frequency combustion instability in a combustor rig designed to emulate an actual aircraft engine instability experience with a conventional, rich-front-end combustor. The current effort is developing further understanding of the problem specifically as applied to future lean-burning, very <b>low-emissions</b> combustors. A prototype advanced, <b>low-emissions</b> aircraft engine combustor with a combustion instability has been identified and previous work has characterized the dynamic behavior of that combustor prototype. The combustor exhibits thermoacoustic instabilities {{that are related to}} increasing fuel flow and that potentially prevent full-power operation. A simplified, non-linear oscillator model and a more physics-based sectored 1 -D dynamic model have been developed to capture the combustor prototype s instability behavior. Utilizing these models, the NASA Adaptive Sliding Phasor Average Control (ASPAC) instability control method has been updated for the <b>low-emissions</b> combustor prototype. Active combustion instability suppression using the ASPAC control method has been demonstrated experimentally with this combustor prototype in a NASA combustion test cell operating at engine pressures, temperatures, and flows. A high-frequency fuel valve was utilized to perturb the combustor fuel flow. Successful instability suppression was shown using a dynamic pressure sensor in the combustor for controller feedback. Instability control was also shown with a pressure feedback sensor in the lower temperature region upstream of the combustor. It was also demonstrated that the controller can prevent the instability from occurring while combustor operation was transitioning from a stable, low-power condition to a normally unstable high-power condition, thus enabling the high-power condition...|$|R
