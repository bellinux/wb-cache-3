5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> the B flat major chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E
5|$|Coward's most {{enduring}} {{work from the}} war years was the hugely successful black comedy Blithe Spirit (1941), about a novelist who researches the occult and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a 1945 film, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in Blithe Spirit, alternating the piece with his comedy Present <b>Laughter</b> <b>and</b> his working-class drama This Happy Breed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an HMM-based synthesis approach for speech-laughs. The building stone {{of this project}} {{was the idea of}} the co-occurrence of smile <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> bursts in varying proportions within amused speech utterances. A corpus with three complemen-tary speaking styles was used to train the underlying HMM models: neutral speech, speech-smile, <b>and</b> finally <b>laughter</b> in different ar-ticulatory configurations. Two types of speech-laughs were then synthesized: one made by combining neutral speech <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> bursts, <b>and</b> the other made by combining speech-smile <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> bursts. Synthesized stimuli were then rated in terms of perceived amusement and naturalness levels. Results show the compound effect of both <b>laughter</b> bursts <b>and</b> smile on both amusement and naturalness and inspire interesting perspectives.

50|$|The Fourposter is a 1951 play {{written by}} Jan de Hartog. The two-character story spans thirty-five years, from 1890 to 1925, as {{it focuses on}} the trials <b>and</b> tribulations, <b>laughters</b> <b>and</b> sorrows, and hopes and disappointments {{experienced}} by Agnes and Michael throughout their marriage. The set consists solely of their bedroom, dominated by the large fourposter bed {{in the center of}} the room. Its simple set and small cast have made it a popular choice for amateur theatrical groups.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount of voice acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, <b>laughter,</b> <b>and</b> other battle cries.|$|E
5|$|Born in Teddington, {{south-west}} London, Coward {{attended a}} dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début {{at the age}} of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as Hay Fever, Private Lives, Design for Living, Present <b>Laughter</b> <b>and</b> Blithe Spirit, have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta Bitter Sweet and comic revues), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel Pomp and Circumstance, and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.|$|E

More specifically, the study examines how oncology patients take stances, facilitated by humor <b>and</b> <b>laughter,</b> {{in the midst of}} raising issues about their health and wellness. The concept of "justifying wellness" is extended by attending to how cancer patients utilize humor <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> when trying to convince physicians that they are not sick but well. These instances of humor <b>and</b> <b>laughter</b> involve delicate discussions about weight, the use of sarcasm, and language designed to minimize sickness and optimize wellness. Attention is also given to how providers respond to patient-initiated humor <b>and</b> <b>laughter.</b> Key Words: laughter, humor, justifying wellness, oncology...|$|R

One very public {{indication}} of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979 interview on Tom Snyder's late-night The Tomorrow Show. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the inebriated Frehley, whose frequent <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder {{and the rest of}} the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.|$|E

In November 1872, though, he adapted Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea for children. Five years later Józef Ignacy Kraszewski's The Favourites of King August came out, translated from the Polish and edited by Leskov.|$|E
25|$|Wilder and Brackett, {{nervous about}} a major {{screening}} in Hollywood, held a preview in Evanston, Illinois, in late 1949. The original edit {{opened with a}} scene inside a morgue, with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted with <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> seemed unsure whether to view {{the rest of the}} film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in Poughkeepsie, New York, and a third in Great Neck, the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening, using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.|$|E

25|$|In a {{dramatic}} case of situational irony, {{a room at}} the Salon d'Automne was dedicated to Picasso in 1944. During the crucial years of Cubism, between 1909 and 1914, the dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler forbade Braque and Picasso from exhibiting at both the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Indépendants. He thought the salons were places of humor and ribaldry, of jokes, <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> ridicule. Fearing that Cubism would not be taken seriously in such public exhibitions where thousands of spectators would assemble to see new creations, he signed exclusivity contracts with his artists, ensuring that their works could only be shown (and sold) in the privacy of his own gallery.|$|E
25|$|The Prahasanas(broad farces) of Chilakamarti can be {{classified}} into three kinds. As a matter of rule and as the word Prahasana connotes, it should create much <b>laughter</b> <b>and</b> hence known as a broad farce. Even a farce must have a purpose. Unless it conveys a message, it cannot be called genuine Prahasana. Keeping this in view, Chilakamarti wrote almost half of his prahasanas with specific aim of conveying a message. The second category is purely {{for the sake of}} farce; loud laughter is sometimes produced by mere dialogue and its articulation. The third category is much like an essay through which comment and caustic criticism is offered on the evils prevailing in the society.|$|E
