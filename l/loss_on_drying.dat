50|$|An {{accurate}} {{method for}} determining {{the amount of water}} is the Karl Fischer titration, developed in 1935 by the German chemist whose name it bears. This method detects only water, contrary to <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>drying,</b> which detects any volatile substances.|$|E
50|$|KF is {{selective}} for water, because the titration reaction itself consumes water. In contrast, measurement of mass <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>drying</b> will detect {{the loss of}} any volatile substance. However, the strong redox chemistry (SO2/I2) means that redox-active sample constituents may react with the reagents. For this reason, KF is unsuitable for solutions containing e.g. dimethyl sulfoxide.|$|E
50|$|The classic {{laboratory}} {{method of}} measuring high level moisture in solid or semi-solid materials is <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>drying</b> (LOD). In this technique {{a sample of}} material is weighed, heated in an oven for an appropriate period, cooled in the dry atmosphere of a desiccator, and then reweighed. If the volatile content of the solid is primarily water, the LOD technique gives a good measure of moisture content. Because the manual laboratory method is relatively slow, automated moisture analyzers have been developed that can reduce the time necessary for a test from a couple hours {{to just a few}} minutes. These analyzers incorporate an electronic balance with a sample tray and surrounding heating element. Under microprocessor control the sample can be heated rapidly and a result computed prior to the completion of the process, based on the moisture loss rate, known as a drying curve.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{structure}} of two oak woodland {{types in the}} Santa Rosa region of the Santa Ana Mountains of southern California {{has been described by}} Zuill (1967). One type called the grass oak woodland (GOW) is composed mainly of Q. engelmannii on hills and slopes. The other type called the dense oak woodland (DOW) is composed equally of Q. engelmannii and Q. agrifolia with twice the density of the GOW and is located in valleys with granite rock outcrops. An apparent lack of seedlings and saplings was noted in the area. The present study focuses on an explanation for the distribution patterns of the two oak species in the field and the factors which might be most important in influencing seedling establishment. Quercus agrifolia is restricted to cool moist protected locations on the north side and in fractures of rock outcrops because its acorns are sensitive to moisture <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> air <b>drying,</b> require constantly moist conditions for one to five weeks for water uptake to effect germination and have very rapid shoot development after germination. Seedlings may be intolerant of high temperatures in open grass litter, and seedlings and saplings appear less tolerant of fire than Q. engelmannii, which would also tend to restrict Q. agrifolia to protected locations around rock outcrops. The distribution of Q. engelmannii trees with respect to rock outcrops does not differ from a random distribution and the few that are associated with outcrops show a random distribution with respect to position around outcrops. The occurrence of Q. engelmannii in more open exposed habitats may be due to its acorns' tolerance to moisture <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> air <b>drying,</b> their ability to germinate with little or n 6 additional water uptake, its self-planting mechanism and delayed shoot development, and the drought deciduous habit of seedlings and their tolerance to fire.

40|$|Different {{methods for}} quality {{assessment}} of separated andcommingled plastics from household and electronic waste havebeen developed. Especial {{attention has been}} given tospectroscopic methods since they are non-destructive andrequire little or no sample preparation at all. A wide variety of low molecular weight compounds have beenidentified in recycled polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylenefrom hard packaging waste by gas chromatography- massspectroscopy (GC-MS) after microwave assisted extraction (MAE). Low molecular weight substances such as alcohols, esters,ketones and fragrance and flavour compounds were detected inthe recycled resins. The major category of compounds identifiedin the virgin resins is conformed by aliphatic hydrocarbonssuch as alkanes and alkenes. It was found that theconcentration of aromatic hydrocarbons without functionalgroups, e. g. ethylbenzene and xylenes in recycled HDPE wasapprox. 5 times higher and equal to 120 and 35 ppb,respectively. The potential of near infrared (NIR) and Fourier transformRaman (FT-Raman) spectroscopy in combination with multivariateanalysis as a rapid, non-destructive and accurate analyticalmethod has been studied and the feasibility of these methodsfor at/in line characterisation of several properties ofrecyclates has also been explored. NIR in diffuse reflectance mode has been successfully usedfor quantification of antioxidants in polyethylene, thestandard error of prediction is almost comparable to the errorof wet methods, i. e., extraction plus liquid chromatography. The error of prediction of this method is 35 ppm for Irganox 1010 and 68 ppm for Irgafos 168. The inaccuracy in thequantification of Irgafos 168 {{is due to the fact}} that thisantioxidant degrades during polymer processing. NIR and Mid-infrared (Mid-IR) worked well for fastdetermination of molecular weight and crystallinity of therecycled HDPE and acceptable errors of prediction, comparableto that of the reference methods, i. e. size exclusionchromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) have been obtained. The present thesis also shows that NIR and Raman are goodcandidates for in/on line compositional analysis of mixedpolymer fractions from recycled plastic waste. Diffusereflectance NIR allows a rapid and reliable measurement ofpellets and requires no previous sample preparation. Thecomposition of binary blends can be determined with highaccuracy. The PP content in the PP/HDPE blends was predictedwith a RMSEP equal to 0. 46 %w in the 0 - 15 %wt region and theRMSEP for PP in the PP/ABS blends was 0. 3 %wt. The thermal and thermoxidative stability of recycled PP,HDPE and a 20 / 80 PP/HDPE blend subjected to multiple extrusionhave been studied by DSC, thermal analysis (TGA) andchemiluminiscence (CL). A decrease in Toxand OIT was observed after each extrusion step. The drop in OIT was sharper after the first two extrusions. TheOIT values produced by DSC and CL were in good agreement. However, CL provided more information about the oxidationprocess taking place in the blends. The moisture content in recycled polyamide 6, 6 was readilydetermined by NIR in transmission mode and it could bepredicted with a RMSEP = 0. 05 %wt. The accuracy of the methodappeared to be as good as that of the more time consumingthermal methods such as TGA, DSC and <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>dry</b> (LOD), whichwere used as reference methods.

The API AeroFlow® automated flowability analyzer was tested using 6 pharmaceutical excipients.

Powders were also characterized in terms of particle size, particle shape, <b>loss</b> of weight <b>on</b> <b>drying,</b> Carr’s compressibility index, and critical orifice diameter to prevent ratholing.
