25|$|The Blitz was a German bombing {{offensive}} against Britain in 1940 and 1941, during the Second World War. The term {{was first used}} by the British press as an abbreviation of Blitzkrieg (<b>lightning</b> <b>war).</b> The Germans conducted mass air attacks against industrial targets, towns and cities, beginning with raids on London {{towards the end of}} the Battle of Britain in 1940, a battle for daylight air superiority between the Luftwaffe and the Royal Air Force over the United Kingdom. By September 1940, the Luftwaffe had failed and the German air fleets (Luftflotten) were ordered to attack London, to draw RAF Fighter Command into a battle of annihilation. Adolf Hitler and Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered the new policy on 6 September 1940. From 7 September 1940, London was systematically bombed by the Luftwaffe for 56 out of the following 57 days and nights. Most notable was a large daylight attack against London on 15 September.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, as Deputy Commander of Operations/III Corps, {{assistant}} to General Pham Quoc Thuan, Hiếu applied Blitzkrieg (<b>lightning</b> <b>war)</b> tactics {{to alleviate the}} pressure exerted by 5th NVA Division originating from Svay Rieng Province in the Parrot's Beak area of Cambodian territory aiming at Đức Huệ base camp. Hiếu employed twenty mobile battalions to surround the Parrot's Beak area. Secondly, on April 27, he launched 49th Infantry Regiment and 7th Ranger Group through the swamp lands around Đức Huệ towards the Cambodian border, and had VNAF airplanes attack positions of 5th NVA Division units. In the meantime, he relied on two Regional Force battalions belonging to IV Corps to move from Mộc Hóa up north to establish blocking positions on the southwestern edge of the 5th NVA Division's logistical base and assembly area. On 28 April, General Hiếu launched eleven battalions into the battleground to conduct preliminary operation in preparation of the main offensive.|$|E
25|$|German tactics for the {{offensive}} involved an initial intense artillery barrage, {{followed by an}} immediate infantry attack by the Volksgrenadier divisions supported with light assault guns like the Sturmgeschütz IV. This initial attack with relatively non-mobile and relatively expendable troops was intended to clear major roads {{for use by the}} SS Panzer divisions, which would then rapidly move to capture bridges on the Meuse river for the final drive to Antwerp. These armored divisions were employed in a much more organized and controlled fashion, and with better leadership, than was the standard in U.S. armies. The German concept of the armored division involved independent units that carried with them all their supporting elements, making them more mobile, flexible, and able to concentrate greater force at the point of attack. Shock and high speed would overwhelm resistance, as did the first drive from the Ardennes in 1940. These tactics made up what was referred to in the press as the blitzkrieg, or <b>lightning</b> <b>war.</b> This evolution of mechanized attack was more sophisticated than tactics used by the American army. The German command expected that the allied high command would take weeks to adjust to the impact. But Hitler failed to consider the constricted, winding, often unpaved roads of the northern Ardennes and vastly underrated the capabilities of the American units on the northern shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|On 10 May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded France and the Low Countries. The Blitzkrieg (<b>Lightning</b> <b>War)</b> tactics {{took the}} Western powers by surprise. By {{the time of}} the {{resignation}} of the French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud on 16 June, it was obvious that Germany victory in the Battle of France was inevitable. In the Channel Islands, civilians worried about the consequences of remaining on the Islands but, to avoid panic, were told by the authorities to stay put. Senior officials were ordered to stay in order to maintain order and to keep the Government functioning. On the 15 June, the British government decided to demilitarise the Islands, evacuating the British garrisons and leaving them undefended. The Germans were not informed however. [...] Evacuation boats for civilians only became available on 20 June and again, to stop a panic, people were still told to remain where they were and that only women and children should be taken. Only when the Lieutenant Governors of the islands evacuated were the recommendation relaxed. The last official ships sailed on 23 June.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the term blitzkrieg is obscure. It was never used {{in the title of}} a {{military}} doctrine or handbook of the German army or air force, and no [...] "coherent doctrine" [...] or [...] "unifying concept of blitzkrieg" [...] existed. The term seems rarely to have been used in the German military press before 1939 and recent research at the German Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt at Potsdam found it in only two military articles from the 1930s. Both used the term to mean a swift strategic knock-out, rather than a radical new military doctrine or approach to war. The first article (1935) deals primarily with supplies of food and materiel in wartime. The term blitzkrieg is used with reference to German efforts to win a quick victory in the First World War but is not {{associated with the use of}} armoured, mechanised or air forces. It argued that Germany must develop self-sufficiency in food, because it might again prove impossible to deal a swift knock-out to its enemies, leading to a long war. In the second article (1938), launching a swift strategic knock-out is described as an attractive idea for Germany but difficult to achieve on land under modern conditions (especially against systems of fortification like the Maginot Line), unless an exceptionally high degree of surprise could be achieved. The author vaguely suggests that a massive strategic air attack might hold out better prospects but the topic is not explored in detail. A third relatively early use of the term in German occurs in Die Deutsche Kriegsstärke (German War Strength) by Fritz Sternberg, a Jewish, Marxist, political economist and refugee from the Third Reich, published in 1938 in Paris and in London as Germany and a <b>Lightning</b> <b>War.</b> Sternberg wrote that Germany was not prepared economically for a long war but might win a quick war ("Blitzkrieg") [...] He did not go into detail about tactics or suggest that the German armed forces had evolved a radically new operational method. His book offers scant clues as to how German lightning victories might be won.|$|E

5000|$|Blitzkrieg {{was not a}} doctrine, or an {{operational}} scheme, or even a tactical system. In fact, it simply doesn’t exist, {{at least not in}} the way we usually think it does. The Germans never used the term Blitzkrieg in any precise sense, and almost never used it outside of quotations. It simply meant a rapid and decisive victory (<b>lightning</b> <b>war)...</b> The Germans didn’t invent anything new in the interwar period, but rather used new technologies like tanks and air and radiocontrolled command to restore an old way of war that they still found to be valid, Bewegungskrieg.|$|E
50|$|Less mobile {{mechanized}} {{infantry and}} regular infantry (who, {{along with their}} horse-drawn artillery support, vastly outnumbered their mechanized comrades) would then in theory follow-up the panzer divisions' penetration into enemy territory. The Heer was closely supported by the Luftwaffe, especially by dive bombers that attacked and disrupted the enemy's supply and communications lines and spread panic and confusion in its rear, thus further paralyzing the enemy's defensive capabilities. Mechanization {{was the key to}} this German tactic first revealed in the September Campaign and nicknamed blitzkrieg (<b>lightning</b> <b>war)</b> by contemporary journalists, who found the name fitting because of the unprecedented speed and mobility that were its underlying characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|... 200 years ago, the Iron Legion, {{ruled by}} the fearsome Lord Ferrok, {{was on the brink}} of total conquest of the world. Ferrok, believing victory was at hand, {{gathered}} his armies at his stronghold, the Iron Tower, to prepare for a final onslaught. However, the Solar Empire, the last nation still standing after the <b>Lightning</b> <b>Wars,</b> invades Old Xylvania in a last-ditch attempt to destroy the Legion. After a series of battles, Empress Qa-len, monarch of the Solar Empire, drops a strike battalion equipped with a powerful staff deep into Legion territory with orders {{to take it to the}} top of the Iron Tower, whereby it can be used to activate a satellite super-weapon, which would destroy the Legion. Lord Ferrok, discovering the plan, sends in bombers to find and eliminate them, yet one member of the battalion survives the assault. A lone grunt quickly finds the staff just as it is about to fall into enemy hands, and quickly proceeds towards the tower. His rifle is now supercharged by the staff, and a shield is created around himself. The Staff Bearer (as he became known) defeats many Legion troops, heavy tanks and gunships before destroying one of Ferrok's precious Battlestations. The explosion from the Battlestation destroys the protective wall around the tower, clearing the path for the Staff Bearer (who is now accompanied by three Solar grunts). After defeating the grunts guarding the tower, the four Solar warriors infiltrate the tower and activated the satellite's superweapon. After the huge blast from the satellite struck and destroyed, both the Iron Tower and the Iron Legion, Qa-Len finds the staff in the crater, and proceeds to an icy wasteland, where she throws it into a chasm, in hopes that it may never be used again, unaware this action would spark a new conflict in the future.|$|R
2500|$|Explanation of {{accelerated}} glacial coastward {{movement and}} iceberg calving fails to consider another causal factor: increased {{weight of the}} central highland ice sheet. As the central ice sheet thickens, which it has for at least seven decades, its greater weight causes more horizontal outward force at the bedrock. This in turn appears to have increased glacial calving at the coasts. Visual evidence for increased central highland ice sheet thickness exists in the numerous aircraft that have made forced landings on the icecap since the 1940s. They landed {{on the surface and}} later disappeared under the ice. [...] A notable example is the Lockheed P-38F <b>Lightning</b> World <b>War</b> II fighter plane Glacier Girl that was exhumed from 268 feet of ice in 1992 and restored to flying condition after being buried for over 50 years.
