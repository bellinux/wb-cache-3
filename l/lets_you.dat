It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city that lives and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, {{as well as more}} quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.|$|E

500|$|Jayne Nelson, {{writing in}} {{magazine}} SFX, named Dale {{the second most}} [...] "serial" [...] science-fiction guest star after Mark Sheppard. She wrote: [...] "The thing is, soap-opera origins aside, Dale is always good. Which is why he keeps getting so much work....Dale never <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> down, always (well, usually) summoning up a pitch-perfect accent, too. There's something comforting about his presence on a show, as though the fact he's in it has lent it some weight." [...] In a profile of his work on [...] "cult shows", Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy called Dale an [...] "institution".|$|E
500|$|The {{score is}} mostly low-key, with the {{exception}} of the suspense and death scenes. It was performed by a union orchestra, obliging New Line Cinema to grant the film its own score. Walker described her score as [...] "very theme-driven, conservative music that covers the range from bizarre animal noises with stronger visceral impact to stirring emotional music with well-defined melodies that evolve through the storytelling". The [...] "Main Title" [...] piece, used for the opening credits, was rare for opening a film aimed at a youth audience at the time. [...] "What a treat for me to get to write a piece that calls you into the movie and <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know something bad is going to happen from the get go", Walker said. According to Walker, [...] "Main Title" [...] consumed most of her time, due to its [...] "dark theme and counter melody which carries throughout the score".|$|E
500|$|Kenneth Wayne Thomas, in Intrinsic Motivation at Work, {{described}} {{the book as}} [...] "somewhat sympathetic" [...] to Erhard and the est philosophy; Steve Jackson, writing in Westword, similarly included it among [...] "books sympathetic to Erhard, est and Landmark", written by an [...] "old friend of Erhard's". Stephen Goldstein, in a Washington Post review, said Bartley had made it [...] "obvious {{from the start that}} he cares about his subject and his own est experience" [...] and had told [...] "a rather simple, straightforward story that pretty much <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> draw your own conclusions [...] or keep the ones you have already reached." [...] A reviewer in [...] stated he was [...] "enthusiastic about this book", praising the [...] "personal quality [...] the narrative, which, though, sometimes becomes overly detailed." [...] He highly recommended the book for general and college libraries focused on the social sciences.|$|E

500|$|Publications {{judged the}} co-op {{aspect of the}} game well. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer praised {{the fact that the}} {{missions}} were [...] "designed with co-op in mind." [...] He noted that, for example, the third level [...] "has Joanna providing cover fire for her father Jack as he hops from one point of the level to the next. In the single player campaign Jack's AI controlled, but co-op <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> take direct control of his actions, making the experience a much more engaging affair all-round." [...] Multiplayer matches of Perfect Dark Zero were widely well received. GameSpot stated that [...] "the excellent weapon selection, flexibility of options, high-quality maps, and smooth online performance ... make for a rock-solid competitive shooter." [...] IGN stated similar pros, calling it [...] "enormous". 1UP.com reviewer Che Chou also praised the multiplayer, but observed that [...] "constantly roll-dodging to avoid enemy fire at close range [...] combined with the exceptionally slow movement speed of your character [...] can occasionally be highly frustrating for beginners." ...|$|E
500|$|Complaints {{about her}} role as fashion {{eminence}} grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. [...] "She's honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no," [...] according to Karl Lagerfeld. [...] "She's not too pushy", agrees François-Henri Pinault, {{chief executive officer of}} PPR, Gucci's parent company. [...] "She <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." [...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. [...] "Commercial is not a dirty word to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Hayward {{categorized}} {{the writing}} team involved in Todd's redemption as [...] "an usually {{high number of}} male writers", and as an unusual situation because, historically, most soap opera writers have been women. In a June 1994 interview with TV Guide, in {{an article about the}} trend during the early 1990s of redeemed rapists on soap operas, head writer Malone commented that [...] "he bond between the woman and the violator is a great historical tradition in fiction and films," [...] and said that Rudolph Valentino, Humphrey Bogart, Kirk Douglas, and Clark Gable [...] "all began as totally irredeemable villains." [...] Although he did not think that most women want to be raped or are drawn to violence, he said that viewers [...] "are responding to the intensity of passion and an actor who <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> inside the torment. Some [...] believe they can be swept up in that passion and still turn it good. They think, 'With me, he'd be different. [...] The author of the article, Michael Logan, supported Malone's statements, and commented, [...] "Let's call a spade a spade. There is a large contingent of American female soap viewers who find something very attractive about rapists". [...] Hayward reported that many female viewers were furious that Logan had described them this way, and stated that their attraction to Todd was due to the skill of the actor portraying him.|$|E

500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know when you have an opening and when to run".|$|E
500|$|Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone {{appreciated}} André 3000's {{performance and}} the song itself, writing: [...] "André 3000 is sharp and effortlessly charismatic on his rapped verse, but the real attraction here is the track itself." [...] Similarly, David Amidon of PopMatters commented that the song features [...] "one of those rare 'look how effortless rapping is for me'." [...] This was echoed by Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork Media, who wrote that [...] " [...] carefree retro sensibility pops up on three more highlights, including 'Party', which combines a pitch-perfect André 3000 guest verse, a Slick Rick sample, [...] while its bounce provides prime summer barbecue background." [...] Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was also positive: [...] "'Party' sounds right out of The SOS Band's catalog (its plodding tempo {{is the only thing}} that <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> know she isn't quoting a particularly poetic, desperately meth-seeking craigslist m4m ad [...] )". Jon Caramainca of The New York Times wrote that Beyoncé sings the song [...] "in her best impression of naughtiness." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound praised the minimal production and simplistic lyrics of [...] "Party" [...] further describing the song as being as [...] "simple as a Beyoncé song gets: a low-key, synth-y beat paired with inspired vocals by Beyoncé and a killer, fluid verse by Mr. Benjamin [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump <b>lets</b> <b>you</b> do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
