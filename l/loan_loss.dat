Citigroup will continue to operate as a single company for the time being, but Citi Holdings managers will be tasked to [...] "take advantage of value-enhancing disposition and combination opportunities as they emerge", and eventual spin-offs or mergers involving either operating unit were not ruled out. Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages.

It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized as other.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present data {{collected}} by the banking supervision authorities on banks' nonperforming assets and <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> {{with a view to}} establishing a consistent database for analysing the condition of Finnish banks and firms. Over {{the past couple of years}} some FIM 100 billion's worth of banks' exposures have been nonperforming, for shorter or longer periods of time. At the end of 1992 banks' nonperforming assets amounted to FIM 55 billion, after writeoffs of FIM 22 billion for the year. Firms in the domestic sector of the economy are facing the most difficult debt-servicing problems; nonperforming assets amounted to some 15 per cent of exposures on average. For manufacturing firms, the figure was less than five per cent. The relatively stronger position of manufacturing firms is also clearly seen in the breakdown of <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> by industry. These firms accounted for only just over 10 per cent of <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> attributable to domestic firms. Construction and real estate business accounted for 45 per cent of the total. Although a fifth of nonperforrning loans were accounted for by households, these loans have not caused the banks' <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> to any great extent so far.

40|$|During {{the last}} couple of years, concern has {{increased}} that the exceptionally rapid growth in business loans at commercial banks has been {{due in large part to}} excessively easy credit standards. Some analysts argue that competition for loan customers has greatly increased, causing banks to reduce loan rates and ease credit standards to obtain new business. Others argue that as the economic expansion has continued and memories of past <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> have faded, banks have become more willing to take risks. Whichever explanation is correct, the acceleration in loan growth could lead eventually to a surge in <b>loan</b> <b>losses,</b> reducing bank profits and sparking a new round of bank failures. As the experience of the early 1990 s made clear, such a slump in banking could not only threaten the deposit insurance fund but also slow the economy by discouraging banks from granting new loans. > The view that faster loan growth leads to higher <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> should not be dismissed lightly; nor should it be accepted without question. If loan growth increases because banks become more willing to lend, credit standards should fall and <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> should eventually rise. But loan growth can increase for reasons other than a shift in supply, for example, businesses may decide to shift their financing from the capital markets to banks, or an increase in productivity may boost the returns to investment. In such cases, faster loan growth need not lead to higher <b>loan</b> <b>losses.</b> > Keeton explains why supply shifts are necessary for faster loan growth to lead to higher <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> and determines if supply shifts have caused loan growth and <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> to be positively related in the past. On balance, he finds limited support for the view that supply shifts have caused loan growth and <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> to be positively related. Data on business loans and delinquencies show that states experiencing unusually rapid loan growth tended to experience unusually big increases in delinquency rates several years later. His finding is tempered, however, by evidence on business loan growth and business credit standards suggesting that changes in loan growth are not always due to shifts in supply.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the more fragile a banking system is, {{the more likely it is}} to experience problems when an unexpected shock hits. The empirical framework where this test is conducted is a reduced form model, where macroeconomic factors explain banks’ <b>loan</b> <b>losses.</b> The dependent variable is the ratio of net <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> to lending in a panel comprising the banking sectors of nine sample countries. An econometric model is estimated on pooled annual data mostly covering the period from the early 1980 s to 2002. There are three separate explanatory terms. Two of these include a surprise change both in incomes and real interest rates. Both form a separate cross-product term with lagged aggregate indebtedness. The lagged dependent variable is the third explanatory term possibly capturing the feedback effect from <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> back to the real economy. The underlying macroeconomic account that this paper puts forward is that <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> seem basically to be generated by strong adverse aggregate shocks under high exposure of banks to such shocks.

In ad-dition to the lagged dependent variable, the explanatory variables include a surprise change in incomes and real interest rates, both variables as a separate cross-product term with lagged aggregate indebtedness.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that banks smooth income by managing provisions for <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> and <b>loan</b> charge-offs in a coordinated fashion that varies across the bust and boom phases of the business cycle and across homogeneous and heterogeneous loan types. In particular, during the 1990 s boom, we predict and find that banks accelerated provisioning for <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> and made this less obvious by accelerating loan charge-offs, especially for homogenous loans for which charge-offs are determined using number-of-days-past-due rules. We also {{provide evidence}} that the valuation implications of banks’ provisions for <b>loan</b> <b>losses</b> and <b>loan</b> charge-offs vary across the phases of the business cycle and loan types reflecting {{the effect of these}} factors on banks’ income smoothing.

Our results are consistent with the market only partially appreciating healthy banks’ overstatement of charge-offs of homogeneous loans based on number-of-days-past-due rules during the 1990 s boom, because of the perceived non-discretionary nature of these charge-offs. ...|$|R
