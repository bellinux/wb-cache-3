40|$|A new {{approach}} for monitoring in fractured rock was demonstrated in a contaminated (trichloroethylene and metola-chlor) dolostone aquifer used for municipal water supply.

[FLUTe] blank liner) and a depth-discrete multilevel monitoring system (MLS) (the Water FLUTe) for temporary or permanent monitoring. The continuous borehole liner consists of a urethane-coated nylon fabric tube custom sized to each hole. The FLUTe MLS consists of the same liner material with many depth-discrete intervals for monitoring hydraulic head and/or ground water quality. The FLUTe blank <b>liner</b> <b>seals</b> the entire borehole, prior to FLUTe multilevel installation, to prevent vertical cross connection while allow-ing borehole logging and testing.

40|$|Based on {{regulatory}} requirements for Type A and B radioactive material packaging, a Testing Program {{was developed to}} evaluate the effects of mixed wastes on plastic materials {{which could be used}} as <b>liners</b> and <b>seals</b> in transportation containers. The plastics evaluated in this program were butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer (Nitrile rubber), cross-linked polyethylene, epichlorohydrin, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), fluorocarbons, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), butyl rubber, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). These plastics were first screened in four simulant mixed wastes. The liner materials were screened using specific gravity measurements and seal materials by vapor transport rate (VTR) measurements. For the screening of liner materials, Kel-F, HDPE, and XLPE were found to offer the greatest resistance to the combination of radiation and chemicals. The tests also indicated that while all seal materials passed exposure to the aqueous simulant mixed waste, EPDM and SBR had the lowest VTRs. In the chlorinated hydrocarbon simulant mixed waste, only Viton passed the screening tests. In both the simulant scintillation fluid mixed waste and the ketone mixture waste, none of the seal materials met the screening criteria. Those materials which passed the screening tests were subjected to further comprehensive testing in each of the simulant wastes. The materials were exposed to four different radiation doses followed by exposure to a simulant mixed waste at three temperatures and four different exposure times (7, 14, 28, 180 days). Materials were tested by measuring specific gravity, dimensional, hardness, stress cracking, VTR, compression set, and tensile properties.

30|$|A dense {{sampling}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{at the peak}} of the dry season (January 2012) during which 72 water samples were collected from over 13 communities (Fig.  1). These included 32 open wells and 14 ‘boreholes’ hereafter termed groundwater, 14 streams, 4 rivers, 5 dam waters, and 3 lakes (Lakes Bambili, Oku and Ber) hereafter called surface water. Surface water sources were collected under base flow conditions (no run-off influence) since the sampling was in the dry season. The locations and altitudes of the selected sampling points were identified in the field using a Garmin Vista CX GPS. New narrow mouth low-density polyethylene bottles (100  ml) and Duran glass bottles (500  ml) were used for stable isotopes and tritium (3 H) water sampling, respectively. The glass bottles contained screw caps bonded with polytetrafluoroethylene-coated silicone <b>seal</b> <b>liners.</b> In order to avoid contamination, the bottles were properly rinsed with distilled water and dried in the Laboratory. Further details on water sampling are described in Wirmvem (2014).

Underground openings excavated at this site must be designed for worker safety in the seismic environment anticipated for the preclosure period. This includes accesses developed for site characterization regardless of the ultimate outcome of the repository siting process. Experience with both civil and mining structures has shown that underground openings are much more resistant to seismic effects than surface structures, and that even severe dynamic strains can usually be accommodated with proper design. This paper discusses the design and performance of lined openings in the seismic environment of {{the potential}} site. The types and ranges of possible ground motions (seismic loads) are briefly discussed. Relevant historical records of underground opening performance during seismic loading are reviewed.

Design features that will enhance liner stability and mitigate the impact of the potential seismic load are reviewed.

40|$|The piston-cylinder liner {{interface}} comprises {{more than}} half of the total engine rubbing friction. With current demand being for internal combustion engines with better fuel economy, lower exhaust emissions and higher performance, reducing this form of friction is the subject of much study. The research reported in this thesis is concerned with the development of an existing floating liner rig to measure the friction in this region. The performance features of the modified setup have also been assessed. Parametric studies have been undertaken with the modified setup to identify the potential means of friction reduction. Modifications undertaken in the sealing method and driveline assembly has facilitated friction measurement at higher gas loading of up to 80 barg. The modified sealing assembly with a sealing ring overcame the problem of arbitrary force interruption through irregular <b>liner</b> and <b>seal</b> contacts. Addition of five times higher inertia flywheel aided the motor to support the rig with adequate torque during high gas loading operations. Calibrations have been performed at each different build of piston-liner combination to reduce build to build variability in measurement. Experimental studies have been undertaken to assess the friction characteristics for different factors such as operating pressure, temperature and speed, lubricant oil formulation, piston-liner clearance, piston material etc. Tests have been undertaken at a range of operating conditions; peak pressure of 0 to 80 barg, speed of 1000 to 2000 rpm and average mid-liner temperature of 40 to 90 ˚C. Peak cylinder pressure has been observed to be dominating the friction followed by temperature and speed. Friction spikes were observed near the top dead centre for pressurised operations; where normal load on the rings are highest in a cycle. Higher speed generally results in a higher total frictional loss. However at higher temperature and peak pressure, contrasting effect of speed on total friction has been reported. The study further identified that piston motion play important roles in determining mixed/boundary friction along with the local gas pressure, velocity and oil film temperature. Friction reductions have been obtained by using a lower viscosity oil and higher piston-liner clearance. Maximum friction reduction of 18...|$|R
40|$|A {{cost-effective}} way {{of producing}} all-weather surfaces for cattle {{is to use}} a combined geotextile-gravel pad construction, which allows pavement depth to be reduced. This study sought to determine the pavement construction that would offer the least runoff, best drainage effect and highest quality runoff and drainage effluent after exposure to heavy precipitation under different manure loads in high animal density areas. The study also examined whether any pavement construction gave acceptable sealing to the underlying soil surface. Three different combinations of non-woven and woven geotextile together with two gravel fractions of 200 mm were exposed to 50 mm precipitation for 30 minutes and 15 kg of cattle manure under two manure regimes (manure removal and manure accumulation). Runoff, drainage effluent and leachate were flow measured and sampled in buckets as they exited their respective pipes for both regimes. The pad surface layer reduced runoff flow rate and stabilised drain flow throughout the experiments, confirming pad stability. Manure removal reduced total N, total P, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solid (TS) concentrations in drainage effluent. One pad construction proved better at oxidising NO 2 -N and another at trapping TS. One pad construction met the <b>sealing</b> <b>liner</b> norm to the underlying soil. The drainage effluent produced was acceptable for wetland treatment.

40|$|PFA-linings for {{avoidance}} of dewpoint corrosion in heat-exchangers and ducts of waste-incineration power plants M. Lotz Quadrant EPP AG, Switzerland The combustion of wastes of diverging qualities {{leads to the}} formation of gases with a high content of sulphur, chlorine and fluorine compounds. When the dewpoint of these gases is underrun in heat exchangers, housings and ducts in order to re-cycle more heat out of the combustion gases, this leads to a heavy condensation of hydrochloric, hydrofluoric and sulphuric acid on the involved equipment and in consequence to one of the strongest types of corrosion known, called dewpoint corrosion. The latter even corrodes the most resistant steel grades and thus requires other technical solutions. A lining of the condensing heat-exchangers, their housings and the flue gas ducts with the fully-fluorinated thermoplastic PFA (tetrafluoroethylene-perfluoroalkylvinylether) renders possible a service of the heat exchangers under condensing conditions and consequently increases the total power production efficiency of the waste-incineration plant, even having a positive environmental effect due to a positive influence on the overall energy mix. Although the suitability of this technical principle had already been demonstrated in multiple successful examples in fossil- and waste-fired power plants, constructive and technical details can have an influence on the performance of the lined equipment, such as material properties, welding of the <b>liner,</b> installation and <b>sealing</b> against the unlined parts as well as constructive aspects of the heat exchanger pipes and tubes.

Favourable environmental conditions for microbiological reduction of perchlorate were sought by infiltrating an electron donor-enriched water solution using drip irrigation underlying an airtight <b>sealing</b> <b>liner.</b> A vadose zone monitoring system (VMS) was used for real-time tracking of the percolation process, the penetration depth of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and the variation in perchlorate concentration across the entire soil depth. The experimental conditions for each infiltration event were adjusted according to insight gained from data obtained by the VMS in previous stages. Continuous monitoring of the vadose zone indicated that in the top 13  m of the cross section, perchlorate concentration is dramatically reduced from thousands of milligrams per litre to near-detection limits with a concurrent increase in chloride concentration. Nevertheless, in the deeper parts of the vadose zone (<  17  m), perchlorate concentration increased, suggesting its mobilization down through the cross section. Breakthrough of DOC and bromide at different depths across the unsaturated zone showed limited migration capacity of biologically consumable carbon and energy sources due to their enhanced biodegradation in the upper soil layers. Nevertheless, the increased DOC concentration with concurrent reduction in perchlorate and increase in the chloride-to-perchlorate ratio in the top 13  m indicate partial degradation of perchlorate in this zone. There was no evidence of improved degradation conditions in the deeper parts where the initial concentrations of perchlorate were significantly higher...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{hazardous}} and radioactive materials packaging is to, enable these materials {{to be transported}} without posing {{a threat to the}} health or property of the general public. To achieve this aim, regulations have been written establishing general design requirements for such packagings. While no regulations have been written specifically for mixed waste packaging, regulations for the constituents of mixed wastes, i. e., hazardous and radioactive substances, have been codified. The design requirements for both hazardous and radioactive materials packaging specify packaging compatibility, i. e., that the materials of the packaging and any contents be chemically compatible with each other. Furthermore, Type A and Type B packaging design requirements stipulate that there be no significant chemical, galvanic, or other reaction between the materials and contents of the package. Based on these requirements, a Chemical Compatibility Testing Program was developed in the Transportation Systems Department at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL). The program, supported by the US Department of Energy`s (DOE) Transportation Management Division, EM- 261 provides the means to assure any regulatory body that the issue of packaging material compatibility towards hazardous and radioactive materials has been addressed.

The chemical stresses on plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS for this application are much less than in waste dump construction. Normally, it is only necessary to demonstrate long-term resistance to oils, fuels and salt solutions as, on account of the good opportunities for sanitation, the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER is only polluted for a short time by liquids dispersed {{in the event of an}} accident. When installing the sealing system in the embankment it must be demonstrated that the covering layer cannot slide off the sealing system. Diagrams for three limiting embankment geometries were produced with which proof of this can be produced with a known natural angle of incline of the covering material and limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system. Furthermore, it was shown how a reinforcing element can be used to increase the stability and how the necessary reinforcement tensile force is calculated. In order to determine the limiting surface natural angle of incline of the sealing system, shear tests were carried out in a shear device with dimensions 30 x 30 cm. The following structure was tested: covering layer/reinforcing element/geotextile support layer/plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER/geotextile protective layer. Tests were carried out with 3 soils, 2 reinforcing elements and plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINERS with various surface structures. In order to protect the plastic GEOMEMBRANE LINER against mechanical damage, mechanically bonded fabrics can be used. In laboratory and field tests, studies were carried out on what requirements these protective layers must meet depending on the loads which arise. (orig.)

40|$|An {{experimental}} programme {{is presented}} {{with the aim of}} characterising –from physical, microstructural and geotechnical perspectives– the main properties of compacted clay phyllites. These clay phyllites are widely used as waterproofing material for roofs in the Alpujarras (Andalusia, Spain), as <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> in irrigation ponds, and as core material of small earthen zoned dams. An exhaustive physical-characterisation programme on the powder fraction has been followed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chemical analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), thermal analysis, particle-size distribution analysis, consistency limits, and density of solid particles. From a microstructural standpoint, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests, as well as nitrogen-adsorption tests, were carried out to characterise the pore network and surface area of the material in both natural and compacted states. The geotechnical characterisation programme on the compacted material was focused on the water-permeability and water-retention properties, the volume change on soaking (swelling or collapse), the compressibility on loading, the shearstrength properties, and the mechanical-penetration properties. In this way, an important physical and hydro-mechanical data base is provided, which could help in evaluating the suitability for using this material {{in a wide range of}} earthen constructions (liners, road subgrades, embankments, core material in zoned dams). It has been found that the material contains illite, chlorite and quartz as the main components, and feldspar, iron oxide and interstratified illite–smectite as minor ones. Despite the presence of active clay minerals, the compacted material did not display an important swelling on soaking at low stresses, as a consequence of its low specific surface and low water-retention ability. The material exhibited good compaction properties and, consequently, low water permeability plus a stiff response on loading. Nevertheless, despite the low porosity attained on the dry-side compaction, the material underwent some collapse on soaking at stresses greater than 100 kPa.

40|$|The {{clogging}} of fine-porosity geotextiles by {{soil particles}} {{is considered to}} be a problem in applications of these fabrics to filtering of municipal and industrial effluents. However, the clogging phenomenon can be an advantage for certain purposes, such as the creation of near-watertight membranes for sealing manure holding tanks. The conceived advantages of non-woven needle-punctured geotextiles are that they are less expensive due to lower material quantity, they are more resistant to tensile stresses compared to impermeable plastics and concrete, and they are easily installed. This thesis describes experimental work on the permeability and clogging characteristics of a Non-woven Polyester Geotextile with three different porosities (13. 4, 19. 5 and 26. 0 mum) but the same hydraulic conductivity (Kw = 10 - 5 m/s), when subjected to different heads of cattle slurry at 1, 2 and 4 % total solids (TS) concentrations. The resulting infiltration rates were used to establish the effect of geotextile pore size and manure TS on geotextile sealing and to find the location of the seal, whether at the surface or within the geotextile. After 100 days of experimentation, the lowest infiltration rate of 1. 1 L/m 2 /d was reached with the 13. 4 mum geotextile. Manure TS had a significant effect on the sealing and at least 4 % TS was required to minimize the geotextile's infiltration rate. Clogging occurred within the pores, suggesting that the seal remains even after removing the manure. This advantage can be translated into economic benefit when fun cost comparisons with <b>sealing</b> <b>liners</b> such as geomembranes and concrete are undertaken. This research also reviews and analyzes the physical, chemical and biological processes leading to clogging of geotextiles as well as a cost-benefit comparison with the other sealing materials.

40|$|In principle, a {{reciprocating}} compressor stage {{consists of a}} cylinder, the working volume which varies periodically due to a piston moving inside a <b>liner.</b> Latter is <b>sealed</b> by two sets of valves. On the one hand the suction valve for admitting the gas to be compressed {{and on the other}} the discharge valve for allowing the high pressure gas to be delivered to the downstream process. The typical type of valves used within compressors for refrigeration plants are reed valves. The key feature of these mentioned valves - simultaneously affecting both their sealing performance as well as the reliability - is that they are not actuated. They are held close by elastic forces and they open and close automatically, in accordance to the balance of gas pressure forces as well as the previously mentioned elastic ones. The former is primarily characterized by the static pressure difference across the closed valve and the aerodynamic drag brought about by the gas flow impinging onto the sealing reed in a partially or fully open valve. Evidently, a high degree of coupling between the gas flow and the sealing element motion, today referred to as fluid-structure interaction (FSI), can be expected. The reed and the absence of a reliable guide that would provide for the plan-parallel motion give rise to non-parallel impacts with other parts of the valve assembly, leading to dynamic stress effects. This not only complicates the prediction of the reed valve dynamics, it also causes premature sealing element fracture, decreases the compressor efficiency and ultimately leads to unscheduled maintenance shutdowns. Consequently pursuing the optimization of the reed valve movement is a necessity. The measurements of reed valve dynamics as well as their movement in compressors can be performed by commercial proximity sensors, strain gauges or in house developed sensors. Although timing and lift information is available through these methods, other modes of fluttering such as torsional movement are more difficult to be observed. This work tries to address these aspects by providing real operation data obtained in a test rig. An in-depth comparative analysis of three measurement methodologies, represented by an optical, resistive as well as an eddy current sensor system will be carried out regarding their possible adoption in a state-of-the-art refrigeration compressor. Furthermore, the acquired data will be evaluated with respect to its potential application for collecting mentioned torsional movements.

40|$|Dental amalgam {{is still}} the {{material}} most commonly used to restore posterior teeth in many countries. Amalgam is very popular because of its strength, longevity, low cost, and relative ease of handling compared to other direct restorative materials. Two important disadvantages of amalgam restaurations are lack of adhesion to tooth structure and marginal leakage. Introduction of dentin adhesive systems enabled better marginal seal between amalgam and tooth structure. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate, in vitro conditions, the marginal seal of amalgam restaurations with dentin adhesive systems using the method of diffusion dye. Material and methods: In this study 50 extracted human teeth were used. Class II cavities were prepared on all the teeth. The teeth were divided in five groups and materials applied according to manufacturer’s instructions: Gamabond, Optibond Solo, OptiGuard, Ionosit - Base Liner and control group. All the teeth were thermocycled 200 times, at temperatures: 5 - 7 ºC, 37 ºC and 57 - 59 ºC. Method of diffusion dye was used to estimate the quality of marginal seal of amalgam restaurations. All teeth were immersed into 50 % solution of silver nitrate, and then into 10 % developing solution. All teeth were cut with a diamond disc in the meso - distal plane. Penetration dye was estimated using binocular magnifying glass that magnifies 25 times, with inserted micrometar scale. Results were statistically analysed with Student t - test. Results: The least penetration dye was recorded in the group of amalgam restaurations rebonded with OptiGuard. Higher penetration dye was noted in the groups of adhesive amalgam restaurations, where Gamabond showed lower penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo. Penetration dye in the group Ionosit - Base Liner was higher than in the groups where dentin adhesive systems were used: on the occlusal wall, penetration dye in comparison with Gamabond showed statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 5) while penetration dye in comparison with Optibond Solo showed no statistically significant difference. On the gingival wall, penetration dye in comparison with dentin adhesive systems - Gamabond and Optibond Solo, showed a statistically significant difference, (p < 0, 01). The highest penetration dye was in the control group. Conclusion: The best marginal seal of amalgam restaurations was achieved with OptiGuard. Use of dentin adhesive systems also provided good marginal seal, with better results from Gamabond compared to Optibond Solo. Using Ionosit - Base <b>Liner</b> good marginal <b>seal</b> on the occlusal wall was also accomplished, while penetration dye on the gingival wall showed a statistically significant difference in comparison with adhesive and rebonding amalgam restaurations...|$|R
