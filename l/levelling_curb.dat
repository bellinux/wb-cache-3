40|$|Inefficiency and {{low quality}} of health {{services}} are common in many developing countries. To mitigate these problems, we conducted an experiment in rural China in which we changed the existing fee-forservice method of paying village doctors to a mixed payment method that included a salary plus a bonus based on performance. The new payment method also removed a feature that previously allowed doctors to purchase medications to prescribe to patients and earn a markup on each prescription. Changing these payment incentives reduced spending at the village <b>level,</b> <b>curbed</b> unnecessary care for healthier patients, and also decreased the prescribing of unnecessary drugs. However, other features of the arrangement encouraged doctors to refer sicker patients to township and county facilities, where costs were higher. As a result, total health care spending was not significantly reduced. The findings underscore that policy makers should design payment methods carefully to both contain costs and improve quality. © 2011 Project HOPE-The People-to-People Health Foundation, Inc...|$|R

However, it also lowers the expected gains from corruption as, following decentralization, {{the number of individuals}} who are in charge of a single decision is reduced.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current medical {{scores have}} limited {{efficiency}} and safety profiles to enable assignment {{to the most}} appropriate treatment site in patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). We describe our current triage practice and assess the potential {{of a combination of}} CURB 65 with proadrenomedullin (ProADM) levels for triage decisions. METHODS: Consecutive patients with LRTIs presenting to our emergency department were prospectively followed and retrospectively classified according to CURB 65 and ProADM <b>levels</b> (<b>CURB</b> 65 -A). Low medical risk patients were further subgrouped according to biopsychosocial and functional risks. We compared the proportion of patients virtually allocated to triage sites with actual triage decisions and assessed the added impact of ProADM in a subgroup. RESULTS: Overall, 93 % of 146 patients were hospitalised. Among the 138 patients with available CURB 65 -A, 17. 4 % had a low medical risk indicating possible treatment in an outpatient or non-acute medical setting; 34. 1 % had an intermediate medical risk (short-hospitalisation); and 48. 6 % had a high medical risk (hospitalisation). Fewer patients were in a low CURB 65 -A class (I) than a low CURB 65 class (0, 1) (17. 4 % vs. 46. 3 %, p > 0. 001). Mean length of hospitalisation was 9. 8 days including 3. 6 days after reaching medical stability. In 60. 3 % of patients, hospitalisation was prolonged after medical stability mainly for medical reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Current rates of hospitalisation are high in patients with LRTI and length of stay frequently extended beyond time of medical stabilization. The lower proportion of patients reclassified as low risk by adding ProADM to the CURB 65 score might improve confidence in the triage algorithm...|$|R
