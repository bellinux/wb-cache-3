25|$|The first {{large scale}} {{liquefaction}} {{of natural gas}} in the U.S. was in 1918 when the U.S. government liquefied natural gas {{as a way to}} extract helium, which is a small component of some natural gas. This helium was intended for use in British dirigibles for World War I. The <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas (LNG) was not stored, but regasified and immediately put into the gas mains.|$|E
25|$|The East Ohio Gas Company built a {{full-scale}} commercial <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas (LNG) plant in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940 just after a successful pilot plant built by its sister company, Hope Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. This {{was the first}} such plant in the world. Originally it had three spheres, approximately 63 feet in diameter containing LNG at −260°F. Each sphere held {{the equivalent of about}} 50 million cubic feet of natural gas. A fourth tank, a cylinder, was added in 1942. It had an equivalent capacity of 100 million cubic feet of gas. The plant operated successfully for three years. The stored gas was regasified and put into the mains when cold snaps hit and extra capacity was needed. This precluded the denial of gas to some customers during a cold snap.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} the crisis on Wesfarmers' {{subsidiaries}} caused a slump in the company's share prices. Wesfarmers managing director, Richard Goyder, said, [...] "At this stage, our best estimate is that the pre-tax impact on group profit {{will be up to}} $20 million per month at the current level of gas supply. A portion of that loss is expected to be recovered from insurance". The subsidiaries affected are CSBP, which can no longer produce ammonium nitrate, Wesfarmers LPG, which has delayed commissioning of a new <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas plant in WA, and Premier Coal, whose sales have been reduced due to the closure of some of its customers, such as Iluka Resources.|$|E

2500|$|There are two {{processes}} for liquefying natural gas in large quantities. The {{first is the}} cascade process, in which the natural gas is cooled by another gas {{which in turn has}} been cooled by still another gas, hence named the [...] "cascade" [...] process. There are usually two cascade cycles prior to the <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas cycle. The other method is the Linde process, with a variation of the Linde process, called the Claude process, being sometimes used. In this process, the gas is cooled regeneratively by continually passing it through an orifice until it is cooled to temperatures at which it liquefies. The cooling of gas by expanding it through an orifice was developed by James Joule and William Thomson and is known as the Joule–Thomson effect. Lee Twomey used the cascade process for his patents.|$|E
2500|$|Ruled a {{national}} energy security issue by the government, the pipeline's significance {{lies in the}} UK's move from being a net exporter to a net importer of energy as the North Sea oil and gas fields are used up. National Grid stated that, [...] "The {{reality is that the}} offshore fields are decreasing in output and demand for gas from homes and businesses is growing at such a rate, that analysis shows that the UK will become increasingly dependent upon imported gas over the coming years." [...] This depletion was predicted by Hubbert peak theory. As a result, the energy policy of the United Kingdom is likely to become an increasingly important issue and importation of <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas from the Middle East will help diversify UK energy supplies otherwise dependent on a few suppliers such as Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Kaine endorses making coal energy {{production}} cleaner, {{saying that it}} is imperative [...] "to convert coal to electricity with less pollution than we do today." [...] He has criticized those who [...] "frame the debate as a conflict between an economy and the environment," [...] saying that [...] "protecting the environment is good for the economy." [...] Kaine co-sponsored the Advanced Clean Coal Technology Investment in Our Nation (ACCTION) Act, legislation to increase investment in clean coal technologies. He voted against passage of legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Kaine supports the use of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) to harvest natural gas from shale formations. He believes this will reduce carbon pollution. Kaine voted against an amendment, introduced by Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, that would have repealed a provision in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that exempts hydraulic fracturing from the underground injection control provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act. As a result, regulation of hydraulic fracturing remains in the hands of state agencies; the U.S. EPA cannot regulate hydraulic fracturing nor require a federal permit. Kaine supports exporting <b>liquid</b> <b>natural</b> gas (LNG) to other countries.|$|E

50|$|Oil {{pipelines}} {{are made}} from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurised into <b>liquids</b> known as <b>Natural</b> Gas <b>Liquids</b> (NGLs). <b>Natural</b> gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel. Highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines, but accidents have been rare.

District heating or teleheating systems use a network of insulated pipes which transport heated water, pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer.|$|R
