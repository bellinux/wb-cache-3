Instead, the cause was found to be a series of changes to speed, power and flap angle settings which were not in accordance with the airline's operating procedures and which took place in the last [...] of the approach. At 0128, the aircraft picked up the ILS <b>localiser</b> <b>beam,</b> and the flaps were lowered in three stages as the aircraft's speed reduced. Soon afterwards, as it approached the ILS glideslope beam, its height and speed were reduced further and the undercarriage was extended. Then the Captain saw a light which he mistook for one {{at the far end of}} the runway—it was actually on a hill beyond the airport—and the [...] "stabiliser out of trim" [...] warning light came on. This had been faulty earlier in the flight, and the Captain disengaged the autopilot and the automatic glideslope tracker. At 0133, the flap angle was increased; the aircraft then began to fall below the approach slope and was travelling faster than the crew thought. Only when it reached a height of [...] was an attempt made to gain height, but this happened too late.|$|E
