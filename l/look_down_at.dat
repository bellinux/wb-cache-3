5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by a bee {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole. Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to the sting, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The boys <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> his body, then walk off silently.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many boxers, Norton {{would often}} {{not attempt to}} stare down an {{opponent}} while announcements were made before the match started. Instead, he'd often <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the floor and gather his thoughts. He was also widely noted for his fine athletic build.|$|E
25|$|The {{head-up display}} projects, through a combiner, all {{essential}} flight information {{gathered by the}} integrated avionics system. This display, visible in any light condition, provides the pilot information necessary to track and destroy an enemy aircraft without having to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> cockpit instruments.|$|E

Coniston believes, and always will believe, that the social bars are strong enough. So Cynthia <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the reins.|$|R

25|$|The yaw string, {{also known}} as a slip string, is a simple device for {{indicating}} a slip or skid in an aircraft in flight. It performs the same function as the slip-skid indicator ball, but is more sensitive, and does not require the pilot to <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the instrument panel. Technically, it measures sideslip angle, not yaw angle, but this indicates how the aircraft must be yawed to return the sideslip angle to zero.|$|E
500|$|The {{countdown}} on the Auriga {{continues as}} the survivors escape in the Betty. The Auriga collides with Earth, causing a large explosion. As they <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Earth, Call asks what Ripley 8 {{wants to do}} next. [...] "I'm a stranger here myself," [...] she replies. In an alternate ending that appears in some versions, the Betty lands in a ruined Paris.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the digital effects, the series also features stuntwork. Lou Bollo took over as stunt coordinator after the pilot episode, and big scenes often involved the actors, though stunt doubles were used for certain moments. For the final lake scene in [...] "Dead in the Water", in which Dean must save a boy after he is pulled underwater by a vengeful spirit, Jensen Ackles had {{to hold onto the}} young actor as they were pulled down ten feet into the water by divers. The actor portraying the vengeful spirit had to wear a wetsuit under his costume due to the extended period of time he was required to spend in the lake. Ackles and Jared Padalecki performed most of the fight scene featured in [...] "Skin", and only took four hours to learn the fight choreography. However, stunt doubles were brought in for the scenes in which they are thrown into bookshelves and through a coffee table. For the episode [...] "Shadow", rather than filming at the exterior location for the scene of Meg Masters being thrown out of a window to the street below, it was decided to not depict the impact, instead having the Winchesters <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her body after the landing. Thus, filming of it was allowed to take place in the studio using a body double.|$|E

500|$|... "Clown"'s concept {{deals with}} an {{incident}} that happened in San Diego, California. A skinhead that told Davis to [...] "go back to Bakersfield" [...] attempted to hit Davis but he dodged and the band's road manager, Jeff, knocked the skinhead out. [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] was about Davis' drug abuse, and the fear that gripped him {{at the height of}} his drug problem. He pleaded for a divine intervention to deliver him from his nightmare, as if he cannot help himself. Davis explained: [...] "I'd wake up in the morning and do a line to get out of bed. Speed in the morning, I'd have it all lined up for breakfast so when I'd lay down and go to sleep, I'd wake up and just snort and it's like 'Yeah, okay, I'm up. ' It was bad. It's like, you do one line and stay up all night, but then you have shit to do the next day so you have to do another line to be able keep staying up to get that shit done. Eventually you start spinning-out from sleep deprivation. You get hallucinations and shit like that." [...] Davis said that [...] "Helmet in the Bush" [...] "is about meth. It's about when you do meth and you <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> your dick and it's literally a helmet in the bush [...] ". [...] "Basically it's what happens when you do too much drugs and your girl wanna get with you and you got some man problems down below. Just another reason not to do drugs, children," [...] Fieldy elaborated.|$|E
500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette out of her mouth and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{models for}} the {{paintings}} were local farmhands, some of whom worked on the Cézanne family estate, the Jas de Bouffan. Each scene is depicted as one of quiet, still concentration; the men <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their cards rather than at each other, with the cards being perhaps their sole means of communication outside of work. One critic described the scenes as [...] "human still life", while another speculated that the men's intense focus on their game mirrors that of the painter's absorption in his art.|$|E

2500|$|On May 21, 2014, Smith {{appeared}} {{along with}} other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted {{under the guidance of}} the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't give a shit about science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids <b>look</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
