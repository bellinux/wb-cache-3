50|$|<b>Lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate</b> is the acetate ester of lavandulol. It is a {{component}} of lavender oil.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{composition}} of lavender essential oil varies from species to species but consists primarily of monoterpeneoids and sesquiterpeneoids. Of these linalool and linalyl acetate dominate, with moderate levels of <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> terpinen-4-ol and lavandulol. 1,8-cineole and camphor are {{also present in}} low to moderate qualities. In all lavender oil typically contains many more than 100 compounds, although {{a great many of}} these are present at very low concentrations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{essential}} oil {{content in the}} inflorescence of lavender (Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) cultivated in the mid hills of Uttarakhand {{was found to be}} 2. 8 % based on the fresh weight.

40|$|Zingiber rubens Roxb., and Zingiber zerumbet (L.) Smith were {{collected}} respectively from Nghe An, Province and Ha Tinh, Province,Vietnam. The root essential oils {{were obtained by}} water distillation and analyzed by Gas chromatography (GC) and Gas chromatography coupled with Mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The most abundant components of Z. rubens were (Z) -citral (30. 1 %), camphene (9. 7 %), β -phellandrene (7. 5 %) and 1, 8 -cineole (7. 0 %) and zingiberene (5. 3 %).

40|$|Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) {{are a key}} threat for {{millions}} of people and animals worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating pathogens and parasites, including malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, filiariasis and Zika virus. Mosquito young instars are usually targeted using organophosphates, insect growth regulators and microbial agents. Indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets are also employed. However, these chemicals have negative effects on {{human health and the environment}} and induce resistance in a number of vectors. In this scenario, newer and safer tools have been recently implemented to enhance mosquito control. The concrete potential of screening plant species as sources of metabolites for entomological and parasitological purposes is worthy of attention, as recently elucidated by the Y. Tu's example. Here we investigated the toxicity of Heracleum sprengelianum (Apiaceae) leaf essential oil and its major compounds toward third instar larvae of the malaria vector Anopheles subpictus, the arbovirus vector Aedes albopictus and the Japanese encephalitis vector Culex tritaeniorhynchus. GC–MS analysis showed that EO major components were <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (17. 8 %) and bicyclogermacrene (12. 9 %). The EO was toxic to A. subpictus, A. albopictus, and C. tritaeniorhynchus, with LC 50 of 33. 4, 37. 5 and 40. 9 µg/ml, respectively. <b>Lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate</b> was more toxic to mosquito larvae if compared to bicyclogermacrene. Their LC 50 were 4. 17 and 10. 3 µg/ml for A. subpictus, 4. 60 and 11. 1 µg/ml for A. albopictus, 5. 11 and 12. 5 µg/ml for C. tritaeniorhynchus. Notably, the EO and its major compounds were safer to three non-target mosquito predators, Anisops bouvieri, Diplonychus indicus and Gambusia affinis, with LC 50 ranging from 206 to 4219 µg/ml. Overall, this study highlights that H. sprengelianum EO is a promising source of eco-friendly larvicides against three important mosquito vectors with moderate toxicity against non-target aquatic organisms...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{essential}} oil content was determined in lavender flowers and leaves by hydrodistillation. Physical and chemical {{characteristics of the}} isolated oils were determined. By using CO 2 in supercritical state the extraction of lavender flowers was performed with a selected solvent flow under isothermal and isobaric conditions. By the usage of gas chromatography in combination with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography with flame ionisation detector (GC/FID) the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained essential oil and supercritical extracts (SFE) was carried out. Also, the analysis of individual SFE extracts obtained during different extraction times was performed. It {{turned out that the}} main components of the analysed samples were linalool, linalool acetate, lavandulol, caryophyllene oxide, <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> terpinen- 4 -ol and others.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of Pastinaca sativa L. (Apiaceae) essential oil. The aerial parts of plants were collected at Kopaonik Mountain (Serbia) and the essential oil has been isolated by hydrodistillation from this plant material. Essential oil was dominated by (Z) -β-ocimene (10. 8 %), hexyl butanoate (10. 4 %), (E) -β-farnesene (6. 1 %) and <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (5. 2 %). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was investigated using a micro-well dilution assay against the most common human gastrointestinal pathogenic microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and yeast Candida albicans. The results showed that minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentrations of essential oil ranged from 0. 72 μg/ml (for the most sensitive B. cereus) to above 92. 5 mg/ml for S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes. This finding suggests that P. sativa may {{be considered as a}} natural source of antimicrobial agents...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{involving}} concurrent headspace solvent microextraction combined with continuous hydrodistillation (HD-HSME) for the extraction and pre-concentration {{of the essential}} oil of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. into a microdrop is developed. A microdrop of n-hexadecane containing n-heptadecane (as internal standard) extruded from the needle tip of a gas chromatographic syringe was inserted into the headspace above the plant sample. After extraction for an optimized time, the microdrop was retracted into the syringe and injected directly into a GC injection port. The effects {{of the type of}} extracting solvent, sample mass, microdrop volume and extraction time on HD-HSME efficiency were investigated and optimized. Using this method, thirty-six compounds were extracted and identified. Linalool (32. 8 %), linalyl acetate (17. 6 %), <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (15. 9 %), α-terpineol (6. 7 %) and geranyl acetate (5. 0 %) were found to be the major constituents. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first report on the use of continuous headspace solvent microextraction coupled with hydrodistillation for investigation of essential oil components...|$|E

40|$|International audienceChemometric {{treatments}} of near infrared (NIR) spectra were used firstly to understand data structure by {{principal component analysis}} (PCA), to discriminate, by partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression, French lavender and lavandin essential oils (EOs) samples (n = 160) and the seven varieties (Abrial, Fine, Grosso, Maillette, Matherone, Sumian and Super) and to quantify the main compounds such as linalyl acetate, linalool, eucalyptol and camphor by PLS regression models. The study was carried out over three crop years (2012 – 2014) to take seasonal variations into account. French lavender and lavandin EOs and their varieties were well classified (100 % for lavender/lavandin EOs and between 96 and 100 % for varieties) by PLS-DA regression models. The calibration models obtained by PLS regression for {{the determination of the}} main compound contents revealed good correlation (≥ 0. 97) between the predicted and reference values. In the case of major compounds including linalyl acetate and linalool, the relative error of prediction (REP) is close to 2. 5 %. Partial least squares regression vectors allowed us to identify <b>lavandulyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> eucalyptol, linalool, camphor, trans-ocimene,-caryophyllene and linalyl acetate as metabolomic indicators of Fine, Maillette, Matherone, Abrial, Grosso, Super and Sumian varieties respectively.
