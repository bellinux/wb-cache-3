5|$|On July 29, 2014, C-SPAN {{announced}} that it would begin restricting access to the <b>live</b> <b>feeds</b> of the main channel, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 to subscribers of cable or satellite providers later that summer, citing concerns with the slow shift in viewing habits from cable television to the internet due to its reliance on carriage fees from cable and satellite providers. However, it will continue to allow all government meetings, hearings and conferences to be streamed live online and via archived on the C-SPAN Video Library without requiring an authenticated login by a provider. The decision drew some criticism from public interest and government transparency advocates, citing the fact that C-SPAN was designed as a public service.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of the series is the <b>live</b> <b>feeds,</b> in which viewers can view inside the house at any time. The <b>live</b> <b>feeds</b> {{have been a part}} of the series since its inception, {{initially}} being offered as a free service during the first season. From the second season onward, a subscription to the <b>live</b> <b>feeds</b> has been required, with the price ranging each year.

From the second season to the fourteenth season, the feeds were available through RealNetworks either as a subscription or as a free addition for Gold members. With the fifteenth season onward, the <b>live</b> <b>feeds</b> have aired on the official CBS website, again requiring a subscription from users. Though advertised as being available at any time, the feeds are shut off during the weekly nomination ceremony, Power of Veto ceremony, and the competitions and evictions for that week; this is to provide suspense for the series. Slanderous statements and singing of copyrighted music are also blocked for legal reasons.|$|E

40|$|For the {{successful}} culture operations of fin fishes and shellfishes, feeding the larval, juvenile and adult stages with appropriate, nutritionally balanced, non-polluting, economically viable and readily acceptable feed {{to obtain the}} optimum growth and survival, is considered {{as one of the}} major requirements in aquaculture practices the world over. <b>Live</b> <b>feed</b> organisms {{play an important role in}} the dietary regime of cultivable fishes and shellfishes, particularly in the larval stages, as one or the other <b>live</b> <b>feed</b> organisms form the principal food of the larvae in nature.
