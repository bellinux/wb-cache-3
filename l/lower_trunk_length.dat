40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the similarities and differences}} with regard to body build traits between two groups of short-statured children: the first one including children with growth retardation related to the growth hormone deficiency and the second one comprising of children with normal secretion of the growth hormone. Subsequently the traits useful in the differential diagnostics of growth retardation were selected. Anthropometric measurements were taken from 273 short-statured non-treated children aged from 3 to 17 years (73 girls and 200 boys). The children were divided into 6 clinical groups {{on the basis of the}} clinical picture and the results of stimulation tests assessing the pituitary reserve for growth hormone secretion. The clinical groups were differentiated using a specifically developed anthropometric test based on 9 calendar age traits (height, weight, BMI, length of upper and <b>lower</b> limbs, <b>trunk</b> <b>length,</b> shoulders breadth, hips breadth and chest breadth) and 4 developmental age traits (length and circumference of the head, chest circumference, thigh circumference) and the calculated value of arm fat content and the average stature of the parents...|$|R

These dimorphisms have generally been interpreted as follows: (1) large heads in males evolve through male-male rivalry (sexual selection); and (2) larger interlimb lengths in females provide space for more eggs (fecundity selection). In an Australian lizard (the snow skink, Niveoscincus microlepidotus), we found no evidence for ongoing selection on head size. <b>Trunk</b> <b>length,</b> however, was under positive fecundity selection in females and under negative sexual selection in males.

40|$|Background/Objective:To {{investigate}} socioeconomic, gestational {{and early}} life exposures as potential determinants of total height, leg and <b>trunk</b> <b>length.</b> Subjects/Methods:Male subjects from the 1982 Pelotas Birth Cohort Study {{were examined in}} 1986 at home, and in 2000 when registering at the local army base. The follow-up rate was 79 %. Standing and sitting heights were measured on both occasions. Leg length was calculated as the difference between standing and sitting heights. Outcome measures were height, leg and <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> at 4 and 18 years and growth in this period. Complete data were obtained for 2012 participants, representing 71 % of all eligible male subjects. Results:Mean (s. d.) height, <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> and leg length at 18 years were 173. 4 (6. 8), 96. 0 (3. 5) and 77. 5 cm (4. 5), respectively. The mean (s. d.) change in height from 1986 to 2000 was 75. 4 cm (5. 2) and for leg and <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> 35. 4 (3. 9) and 40. 0 cm (2. 9), respectively. Of 11 independent variables analyzed, only maternal height and birthweight were associated with all three variables of growth. Gestational age showed no associations with growth or attained size. Conclusions: Early growth plays {{a pivotal role in}} determining attained height and its components. Both biological and socioeconomic variables strongly influence determinants of height, though socioeconomic factors appear to be more important in early growth. Leg and <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> contribute almost equally to differences in overall height, regardless of the independent variable influencing the difference.

40|$|Short stature {{or short}} legs is {{associated}} with cardiometabolic disease. Few studies have addressed this issue in children, incorporated repeated measures, or studied modern cohorts. We examined if change in total height, leg <b>length</b> and <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> between two time points from early (median: 3. 2 years) to mid-childhood (median: 7. 7 years), with and without adjustment for concurrent change in adiposity (subscapular plus triceps skinfold thickness), was associated with mid-childhood cardiometabolic risk in 315 boys and 295 girls from Project Viva. The main outcome was a cardiometabolic risk score based on sex-specific internal z-scores for systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Mean (SD) total height was 97. 9 (4. 5) cm in boys and 97. 1 (4. 7) cm in girls in early childhood and 129. 1 (7. 2) cm in boys and 128. 3 (7. 9) cm in girls in mid-childhood. <b>Trunk</b> <b>length</b> constituted about half of total height. In linear regression models adjusted for parental anthropometry and socio-demographics, faster growth in total height, leg <b>length</b> and particularly <b>trunk</b> <b>length,</b> were associated with higher cardiometabolic risk in mid-childhood. Per 1 cm annual increase in <b>trunk</b> <b>length,</b> the cardiometabolic risk score was 0. 23 z-score (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 08, 0. 39) higher among boys and 0. 47 z-score (95 % CI 0. 33, 0. 60) higher among girls.

FoF and {{increased}} walking speed are associated with <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> oscillation during gait in older adults. We hypothesized that older adults with FoF would struggle to walk safely when instructed to walk faster than usual. MethodsParticipants included 260 community-dwelling older adults aged over 65 years (mean age[*]=[*] 71. 9 [*]Â±[*] 3. 9 years) {{who were able to}} walk independently without an assistive device. Participants were instructed to walk along a 15 -m smooth horizontal walkway at self-selected normal and fast gait speeds. During the middle 10 m of the walk, oscillation of the <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> and stride times were measured with two accelerometers. We examined associations between gait variables, including harmonic ratio (HR) in vertical, mediolateral (HR-ML) and anteroposterior (HR-AP) directions as indicators of smoothness of <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> oscillation, as well as stride time variability (STV) and FoF. ResultsGait-speed- and STV- adjusted models showed that FoF was significantly associated with HR-ML in the normal-gait condition (HR-ML: Î²[*]=[*]-. 135, p[*]=[*]. 040), while FoF was significantly associated with HR-AP in the fast-gait condition (HR-AP: Î²[*]=[*]-. 154, p[*]=[*]. 017). ConclusionsFoF-related changes in gait vary with gait speed. In older adults with FoF, <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> oscillation was less smooth in the lateral direction when they walked at their usual pace. In addition, <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> oscillation was also less smooth in the direction of travel when they walked at a faster pace than their usual walking speed...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUNDâAdult height {{has been}} {{inversely}} associated with {{coronary heart disease}} risk in several studies. The mechanism for this association is not well understood, however, and this was investigated by examining components of stature, cardiovascular disease risk factors and subsequent coronary heart disease in a prospective study. â¨METHODSâAll men aged 45 - 59 years living {{in the town of}} Caerphilly, South Wales were approached, and 2512 Â (89 %) responded and underwent a detailed examination, which included measurement of height and sitting height (from which an estimate of leg length was derived). Participants were followed up through repeat examinations and the cumulative incidence of coronary heart diseaseâboth fatal and non-fatalâover a 15 Â year follow up period is the end point in this report. â¨RESULTSâCross sectional associations between cardiovascular risk factors and components of stature (total height, leg <b>length</b> and <b>trunk</b> <b>length)</b> demonstrated that factors related to the insulin resistance syndromeâthe homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, fasting triglyceride levels and total to HDL cholesterol ratioâwere less favourable in men with shorter legs, while showing reverse or no associations with <b>trunk</b> <b>length.</b> Fibrinogen levels were inversely associated with leg length and showed a weaker association with <b>trunk</b> <b>length.</b> Forced expiratory volume in one second was unrelated to leg length but strongly positively associated to <b>trunk</b> <b>length.</b> Other risk factors showed little association with components of stature. The risk of coronary heart disease was inversely related to leg length but showed little association with <b>trunk</b> <b>length.</b> â¨CONCLUSIONâLeg length is the component of stature related to insulin resistance and coronary heart disease risk. As leg length is unrelated to lung function measures it is unlikely that these can explain the association in this cohort. Factors that influence leg length in adulthoodâincluding nutrition, other influences on growth in early life, genetic and epigenetic influencesâmerit further investigation in this regard. The reported associations suggest that pre-adult influences are important in the aetiology of coronary heart disease and insulin resistance. â¨â¨â¨Keywords: leg length; coronary heart diseas...|$|R

The second aim was to determine the level of association between crunch factor-related variables with swing (clubhead velocity) and launch (launch angle). Thirty-five high-level amateur male golfers (Mean Â± SD: age = 23. 8 Â± 2. 1 years, registered golfing handicap = 5 Â± 1. 9) without low back pain had kinematic data collected from their golf swing using a 10 -camera motion analysis system operating at 500 Hz.

40|$|If golfers achieve long hitting {{distances}} whilst {{maintaining their}} accuracy they will gain a competitive advantage. To increase hitting distance, faster clubhead speed is required {{and this can}} potentially be achieved {{through a number of}} factors. Firstly, anthropometric factors such as height and physical factors such as trunk rotational power have been previously considered to be of importance. However, biomechanical factors such as; the X-factor (separation of the trunk-pelvis alignment when viewed in the transverse plane), have been a major focus of recent research. Further, the interaction of the golfer with the implement they hit with i. e. the golf club has also been examined in biomechanical studies. The broad aim of this doctoral research was to investigate how male high-level amateur golfers generate club head speed and this was examined in a series of five studies that examined technical and equipment factors. The first study of this thesis (Study I) developed a valid three-dimensional Cardan / Euler model to examine the kinematics of the <b>trunk</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> during the golf swing. This validation study involved; developing and validating models and related algorithms as well as making comparisons to static and dynamic postures. It was concluded that a lateral bending / flexion-extension / axial rotation (ZYX) order of rotation was the most suitable to quantify the X-factor and <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> movement in the golf swing. Previous research has shown conflicting relationships between golf swing kinematics (such as variables related to the X-factor) and clubhead speed, as well as what physical variables assist in generating clubhead speed. The second study of this thesis (Study II) had two aims. The first aim was to determine whether significant between-club (driver and five-iron) differences existed for <b>trunk</b> and <b>lower</b> <b>trunk</b> kinematics as well as launch conditions.

Vertebrates exhibit a remarkably broad variation in <b>trunk</b> and tail <b>lengths.</b> However, the evolutionary and developmental origins of this diversity remain largely unknown.

Maintaining high Oct 4 levels in axial progenitors throughout development was sufficient to extend <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> in mouse embryos. Oct 4 also shifted posterior Hox gene-expression boundaries in the extended trunks, thus providing a link between activation of these genes and the transition to tail development. Furthermore, we show that the exceptionally long trunks of snakes are likely to result from heterochronic changes in Oct 4 activity during body axis extension, which may have derived from differential genomic rearrangements at the Oct 4 locus during vertebrate evolution.

40|$|Background Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that shorter leg <b>length,</b> not <b>trunk</b> <b>length,</b> may explain the inverse association between height and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, investigation of the importance of birth weight for these associations has been limited. This study examines associations of measures of stature and birth weight with CHD risk factors (measures of blood pressure and lipids, 2 h glucose, waistâhip ratio and fibrinogen) and incident non-fatal coronary events in middle age. Methods Data were derived mostly from the Phase 5 (1997 â 99) clinical screening of the Whitehall II study of British civil servants. The main cross-sectional analyses included 1084 women and 2290 men with complete data. Results In women total height and leg length were the measures that tended to be most strongly associated with CHD risk factors, while in men leg length demonstrated the closest associations. Although associations between <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> and CHD risk factors were weaker, <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> was the component of height that appeared to be most closely associated with coronary events. Associations between birth weight and CHD risk factors and coronary events were generally weaker than for any measure of stature. Adjustment for birth weight had little effect on associations between components of stature and CHD risk factors or events. Conclusion Findings from this relatively privileged cohort confirmed that shorter leg length underlies the inverse association between height and CHD risk factors in middle-aged women and men. Furthermore, in this study population shorter <b>trunk</b> <b>length</b> was more closely associated with incident, non-fatal coronary events...|$|R
