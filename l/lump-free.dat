40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the reason lumps occur in high-slump concrete and develop adequate batching procedures for a lumps-free high-slump ready-mix concrete mix used by the Florida Department of Transportation. Cement balls are round lumps of cement, sand, and coarse aggregate, typically {{about the size of a}} baseball that frequently occur in high-slump concrete. Such lumps or balls jeopardize the structural integrity of structural members. Experiments were conducted at the CSR Rinker concrete plant in Miami, Florida, based on a protocol developed by a team of Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) concrete engineers, Rinker personnel, and Florida International University faculty. A total of seventeen truckloads were investigated in two phases, between April 2001 and March 2002. The tests consisted of gathering data by varying load size, discharge rate, headwater content, and mixing revolutions. The major finding was that a usual load size and discharge rate, an initial headwater ratio of 30 %, and an initial number of revolutions of 100 at 12 revolutions per minute seem to produce a <b>lump-free</b> high-slump concrete. It was concluded that inadequate mixing and batching procedures caused cement lumps. Recommendations regarding specific load size, discharge rates, number of mixing revolutions, and initial water content are made. Clear guidelines for a high-slump concrete batching protocol can be developed, with further testing based on these research conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Armstrong’s {{two-dimensional}} paper chromatographic {{method for}} VMA estimation has been adapted to thin-layer chromatography. DAPTING Armstrong’s two-dimensional paper chromatographic nlethod for VMA estimation (1 - 3) to thin-layer chromatography of-fers {{the advantages of}} increased sensitivity, considerably shortened analytical time, and reduced space needs. This report presents details of the technic. Method Layer the plates (200 X 200 mm.) with an aqueous slurry of MN-cellulose powder, 300 0, made by stirring 15 gm. into 110 ml. of de-mineralized water until <b>lump-free</b> (about 5 mm. with an electric mixer). Apply the slurry with the applicator set at 0. 5 -mm. thickness. Keep the plates in a horizontal position for 15 mill., and then dry them for 10 mm. at 110 #{ 176 }. Before using the prepared plates draw two pencil lines on each as indicated in Fig. 1. Make the usual ethyl acetate extract of that volume of urine contain-ing 1 mg. of creatinine as reported elsewhere (2, 3). Dissolve the dry residue in 1 ml. of absolute ethanol, and apply 25,l. (equivalent to 0. 025 mg. creatinine) to one plate and 100 /Ll. (equivalent to 0. 1 mg. creatinine) to another (Spot A, Fig. 1). Prepare VMA standards in ethyl acetate representing 0. 02 g/l. and 0. 04 g. /JLl. Spot 5 of the weaker standard (B) and 5, 10, and 15 l. of the stronger standards (C, D, and E, respectively), as show...|$|E
