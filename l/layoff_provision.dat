40|$|We study non-contractible firms' {{investment}} in general training {{in a model}} of frictional unemployment. Since training is vested in workers, firms' return to training is zero when a match ends. Consensual <b>layoff</b> <b>provisions</b> or large severance payments oblige firms to bargain efficiently over the joint payoff from separation. This increases employers' incentives to train as they share workers' outside return to general human capital. The result generalizes to all types of general investment that are vested in the non-investing party on separation. We also show that, independently from under{{investment in}} training, the laissez-faire equilibrium is always inefficient for any given level of investment.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data also revealed that in 1970 – 1971, over 70 % of employee groups under major union agreements in the U.S. were covered by <b>layoff</b> <b>provisions</b> that specified seniority as the most important factor for consideration in permanent layoff decisions. Given this evidence, in the empirical analysis, the union status as a proxy for layoff costs, C is used.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} months of 1904, Coulby led the LCA in {{bargaining}} with the many small unions fighting for membership among ship and dock workers. His strategy was to negotiate incremental givebacks first, then snowball the effort into a major anti-union drive. He convinced the Marine Firemen, Oilers and Water Tenders' Union to accept a small wage cut, agree to the elimination of engineers on barges, and to permit captains to lay off workers if a ship was more than three days in port. Then the LCA forced the International Seamen's Union to agree to drop overtime pay and accept a similar <b>layoff</b> <b>provision.</b> The LCA then refused to bargain with the Marine Cooks and Stewards' Union. The union was unable to win a strike vote, and its members went back to work without a contract (accepting a sharp reduction in pay to just $70 a month). Just weeks before the shipping season began in April, Coulby fired all captains in the Pittsburgh Steamship Company fleet, and forced them to reapply for their jobs (blackballing those who had joined a union). The American Association of Masters and Pilots resisted, demanding a captain' right to join a union and a 13.6 percent wage increase (to $2,250 for a full nine months). Although many members of the LCA initially declined to support Coulby, he told them that U.S. Steel would not charter their ships if they backed down. The owners decided to support Coulby. The union went on strike, but the strike was broken on June 14, 1904, after many union members went back to work without a contract. The union never again attempted to organize ship captains. Coulby then forced his workers to sign yellow-dog contracts in 1905. When the Marine Firemen threatened to strike, Coulby won a pledge from the Lake Seamen's Union and the Marine Engineers' Beneficial Association to provide strikebreakers. The International Longshoremen's Association struck anyway on May 1, but when it received no backing from any other union the strike collapsed.|$|E

Katharine O. Strunk argues that the state’s policies force districts to retain lower-quality teachers and that the decision is a victory for students and parents in California’s public school system. She writes that if the ruling is upheld, and California’s state legislature is tasked with writing new laws on teacher’s conditions, then they should take lessons from cities such as New York and Washington D.

40|$|Excerpt] This chapter {{summarizes}} {{the provisions of}} federal and California law that are implicated by reductions in force (RIFs), plant closings, and plant relocations. Two statutes that come into play under such circumstances are the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) (29 USC §§ 2101 – 2109) and the California-specific mass <b>layoff</b> <b>provisions</b> of Lab C §§ 1400 – 1408. See §§ 18. 20 – 18. 44. If the employer’s workforce is organized, provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (29 USC §§ 141 – 187) are relevant. See §§ 18. 57 – 18. 74. If the workforce reduction or plant closing is necessitated by the employer’s failing financial health, bankruptcy issues must be considered. See §§ 18. 75 – 18. 84. Finally, a RIF often brings in its wake employee claims of discrimination, particularly age discrimination. Senior members of the workforce may be protected by the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act of 1990 (OWBPA) (Pub L 101 – 433, 104 Stat 978). See §§ 18. 3 – 18. 10. In preparing for and dealing with litigation following a RIF, plant closing, or plant relocation, the employer should give each of these subjects careful consideration...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "By {{the end of this}} fiscal year [...] in less than one month [...] the U. S. Postal Service (USPS) projects that it will incur a $ 9 billion loss; reach its $ 15 billion borrowing limit; not make its $ 5. 5 billion retiree health benefits payment; and thus, become insolvent. USPS recently summarized this situation as the equivalent of facing Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In August 2011, USPS outlined new proposals to address the crisis. USPS seeks legislation to remove itself from the federal health benefit program and sponsor its own program; change pension benefits for new employees; and eliminate the <b>layoff</b> <b>provisions</b> it negotiated with its unions in collective bargaining to accelerate its delivery, processing, and retail network and workforce downsizing. Other USPS proposals, such as moving to 5 -day delivery, and pending legislation include additional options for consideration. This statement discusses (1) updated information on USPS's financial crisis and (2) GAO's review and analysis of proposals to address this crisis, including USPS's new proposals, and options in current legislation. The testimony is based primarily on GAO's review of pending legislation, past and ongoing work related to postal issues, as well as USPS's recent financial results and GAO's discussions with senior postal officials regarding USPS's recent proposals. GAO has reported that action by Congress and USPS is urgently needed to restore USPS's financial viability. GAO provided a draft statement to USPS for comments and did not receive any suggested changes. ...|$|R
40|$|L'auteur, après avoir établi les fondements du droit au travail, en précise la notion. Il montre les tentatives d'insertion dans le droit positif. Une dernière partie est consacrée à répondre à la question : à qui appartient la responsabilité de fournir un emploi ?The {{right to}} work can be {{considered}} as something positive and also as something which is negative. In one of these instances, the {{right to work}} lies in the possibility of actually performing a certain work without being prevented illegitimately from doing so. It can then be compared with the right to live, to get married, the general right of property and the right to education. Other people are under the obligation of bringing no obstacle to the exercise of such a right. In the other case, the right to work is considered as the moral foundation to claiming a job. According to this right of any man, others would be under the obligation of actually providing him with some work. The big question then is to find out who would be under such an obligation. The first aspect of the right to work is pretty well cared for by Canadian legislation. Many statutes protect the workers against undue discrimination originating from union activity, race, religion or colour. It is, moreover, covered by the regulations of some professional bodies, by seniority and <b>layoff</b> <b>provisions</b> of most collective labour agreements. As far as the right to claim a job is concerned, western countries are not actually giving it a full practical recognition, even if some of them have embodied a declaration to that effect in their fundamental law. Some totalitarian states have in fact achieved this policy but by stressing the obligation to work and by forgetting about human liberties. Morally, it is the duty of free enterprises, of governments and of the society as a whole {{to make it possible for}} the right to work, considered as a positive claim to a job, to become effective...|$|R

25|$|Bieber's {{final round}} of {{collective}} bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approve the strike, but Yokich was the quarterback who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, but gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend {{the time it took}} for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or <b>layoff</b> income security <b>provisions.</b> However, Ford did agree to fully pay for health care costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use layoff pay during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying layoff pay to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants. The wage payment scheme was the same as the previous contract.|$|R
