A {{range of}} visual {{functions}} was assessed {{in a group}} of 27 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and {{in a group of}} matched normal controls. <b>Luminance</b> <b>threshold,</b> two-flash resolution, relative perceptual latency, luminance critical flicker frequency (CFF), and chromatic CFF were all measured foveally. Variabilities of these functions and correlations between their values were also evaluated. 2. Overall results for the MS group showed a statistically significant impairment relative to the control group. More detailed analysis was performed after division of the patient group according to history of visual involvement: subgroup A without previous optic neuropathy (ON) and subgroup B with previous ON. 3. Subgroup B showed significant impairment for <b>luminance</b> <b>threshold,</b> luminance CFF, chromatic CFF, and variability of luminance CFF. Subgroup A also had significant impairment for <b>luminance</b> <b>threshold,</b> luminance CFF, and chromatic CFF, although the effects were less pronounced than for subgroup B. 4.

40|$|Difficulty with {{selective}} {{attention is}} a frequent complaint of adult patients with ADHD, but selective attention tasks have not provided robust evidence of attentional dysfunction in this group. Two experiments examine this puzzle by distinguishing between failures of spatial selection and problems due to sensitivity to perceptual interference. In Experiment 1, we measured the level of perceptual interference generated by targets in crowded displays with nearby distractors by comparing <b>luminance</b> <b>thresholds</b> in both distractor-present (noise) and distractor-absent (clean) displays. ADHD and control participants had comparable thresholds for clean displays, but ADHD individuals had elevated thresholds to crowded displays. These effects could be explained in two distinct ways. Deficits may have arisen from amplified visual interference in the noise condition, or from abnormalities in top-down attentional processes that reduce visual interference. Experiment 2 adjusted for individual perceptual differences with clean and noise displays, before measuring visual interference resolution at attended versus unattended locations. ADHD and control groups had comparable interference resolution at attended locations. These results suggest that perceptual interference rather than spatial attention deficits may account for some deficits in ADHD. This putative deficit in sensory function highlights a potential early-stage perceptual processing deficit in ADHD distinct from selective attention. (JINS, 2012, 18, 1 – 10...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies show}} that dark {{adaptation}} in the visual system depends on local luminance levels surrounding the viewing direction.

The results show that a background with bright areas close to the viewing direction yields longer adaptation times than a background with bright areas at a larger visual angle. Therefore, we conclude that dark adaptation is affected to a great extent by local luminance, even when controlling for veiling luminance.

This study investigated the influence of blue/green as compared to red and white light of equal photopic intensity on subsequent visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and dark-adaptation. Male subjects (n = 90) were {{assigned to one of}} 15 treatment conditions (n = 6) as determined by the colour (blue/green, red or white) and intensity (0. 1; 0. 4; 1. 6; 6. 4 and 25. 6 cd/m²) of the pre-adaptation stimuli. A modified Goldmann/Weekers adaptometer was used to present the preadaptation stimuli, test stimuli and record visual (<b>luminance)</b> <b>thresholds</b> of each subject. Blue/green lighting had the same affect on visual (photopic) acuity and contrast sensitivity as white and red lighting. Blue/green affected visual (absolute) threshold at the start and during the process of dark-adaptation {{in the same manner as}} white but not the same as red lighting. White and red lighting did not differ significantly (p < 0. 01) at low intensities (mesopic range) but did at the higher intensities (photopic range). After exposure to blue/green and white light, it will take longer to reach the same level of dark-adaptation than after exposure to red. These time differences increase with" increased intensities. The brightness ratio between red and white lights to produce the same dark-adaptation increases with an increase in intensity. At the upper mesopic region the differences between the effects of white and red lighting on subsequent dark-adaptation become irregular due to the inability to accurately equate non-monochromatic lights in the mesopic range. ...|$|R
40|$|We measure {{threshold}} versus contrast (TvC) {{functions for}} chromatic (red-green) and luminance sine-wave-grating stimuli for (1) {{the detection of}} luminance {{in the presence of}} color contrast and (2) the detection of color in the presence of luminance contrast. We find that, although these crossed TvC functions both display a dipperlike shape, their facilitation differs from that found for standard uncrossed dipper functions (luminance on luminance or color on color contrast). Their facilitation disappears (cross condition 1) or is reduced (cross condition 2) by randomized presentation of the phase of the test and the mask, and the remaining facilitation (cross condition 2) displays no spatial tuning. We argue that these crossed facilitatory interactions cannot be explained by detection mechanisms with common inputs from color and luminance contrast (a nonindepen-dence of transduction), and we present evidence that instead they reflect the use of local cues in the stimuli. We also measure the luminance-luminance TvC function {{in the presence of a}} fixed suprathreshold color contrast. The results demonstrate that, even when the color contrast produces a masking of the <b>luminance</b> <b>thresholds,</b> luminance-luminance facilitation still occurs. Thus the opposing effects of masking and facilita-tion can occur simultaneously. Furthermore, while luminance-luminance facilitation occurs independently of color contrast, masking can be produced by either contrast. This suggests that masking and facilitation have different underlying origins. Similar results are found for the color detection thresholds in the pres-ence of a luminance pedestal. We conclude that there are separate pathways for the detection of color and luminance contrast, each with no input from the other contrast. We suggest that the cross masking reflects divisive interactions between these pathways that is restricted to high contrasts. Key words: color vision, isoluminance, spatial masking. 1...|$|R

The eyes with a bifocal intraocular lens displayed a much greater depth of focus, though {{at the expense of}} diminished contrast sensitivity compared with the normal values expected for that age. Simulation experiments suggested that the observed reduction in contrast sensitivity was not adequately explained by a simple reduction in retinal illumination of the in-focus image as might intuitively be expected from the bifocal separation of incident light to two simultaneous focal points.

No evidence for an early magnocellular deficit could be detected as the thresholds of all schizophrenic observers were higher both in the steady paradigm (presumed magnocellular mediation) and in the pulse paradigm (presumed parvocellular mediation).

While the amplitude of ongoing oscillatory activity {{is known to}} correlate with various aspects of perception, the influence of oscillatory phase on perception remains unknown. In particular, since phase varies on a much faster timescale than the more sluggish amplitude fluctuations, phase effects could reveal the fine-grained neural mechanisms underlying perception.

Although the stimulus on each trial was identical, subjects detected {{approximately half of the}} flashes (hits) and entirely missed the other half (misses).

This effect was strongest in the theta and alpha frequency bands. In this time-frequency range, oscillatory phase accounted for at least 16 % of variability in detection performance and allowed the prediction of performance on the single-trial level. This finding indicates that the visual detection threshold fluctuates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG activity. The results support the notion that ongoing oscillations shape our perception, possibly by providing a temporal reference frame for neural codes that rely on precise spike timing...|$|E
