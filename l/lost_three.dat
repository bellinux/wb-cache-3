5|$|Amazon <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> in {{the battle}} and six in her wreck, with 15 wounded, while Indefatigable did not lose a single man killed, {{suffering}} only 18wounded. The discrepancy in losses during the action is likely due to the extreme difficulty the French crew had in aiming their guns given their ship's instability in heavy seas.|$|E
5|$|He {{still found}} time for two matches in 1846, comfortably beating the {{professionals}} Bernhard Horwitz (fourteen wins, three draws, and seven losses) and Daniel Harrwitz. The match against Harrwitz {{was set up}} in a very unusual way: seven games in which Staunton gave Harrwitz odds of pawn and two moves (Staunton won four and <b>lost</b> <b>three),</b> seven games where he gave pawn and move (Staunton lost six and won one), and seven at no odds (Staunton won all seven).|$|E

5|$|In March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) {{proposed}} to close 20 of the 174state-owned mines and cut 20,000jobs out of 187,000. Two-thirds of the country's miners, {{led by the}} National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) under Arthur Scargill, downed tools in protest. However, Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on the strike, having previously <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> ballots on a national strike (in January and October 1982, and March 1983). This led to the strike being declared illegal.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1926, {{thousands}} of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians {{would win the}} pennant even when they trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians were only two games behind New York, but then <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the defeat, Gibson was fired, and the Giants <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> out of their last four games to finish out of the playoffs for the 15th straight season, leading them to let coach John McVay go as well.

5|$|On October 19, 1959, a Boeing 707-227 {{crashed on}} the banks of the Stillaguamish River's North Fork during a test flight, killing four of eight occupants.

The plane made an emergency landing in the riverbed while unsuccessfully trying to reach a nearby open field.|$|E
5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, {{but it was}} an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed out before the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E

5|$|The Bf 109s of JG 27 lost six fighters. Two {{pilots were}} saved. Another source gives eight Bf 109s destroyed. JG 27 claimed 14 victories, {{but it is}} likely this was an exaggeration. Only seven were allowed to stand by the Luftwaffe. RAF {{casualties}} in the air battles amounted to five fighters destroyed and four damaged. No. 43 Squadron suffered one damaged Hurricane; 152 Squadron two damaged Spitfires; No. 601 Squadron lost two Hurricanes; No. 602 Squadron <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> Spitfires and one damaged.|$|E
5|$|The British {{suffered}} casualties as well. No. 17 Squadron {{lost one}} Hurricane and one pilot killed.

No. 111 Squadron lost one Hurricane destroyed {{on the ground and}} one damaged on the ground and three shot down in aerial combat, but all pilots survived. No. 501 Squadron suffered heavy losses amounting to five Hurricanes destroyed, two pilots killed, one seriously wounded. No. 601 lost two Hurricanes and both pilots killed while No. 602 Squadron <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> Spitfires and one damaged with one pilot wounded. No. 615 Squadron also took crippling casualties. It <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> Hurricanes with one pilot killed and another wounded. However, a further six of their Hurricanes were destroyed in the Kenley raid by 9 Staffel./KG 76. The casualties of 615 have been challenged by another source which indicates 615 Squadron lost only three on the ground at Kenley (P3158, P3487, R4186).|$|E
5|$|This was Arsenal's first {{appearance}} in the Charity Shield in 10 years; prior to the game they had won seven Shields (1930, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1938, 1948 and 1953), and <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> (1935, 1936 and 1979). By contrast, Liverpool had won seven previous Shields outright (1966, 1974, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1982 and 1988), shared two with Manchester United (1965 and 1977) and one apiece with Everton (1986) and West Ham United (1984).

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Australia, Bradman retired and Barnes {{took a break}} from cricket, thereby opening two vacancies in the Test team. Brown had a reasonable domestic season in 1948–1949 to press his claim for a Test recall. He scored 626 runs at 41.73, the sixth highest aggregate of the season, with a century and three fifties. Queensland won two and <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> games. Despite this, the 37-year-old Brown was not named in the touring party for the Test tour of South Africa in 1949–50. In {{the absence of the}} Test players, Brown scored 507 runs at 50.70 in the Sheffield Shield season, with a top score of 190, making him the third highest run-getter. In their first five matches of the season, Queensland <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> times, before Brown's 190 in the last match against South Australia set up a nine-wicket win. It was his only century of the season after previously falling for 94 twices.|$|E
5|$|As of 30 June 1854, {{the crew}} of Albany {{consisted}} of 18 officers, 156 seaman, and 23 Marines.

5|$|As {{part of a}} large {{attack on}} the Thanh Hóa Bridge on 3 April, the VPAF first {{appeared}} with two flights of four MiG-17s launched from Noi Bai airbase and shot down an F-8 Crusader for the cost of one of their own aircraft written off when it landed on a river bed after running short of fuel. A repeat the next day resulted in a classic dogfight with F-100 Super Sabres and F-105s fighting with more MiG-17s. In total, the USAF lost eleven aircraft to air and ground forces, while the VPAF <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> of their fighters.|$|E
5|$|As with Parcells {{eight years}} previous, one of Handley's first major {{decisions}} involved replacing Phil Simms as starting quarterback. Jeff Hostetler {{was named the}} team's starter. Though the Giants won their opening game in an NFC Championship Game rematch against the 49ers, 16–14, they <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> out of their next four games to drop to 2–3. Though they rallied to finish the season 8–8, and Simms reclaimed his starting job later in the year, the excitement that surrounded the Giants the previous year was gone. One of the few promising young players to emerge on the team was second–year running back Rodney Hampton, who led the Giants in rushing with 1,059 yards.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two tank {{companies}} and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support. The Egyptian commando battalion {{in charge of}} Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed to very short distances. The Israelis <b>lost</b> <b>three</b> tanks, two half-tracks, {{and a large number}} of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during the afternoon and pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal. The Israeli attack had been thoroughly routed.|$|E
