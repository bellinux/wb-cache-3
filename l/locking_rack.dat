50|$|The four {{cast iron}} rails run over 300 {{feet into the}} waters of the loch and this section was badly corroded. Two central rails have a <b>locking</b> <b>rack</b> between them so that pawls on the central bogies can drop down and lock the {{carriage}} or cradle firmly in position as required. The gradient of the slip is 1 in 18 and the total length of the rails is 560 feet or 171 metres. The angle on the carriage, combined with the angle of the slip gives the suitable overall gradient of 1 in 44.5 for a ship.|$|E
2500|$|Firearm lockers: In certain countries, {{including}} the United States, some police vehicles {{are equipped with}} lockers or <b>locking</b> <b>racks</b> in which to store firearms. [...] These are usually tactical firearms such as shotguns or rifles, which would not normally be carried on {{the person of the}} officer.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{principle}} behind the <b>rack</b> <b>lock</b> is as follows: To begin, skis are placed in the ski rack, and a pin is used to fix them into place so they cannot be removed. The <b>rack</b> <b>lock</b> then ensures that the pin cannot be removed by anyone other than the owner. <b>Rack</b> <b>locks</b> are always fastened with a key.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rack</b> <b>locks</b> {{are another}} form of lock common at many European and American ski resorts. They provide {{a high level of}} {{security}} and are generally smaller and more convenient than either cable or tether locks. One of the downfalls of <b>rack</b> <b>locks</b> are that they must be used in conjunction with certain types of ski racks which are not found at all ski resorts. Another is that they only work at locations where these racks are located meaning less freedom.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lock</b> {{has since}} <b>racked</b> up 36 {{appearances}} in a Saints shirt {{and most recently}} helped Saints' second team, the Northampton Wanderers, secure the Aviva 'A' League title as the side beat Gloucester United at Franklin's Gardens as the side lifted the trophy.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{conventional}} bindings {{have greatly}} reduced {{the need for}} solutions like the Integral. Most bindings now have easy-to-adjust sizing based on a lever that <b>locks</b> into a <b>rack</b> plate on the ski. Others use a rack and pinion arrangement that moves the toe and heel bindings by the same amount by turning a single screw.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2016, parking costs $10.00 ($8.00 {{when the}} beach is closed), though a New York State Empire Passport ($65.00) {{can be used to}} park for free. Parking fees are charged from 6:00a.m. to 6:00p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, and from 8:00a.m. to 4:00p.m. weekdays from Memorial Day through Columbus day. The six main public parking areas along the boardwalk can handle 14,302 vehicles. The center parking fields are the busiest on summer weekends. [...] Bicycle parking is free, but bike riding within the park is not allowed during the summer and bikes must be <b>locked</b> at the <b>racks</b> by the boardwalk.|$|R
5000|$|Guns were {{previously}} banned from school grounds, however, {{they are now}} allowed if the school ground in question is a public school, {{as long as the}} owner is in possession of a concealed weapons permit, and the gun is inside a locked compartment, which is in turn inside a locked car. Private schools may permit or ban guns on their campuses as they wish. [...] However, it is a misdemeanor, rather than a Class I Felony, for any person to possess or carry, whether openly or concealed, any gun, rifle pistol, or other firearm of any kind, on educational property or to an extra curricular activity sponsored by a school if the person is not a student attending schools on the educational property, or an employee employed by the school working on the educational property; and the person is not a student attending a curricular or extracurricular activity sponsored by the school at which the student is enrolled, or an employee attending a curricular or extracurricular activity sponsored by the school at which the employee is working; and the firearm is not loaded, is in a motor vehicle and is locked in a container or a <b>locked</b> firearm <b>rack.</b> A concealed handgun permit does not allow a permittee to carry a gun on any school ground. Guns are not allowed into State buildings unless they are being used for instructional or officially sanctioned ceremonial purposes. It is also unlawful for a person to arm himself or herself with a gun for the purpose of terrifying others and go about so on public highways in a manner to cause terror.|$|R
5000|$|... {{does not}} apply to the {{possession}} of a firearm—(i) on private property not part of school grounds;(ii) if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or political subdivision requires that, before an individual obtains such a license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or political subdivision verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license;(iii) that is—(I) not loaded; and(II) in a locked container, or a <b>locked</b> firearms <b>rack</b> that is on a motor vehicle;(iv) by an individual for use in a program approved by a school in the school zone;(v) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered into between a school in the school zone and the individual or an employer of the individual;(vi) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity; or(vii) that is unloaded and is possessed by an individual while traversing school premises for the purpose of gaining access to public or private lands open to hunting, if the entry on school premises is authorized by school authorities.Pursuant to : {{does not apply}} to the discharge of a firearm—(i) on private property not part of school grounds;(ii) as part of a program approved by a school in the school zone, by an individual who is participating in the program;(iii) by an individual in accordance with a contract entered into between a school in a school zone and the individual or an employer of the individual; or(iv) by a law enforcement officer acting in his or her official capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Most pits are {{designed}} as a hydraulic lift, jackscrew lift, <b>locking</b> chain lift, <b>rack</b> and pinion lift, scissors lift or other system that can be raised and lowered as needed. The lift can usually be lowered {{all the way to}} a storage space under the stage, or halfway to floor level, or all the way up level with the stage. When lowered all the way, the lift can be filled with equipment or props from underneath the stage and then raised and unloaded on stage. The pit can be raised so it is level with the floor of the audience seats to accommodate more seating area. This is common when the stage is being used for a rock show and then the pit area is used for standing room. When the pit is raised all the way up, level with the stage, it can be used as part of the stage to give more room for larger shows. Having a lift set up this way gives the theatre much more flexibility and ability to adapt to different events that occur in the theatre. It allows many different setups, each one personal to certain types of productions.|$|R
