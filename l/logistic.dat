5|$|Cross {{was given}} the honorary title of Colonel Commandant, Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps on 5 April 2003. On 9 October 2004, he was {{appointed}} General Officer Commanding, Theatre Troops, Iraq—commander of all British Army combat personnel in the Iraq War. He retired from active service on 20 January 2007, retaining the honorary title of Colonel Commandant, Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps and, in April 2007, {{was given the}} further ceremonial appointment of Honorary Colonel, 168 Pioneer Regiment (Volunteers), Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the army}} {{comprised}} eight combat, four combat support and two <b>logistic</b> brigades, while ten combat, five combat support and two <b>logistic</b> brigades {{could be further}} mobilised in case of crisis. Many of these units have been restructured, however, {{as part of the}} 2007 Force Plan.|$|E
5|$|After Iraq, Cross was {{appointed}} the first Commander, <b>Logistic</b> Support for 3rd Infantry Division in late 1992. During a re-organisation of the Army in 1993, the Royal Army Ordnance Corps was amalgamated {{to become part}} of the newly formed Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps (RLC), into which Cross transferred and was promoted to colonel. Having completed the Higher Command and Staff Course earlier in 1995, he returned to 3rd Division and served in Bosnia as part of NATO's Implementation Force in 1995 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|Based at Nui Dat in the III Corps Tactical Zone {{as part of}} US II Field Force, Vietnam, 1 ATF now {{included}} two infantry battalions plus armour, aviation, engineers and artillery support, with total Australian troop strength in Vietnam reaching 6,300 men. <b>Logistic</b> arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian <b>Logistic</b> Support Group based {{at the port of}} Vung Tau. The 5th and 6th Battalions, Royal Australian Regiment (6 RAR) subsequently returned to Australia in May and June 1967, and were replaced by the 2nd and 7th Battalions, Royal Australian Regiment (7 RAR). Meanwhile, Viet Cong units operating in the province in early 1967 included Main Forces from the Viet Cong 5th Division, which consisted of the 274th Regiment and 275th Regiment, each of three infantry battalions under the command of Senior Colonel Nguyen The Truyen. Supporting this force were a number of artillery, engineer, medical and <b>logistic</b> units. Group 89 (Artillery) was equipped with recoilless rifles, medium mortars and heavy machine-guns. Local Forces included D445 Provincial Mobile Battalion, a provincial unit normally operating in the south of the province and in Long Khanh, while guerrilla forces {{included two}} companies in the Chau Duc district, one in Long Dat and a platoon in Xuyen Moc; in total around 4,500 men.|$|E
5|$|The Army Training Regiment, Grantham {{provides}} {{training for}} Army Reserve recruits, and the Army Training Regiment, Pirbright provides {{training for the}} Army Air Corps, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Corps of Signals, the Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Adjutant General's Corps, the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Intelligence Corps. The Army Training Regiment, Winchester trains the Royal Armoured Corps, the Army Air Corps, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Corps of Signals, the Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, the Adjutant General's Corps, the Royal Army Medical Corps and the Intelligence Corps.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E
5|$|Based in Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy Province, the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF) {{was part}} of US II Field Force, Vietnam (IIFFV), under the overall command of Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand. By early 1968, 1 ATF had been {{reinforced}} and was at full strength with three infantry battalions supported by armour, artillery, aviation and engineers, while <b>logistic</b> arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian <b>Logistic</b> Support Group (1 ALSG) based {{at the port of}} Vung Tau. Commanded by Brigadier Ron Hughes, 1 ATF had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy, and while the war had become a series of large-scale search-and-destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, the Australians had largely pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign despite the differences between Australian and American methods at times producing friction between the allies. Regardless, 1 ATF was also available for deployment elsewhere in the III Corps Tactical Zone and with the province coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians would increasingly spend a significant period of time conducting operations further afield.|$|E
5|$|Each year, 50,000vessels {{pass through}} Malacca Strait. In 2000, the Indonesian {{government}} declared Sabang a Free Trade Zone and Free Port, to gain economic benefit by establishing the port as a <b>logistic</b> hub for international vessels {{passing through the}} strait. Infrastructures for a deep water harbour, port, warehousing and refuelling facilities, were developed.|$|E
5|$|Further logarithm-like inverse {{functions}} {{include the}} double logarithm ln(ln(x)), the super- or hyper-4-logarithm (a slight variation {{of which is}} called iterated logarithm in computer science), the Lambert W function, and the logit. They are the inverse functions of the double exponential function, tetration, of , and of the <b>logistic</b> function, respectively.|$|E
5|$|HV-22 : The U.S. Navy {{considered}} an HV-22 to provide combat search and rescue, delivery and retrieval of special warfare teams along with fleet <b>logistic</b> support transport. It chose the MH-60S for this role in 2001. Naval Air Systems Command's 2011/2012 V-22 Osprey Guidebook lists the HV-22 for the U.S. Navy with the USAF and USMC variants.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, the Victorian ship HMCSS Victoria was {{dispatched}} {{to help the}} New Zealand colonial government in its war against Māori in Taranaki. Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and <b>logistic</b> support, although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications. One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|The CASG is not {{responsible}} for directly supplying deployed ADF units; this {{is the responsibility of}} the Joint Logistics Command and the single service <b>logistic</b> units. These units include the Navy's Strategic Command and replenishment ships, the Army's 17th Combat Service Support Brigade and Combat Service Support Battalions, and the Combat Support Group RAAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{barrels of}} the Chinese cannon {{are on display}} at Firepower - The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich. The {{remaining}} portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal <b>Logistic</b> Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the special forces within the Romanian Land Forces led {{to the establishment of}} the 1st Special Operations Regiment on 1 August 2009, headquartered at Târgu Mureş. It later became the 6th Special Operations Brigade on 25 October 2011, composed of a special operations battalion, two paratrooper battalions and a <b>logistic</b> battalion.|$|E

In total, aerospace accounts for more than 10 percent of Oklahoma's industrial output, and {{it is one of the}} top 10 states in aerospace engine manufacturing. Because of its position in the center of the United States, Oklahoma is also among the top states for <b>logistic</b> centers, and a major contributor to weather-related research.|$|E
25|$|Because of its <b>logistic</b> infrastructure, {{professional}} network, {{and resources}} in science, technology, and communication, Chengdu has become home to 43 foreign-funded <b>logistic</b> enterprises, including UPS, TNT, DHL, and Maersk, {{as well as}} a number of well-known domestic <b>logistic</b> enterprises including COSCO, CSCL, SINOTRANS, CRE, Transfar Group, South <b>Logistic</b> Group, YCH, and STO. By 2012, the <b>logistic</b> industry in Chengdu will realize a value added of RMB 50 billion, with an average annual growth exceeding 18 percent. Ten new international direct flights will be in service; five railways for five-scheduled block container trains will be put into operation; and 50 large <b>logistic</b> enterprises are expected to have annual operation revenue exceeding RMB 100 million.|$|E

25|$|The log-logistic {{distribution}} is the probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm has a <b>logistic</b> distribution.|$|E
25|$|The <b>logistic</b> {{growth curve}} is {{initially}} {{very similar to}} the exponential growth curve. When population density is low, individuals are free from competition and can grow rapidly. However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size. At the carrying capacity, the rate of change of population density is zero because the population is as large as possible based on the resources available. Experiments on Daphnia growth rates showed a striking adherence to the <b>logistic</b> growth curve. The inflexion point in the Daphnia population density graph occurred at half the carrying capacity, as predicted by the <b>logistic</b> growth model.|$|E
25|$|The <b>logistic</b> map is a {{polynomial}} mapping (equivalently, recurrence relation) {{of degree}} 2, {{often cited as}} an archetypal example of how complex, chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. The map was popularized in a seminal 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the <b>logistic</b> equation first created by Pierre François Verhulst.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of considerable civilian and military infrastructure in Darwin, the provision of this support proved a major challenge for Australia, which had not been required to provide full <b>logistic</b> support for a deployed force since the Second World War. Reductions in Defence spending over the previous decade had led to the run down of its <b>logistic</b> support force, resulting in the requirement to quickly implement a range of ad hoc measures to overcome these shortfalls. Despite relatively short lines of communication, low expenditure of ammunition, fuel and other consumables, and limited personnel and equipment casualties, the operation strained the ADF's limited <b>logistic</b> capability and it was questionable whether it could have sustained a more high intensity deployment.|$|E

25|$|Gause’s 1930s lab {{experiments}} showed <b>logistic</b> {{growth in}} microorganisms. Populations of yeast grown in test tubes initially grew exponentially. But as resources became scarcer, their growth rates slowed until reaching the carrying capacity. If the populations {{were moved to}} a larger container with more resources they would continue to grow until reaching their new carrying capacity. The shape of their growth can be modeled very effectively with the <b>logistic</b> growth model.|$|E

25|$|The <b>logistic</b> growth {{equation}} {{is an effective}} tool for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, and {{has been used to}} model many real biological systems. At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the may determinant for population growth is just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the <b>logistic</b> equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density.|$|E
