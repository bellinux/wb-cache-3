The players will continue to play until a winner is decided. All matches will be best of five. The playoffs will all take place on May 26.|$|R
25|$|Mellon {{believed}} that the income tax should remain progressive but with lower rates than those enacted during World War I. He thought that the top income earners would willingly pay their taxes only if rates were 25% or lower. Mellon proposed tax rate cuts, which Congress enacted in the Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926. The top marginal tax rate was cut from 73% to 58% in 1922, 50% in 1923, 46% in 1924, 25% in 1925, and 24% in 1929. Rates in <b>lower</b> <b>brackets</b> were also cut substantially, relieving burdens on the middle-class, working-class, and poor households.|$|E

2500|$|Denmark has a {{universal}} health care system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, {{for most of the}} services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income is a national health care contribution (...) (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it is being phased out and will be gone from January 2019, with the income taxes in the <b>lower</b> <b>brackets</b> being raised gradually each year instead. Another source comes from the municipalities that had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007, a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead. This means that most health care provision is free at the point of delivery for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as physiotherapy. , Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita). This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{historical}} precedents {{other than}} those cited directly by Laffer. For example, in 1924, Secretary of Treasury Andrew Mellon wrote: [...] "It seems difficult for some to understand that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean large revenue to the government, and that more revenue may often be obtained by lower rates". Exercising his understanding that [...] "73% of nothing is nothing", he pushed for {{the reduction of the}} top income tax bracket from 73% to an eventual 24% (as well as tax breaks for <b>lower</b> <b>brackets).</b> Mellon was one of the wealthiest people in the United States, the third-highest income-tax payer in the mid-1920s, behind John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford. While he served as Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department his wealth peaked at around US$300–US$400 million. Personal income-tax receipts rose from US$719 million in 1921 to over US$1 billion in 1929, an average increase of 4.2% per year over an 8-year period, which supporters attribute to the rate cut. David Hume also expressed similar arguments in his essay Of Taxes in 1756, as did fellow Scottish economist Adam Smith, twenty years later.|$|E
2500|$|The tournament {{initially}} {{began with}} the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), China, Europe, North America, South America, and Southeast Asia regional qualifiers in June 2017. Prior to the main event on August 2–5, two separate best-of-two round robin groups consisting of nine teams each were played, with the bottom placed team of each group being eliminated. The remaining 16 teams {{moved on to the}} double elimination main event at the KeyArena in Seattle from August 7–12, with the top four finishing teams from both groups advancing to the upper bracket, and the bottom four advancing to the lower bracket. The first round of the lower bracket was treated as single-elimination, with the loser of each match being immediately eliminated from the tournament. Every other round of both brackets was played in a best-of-three series, with the exception being the Grand Finals, which was played between the winners of the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>brackets</b> in a best-of-five series. As with previous years of the event, Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison reprised her role as co-host and interviewer. However, Paul [...] "ReDeYe" [...] Chaloner, the desk host of the last two Internationals, was not invited. Instead, [...] tournament host Alex [...] "Machine" [...] Richardson and StarCraft personality Sean [...] "Day" [...] Plott replaced him.|$|E

2500|$|Unless {{otherwise}} {{notified by}} the Speaker, a Parliamentary sitting begins at 1:30pm. It {{begins with the}} Speaker's procession, during which the Serjeant-at-Arms enters the chamber of the House bearing the Mace of Parliament on his right shoulder ahead of the Speaker, the Clerk of Parliament, and the Clerk's assistants. Members of Parliament rise in their places upon the entry of the Speaker and bow to him, and he reciprocates. The mace is an ornamented staff that represents the Speaker's authority and is the Serjeant's emblem of office. When Parliament's predecessor, the Legislative Assembly, acquired the Mace in 1958, the Speaker, Sir George Oehlers, invited members to [...] "accept that the Mace {{is an essential part}} of the equipment of this Assembly and that this Assembly cannot, in future, be considered to be properly constituted unless the Mace be first brought into the House and laid on the Table". The Mace is placed on the Table of the House, which is a table in the centre of the debating chamber between the front benches. There are two sets of brackets on the Table, and when the Speaker is in his chair the Mace is placed on the upper brackets. The Mace is removed to the <b>lower</b> <b>brackets</b> when the House sits as a committee, and is not brought into the chamber when the President addresses Parliament.|$|E
