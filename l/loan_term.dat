2500|$|Wonga.com (a {{trading name}} of WDFC UK Limited) is a British payday loan company {{offering}} [...] "short-term, high-cost credit". The interest {{charged by the}} lender, which can equate to an annual percentage rate (APR) of 1509%, has been widely criticised.

30|$|We ran {{a series}} of {{experiments}} investigating this phenomenon (LeBoeuf, 2014). In particular, {{we wanted to know}} whether reminding people to look at some <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> causes them to forget to check others that they previously knew that they were supposed to check. There were several stages in these experiments. In the first stage, participants were given eight <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> that they were supposed to remember to review. The experimenter took his time reviewing and describing all of the <b>loan</b> <b>terms</b> the participant was to review. Participants then viewed a 10 -min sports video, as usually there is some delay between when consumers learn that they should review terms on disclosure documents and when they actually do so, and to capture the fact that many lenders and mortgage brokers spend time at closing talking about irrelevant topics. After viewing the sports video, participants reviewed the 2010 HUD- 1 disclosure form. Before they started doing so, however, the experimenter off-handedly reminded half of the participants of some of the terms. The other half of the participants proceeded directly to review the form.|$|R
