5|$|The Milky Way has a {{relatively}} low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light such as <b>light</b> <b>pollution</b> or stray light from the Moon. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond {{in order for the}} Milky Way to be seen. It should be visible when the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1. This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from any brightly lit urban or suburban location, but very prominent when viewed from a rural area when the Moon is below the horizon. The new world atlas of artificial night sky brightness shows that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due to <b>light</b> <b>pollution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though <b>light</b> <b>pollution</b> may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E

50|$|Many people criticize {{these new}} materials, {{referred}} to as white cork, since the black smoke they give off during the burning of the monument means the combustion can't be seen clearly. The pollution that these new materials cause has also been criticised {{in comparison with the}} supposedly <b>lighter</b> <b>pollution</b> from traditional materials.The Polytechnic University of Valencia carried out a study which seems to prove that, on the contrary, white cork is less polluting than the traditional materials. The student of Fallas Manuel Sanchis Ambrós carried out a study in which he assured that even though the combustion of cork gave off more heat, the combustion of wood and liquid materials used in making a wood structure is clearly more polluting. A few years later (2013), the same university went back to the traditional method of falla making in view of its greater environmental sustainability.|$|R

5|$|At a {{distance}} of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes {{it one of the}} most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80°N is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the unaided eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by <b>light</b> <b>pollution.</b>|$|E

5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial <b>light</b> <b>pollution.</b> A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea's {{summit is}} one of the best sites in the world for astronomical {{observation}} due to favorable observing conditions. The arid conditions are important for submillimeter and infrared astronomy for this region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The summit is above the inversion layer, keeping most cloud cover below the summit and ensuring the air on the summit is dry, and free of atmospheric pollution. The summit atmosphere is exceptionally stable, lacking turbulence for some of the world's best astronomical seeing. The very dark skies resulting from Mauna Kea's distance from city lights are preserved by legislation that minimizes <b>light</b> <b>pollution</b> from the surrounding area; the darkness level allows the observation of faint astronomical objects. These factors historically made Mauna Kea an excellent spot for stargazing.|$|E

Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of <b>light</b> <b>pollution.</b> Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea.

40|$|International audienceIn urban environments, wild {{vertebrates}} have {{to adjust}} to new environmental challenges (e. g., modifiedresource availability, increased chemical, noise and <b>light</b> <b>pollutions).</b> However, while the pace of urbanizationis constantly increasing, {{little is known about}} the ultimate consequences of urban life on thecondition of free-living organisms during different life-history stages. In this study, we investigated theinfluence of urbanization on the condition and non-ornamental feather quality in a common wild birdspecies, the House sparrow (Passer domesticus). Using a national network of trained ringers, almost 600 juvenile (early post-fledging) and adult sparrows were captured at 30 sites that differ in urbanizationrates. To specifically test whether urbanization differentially affect individuals during different parts ofthe life cycle, we used several proxies for the energetic and nutritional conditions experienced during(1) the developmental period (body size, juvenile feather quality), (2) at the time of capture (body condition),or (3) during the molting period (adult feather quality). Using this methodology, we showed for thefirst time that urbanization is associated with both reduced body size and feather quality in this urbandwellerspecies across a large geographical scale. Importantly, only tarsus length and juvenile plumagequality, both determined during development in the nest, were affected by the degree of urbanization. Conversely, body condition and plumage quality did not differ along the urbanization gradient in adults. Our results thus suggest that urban house sparrows could suffer from nutritional deficit during theirdevelopment while such constraints disappear once the chicks have completed their growth...|$|R

5|$|Plans {{were made}} in 1993 to build a direct {{interchange}} between the turnpike and I-79 in Cranberry Township, Butler County. A contract was awarded to build this interchange in November 1995. In 1997, transportation officials agreed upon a design for the interchange. The project also included the movement {{the western end of}} the ticket system to a new toll plaza in Warrendale. The interchange project was delayed by a dispute with Marshall and Pine townships in Allegheny County, who wanted to prevent construction of the toll plaza as they thought it would cause noise, air and <b>light</b> <b>pollution.</b> Marshall Township eventually agreed to allow the toll plaza be built. Groundbreaking for the new interchange took place on February 22, 2002. The westbound Butler service plaza was closed because the Warrendale toll plaza was to be located at its site. On June 1, 2003, the plaza opened and the Gateway toll plaza became a flat-rate toll plaza, while all the exit toll plazas west of Warrendale closed.
