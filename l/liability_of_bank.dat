We identify financial intermediaries ’ underpricing of the put option imbedded in non-recourse mortgage loans as a potential cause for the observed price behavior. This underpricing is due to behavioral causes (lender optimism and disaster myopia) and/or rational response of lenders to market incentives (agency conflicts, deposit insurance, or limited <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> shareholders). The empirical evidence suggests that underpricing occurred in Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Consequently, these countries experienced a more severe market crash than Hong Kong and Singapore, where underpricing was kept under control by strong government intervention and/or more appropriate incentive mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|This essay {{examines}} how the Banking Acts of the 1933 and 1935 and related New Deal legislation influenced risk {{taking in the}} financial sector of the U. S. economy. The analysis focuses on contingent <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks. Using a new panel data set, we find contingent liability reduced risk taking. In states with contingent liability, banks used less leverage and converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could survive larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. In states with limited liability, banks took on more leverage and risk, particularly in states that required banks with limited liability to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the long run, the New Deal replaced a regime of contingent liability with deposit insurance, stricter balance sheet regulation, and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from bankers to state and federal regulators...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} the Banking Acts of the 1933 and 1935 and related New Deal {{legislation}} influenced risk taking in the financial sector of the U. S. economy. Our analysis focuses on contingent <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> owners for losses incurred by their firms and how the elimination of this liability influenced leverage and lending by commercial banks. Using a new panel data set that compares balance sheets of state and national banks, we find contingent liability reduced risk taking, particularly when coupled with rules requiring banks to join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Leverage ratios are higher in states with limited liability for bank owners. Banks in states with contingent liability converted each dollar of capital into fewer loans, and thus could sustain larger loan losses (as a fraction of their portfolio) than banks in limited liability states. The New Deal replaced a regime of contingent liability with stricter balance sheet regulation and increased capital requirements, shifting the onus of risk management from banks to state and federal regulators. By separating investment banks from commercial banks, the Glass-Steagall Act left investment banks to manage their own leverage, a feature of financial regulation that, in part, depended on their partnership structur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} delictual <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>bank</b> towards a non-customer who suffered financial loss {{as a result}} of an electronic funds transfer, specifically fraud perpetrated by a phishing scam. For the purposes of this dissertation we are concerned with instances where banking customers fall victim to internet banking fraud, specifically phishing scams, and their funds are transferred to an account held with another bank (not their bank). In this instance, there is no contractual relationship between the victim and the beneficiary bank. Therefore, if the victim, who is a non-customer, wants to claim from the beneficiary bank he must do so by way of an Aquillian action. To establish delictual liability, the following needs to be proven, that there was: a culpable (intentional or negligent), wrongful act which caused harm to another. This dissertation focuses mainly on elements of negligence and wrongfulness. In a recent decision, Peterson NO and Another v Absa Bank, the court had to consider whether there was a legal duty on the beneficiary bank to prevent pure economic loss to a third party, that is, a non-customer. Essentially the court in the Peterson case, equated the relationship between an originator of a payment order and the beneficiary bank to the relationship between the owner of a cheque and the collecting bank. The court adopted the approach of the court in Indac Electronics v Volkskas Bank and found that the evidence supported the existence of a legal duty on the part of the bank to prevent pure economic loss to the non-customer by negligently opening and maintaining the bank account. Mark Henri Pienaar, completed a dissertation in 2014 exploring the legal duty of a bank to prevent pure economic loss to non-customers. Whilst this dissertation is specifically concerned with the legal duty of a beneficiary bank to prevent pure economic loss to a non-customer in the context of phishing, Pienaar’s dissertation proved to be of great assistance in answering the question that this dissertation is concerned with. However, this dissertation after a consideration of the relevant law and policy considerations, comes to a different finding. This issue of whether a beneficiary bank owes a legal duty to a non-customer was recently the subject of a test case that was referred by the Ombudsman for Banking Services to Judge Malan [...] . LL.

50|$|Although banking at {{the time}} was not a new concept, what had changed was that {{deposits}} had become the primary <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>banks.</b> In 1830 the capital <b>of</b> <b>banks</b> was about three times the deposits, but less than one hundred years later depositors had come to represent approximately 68 percent of the equity in banks.

If the funds are used to purchase stock, the stock is similarly not owned by the bank, and do not appear as an asset or <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bank.</b> If the client subsequently sells the stock and deposits the proceeds in a regular bank account, these would now again appear as a <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the <b>bank.</b>|$|R
