5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested <b>Liza</b> <b>Minnelli</b> wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
5|$|The Sinatra period saw extravagant {{parties and}} visits by celebrities such as Judy Garland, <b>Liza</b> <b>Minnelli,</b> Kim Novak, Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz and Richard Crenna. However, his mood swings would {{sometimes}} determine how {{he responded to}} patrons. Journalist Herb Caen reported {{that he could be}} dismissive and insulting to those who annoyed him. Giancana was banned from the state of Nevada, but Sinatra continued to allow him to stay at the lodge which resulted in Sanicola seeking to remove himself as a shareholder. Although Sinatra sought to explain that Giancana was only visiting his girlfriend, Phyllis McGuire, the disagreement resulted in the end of Sinatra and Sanicola's friendship. After Giancana was spotted on the premises, Sinatra had his gambling license removed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Following this, Sinatra decided he {{wanted to get out of}} entertainment property ownership as he was being heavily criticized in the national press and pursued by law enforcement over illegal activities at the casino. The Cal Neva Lodge was leased to Jack L. Warner in a deal which also saw a majority stake in Reprise Records sold to Warner Bros. Records and Sinatra gaining a one-third ownership in the new company.|$|E

25|$|After reuniting with Sinatra and Dean Martin in 1987, Davis toured {{with them}} and <b>Liza</b> <b>Minnelli</b> internationally, before he died of throat cancer in 1990.

25|$|Another {{criticism}} {{of the show is}} that the actors' impressions, though passable on their radio show, were not at all convincing once they went to TV broadcasts. This problem got worse as the cast got older. The impressions were also often made fun of for being nothing more than thin caricatures of {{one or more of the}} politician or celebrity's characteristics (i.e. Roger Abbott's portrayal of Jean Chrétien as a twisted-mouthed man who ridiculously mispronounced English words with an over the top French Canadian accent, Jessica Holmes' impressions of Celine Dion as a diva and a whiny <b>Liza</b> <b>Minnelli,</b> and Craig Lauzon's impression of Stephen Harper as a robot).|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Warhol's {{homosexuality}} influenced {{his work and}} shaped his relationship to the art world is a major subject of scholarship on the artist and {{is an issue that}} Warhol himself addressed in interviews, in conversation with his contemporaries, and in his publications (e.g., Popism: The Warhol 1960s). Throughout his career, Warhol produced erotic photography and drawings of male nudes. Many of his most famous works (portraits of <b>Liza</b> <b>Minnelli,</b> Judy Garland, and Elizabeth Taylor, and films such as Blow Job, My Hustler and Lonesome Cowboys) draw from gay underground culture or openly explore the complexity of sexuality and desire. As has been addressed by a range of scholars, many of his films premiered in gay porn theaters.|$|E
