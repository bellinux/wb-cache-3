25|$|Attempts at border-blasting were {{somewhat}} more common {{on the other}} side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. WIVB-TV, prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller market than Southern Ontario, which boasts the major world city of Toronto); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF <b>low</b> <b>band</b> (channel 4), even after the Federal Communications Commission reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station WKBW-TV did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was KCND-TV in Pembina, North Dakota; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting Winnipeg, a much larger city sixty miles north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York found it could reach a larger audience in Montreal. Canadian regulators put in simultaneous substitution requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba-based CKND-TV; Burlington station WFFF-TV entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed).|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} topological phase {{transitions in}} Chern insulators within three-band models, {{focusing on the}} empty <b>band</b> and <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> populated by spinless fermions. We consider Lieb and kagome lattices and notice phase transitions driven by the hopping integral between nearest-neighbors, {{which leads to the}} change of the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> Chern number from C= 1 to C=- 1. In the single-particle picture, different phases are examined by investigating corresponding entanglement spectra and the evolution of the entanglement entropy. Entanglement spectra reveal the spectral flow characteristic of topologically nontrivial systems before and after phase transitions. For the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> with 1 / 3 filling, Fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases are identified by examining the ground state momenta, the spectral flow, and counting of the entanglement energy levels below the gap in the entanglement spectrum. A quasilinear dependence of the entanglement entropy α(n_A) term is observed for FCI phase, similarly to linear behavior expected for Laughlin phase in the fractional quantum Hall effect. At the topological phase transition, for both empty and partially filled <b>lowest</b> <b>bands,</b> the energy gap closure and a discontinuity in the entanglement entropy are observed. This coincides with the divergence of a standard deviation of the Berry curvature. We notice also a phase transition driven by the nearest-neighbor interaction in the Lieb lattice, where the many-body energy gap closes. The phase transitions are shown to be stable for an arbitrary system size, thus predicted to be present in the thermodynamic limit. While our calculations are performed for an interaction energy far exceeding the gap between the two <b>lowest</b> energy <b>bands,</b> we note that the higher band does not affect the phase transitions, however destabilizes FCI phases.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} treatment of overdamped Brownian motion on a multidimensional tilted periodic potential that {{is analogous to}} the tight-binding model of quantum mechanics. In our approach we expand the continuous Smoluchowski equation in the localized Wannier states of the periodic potential to derive a discrete master equation. This master equation can be interpreted in terms of hopping within and between Bloch bands and for weak tilting and long times we show that a single-band description is valid. In the limit of deep potential wells, we derive a simple functional dependence of the hopping rates and the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> eigenvalues on the tilt. We also provide general expressions for the drift and diffusion in terms of the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> eigenvalues. Comment: 10 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} atomic {{momentum}} distribution for a superposition of Bloch states spreading in the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> of an optical lattice after {{the action of}} the standing wave pulse. By designing the imposing pulse on this superposed state, an atomic momentum pattern appears with narrower interval between the adjacent peaks that can be far less than the double recoil momentum. The patterns with narrower interval come from the superposition of {{the action of the}} designed pulse on many Bloch states with quasi-momenta over the first Brillouin zone, where for each quasi-momentum there is an interference among several <b>lowest</b> <b>bands.</b> Our experimental result of narrow interval peaks is consistent with the theoretical simulation.

In this thesis we study a Bose-Hubbard model describing spinless particles at zero temperature in a fully frustrated quasi-one-dimensional diamond chain. Frustration means that all the nearest neighbor terms of the Hamiltonian cannot be minimized simultaneously; furthermore, in our model, in absence of interactions frustration leads to strongly localized states, named Aharonov-Bohm cages. However we consider a model including interactions as well and using two numerical approaches, namely the Exact Diagonalization and the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group, we study the phases displayed by the system.

This dynamics is governed by diffusion in the <b>lowest</b> Bloch <b>band</b> of the Josephson junction as well as by Landau-Zener transitions out of the <b>lowest</b> <b>band</b> into the higher bands.
