Maik Yohansen received his secondary education at the Kharkiv Third Gymnasium. There he studied along with Hryhoriy Petnikov and Bohdan Hordeev (pseudo: Bozhydar), who later became well-known poet-futurists, {{as well as with}} Yuriy Platonov - a geographer and prose writer. Afterwards, Maik Yohansen studied at the Kharkiv University, which he successfully graduated in 1917, specialising in Latin.

40|$|Conventional Engineering {{curriculum}} is strongly {{focused on the}} development in students of technical knowledge and skills. However, in recent years, employers have increasingly acknowledged that this traditional preparation of Engineering students‘ is inadequate, as graduates lack {{the wide range of}} written and spoken communication skills required to engage with members of other professional groups and with the broader community. Recognition of the important role that communicative competence plays in professional success within the engineering industry has, as a result, led to a number of tertiary institutions developing curricula to address these needs. This paper presents a successful integrative Engineering Communication curriculum, developed for both local and international Engineering students in an Australian university, which aims to develop both communicative ability and community engagement. The courses that form the Engineering Communication Program provide for critical awareness-raising of community issues such as ethics, sustainability and gender, English for academic and professional Engineering purposes for both English as an Additional Language (EAL) and English background students and advanced research communication for postgraduate students. All courses are strongly informed by scaffolded learning techniques, systemic functional linguistics and genre theory, and most are run collaboratively by Engineering, Education and Applied <b>Linguistics</b> <b>lecturers.</b> The aims of the Program are to raise awareness in Engineering students about, and to equip them with skills for, their future roles and responsibilities, and to provide the community with engineers whose strong technical knowledge is balanced by an appreciation of the broader social contexts with which they will engage in their professional lives...|$|R
50|$|U.S. Army Major Tristan Lyons hires Dr. Melisande Stokes, a Harvard <b>linguistics</b> <b>lecturer,</b> to {{translate}} {{a variety of}} historic texts. The work is classified, {{to the point that}} Lyons cannot even reveal the full name of D.O.D.O, the secret government agency that he works for. Stokes' translations suggest that magic and witches existed in the historical record, and also that magic grew weaker and ceased to function sometime during the Industrial Revolution. Stokes and Lyons eventually discover that photography nullifies magic in the general area by causing a wave function collapse. Magic use ended worldwide when a photograph was taken of the Solar eclipse of July 28, 1851.|$|E

40|$|Teaching and {{learning}} linguistics {{in higher education}} is very important especially for English students because of learning language aspects. Linguistics is a course learnt by English students in Department of English Education. In the process of teaching {{and learning}} <b>linguistics,</b> the <b>lecturers</b> should focus on the outcome of the learning. They do not only demonstrate how to understand the branches of linguistics such as morphology, semantics, discourse but they also should {{be able to make a}} successful teaching and learning. One of the ways is by applying Outcome Based Learning (OBL) which is rarely applied. This approach covers three basic elements: designing the course intended learning outcomes, designing teaching and learning activities, and designing assessment. That is why the literature study is used to know whether OBL can be a potential approach in teaching and learning a linguistics course in Department of English Education. This article focuses on how OBL contributes in the teaching and learning a linguistics course. ...|$|R
50|$|The Peabody Museum {{celebrated its}} one-hundredth anniversary on October 8, 1966. The event was celebrated {{the evening before}} with {{approximately}} four-hundred and fifty graduates, friends, faculty, and staff. IN an essay in the volume 100 Years of Archaeology, Brew notes {{that it was a}} festive event in which tobacco was smoked and cocktails were served for the first time inside the halls of the museum. He also organized several lectures that took place over the 1966 academic year that discussed the growth of the five major phases of anthropology from 1866 to 1966. Those phases were: American Archaeology, Old World Prehistory, Biological Anthropology, Ethnology and Social Anthropology, and Anthropological <b>Linguistics.</b> The <b>lecturers</b> were Gordon Willey of Harvard University, Glyn Daniel of Cambridge University in England, Sherwood Washburn of the University of California at Berkeley, Fred Eggan of the University of Chicago, and Floyd Lounsbury of Yale University. Brew also gave a brief history of the Peabody Museum. All of these activities showed what great enthusiasm Brew had for Harvard University, the Peabody Museum, and the fields of anthropology and archaeology.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the {{learning and teaching}} experiences of two Deaf students and their respective lecturer and supervisor at the Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, University of Malaya. One is a postgraduate Deaf student pursuing a Masters in Linguistics while {{the other is a}} Deaf student pursuing a PhD. The first student is in a classroom setting involving in-front-of class teaching, open group discussions, student presentations, and written assignments. The PhD Deaf student requires one-on-one discussions, written and verbal feedback on written drafts, administrative reminders from the supervisor, and preparations for postgraduate seminars. Both settings are new challenges to the lecturer and the PhD supervisor because {{this is the first time}} Deaf students have been admitted to the Faculty of Languages and <b>Linguistics.</b> The <b>lecturer</b> was not informed that a Deaf student would be enrolled in the class; therefore, she did not have time to make necessary preparations for handling this unique teaching-learning situation. The lecturer is faced with the challenge of imparting field specific knowledge to a student who can neither hear the lectures, nor have eye contact with the lecturer; and is uncomfortable participating in class discussions. At the beginning of the semester, the lecturer assumed that the availability of a sign language interpreter should be sufficient to meet the Deaf student’s needs and fulfill the learning objectives of the course. However, as the semester unfolded, problems began to surface for both Deaf students. In the absence of relevant learning support services to address these problems, the most crucial strategies proved to be having regular open discussions with the Deaf students, the hearing students, and the sign languag...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is a sociolinguistic study of cross cultural communication style choice in multicultural society in Los Angeles {{as reflected in}} the script of Crash. The objectives of the study are: 1. Figure out the cross cultural communication style choice which occurs in the movie, 2. identifying the strategy of cross cultural communication style choice which occurs in the movie. This research uses a descriptive qualitative research design. The data sources of the research are the script and original VCDs of Crash. It is applied three triangulation methods to check and establish validity in the research i. e. data triangulation, theory triangulation, and investigator triangulation. The findings of this research show that there are 68 data from 175 cross cultural communication style choice phenomena uttered by the characters in Crash. For the style it is divided into nine forms from four types (Direct-Indirect Type, Elaborate-Exacting-Succinct Type, Personal-Contextual Type and Instrumental- Affective Type) i. e. Direct Style, Indirect Style, Elaborate Style, Exacting Style, Succinct Style, Personal Style, Contextual Style, Instrumental Style and Affective Style. For the strategy it is divided into 18 points, i. e. overt expression and assert self face needs, Saving face and implicit/ambiguous, flashy and embellished language, not less or more than it is needed, concise statement, understatement and silence, first personal pronoun and informal, personal pronoun and formal, sender based and goal outcome based and receiver oriented and process oriented. The data shows that the White people tend to use Direct, Elaborate, Personal, and Instrumental Style. The Black people use Indirect, Elaborate, Personal and Affective Style. Hispanic people tend to use an Indirect, Elaborate, Personal and Affective Style. Asian people use Indirect, Elaborate, Contextual and Instrumental Style. While Arabian use Direct, Exacting, Personal and Instrumental Style. For the most often occurs strategy are overt expression, implicit/ambiguous, flashy and embellished language, not less or more than it is needed, concise statement, first person pronoun, personal pronoun, influence/persuade, and receiver oriented strategy. It is good for the English <b>Lecturers,</b> <b>Linguistics</b> Students and Further Researcher to go deeper with this research since cross cultural communicationonly discuss generally in books or classes. Moreover, cross cultural communication is really close to us that need to be explores more to minimize the misunderstanding...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to extend our current {{understanding}} of the linguistic characteristics of student-centred distance education texts. This aim links directly with the shift in South Africa from an objectivistic, content-centred teaching approach towards an outcomes-based, studentcentred one. Partly because few guidelines exist as to what the linguistic characteristics of student-centred texts are, developers of such texts in a distance education environment face many challenges and thus, a secondary, more indirect {{aim of this}} study is to benefit developers of distance education study materials. In view of the educational context in which the study is situated, a brief overview of some of the most relevant pedagogic perspectives underlying the notion of student-centredness is provided. Student-centredness is then interpreted in terms of Biber's (1988) construal of `involvement' and also in terms of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) : more particularly, the interpersonal discourse semantic metafunction of SFL and on insights developed in Appraisal Theory. The focus of the study is thus on `involvement' and the expression of evaluative stance, and consequently on attitudinal language through `involvement' features. Of particular interest to the present study is how learning is advanced through the use of attitudinal language. The data for the study include six print-based distance education teaching texts (study guides) from three different academic departments at the University of South Africa. Two guides from each department are analysed and compared: one developed by way of a content-centred approach to teaching and the other by way of a student-centred approach. The linguistic construal of evaluative stance in these guides is analysed and interpreted in interpersonal terms. The thesis develops a theoretically motivated explanation of the linguistic characteristics of student-centred distance education texts, and in the process provides evidence of the interpersonal and pedagogic relevance of evaluative stance in the context of distance education. Some of the main conclusions reached are that student-centred texts differ from contentcentred ones with regard to: the extent to which the social presence of discourse participants is signalled in such texts; the extent to which solidarity is negotiated with students; the participation of students in the knowledge construction process; the relationship that prevails between lecturers and students; and the identity developed for both students as well as <b>lecturers.</b> <b>Linguistics</b> and Modern LanguagesD.
