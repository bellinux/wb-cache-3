40|$|A generic, {{quantitative}} {{risk assessment}} was carried out according to the standard method in the 'Purple Book' to determine the risks posed by pontoons used for supplying fuel to watercraft. The pontoon {{is assumed to be}} situated in a yacht basin accessible only to pleasure boats, and the tank lorry during unloading assumed to be protected against external impact from passing traffic. The reference system defined consists of a concrete pontoon with a relatively large capacity and a high volume of trade. Applying the reference pontoon system led to individual risk contours of 10 - 5 and 10 - 6 per year, which almost coincide. The distance of these risk contours to both the pontoon and the tank lorry is about 20 metres. The risk posed by the pontoon is largely determined by the pool fire within the pontoon and a rupture in the <b>loading</b> <b>hose,</b> which could take place during transhipment from the tank lorry to the pontoon...|$|R
40|$|Framo Engineering has {{replaced}} tanker loading unit (TLU) by a Framo submerged loading (FSL) system at Draugen, with 257 m water depth, in summer 2012. In recent years {{a lot of}} activities {{of oil and gas}} companies including drilling and exporting of oil and gas have been performed in deep and ultra deep waters. The increasing water depth also means {{that it is necessary to}} develop the riser technology to access these depths. The main purpose of this master thesis was the development of the existing FSL system and considering the feasibility of the system for operating in deep water (1000 m). The first challenging step of this master thesis was to modify the existing FSL system RIFLEX model for deep water. It included modification of the existing steel riser, the buoyancy tank, the <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> and the pick-up system. Based on DNV-OS-F 201 standard, the thickness of steel riser was selected to resist internal and external overpressure as well as the other design criteria mentioned in DNV standard. The buoyancy tank length was changed in order to provide the required top tension as well as a reasonable offset. The <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> length was increased as the system offset as well as tanker offset in 1000 m water depth and harsh environment is much larger than in the Draugen with 257 m water depth and moderate environment. After creating the preliminary submerged loading system model, the global analysis of the deep water submerged loading system was conducted in SIMA. Subsequently, the sensitivity studies with respect to different parameters were performed in order to ensure that the theoretical models and numerical approximations represent the real physical behaviour of the submerged loading system model. Finally, based on the obtained results in previous analyses, the deep water submerged loading system was modified and the global analysis results were presented in this report. It must be noted that this design procedure is an iterative process. Therefore, in order to present the final submerged loading system model, fatigue and VIV analyses of the system must be executed that are out of scope of this master thesis. The modified submerged loading system model sustained lower axial tension and bending moment when the buoyancy tank length decreases to 18. 6 m and also the buoyancy tank diameter increases to 7. 5 m compared to the preliminary model when the buoyancy tank had 42. 6 m length and 5 m diameter. Moreover, Catchwheel system was proposed as the pick-up system for the deep water submerged loading system. Although, the Catchwheel system has to be designed and verified in more details, it is a simple and well-performed system which can be easily replaced and repaired because it is located close to the sea surface. Finally, it was concluded that the submerged loading system is feasible for 1000 m water depth. However, more verification as well as fatigue and VIV analyses of the presented system are necessary to obtain the final submerged loading system model. </p...|$|R

This approximation breaks down in the blowout regime where a high-density electron driver expels plasma electrons from its path and creates a cavity void of electrons in its wake. In this paper, we develop a technique that allows to calculate short-range longitudinal and transverse wakes generated by a witness bunch being accelerated inside the cavity.

The hotel was quite empty except {{that there were two}} trained American nurses and a negro porter, and three or four Germans awaiting them. Bert went with the Zeppelin's doctor into the main street of the place, and they broke into a drug shop and obtained various things of which they stood in need. As they returned they found an officer and two men making a rough inventory of the available material in the various stores. Except for them the wide, main street of the town was quite deserted, the people had been given three hours to clear out, and everybody, it seemed, had done so. At one corner a dead man lay against the wall--shot. Two or three dogs were visible up the empty vista, but towards its river end the passage of a string of mono-rail cars broke the stillness and the silence.

40|$|Standard fire {{endurance}} tests {{were performed on}} a full-scale floor assembly and a full-scale wall assembly constructed with cross-laminated timber (CLT) as the main structural element. The full-scale floor assembly consisted of CLT panels encapsulated with fiberglass wool and a single layer of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on the exposed side and with two layers of 12. 7 mm thick cement board on the unexposed side. The full-scale wall assembly was constructed from CLT panels encapsulated with two layers of 15. 9 mm thick Type X gypsum board on both faces. Nine thermocouples were installed on the unexposed face of both assemblies to monitor the temperature rise throughout the test and nine deflection gauges were installed on each assembly to monitor deformations. The superimposed load applied on the floor assembly was 9. 4 kN/m 2 and the load imposed on the wall assembly was 449 kN/m.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} various questions associated with routing and provisioning virtual private networks (VPNs) based on hose traffic models or constraints, i. e., using aggregate (hose) traffic characterizations in/out of VPN end-points. This {{appears to be}} a promising simple approach to dealing with traffic engineering for VPNs. We evaluate the possible efficiencies derived from spatial multiplexing, i. e., over possibly varying routings of traffic <b>loads</b> consistent with <b>hose</b> specifications, and temporal multiplexing, i. e., statistical multiplexing of bursty loads, on shared VPN resources. We explore how these impact VPN routing and provisioning to meet `coarse grained QoS targets' and how routing a sequence of VPNs on a shared network might be done to extend the `life-time' of these decisions (i. e., so as to avoid re-routing) as the number of, and demands on, VPNs grow...|$|R

To avoid breaking of flexible high pressure hose, we proposed to protect with a strong sealed shell filled under pressure with gas (air or inert gas), providing reduction of after-effects of cyclic <b>loads</b> on the <b>hose</b> and, as a result, providing increase of its resource, safety and durability. The structure of flexible high pressure piping due to back pressure {{from the side of}} the strong sealed shell improves hose properties and reduces cyclic loads on the hydraulic actuator, prevents the hose from untimely breaking and ejection of working liquid into the atmosphere. At the same time,operating expenses and contamination of the environment are reduced...|$|R

Important messages were spelt out on the display board using up to 2,000 bulbs. The sign was switched on {{for the first time on}} 10 October 1950, watched by a large crowd.

40|$|The Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) {{concept is}} a ship shaped {{production}} platform frequently {{used on the}} Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). One of the main advantages of a FPSO is that the produced oil {{can be stored in}} the cargo tanks and offloaded to shuttle tankers by tandem offloading. Tandem offloading means that a <b>loading</b> <b>hose</b> from the stern of the FPSO is connected to the bow of the shuttle tanker. The shuttle tankers will then transport the oil to an oil terminal at shore or directly to the market. Tandem offloading is a safety critical and weather sensitive operation. Adverse weather conditions such as wave heights, polar lows, sea ice, etc., influences the offloading operation considerably. The shuttle tankers will normally be allowed to start the operation, if the significant wave height is below 4, 5 m and stop if the wave height increases to above 5, 5 m. A small storage capacity on the FPSO could lead to multiple offloading operations resulting in low regularity for the shuttle tanker operation and transportation. The storage capacity on the FPSO should allow for a full load for the shuttle tanker and also have some margin in order to include uncertainties in the offloading and transportation chain. Typical shuttle tankers have capacities in the range of 550. 000 – 850. 000 barrels. The oil companies have long experience with tandem loading on the NCS. However, offshore field developments are now moving further north into the Barents Sea and we are in subarctic area. The Goliat and Johan Castberg projects are example on such developments. These new areas have challenges related to sub-arctic climate and weather conditions. There is also a long transportation route, if the oil should be transported directly to the market in Europe. A fleet of dedicated purpose built shuttle tankers may be needed for a field development in this area. The cost related to offloading and transportation of oil is significant and the following three main questions need to be addressed; 1. How large should be the FPSO storage capacity in order to secure sufficient offloading regularity? 2. How many shuttle tankers are needed and what should be the capacity in order to ensure sufficient regularity of the transportation? 3. How significant wave height, sea ice & polar lows influence the FPSO storage capacity? For commercial, safety and efficiency reasons, these three questions need to be considered in early phase of the design. The optimal answer depends on many parameters;  Oil production profile for the FPSO  Actual weather condition and weather limitations criteria  Connecting and disconnecting time  Pump capacity for the oil transfer  Sailing route and distance to the market  Regularity requirements  Shuttle tankers capacity  Cost for FPSO storage Using Johan Castberg oil production rate, typical shuttle tanker capacities, wave limitation criteria, time taken by shuttle tankers to travel on 1. 5 m thick sea ice and 48 hours duration polar lows in the vicinity of FPSO, this dissertation intend to optimize the storage capacity for the FPSO. It is assumed that produced oil from Johan Castberg field is transported using shuttle tankers to Murmansk oil terminal located in Russia. The reason for assuming a specific field and oil terminal is to gather input parameters, such as production rate, hindcast data, maritime distance in ice infested waters etc. The case study is performed with shuttle tanker capacity of 850, 000 bbls. Otherwise, the adopted concept in this dissertation will be general i. e., to serve the wide variety of situations and geographical locations.

40|$|A {{versatile}} mobile telerobot, denoted the magnetically attached multifunction maintenance rover (MAGMER), {{has been}} proposed {{for use in the}} inspection and maintenance of the surfaces of ships, tanks containing petrochemicals, and other large ferromagnetic structures. As its name suggests, this robot would utilize magnetic attraction to adhere to a structure. As it moved along the surface of the structure, the MAGMER would perform tasks that could include close-up visual inspection by use of video cameras, various sensors, and/or removal of paint by water-jet blasting, laser heating, or induction heating. The water-jet nozzles would be mounted coaxially within compressed-air-powered venturi nozzles that would collect the paint debris dislodged by the jets. The MAGMER would be deployed, powered, and controlled from a truck, to which it would be connected by hoses for water, compressed air, and collection of debris and by cables for electric power and communication (see Figure 1). The operation of the MAGMER on a typical large structure would necessitate the use of long cables and hoses, which can be heavy. To reduce the <b>load</b> of the <b>hoses</b> and cables on the MAGMER and thereby ensure its ability to adhere to vertical and overhanging surfaces, the hoses and cables would be paid out through telescopic booms that would be parts of a MAGMER support system. The MAGMER would move by use of four motorized, steerable wheels, each of which would be mounted in an assembly that would include permanent magnets and four pole pieces (see Figure 2). The wheels would protrude from between the pole pieces by only about 3 mm, so that the gap between the pole pieces and the ferromagnetic surface would be just large enough to permit motion along the surface but not so large as to reduce the magnetic attraction excessively. In addition to the wheel assemblies, the MAGMER would include magnetic adherence enhancement fixtures, which would comprise arrays of permanent magnets and pole pieces that could be adjusted to maximize or minimize the overall attractive magnetic force. Even with a paint thickness of 2 mm, a preliminary design provides a safety factor of 5 in the magnetic force in the upside- down, water-jets-operating condition, in which the total load (including the weight of the MAGMER and cables and the water-jet force) would be about 260 lb (the weight of 118 kg). Optionally, the MAGMER could carry magnetic shielding and/or could be equipped with a demagnetizing module to remove residual magnetism from the structure. The MAGMER would carry four charge-coupled-device cameras for visual inspection, monitoring of operation, navigation, and avoidance of collisions with obstacles. The control system of the MAGMER would include navigation and collision-avoidance subsystems that would utilize surface features as landmarks, in addition to direct images of obstacles...|$|R
