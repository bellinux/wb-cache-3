The strength of these seams is an important characteristic which has a substantial influence on the mechanical property of the parachute assemblies. It is well established that factors such as fabric width, folding <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint,</b> seam design and seam type will all {{have an impact on}} seam strength. In this work, the effect of these factors on seam strength was studied using both Taguchi's design of experiment (TDOE) as well as an artificial neural network (ANN). In TDOE, two levels were chosen for the factors mentioned above. An L 8 design was adopted and an orthogonal array was generated. The contribution of each factor to seam strength was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal to noise ratio methods. From the analysis {{it was found that the}} fabric width, folding <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> and interaction between the folding <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint</b> and the seam design affected seam strength significantly. Further, using TDOE, an optimal configuration of levels of factors was found. In order to contrast and compare the results from TDOE, an ANN was also used to predict seam strength using the above mentioned factors as inputs. The prediction from TDOE and ANN methodologies were compared with physical seam strength. It was established from these comparisons, in which the root mean square error was used as an accuracy measure, that the predictions by ANN were better in accuracy than those predicted by TDOE...|$|E

At the optimum overlap length {{it is possible to}} reach a maximum load bearing capacity using a minimum quantity of applied adhesive. Design/methodology/approach: In accordance with experimental test results, an optimum overlap length was achieved. In numerical analysis, the proposed material model (MISO) fits well in simulations. Findings: Mechanical properties of adhesive which are often public unknown have very strong influence on reliability of material models used in numerical analysis. Therefore, it was crucial decision of research to made an adhesive specimen for tensile testing. Research limitations/implications: At the overlap lengths above critical (optimal) ones, the usage of a MISO material model in FEA is not acceptable any more.

40|$|Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) {{consist of}} a metal alloy {{reinforced}} with ceramic particles or fibers. These materials possess a very high strength to weight ratio, good resistance to impact and wear, {{and a number of}} other properties which make them attractive for use in aerospace and defense applications. MMCs have found use in the space shuttle orbiter's structural tubing, the Hubble Space Telescope's antenna mast, control surfaces and propulsion systems for aircraft, and tank armors. The size of MMC components is severely limited by difficulties encountered in joining these materials using fusion welding. Melting of the material results in formation of an undesirable phase (formed when molten Aluminum reacts with the reinforcement) which leaves a strength depleted region along the joint line. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a relatively nascent solid state joining technique developed at The Welding Institute (TWI) in 1991. The process was first used at NASA to weld the super lightweight external tank for the Space Shuttle. Today FSW is used to join structural components of the Delta IV, Atlas V, and Falcon IX rockets as well as NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Space Launch System. A current focus of FSW research is to extend the process to new materials, such as MMCs, which are difficult to weld using conventional fusion techniques. Since Friction Stir Welding occurs below the melting point of the workpiece material, this deleterious phase is absent in FSW-ed MMC joints. FSW of MMCs is, however, plagued by rapid wear of the welding tool, a consequence of the large discrepancy in hardness between the steel tool and the reinforcement material. This chapter summarizes the challenges encountered when joining MMCs to themselves or to other materials in structures. Specific attention is paid to the influence of process variables in Friction Stir Welding on the wear process characterizes the effect of process parameters (spindle speed, traverse rate, and <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>joint)</b> on the wear process. A phenomenological model of the wear process was constructed based on the rotating plug model of Friction Stir Welding. The effectiveness of harder tool materials (such as Tungsten Carbide, high speed steel, and tools with diamond coatings) to combat abrasive wear is also explored. In-process force, torque, and vibration signals are analyzed to assess the feasibility of in situ monitoring of tool shape changes as a result of wear (an advancement which would eliminate the need for off-line evaluation of tool condition during joining). Monitoring, controlling, and reducing tool wear in FSW of MMCs is essential to implementation of these materials in structures (such as launch vehicles) where they would be of maximum benefit. The work presented here is extendable to machining of MMCs, where wear of the tool is also a limiting factor...|$|E

The results from those tests show that peak shear strength is a strongly scale-dependent variable. Scale effects are most pronounced in cases <b>of</b> rough undulating <b>joints,</b> whereas they are virtually absent for relatively planar joints. The key factor behind the changing behaviour and strength with increasing scale is the involvement of different sizes of asperities in controlling the peak behaviour <b>of</b> different <b>lengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>joints.</b> An important consequence is a decrease in the value of roughness coefficient (JRC) and wall strength (JCS) operating at larger scale.
