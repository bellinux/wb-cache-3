50|$|Defects in the {{establishment}} of sister chromatid cohesion have serious consequences for the cell and are therefore tied to many human diseases. Failure to establish cohesion correctly or inappropriate <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> can lead to missegregation of chromosomes during mitosis, which results in aneuploidy. The loss of the human homologs of core cohesin proteins or of Eco1, Pds5, Wapl, Sororin, or Scc2 has been tied to cancer. Mutations affecting cohesion and establishment of cohesion are also responsible for Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and Roberts Syndrome. Diseases arising from defects in cohesin or other proteins involved in sister chromatid cohesion are referred to as cohesinopathies.|$|E
50|$|One {{model of}} {{establishment}} of cohesion suggests that establishment is {{mediated by the}} replacement of Wapl in the Wapl-Pds5-cohesin complex with the Sororin protein. Like Wapl, Sororin contains an FGF domain and is capable of interacting with Pds5. In this model, put forward by Nishiyama et al., Wapl interacts with Pds5 and cohesin during G1, before establishment. During S phase, Eco1 (Esco1/Esco2 in humans) acetylates Smc3. This results in recruitment of Sororin. Sororin then replaces Wapl in the Pds5-cohesin complex. This new complex is the established, cohesion-competent cohesin state. At entry to mitosis, Sororin is phosphorylated and replaced again by Wapl, leading to <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion.</b> Sororin also has chromatin binding activity independent {{of its ability to}} mediate cohesion.|$|E

The majority of the PA activity comigrated with the higher- molecular-weight species of human urokinase (approximately 55, 000).

In some of the major battles between the Roman Army and Hellenistic phalanxes, Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx performed relatively well against the Roman army, initially driving back the Roman infantry.

The ancient Greek historian Polybius goes into some detail about the effectiveness of the Roman legion against the Phalanx.

5000|$|Pemphigus is an {{autoimmune}} disease caused by antibodies directed against both desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 present in desmosomes. Loss of desmosomes results in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> between keratinocytes in the epidermis, and {{a disruption of}} the barrier function served by intact skin. The process is classified as a type II hypersensitivity reaction (in which antibodies bind to antigens on the body's own tissues). On histology, the basal keratinocytes are usually still attached to the basement membrane leading to a characteristic appearance called [...] "tombstoning." [...] Transudative fluid accumulates in between the keratinocytes and the basal layer (suprabasal split), forming a blister and resulting in {{what is known as}} a positive Nikolsky's sign. This is a contrasting feature from bullous pemphigoid, which is thought to be due to anti-hemidesmosome antibodies, and where the detachment occurs between the epidermis and dermis (subepidermal bullae). Clinically, pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by extensive flaccid blisters and mucocutaneous erosions. The severity of the disease, as well as the mucosal lesions, is believed to be directly proportional to the levels of desmoglein 3.

Just three days after headquarters opened on 5 April 1941, the Germans broke through and the corps was thrown into a retreat that eventually led to its re-embarkation.

Rowell later wrote: What history should record is that, {{in the face of}} a desperate situation, HQ I Corps never lost control of the battle; made sound tactical decisions with limited resources and succeeded finally in bringing its troops to the beaches with limited resources and with no <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion.</b> [...] Tempers flared when I Corps headquarters was ordered to evacuate to Egypt. Blamey's aide recalled: [...] We had now now come to our last hours in Greece. They were marked by tension and anger.

The hostility in this exchange opened up a rift between the two men. Rowell had always been completely frank in putting his views to Blamey, but not defiant. On this occasion it took a sharp and direct order to remind Rowell who was in command. [...] If Rowell felt that Blamey had shown a lack of moral courage in failing to stand up to the political and military superiors who had directed the ill-fated campaign, Blamey felt that the campaign had revealed flaws in Rowell's character. He wrote to the Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee: Rowell has very great ability; is quick in decision and sound in judgement. There can be no question of his personal courage, but he lacks the reserves of nervous energy over a period of long strain. I found him difficult in the last days in Greece and, as commander, had to exercise considerable tact. Rather a reverse of what it should be.I was a little disappointed in both him and Bridgeford over their attitude in one or two matters.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Mitotic {{chromosome}} segregation depends on bi-orientation and capture of sister kinetochores by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles and the near synchronous loss of sister chromatid cohesion. During meiosis I, in contrast, sister kinetochores orient {{to the same}} pole, and homologous kinetochores are captured by microtubules emanating from opposite spindle poles. Additionally, mechanisms exist that prevent complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> during meiosis I. These features ensure that homologs separate during meiosis I and sister chromatids remain together until meiosis II. The mechanisms responsible for orienting kinetochores in mitosis and for causing asynchronous <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> during meiosis are not well understood. Results: During mitosis in C. elegans, aurora B kinase, AIR- 2, is not required for sister chromatid separation, but it is required for {{chromosome segregation}}. Condensin recruitment during metaphase requires AIR- 2; however, condensin functions during prometaphase, independent of AIR- 2. During metaphase, AIR- 2 promotes chromosome congression to the metaphase plate, perhaps by inhibiting attachment of chromatids to both spindle poles. During meiosis in AIR- 2 -depleted oocytes, congression of bivalents appears normal, but segregation fails. Localization of AIR- 2 on meiotic bivalents suggests this kinase promotes separation of homologs by promoting the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>cohesion</b> distal to the single chiasma. Inactivation of the phosphatase that antagonizes AIR- 2 causes premature separation of chromatids during meiosis I, in a separase-dependent reaction. Conclusions: Aurora B functions to resolve chiasmata during meiosis I and to regulate kinetochore function during mitosis. Condensin mediates chromosome condensation during prophase, and condensin-independent pathways contribute to chromosome condensation during metaphase...|$|E

50|$|Using another genetically {{engineered}} mouse that lacks Sgol2 function, and siRNA experiments in oocytes, {{it has been}} shown that disruption of the mouse SGOL2 does not cause any alteration in sister chromatid cohesion in embryonic cultured fibroblasts and adult somatic tissues. Moreover, although these mutant mice also develop normally and survive to adulthood without any apparent alteration, both male and female Sgol2-deficient mice from this line are infertile. By different approaches it was demonstrated that SGOL2 is necessary for protecting centromeric cohesion during mammalian meiosis I. In vivo, the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> SGOL2 promotes a premature release of the meiosis-specific REC8 cohesin complexes from anaphase I centromeres.

40|$|In meiosis, {{chromosome}} cohesion {{is maintained}} by the cohesin complex, which is released in a two-step manner. At meiosis I, the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit Rec 8 is cleaved by the protease Separase along chromosome arms, allowing homologous chromosome segregation. Next, in meiosis II, cleavage of the remaining centromere cohesin results in separation of the sister chromatids. In eukaryotes, protection of centromeric cohesion in meiosis I is mediated by SHUGOSHINs (SGOs). The Arabidopsis genome contains two SGO homologs.
