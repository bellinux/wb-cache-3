25|$|The net {{bit rate}} of the Ethernet 100Base-TX {{physical}} layer standard is 100Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125Mbit/second, due to the 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding. In this case, the gross bit rate {{is equal to the}} symbol rate or pulse rate of 125megabaud, due to the NRZI <b>line</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{communications}} technologies without forward {{error correction}} and other physical layer protocol overhead, there is no distinction between gross bit rate and physical layer net bit rate. For example, the net as well as gross bit rate of Ethernet 10Base-T is 10Mbit/s. Due to the Manchester <b>line</b> <b>code,</b> each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20megabaud.|$|E

2500|$|Some data streams, {{especially}} high-speed {{serial data}} streams (such as the raw stream {{of data from}} the magnetic head of a disk drive), are sent without an accompanying clock. [...] The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then phase-aligns to the transitions in the data stream with a PLL. This process {{is referred to as}} clock recovery. In order for this scheme to work, the data stream must have a transition frequently enough to correct any drift in the PLL's oscillator.

40|$|International audienceA <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> {{for high}} speed serial {{transmission}} {{is defined by}} two major characteristics: the maximum guaranteed run length (RL) which {{is the number of}} consecutive identical bits, and the running disparity (RD or DC-Balance) which is the difference between the number of 'zeroes' and 'ones' in a frame. Both should be bounded to a certain limit, RL to ensure reliable clock recovery and RD to limit baseline wander. Another important parameter is the overhead predictability. This parameter may be critical for applications that need a regular synchronization but for other applications, especially if the variable transfer rate is handled by the upper layer protocol, a statistical value of this parameter is good enough. In this paper, we propose two programmable line codings which bound RL and RD with fixed or variable overhead. The resulting overhead for the <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> we propose is shown to be the lowest among the existing methods, as much as to 10 times lower than well-known encoding methods. The fixed overhead <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> is based on a generalization of the polarity bit approach and can be dynamically adapted to link quality and the environment. First we propose a <b>line</b> <b>coding</b> which bounds the RL, and then we propose another one which bounds the RD. We end up by combining both methods to build a DC-balanced and Run Length limited <b>line</b> <b>coding...</b>|$|R
