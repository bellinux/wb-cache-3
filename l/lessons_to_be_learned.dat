25|$|Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear {{accidents}} Chris Huhne, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, {{wrote to}} Dr Mike Weightman, {{head of the}} HSE's Nuclear Directorate, on March 12, asking for a report 'on {{the implications of the}} situation and the <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> for the UK nuclear industry. The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On March 15, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried out, and said that it was too early to determine whether the willingness of the private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. In the wake of the accident the Government was criticised for having colluded with EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse in order to manage communications and maintain public support for nuclear power.|$|E

2500|$|The Women Under Siege Project {{was begun}} by Gloria Steinem in 2012 {{in order to}} {{document}} violence against women taking place during violent conflicts. The idea was inspired by two books: Sexual Violence Against Jewish Women During the Holocaust by Sonja M. Hedgepeth and Rochelle Saidel and At the Dark End of the Street: Black Women, Rape and Resistance - a New History of the Civil Rights Movement from Rosa Parks to Black Power by Danielle McGuire. After reading these two books which addressed sexual violence, Steinem wondered if there were <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> from both history and current affairs; and also, if information were more widely available and people {{were aware of the}} issues, if rape and gender-based violence could be prevented in the future.

This appointment was a transfer from Third United States Army; a move which has been characterized as Patton being [...] "kicked upstairs." [...] In actuality the move took away much of the power Patton had in Bavaria in post-War Germany while attempting to maintain some respect for his accomplishments in the war. By this point the Fifteenth was a small organization concerned with documentation of tactical <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> from the war.

2500|$|After {{the death}} of ten Belgium soldiers, the United Nations {{reported}} the removal of most 2,500 peace keepers. Canadian Foreign Minister, Lloyd Axworthy stated [...] "none present could look back without feeling guilt and devastation at the lack to help the Rwandan civilians at their time in need" [...] (BBC News). Even as the council stopped short and delivered an apology, fifteen council members focused on a report about <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned.</b> It {{was based on the}} lack of support and help in Africa. The United Nations presents a core policy and a great challenge to prevent another round of genocidal violence. The councils have already evidently learned how to bring peace from lessons of past failures. The Rwandan ambassador Joseph Mutaboba has welcomed the report and its apologies stating that the council could do more, it’s not too late. In 1994 the United Nations Security Council had appointed General Kofi Annan to the United Nations Security Council and Head of United Nations Peacekeeping operations. Annan commissioned the report and was publicly criticized for not delivering warnings about the upcoming genocide. Kofi Annan has accepted the conclusions based on recorded reports.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{published}} on 26 February 2015 was Kate Lampard's report into <b>lessons</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>learned</b> {{from the health}} service's handling of the Savile scandal. [...] She concluded that:"Savile was a highly unusual personality whose lifestyle, behaviour and offending patterns were equally unusual. As {{a result of his}} celebrity, his volunteering, and his fundraising he had exceptional access to a number of NHS hospitals and took the opportunities that that access gave him to abuse patients, staff and others on a remarkable scale. Savile’s celebrity and his roles as a volunteer and fundraiser also gave him power and influence within NHS hospitals which meant that his behaviour, which was often evidently inappropriate, was not challenged as it should have been. Savile’s ability to continue to pursue his activities without effective challenge was aided by fragmented hospital management arrangements; social attitudes of the times, including reticence in reporting and accepting reports of sexual harassment and abuse, and greater deference than today towards those in positions of influence and power; and less bold and intrusive media reporting. [...] While it might be tempting to dismiss the Savile case as wholly exceptional, a unique result of a perfect storm of circumstances, the evidence we have gathered indicates that there are many elements of the Savile story that could be repeated in the future. There is always a risk of the abuse, including sexual abuse, of people in hospitals. There will always be people who seek to gain undue influence and power within public institutions including in hospitals. And society and individuals continue to have a weakness for celebrities.

Had they been willing to sell, they could have disposed of all they possessed by noon, but, cautioned by Foster Portney, they were firm, and nothing was allowed to change hands but a small bottle of cough syrup which the doctor sold for an ounce of gold, worth sixteen dollars, to a poor fellow suffering with a slight attack of pneumonia. The doctor wanted no pay, but the miner insisted on giving it, saying he would pay a thousand dollars if the physician would make him as well and strong as ever again.|$|E
6000|$|Such were {{my first}} {{impressions}} in this absurd place of education; and, to be frank, {{they were far}} from disagreeable. As long as I was rich, my evenings and afternoons would be my own; the clerk must keep my books, the clerk could do the jostling and bawling in the exchange; and I could turn my mind to landscape-painting and Balzac's novels, which were then my two pre-occupations. To remain rich, then, became my problem; or, in other words, to do a safe, conservative line of business. I am looking for that line still; and I believe the nearest thing to it in this imperfect world {{is the sort of}} speculation sometimes insidiously proposed to childhood, in the formula, [...] "Heads I win; tails you lose." [...] Mindful of my father's parting words, I turned my attention timidly to railroads; and for a month or so maintained a position of inglorious security, dealing for small amounts in the most inert stocks, and bearing (as best I could) the scorn of my hired clerk. One day I ventured a little further by way of experiment; and, in the sure expectation they would continue to go down, sold several thousand dollars of Pan-Handle Preference (I think it was). I had no sooner made this venture than some fools in New York began to bull the market; Pan-Handles rose like a balloon; and in the inside of half an hour I saw my position compromised. Blood will tell, as my father said; and I stuck to it gallantly: all afternoon I continued selling that infernal stock, all afternoon it continued skying. I suppose I had come (a frail cockle-shell) athwart the hawse of Jay Gould; and, indeed, I think I remember that this vagary in the market proved subsequently to be the first move in a considerable deal. That evening, at least, the name of H. Loudon Dodd held the first rank in our collegiate gazette, and I and Billson (once more thrown upon the world) were competing for the same clerkship. The present object takes the present eye. My disaster, for the moment, was the more conspicuous; and it was I that got the situation.
