The Mughals used the method throughout the 17th century and into the 18th, particularly against rebels.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time.

5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, {{as well as the}} output of the intestines, emerges from the cloaca. In addition, many species regurgitate pellets, and fossil pellets that may have come from dinosaurs are known from as <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words in the phrase refer to the number of times that the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as <b>long</b> <b>ago</b> <b>as</b> 1869.|$|E
