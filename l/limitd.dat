40|$|We discuss hardware/software coprocessing on {{a hybrid}} {{processor}} for a compute- and data-intensive hyper-spectral imaging algorithm, KMeans Clustering. The experiments are {{performed on the}} Altera Excalibur board using the soft IP core 32 -bit NIOS RISC processor. In our experiments, we compare performance of the sequential algorithm with two dierent accelerated versions. We consider granularity and synchronization issues when mapping an algorithm to a hybrid processor. Our results show that on the Excalibur NIOS, a 15 % speedup can be achieved over the sequential algorithm on images with 8 spectral bands where the pixels are divided into 8 categories. Speedup is <b>limitd</b> by the communication cost of transferring data from external memory through the NIOS processor to the customized circuits. Our results indicate that future hybrid processors must either (1) have a clock rate 10 X {{the speed of the}} congurable logic circuits or (2) include dual port memories that both the processor and congurable logic can access. If either of these conditions is met, the hybrid processor will show a factor of 10 speedup over the sequential algorithm. Such systems will combine the convenience of conventional processors with the speed of congurable logic.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 67 - 69. The clean SNS junction, with a {{phase difference}} x across the normal metal barrier and without Fermi level mismatch between the components, is modeled by a step like pair potential. The quasiclassical equations are {{obtained from the}} Gorkov equations by the elimination of crystal momenta and are valid {{in the existence of}} only the off-diagonal potential(pair potential). Then for the SNS junction, the quasiclassical Green functions are obtained. At zero temperature, in the long barrier <b>limit(d</b> ^ ^o) > the current is found to have a sawtooth dependence on the phase difference, the amplitude of which is inversely proportional to the thickness of the normal layer. At finite temperatures in the limits d and Tc T, the current is found to have exponential dependence on the thickness of the normal layer, T exp(—d/^ 7 ’) sin y,. where = vfI 2 ttT. An extension of single SNS structures is the periodic SNS structure which may as well exhibit Josephson effect. It is simulated by a periodic step-wise pair potential, where the phase of the pair potential changes by some constant value in subsequent superconducting islands. Bogoliubov equations in the semicla. ssical limit are employed, yielding the density of states(DOS). In the DOS, there appears some forbidden energy regions, which point out to a band structure.
