50|$|During {{the spring}} 1990 electoral campaign, the {{opposition}} parties organised a massive sit-in protest in down-town Bucharest, later known as the Golaniad. After the FSN won an overwhelming majority, most of the Bucharest protesters dispersed, however {{less than a hundred}} chose to remain in the square. The police efforts to evict them and re-establish traffic in central Bucharest two weeks after the elections was met with violence, and several state institutions were attacked (among them the Bucharest Police and the Interior Ministry). The freshly elected president, Ion Iliescu, issued a call to Romania's population to come and defend the government from further attacks. The main group to answer the call were the coal miners of Jiu Valley, leading to the June 1990 Mineriad. The miners and other groups physically confronted the demonstrators and forcibly cleared University Square. After the situation calmed down, president Iliescu publicly thanked the miners for their help in restoring order in Bucharest, and requested their return to the Jiu Valley. The general national and international media portrayal of the miners involvement in these events have been disputed by the miners, who claimed that most of the violence was perpetrated by government agents that were agitating the crowds; these claims, and a growing public suspicion of the sequence and orchestration of events, led to Parliamentary and other inquiries. Parliamentary inquiries showed that members of the government intelligence services were involved in the instigation and manipulation of both the protesters and the miners, and later, in June 1994, a Bucharest court found two former Securitate officers guilty of ransacking and stealing $100,000 from the house of a leading opposition politician.In December 1991, a new constitution was drafted and subsequently adopted, after a popular referendum. March 1992 marked the split of the FSN into two groups: the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), led by Ion Iliescu and the Democrat Party (PD), led by Petre Roman. Iliescu won the presidential elections in September 1992 by a clear margin, and his FDSN won the general elections held at the same time. With parliamentary support from the nationalist National Unity Party of Romanians (PUNR), Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the ex-communist Socialist Workers' Party (PSM), a new government was formed in November 1992 under Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu, an economist and former bureaucrat during the Ceaușescu administration. The government took some limited steps towards the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market,</b> started a privatisation program through management employee buyouts and sought to further relations with the Euro-Atlantic structures (the EEC/EU and NATO). The FDSN changed its name to Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) in July 1993 after the merger with several smaller parties. This coalition dissolved before the November 1996 elections. This coincided with the bankruptcy of the Caritas pyramid scheme, a major scandal at the time in Romania.|$|E

In Bolivia and Finland, for example, consumer cooperatives have been for many years the only mechanism to provide local telecommunication services to the whole country. This paper studies the effects of the Bolivian market's structure on the development of competition as well as on universal access and service policies. It argues that some cooperatives after the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> are not helping to develop competition. Cooperatives may have incentives to increase the interconnection charges that they receive from long distance firms to cross-subsidise the prices of local calls. Moreover, as some cooperatives have entered the long distance market, they may try to restrict competition through collusive agreements. Finally, the paper suggests that the excessive price of the cooperatives' shares may have damaged the possibility of reaching a higher penetration level and greater coverage in rural areas.

40|$|This paper {{contrasts}} {{the operation}} of seed cotton and wheat marketing systems in Sindh. Analysis of marketing margins indicates {{that the private sector}} cotton marketing chain appears to be working efficiently, given the many adverse aspects of its socioeconomic environment. There is evidence that higher domestic prices resulting from alignment with world markets have been transmitted through the marketing chain to producers, and that production has increased. In contrast to cotton, the government continues to be heavily involved in wheat procurement and storage, with private traders usually acting as intermediaries between the Food Department and the grower. Despite expensive involvement of the same private traders as in cotton, the wheat market is characterised by bureaucratic failure and rent-seeking behaviour, leading to stagnation of incentives and production. For cotton, the primary recommendations are to sustain <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and to support the developing beneficial model of private competition through improvements in communications and transport infrastructure. The practical means to improve the grading of cotton lint and seed cotton should also be developed and promoted to provide incentives for higher quality output. For wheat, the main recommendations are to liberalise farmgate prices, reduce the state’s role in procurement, and privatise government godowns. Research is needed on how this might best be achieved, with attention to the conditions necessary for private financing of storage activities, and to ways of minimising price and supply fluctuations. The impact of higher flour prices on poor consumers also needs to be addressed. ...|$|E

40|$|Energy is a {{specific}} product, which is produced and sold generally in one region. Therefore clients on the energy market have usually only one energy distributor: the suppliers have the exclusive right to provide energy in the chosen area. The market was centralised and regulated by the government, which set the energy price. Looking {{for the possibility of}} choosing an energy producer providing lower prices, the clients have been urging changes in the energy trade. The government is also trying to deregulate the energy market and make it more competitive by creating the power exchanges, on which trading is much easier and effective in many countries. In Poland on 7 December 1999, there was established the Polish Power Exchange. Its aim is to increase the efficiency of the Polish energy-sector, adjust it to competitive conditions and the requirements of the European Union and to minimise the costs of leading the business. However energy trading in Poland has met many problems, i. e. (a) the existence of long-term contracts, which prevent the <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> and continue strengthening the monopoly position of the Polish Power Grid Company (PSE SA) (Transmitting-System Operator), (b) the lack of co-ordinated actions to provide the third-party access to the grid (third-party access principle), which means opening the electric-energy market to final consumers (thereby each recipient can choose the energy producer, who offers the best price and terms of delivery), (c) ineffective Balancing Market (which is a 24 h market). All these difficulties cause that the turn-over on the Polish Power Exchange to be relatively low compared with other countries. Solutions will be proposed in this paper which can promote the liberalisation of the energy trade both from conventional and renewable sources.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{electricity}} <b>market</b> changed <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> operation {{not only}} for the power industry, but also for related sectors. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particularly sensitive industries in Poland is coal mining, which is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> coal-based structure of electricity generation. As it is more difficult, in <b>the</b> liberalised <b>market,</b> to burden consumers with all the costs, electricity producers are eager to transfer <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> operation to <b>the</b> suppliers. That increases uncertainty about <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hard coal industry. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this paper was to quantitatively estimate <b>the</b> impact that <b>liberalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electricity <b>markets</b> may have on the coal mining sector in Poland.
