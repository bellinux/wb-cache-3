5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices even when the computer is switched off. Normally, when a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from charging. Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even when the computer is off. On <b>laptops,</b> charging devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most <b>laptops</b> have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even when no laptop is present.|$|E

50|$|A laptop/notebook cooler, cooler pad or chill mat is an {{accessory}} for <b>laptop</b> computers that helps reduce their operating temperature, which is normally used when the <b>laptop</b> {{is unable to}} sufficiently cool itself. <b>Laptop</b> coolers are intended to protect both the <b>laptop</b> from overheating and the user from suffering heat related discomfort. A cooling pad may house active or passive cooling methods and rests beneath the <b>laptop.</b> Active coolers move air or liquid to direct heat away from the <b>laptop</b> quickly, while passive methods may rely on thermally conductive materials or increasing passive airflow.|$|R
50|$|A common {{practical}} {{solution to this}} problem is to place the <b>laptop</b> on a table or desk, or to use a book or pillow between the body and the <b>laptop.</b> Another solution is to obtain a cooling unit for the <b>laptop.</b> These are usually USB powered and consist of a hard thin plastic case housing one, two, or three cooling fans - with the entire assembly designed to sit under the <b>laptop</b> in question - which results in the <b>laptop</b> remaining cool to the touch, and greatly reduces <b>laptop</b> heat buildup.|$|R
