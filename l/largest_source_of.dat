5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the <b>largest</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops were fighting the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E

5|$|In Research Infosource's Decade in Review, McMaster was {{designated}} as the top Canadian performer in university research income growth from 1999 to 2009 in the medical doctoral category and as the second-top performer in research intensity growth for the same period. With a total sponsored research income of $324.624 million in 2015, McMaster has the eighth largest sponsored research income in the country. In the same year, Research Infosource ranked McMaster as the second most research intensive university {{in the country with}} an average research income of C$358,300 per full-time faculty member, the second highest average in the country. Its research activities exceed those of universities twice its size. The federal government is the <b>largest</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> funding, providing 54 percent of McMaster's research budget, primarily through grants. Corporate research income account for 35 percent of the overall research budget.|$|E

Mexico is the United States's <b>largest</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> coffee imports and Oaxaca and Chiapas are the largest coffee growing regions in Mexico. Like the impact in El Tomatal, Rick's effects were much worse than Pauline's because Rick threatened the coffee crop when the beans were more susceptible to winds that could blow them off.|$|E

However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

The surge in drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale since 2008 has generated both economic benefits and environmental concerns—and thus, considerable controversy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>largest</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> wealth for Plymouth Colony was the fur trade.

The colonists attempted to supplement their income by fishing; the waters in Cape Cod bay were known to be excellent fisheries. However, they lacked any skill in this area, and it did little to relieve their economic hardship. The colony traded throughout the region, establishing trading posts as far away as Penobscot, Maine. They were also frequent trading partners with the Dutch at New Amsterdam.|$|E
