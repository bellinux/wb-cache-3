60|$|Mr. Sumner {{was broken}} down by his loss. He sat in his private office {{nearly all of the}} {{remainder}} of the day, his head resting in his hands. Mr. Allen went off on business, and Hardwick stuck to his books as if his <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

40|$|Her <b>Life</b> <b>Depends</b> <b>On</b> <b>It</b> III is the Women's Sports Foundation's {{comprehensive}} report that reviews existing and emerging {{research on the}} links between participation in sport and physical activity and the health and wellbeing of American girls and women. As with the previous editions in 2004 and 2009, this study also confirms that physical activity and sport provides the critical foundation, in no small part, that allows girls and women to lead healthy, strong, and fulfilled lives. Ten years since its first publication, the updated Her <b>Life</b> <b>Depends</b> <b>On</b> <b>It</b> provides an even more comprehensive review of the ever-expanding body of research that demonstrates {{how important it is}} for girls and women to participate in sport and physical activity. The report's contents reflect the review of 1, 500 studies, nearly 400 covered since the previous edition...|$|R
5|$|Due to the stuffy {{atmosphere}} and vapors {{in the dark}} and cramped hold, Pym becomes increasingly comatose and delirious over the days. He can't communicate with Augustus, and the promised supplies fail to arrive, so Pym runs out of water. In the course of his ordeal, he discovers a letter written in blood attached to his dog Tiger, warning Pym to remain hidden, as his <b>life</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

60|$|At that moment, {{strange to}} say, {{thoughts}} {{of my mother}} came into my mind, {{but there was no}} time to be lost, and I threw myself, with a good deal of energy, into the first boat that was lowered, and pulled at the oar as if my own <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would give}} a good deal," [...] Sir Giles Trevor said, [...] "if I could follow your example, and shut myself up for nine months with an infidel to study his language; but I could not do it if my <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> I should throw myself off the wall {{at the end of}} the first fortnight." ...|$|E

60|$|The wrecked crew {{are quick}} {{as well as}} intelligent. <b>Life</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it!</b> They fasten {{the end of the}} hawser, as directed, about two feet above the place where the tail-block is fixed to the stump of the mast. There is much {{shouting}} and gratuitous advice, no doubt, from the forward and the excited, but the captain and mate are cool. They attend to duty and pay no regard to any one.|$|R

60|$|That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage {{down as if}} his <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat {{from his}} three hands.

6000|$|With us three lads {{to lend a}} hand, the {{struggle}} was soon brought to an end, and when we had bound and gagged the stranger so securely {{that he could not}} have made the slightest sound had his <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> I turned to Silas, crushing his hands in mine as I cried, giving no heed to the possibility that there might be more enemies on the outside: ...|$|E
60|$|At {{that instant}} {{there was a}} shout in the village, so loud that we knew the escape was discovered.

They are to go by the forest road.--There, thou canst not doubt my friendship for thee, for now my life is in thy hands! Haste, thou hast no chance against such odds.

6000|$|Aunt Plumy {{produced}} the [...] "camphire" [...] {{the moment she}} saw Sophie's pale face, and made her lie down, while the brave old lady trudged briskly off with bandages and brandy {{to the scene of}} action. On her return she brought comfortable news of the man, so the little flurry blew over and was forgotten by all but Sophie, who remained pale and quiet all the evening, tying evergreen as if her <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|We {{were not}} left long in doubt. The orchard gate flew open and Felix was among us. One glimpse {{of his face}} {{told us that he}} was no bearer of glad tidings. He had been running hard and should have been rubicund. Instead, he was [...] "as pale as are the dead." [...] I could not have asked him what was the matter had my <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> It was Felicity who demanded impatiently of my shaking, voiceless brother: ...|$|E

"For you see, Nigel," [...] {{the captain}} had said, [...] "it's all very well to use breech-loaders when you've got towns and {{railways}} and suchlike to supply you wi' cartridges, but when you've got to cruise in out-o'-the-way waters, there's nothin' like the old style. It's not difficult to carry a few thousand percussion-caps an' a bullet-mould about wi' you wherever you go. As to powder, why, you'll come across that 'most everywhere, an' lead too; and, for the matter o' that, if your <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> you could shove a handful of gravel or a pen-knife or tooth-pick into your gun an' blaze away, but with a breech-loader, if you run out o' cartridges, where are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A man's <b>life</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> Mr. Camperdown," [...] {{said the}} barrister. [...] "It isn't {{a matter of}} cross-examination. If I bring that coat into court I must make a charge against another man by {{the very act of}} doing so. And I will not do so unless I believe that other man to be guilty. It's an inquiry I can't {{postpone}} till we are before the jury. It isn't that I want to trump up a case against another man for the sake of extricating my client on a false issue. Lord Fawn doesn't want to hang Mr. Finn if Mr. Finn be not guilty." ...|$|R

[...] At Christian Music Zine, Joshua Andre told that [...] "while Tim {{may not have}} mastered the up-tempo songs well in this track list, the ballads are where he shines as an artist." [...] The Phantom Tollbooth's Derek Walker said that [...] "The music may have as much variety as his name, but this does have some better lyrical content than the average." ...|$|R

60|$|Having {{disposed}} of this culprit, the bachelor turned to another, and {{from him to}} another, and so on through the whole array, laying, for their wholesome restriction within due bounds, the same cutting emphasis on such of their propensities as were dearest to his heart and were unquestionably referrable to his own precept and example. Thoroughly persuaded, in the end, {{that he had made}} them miserable by his severity, he dismissed them with a small present, and an admonition to walk quietly home, without any leapings, scufflings, or turnings out of the way; which injunction, he informed the schoolmaster in the same audible confidence, he did not think he could have obeyed when he was a boy, had his <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, I'm not {{surprised}} at that for there's many things ye don't know, Crossby; besides, no ghost {{with the smallest}} taste of propriety about it would condescind to spake wid you. Well, boys, that's what the ghost said in a muffled vice--their vices are muffled, you know, an their virtues too, for all I know to the contrairy. It's a good sentiment is that `Now or niver' for every wan of ye--so ye may putt it in yer pipes an' smoke it, an' those of ye who haven't got pipes can make a quid of it an' chaw it, or subject it to meditation. `Now or niver!' Think o' that! You see I'm partikler about it, for the whole story turns on that pint, as the ghost's <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> but ye'll see an' onderstan' better whin I {{come to the end}} o' the story." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dreamed that}} I {{was back at}} Penrith again, {{and was trying to}} get round the church, which had altered its shape very much since I last saw it, and was cloven all {{down the middle of the}} steeple in a most {{singular}} manner. Why I wanted to get round the church I don't know; but I was as anxious to do it as if my <b>life</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> Indeed, I believe it did in the dream. For all that, I could not get round the church. I was still trying, when I came against it with a violent shock, and was flung out of my cot against the ship's side. Shrieks and a terrific outcry struck me far harder than the bruising timbers, and amidst sounds of grinding and crashing, and a heavy rushing and breaking of water--sounds I understood too well--I made my way on deck. It was not an easy thing to do, for the ship heeled over frightfully, and was beating in a furious manner.|$|E
60|$|She {{struggled}} to her feet; her knees shook under her: {{for the moment}} {{she could not have}} moved if her very <b>life</b> had <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> So she stood still, propped against the table, her hands clutching convulsively at its edge for support, and her eyes dilated and staring, still searching round the room wildly for the key.|$|R
50|$|In September 2012 at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was {{announced}} that the film's rights have been purchased by the production company Emmett/Furla Films headed by Randall Emmett and George Furla. The movie also got a working title Fair Trade with the producers reportedly offering the main role to Liam Neeson. The main plotline was also modified for the American audience. Warren is down on his luck and works as a limo driver, despite having a master's degree. When his son has a seizure and needs surgery, he learns that the insurance company will not cover it. With no money, a mysterious man approaches with a deal: he will pay for the child's surgery if the driver kills a mobster. Warren at first refuses, but reconsiders once he realizes his child's <b>life</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
40|$|World Wide Web {{has become}} a good source {{for any kind of}} {{information}}. People of all walks of <b>life</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> for their information retrieval through queries. However users get huge number of records or recommendations. It causes problem to users as they do not see the intended results immediately. Instead they have to spend some time browsing for intended content. This kind of user experience is not good. For this reason {{there is a need for}} improving recommender systems. Ranking is one of the techniques for improving search results. Many ranking techniques came into existence. The recommender systems are using them. In this paper we propose a re-ranking algorithm that improves the ranked results that will give rich user experience. We build a prototype to show the efficiency of the proposed approach. The empirical results revealed that the application is very useful...|$|R
