5000|$|Kinkaid {{was part}} of the Constellation carrier battle group, as Constellation officially {{relieved}} [...] in the Persian Gulf in September 1999. The Constellation carrier battle group then spent the next 10 weeks in the Persian Gulf and conducted maritime interception operation boardings as well as flew combat air patrols over the Iraqi no-fly zones in support of Operation Southern Watch. During the period, Kinkaid rescued the merchant vessel Sima Star, a container ship, from sinking 70 mi off the coast of Bahrain after taking on over 40 tons of water. Kinkaid sailors dewatered the fully <b>loaded</b> <b>container</b> ship, which was listing 15 degrees to the port side. After seven hours of battling poor ventilation and flooding below decks, Kinkaids rescue and assistance team was able to return the Sima Star to a five-degree list, allowing its crew to sail into Bahrain the following Monday morning for repairs. Kinkaid returned home on 17 December 1999, after a six-months deployment. During its 10-week patrol in the Persian Gulf region, the Constellation carrier battle group flew more than 5,000 casualty-free sorties, including nearly 1,300 in support of Operation Southern Watch. These flights included nine separate combat strikes and more than 43 tons of ordnance expended on various Iraqi air defense sites in response to Iraqi aggression against coalition aircraft.|$|E

30|$|Those papers {{assume that}} trucks can only {{transport}} one container at a time, {{as shown in}} the column container per truck of Table  1, whereas, in our case study, some trucks can carry up to two containers. As a result, our drayage problem is more difficult to solve owing to its combinatorial characteristics: a truck with a single container moves one loaded or one empty container, whereas a truck with two containers moves two loaded containers or two empty containers or one <b>loaded</b> <b>container</b> and one empty container. The distribution of more-than-one container per truck by different types of vehicles has received attention only very recently [e.g., Zhang et al. (2015); Vidovic et al. (2017)], and only Lai et al. (2013, 2015) and Funke and Kopfer (2016) investigated both multiple containers per truck and stay-with operations.|$|E

40|$|In {{container}} shipping industry inter-firm {{agreements are}} becoming progressively popular as ship-owners share their slot capacity with commercial partners {{in order to}} have fully <b>loaded</b> <b>container</b> ships and reduce financial risk. This manuscript focuses on the co-operative agreements among shipping firms, i. e. vessel sharing and slot charter agreements within consortia and strategic alliances. Through a quantitative approach based on network and OLS regression analysis, we scrutinise the propensity to co-operate, the geographic extent and leveraging effect generated by this commercial practise on the container-shipping industry. Results show that carriers, usually regarded as independent, are instead fairly co-operative, especially when involved in trade lanes originating from the Far East. Finally, we show that carriers increase their commercial objectives by leveraging the operated fleet capacity. We conclude with some implications for managers and practitioners as well as a discussion on limitations and future extensions of this study...|$|E
40|$|The routing and {{scheduling}} of vehicles and their crews {{is an area}} of increasing importance. In this paper, we describe a large scale vehicle scheduling and routing problem which is of great importance to parcel distribution companies. We devise a Breeder Genetic Algorithm capable of dealing with up to 10, 000 transportation requests to be serviced by an inhomogeneous fleet of vehicles within a 24 hour time interval. A transportation request is defined as the task to move a <b>loaded</b> <b>container</b> from one depot to another. Since the depots do not send out the same number of containers as they receive, the amount of empty containers available at the depots has to be balanced. The optimization task, therefore, is twofold: determine appropriate balance tours and find a low cost schedule for the fleet of vehicles. 1 INTRODUCTION The routing {{and scheduling}} of vehicles and their crews {{is an area of}} increasing importance.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{develops}} {{a mathematical model}} to quantify the market share of given freight transport corridor. By analysing {{the whole process of}} door to door freight transport, the generalized cost model of railway and highway is established, respectively. A case study of long-distance transport in China's inland cities is subsequently conducted to explore market share of railway and highway. At last, the sensitivity of influence factors is analysed. We find that the average train speed, waiting time to be <b>loaded,</b> <b>container</b> volume and transport distance can significant affect the railway market share. The railway market share increases as the average train speed, container volume and transport distance increase, while decreases as the time waiting to be loaded increases. When the average trains speed is over 50 km/h, or the time waiting to be loaded is less than 1. 5 d, railway market share is over 50 %. Moreover, railway is more competitive in high capacity and long-distance freight transport. We also find that the result of single factor's change is limit, while the change of multi-factors can affect the railway market share greatly...|$|E

40|$|High-energy {{monoenergetic}} {{gamma rays}} (6. 13 and 7. 12 MeV) from {{the decay of}} excited states of the {sup 16 }O* nucleus are highly penetrating and thus offer potential for non-intrusive inspection of loaded containers for narcotics, explosives, and other contraband items. These excited states can be produced by irradiation of water with 14 -MeV neutrons from a DT neutron generator or through the {sup 19 }F(p,{alpha}) {sup 16 }O* reaction. Resonances in {sup 19 }F(p,{alpha}) {sup 16 }O* at proton energies between 340 keV and 2 MeV allow use of a low-energy accelerator to provide a compact, portable gamma source of reasonable intensity. The present work provides estimates of gamma source parameters and suggests how various types of contraband could be detected. Gamma rays {{can be used to}} perform transmission or emission radiography of containers or other objects. Through the use of ({gamma}, n) and ({gamma}, fission) reactions, this technique is also capable of detecting special nuclear materials such as deuterium, lithium, beryllium, uranium, and plutonium.

40|$|Several recent {{series of}} {{investigations}} {{were conducted on}} corrugated board performance in the areas of: <b>loaded</b> <b>container</b> endurance in cyclic humidity, predictive models for edge compression strength (ECT), effects of lightweight facings, measurement of transverse shear rigidity, effects of adhesive level, and out-of-plane crushing on ECT. The course of this program prompted exploration and review of several aspects of ECT testing methods: specimen height, test duration, and fixture-clamping effects. In this review, ECT values are shown {{to be influenced by}} the combination of the selected testing technique with the specific structural and strength characteristics of the board being tested. The effect of specimen height on selected single wall C-, E-, F-, and N-flute boards is measured and rationalized using a simplified beam-theory approach. Apparent loss of ECT in a C-flute crushed board is explored to determine whether mitigation is possible by selection or modification of testing method. Investigations of platen speed effects on C-flute substantiate previous work. Lightweight facings on A- and C-flute corrugated boards are observed to display localized buckling, which affects the ECT value. An analytical model that combines the measured bending stiffness of the facings and the compression strengths of the fluting and facings provides an improved predictive accuracy and is applied to a series of laboratory and commercial corrugated boards...|$|E
