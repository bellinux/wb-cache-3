50|$|The {{sanctuary}} area {{is covered}} by various forest types, depending on altitude, including dry evergreen forests, hill evergreen forests, coniferous forests, deciduous dipterocarp forests, and meadows. It is the home {{to a number of}} endangered species of animals, such as <b>long-tailed</b> <b>gorals</b> (Naemorhedus caudatus), Sumatran serows (Capricornis sumatraensis), Asian golden cats (Catopuma temminckii), and big-headed turtles (Platysternon megacephalum). Deignan's babblers (Stachyridopsis rodolphei) and Huia melasma are endemic to this area.|$|R
50|$|Eliminating {{poaching}} will be difficult, {{since the}} most common reason is sustenance hunting. Increasing ecotourism would bring money to the poachers, so {{they would not have}} to further exploit the goral population. Captive populations in zoos are healthy, so reintroduction of this species is possible. The goral has been on the endangered species list for some time, but the species' conservation status has not changed. As long as the population continues to decline, the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral's</b> outlook is not a healthy one.|$|R

50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> is {{protected}} under Appendix I of CITES, and numerous reserves have been set aside, {{but they are not}} the main focus of the reserves; however, they are protected when they are on these properties. In China, the <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> is a Class II species, meaning it {{is protected}}. It is poorly enforced because of the animals' uses in traditional medicine. The only conservation effort is bringing these animals into captivity within the zoo system, which should prevent it from going extinct. Poaching of wild gorals is increasing; they are poached for their fur, meat, and horns. They are also poached because some of their parts are used in traditional medicine. Their natural predators are also affecting the population. Their predators include lynx, snow leopards, tigers, and wolves in some regions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> (also {{known as}} the Chinese gray goral) was and is sparsely found in the wild {{throughout}} China, Russia, and Korea, {{as well as the}} Himalayas. The main population in the wild today is found in Russia where there is a population of about 600 which is in decline; in other places the populations are below 200.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese goral (Nemorhaedus griseus), {{also known}} as the grey <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral,</b> is a species of goral, a small goat-like ungulate, native to mountainous regions of Myanmar, China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and {{possibly}} Laos. In some parts of its range, it is overhunted. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as a [...] "vulnerable species".|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> or Amur goral (Naemorhedus caudatus) is {{a species}} of wild goat found in the {{mountains}} of eastern and northern Asia, including Russia, China, and Korea. A population of this species exists in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, near the tracks of the Donghae Bukbu Line. The species is classified as endangered in South Korea, with an estimated population less than 250. It has been designated South Korean natural monument 217. In 2003, the species was reported as being present in Arunachal Pradesh, in northeast India.|$|E
50|$|The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> appears {{very similar}} to goats. Males can weigh 62-93 lbs and females 49-77 lbs. Lengths can vary {{anywhere}} from 32 to 51 inches and shoulder height 20-31 inches. They are even-toed ungulates of the goat-antelope family. The tips of their horns curve back and have distinct rings. There are openings between their hooves. The face of a goral is flat {{like that of a}} serow, and the nose and eyes are very close together. It has brown fur with shades of gray; the outer fur is long. The bushy tail is usually dark brown or black in color. Females usually are lighter in shade than that of males; their horns are smaller than males' horns.|$|E
50|$|The {{largest of}} these goat {{antelope}} is the takin, {{a relative of}} the musk ox. It lives in highlands from the eastern foothills of the Himalayas to the Qinling and shares habitat with the giant panda in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The takin is a Class I protected species.Serows are smaller than takins but significantly larger than gorals. Both serows and gorals live in rainy mountainous regions and are excellent climbers. Serows have shorter and coarser wool than gorals. The mainland serow is spread across southern China. The range of the Chinese goral is even broader, extending to Korea in the northeast. The <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> lives in the northeast, along the borders with Russia and North Korea. The Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, and red goral are found in southern Tibet. The Taiwan serow is endemic to Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The {{geographic}} location of Primorye {{accounts for the}} variety of its flora. The territory of Primorye has not been subjected to the ice cover in the past. In difference {{from the rest of}} Siberia in the ice ages. This circumstance, as well as the specifics of the geographical situation and the specific features of climate, determine the unique, diversity of the plant world at species and cenotic levels and the richness of plant resources. In the flora of Primorye there are more than two thousand species of higher plants, of which about 250 species of trees, bushes and ligneous lianas. Flora of mosses and lichens is very diverse. As part of the coastal flora, there are many valuable medicinal, technical and food plants, many relict and endemic species. About 200 species are listed in the IUCN Red List, as rare and threatened extermination.There are mountainous tundra areas, conifers and coniferous-deciduous forests, and forest-steppe, which is sometimes called the Far Eastern Prairie, where many ancient plant species have been preserved, including ferns, lotus, and the Chosenia willow. The flora of the territory contains such plants as Taxus cuspidata, Juniperus rigida, Phellodendron amurense, Kalopanax, Aralia elata, Maackia amurensis, Alnus japonica, Actinidia kolomikta, Schisandra chinensis, Celastrus orbiculatus, Thladiantha dubia, Weigela, Eleutherococcus, Flueggea suffruticosa, Deutzia, Nelumbo nucifera, Betula schmidtii, Carpinus cordata, Acer mandshuricum, Parthenocissus tricuspidata, Vitis amurensis, Panax ginseng and many others.The fauna of Primorye is also diverse. The following animals are found in the Krai: Ussuri black bear (Ursus thibetanus), Amur tiger, Amur leopard, lynx, wild boar, Manchurian deer (Cervus elaphus xanthopygos), Siberian roe deer, musk deer, <b>long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> (Naemorhedus caudatus), sika deer, sable, Blakiston's fish owl, mandarinka duck (Aix galericulata), black stork (Ciconia nigra), scaly goosander (Mergus squamatus), chestnut-cheeked starling (Sturnia philippensis), black griffon (Aegypius monachus), large-winged cuckoo (Cuculidae family), and others. Among 690 species of birds inhabiting the territory of the former USSR, 350 are found in Primorye. Rich fisheries of salmon, Hucho taimen, lenok and marine fisheries of crab, pollock and other species make the aquatic and maritime environment a valuable resource for the region. However, the rich diversity of wildlife in Primorye is threatened by poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Wildlife Conservation Society, World Wildlife Fund, Wild Salmon Center, and Russian NGOs including Phoenix Fund are active in the region's wildlife and habitat conservation.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Long-tailed</b> <b>goral</b> (Naemorhedus caudatus) {{is a rare}} {{mountain}} {{ungulate animal}} species with a mosaic range. In the Sikhote-Alin Reserve, the goral {{is located at the}} northern limit of its distribution. The main part of its population is concentrated in the coastal area, in the Abrek natural landmark. In the early XX century, the goral occupied another small area along the coast – 20 km south of the Abrek natural landmark. Currently, the total area of species' habitats is only 7. 1 km 2. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the population size, population density and some demographic parameters of the goral population. Also, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the photo-trap method which is a new approach to the study and monitoring of this rare species. Accounting studies in the Abrek natural landmark were carried out in October 2014 – January 2015 (1401 trap-days); also, at the same time we worked in the second area during three seasons (2014 – 2017, 1326 trap-days). Estimation of the abundance and annual survival of the goral has been carried out using stochastic «capture – recapture» models presented in the software MARK. In the Abrek natural landmark for an effective area of 4 km 2 (63 % of this habitat's area), the average density of the goral population was 15. 4 animals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 14. 6 – 18. 2 individuals per km 2), in the second area (0. 7 km 2) completely accounted – 21. 0 individuals per km 2 (CI 95 % = 20. 1 – 28. 6 individuals per km 2). The total abundance of goral individuals in the Reserve remains, apparently, at the level of the late 1980 s. And currently it is about 110 – 140 individuals. According to our preliminary data, the total annual survival in the first year was 0. 73 (CI 95 % = 0. 41 – 0. 91), and by the end of the second year it was 0. 72 (CI 95 % = 0. 31 – 0. 93). Female animals have prevailed in the population structure, and the sex ratio for adult animals was 1 : 1. 5. The fertility rate was 0. 61. In comparison with the data obtained in the late 1970 s, currently the age and sex structure of the goral population has changed somewhat, and the rate of reproduction has decreased. The use of photo-traps significantly improves the quality of the goral population monitoring. However, photo-trap monitoring is a fairly expensive and time-consuming process. So it is advisable to apply this method in habitats which are most important for conservation of this rare species...|$|E
