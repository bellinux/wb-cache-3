40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with determining the effects that <b>video</b> display <b>terminal</b> use had on reporters' and editors' attitudes toward their jobs and the machines themselves. Data for this investigation were obtained with questionnaires returned from seventy-one reporters and editors who use <b>video</b> <b>terminals</b> in their daily work. Questionnaire data were supplemented with interview data from thirteen questionnaire respondents, Ten hypotheses in five categories were tested with the t test. Four additional hypotheses were tested with raw data. Findings showed that <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> use enhanced perceived job professionalism and made respondents think they should make more money. Attitudes toward <b>video</b> <b>terminals</b> improved after use of the devices, and respondents recognized the value of <b>video</b> <b>terminal</b> training in college...|$|R
