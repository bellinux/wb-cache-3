30|$|Micro-displacement {{measurement}} {{based on}} self-mixing interference using a fiber laser system was demonstrated. The sinusoidal phase modulation technique was {{introduced into the}} fiber <b>laser</b> <b>self-mixing</b> interference measurement system to improve the measurement resolution. The phase could be demodulated by the Fourier analysis method. Error sources were evaluated in detail, and the system was experimentally applied to reconstruct the motion of a high-precision commercial piezoelectric ceramic transducer (PZT). The displacement measurement resolution was well beyond a half-wavelength. It provides a practical solution for displacement measurement based on all optical-fiber sensing applications with high precision.|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>laser</b> <b>self-mixing</b> {{process in the}} Gaussian beam {{approximation}} and reformulate {{the expression of the}} feedback coefficient C in terms of the effective feedback power coupled back into the laser diode. Our model predicts a twenty-fold increase of the ratio between the maximum and the minimum measurable displacements judged against the current plane-wave model. By comparing the interaction of collimated or diverging Gaussian laser beams with a plane mirror target, we demonstrate that diverging beams tolerate larger wobbling during the target displacement and allow for measurement of off-axis target rotations up to the beam angular width. A novel method for reconstructing the phase front of the Gaussian beam by self-mixing scanning measurements is also presented...|$|R

40|$|A Doppler {{velocimeter}} exploiting a <b>self-mixing</b> <b>laser</b> diode is proposed. The {{system has}} been design to evaluate the retinal blood flow velocity. The central frequency of the Doppler band obtained from the <b>self-mixing</b> <b>laser</b> diode measurement {{is related to the}} blood flow velocity in the vessel under test. The measurement can be done under the light-intensity feedback ratio below - 100 dB without using highly sensitive electronics since the laser acts as a high-efficiency mixer oscillator and a shot-noise-limited quantum detector. The advantages in adopting such technique consist in its low cost, easiness of implementation and small size. Moreover, the <b>self-mixing</b> <b>laser</b> diode method offers the advantage to have the excitation and measurement beams spatially overlapped overcoming the alignment difficulty due to limited optical accessibility imposed by the finite aperture of the pupil...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a novel {{velocimeter}} {{based on}} <b>laser</b> <b>self-mixing</b> Doppler {{technology has been}} developed for speed measurement. The laser employed in our experiment is a distributed feedback (DFB) fiber laser, which is an all-fiber structure using only one Fiber Bragg Grating to realize optical feedback and wavelength selection. Self-mixing interference for optical velocity sensing is experimentally investigated in this novel system, and the experimental {{results show that the}} Doppler frequency is linearly proportional to the velocity of a moving target, which agrees with the theoretical analysis commendably. In our experimental system, the velocity measurement can be achieved in the range of 3. 58 mm/s– 2216 mm/s with a relative error under one percent, demonstrating that our novel all-fiber configuration velocimeter can implement wide-range velocity measurements with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Self-mixing {{based on}} vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) offers a compact and {{low-cost}} coherent detection scheme for interferometric accessible measurements. The direct detection {{of the change}} in the junction voltage, in contrast to the traditional optical detection method by means of an external photodiode, further simplifies the setup by adding detector-less capability. The linewidth of an NIR VCSEL was estimated by using the method based on the statistical analysis of the <b>laser</b> <b>self-mixing</b> fringe period in the moderate feedback regime. We investigate the junction voltage noise and optical power noise, simultaneously acquired, in order to establish the best operational condition for both detection schemes. When comparing the laser linewidth measured by the traditional optical power modulation with that of the detector-less voltage self-mixing signal, the agreement is within the experimental errors...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA novel {{method for}} real time {{velocity}} measurement is proposed. All-fiber laser measurement system is built by an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). The measuring principle {{is based on}} <b>laser</b> <b>self-mixing</b> speckle, modulations of laser output caused by the optical feedback from an outer moving object. The generation of speckle signal is theoretically analyzed and experimentally obtained. A Labview programme is developed for waveform acquisition, noise reduction and numeric calculation. The signal processing shows a linear relationship between the energy density of speckle signal and the velocity of the moving object. In the experiments of real time velocity measurement by a rotating aluminum plate, we obtained measurement error less than 4. 1 % {{in the range of}} velocity from 234 to 508 mm/s. The study indicates that the all-fiber self-mixing speckle system can be applied in remote velocity sensing and measurement...|$|R
