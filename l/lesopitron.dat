50|$|<b>Lesopitron</b> (E-4424) is a {{selective}} full agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor which is structurally {{related to the}} azapirones. In 2001 it was under development by Esteve as an anxiolytic {{for the treatment of}} generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It made it to phase II clinical trials but was apparently discontinued as no new information on <b>lesopitron</b> has surfaced since.|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 {{receptor}} antagonists {{to modify the}} disinhibitory profile of diazepam and other agents was investigated in male BKW mice in the light/dark test box. The 5 -HT 2 A/ 2 B/ 2 C receptor antagonists ritanserin, MDL 11939 and RP 62203 and also methysergide, which failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone, caused dose-related enhancements (4 to 8 fold) in the potency of diazepam to disinhibit behavioural responding to the aversive situation of the test box. Ritanserin was shown to enhance the disinhibitory potency of other benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (4 fold), temazepam (10 fold) and lorazepam (10 fold), the 5 -HT 1 A receptor ligands, 8 -OH-DPAT (25 fold), buspirone (100 fold) and <b>lesopitron</b> (500 fold), the 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron (100 fold) R(+) -zacopride (100 fold) and S(−) -zacopride (greater than a 1000 fold), the substituted benzamides, sulpiride (10 fold) and tiapride (5 to 10 fold) and the cholecystokinin (CCK) A receptor antagonist, devazepide (100 fold). It also reduced the onset of action of disinhibition following treatment with the 5 -HT synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Ritanserin failed to enhance the disinhibitory effects of the CCKB receptor antagonist CI- 988, the angiotensin AT 1 receptor antagonist losarten or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ceranapril. The 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists SDZ 205 - 557, GR 113808 and SB 204070 caused dose-related reductions in the disinhibitory effect of diazepam, returning values to those shown in vehicle treated controls. The antagonists failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone. GR 113808 was also shown to cause a dose-related antagonism of the disinhibitory effects of chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, 8 -OH-DPAT, buspirone, <b>lesopitron,</b> ondansetron, R(+) -zacopride, sulpiride, tiapride, devazepide, CI- 988, losarten, ceranapril and parachlorophenylalanine. It was concluded that in BKW mice (a) the failure of 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists when administered alone to modify behaviour in the light/dark test indicates an absence of an endogenous 5 -HT tone at the 5 -HT 2 and 5 -HT 4 receptors and (b) the enhancement by the 5 -HT 2 receptor antagonists and attenuation by the 5 -HT 4 receptor antagonists of drug-induced disinhibition indicates a plurality of 5 -HT receptor involvement in the mediation of drug-induced disinhibitory profiles in the mouse...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} 5 -HT 1 A antagonist {{properties of}} the ß-antagonist tertatolol were assessed using biochemical and electrophysiological assays in the rat. (±) Tertatolol bound with high affinity (Ki = 38 nM) to 5 -HT 1 A sites labelled by [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes. The (–) stereoisomer (Ki = 18 nM) was about 50 -fold more potent than the (+) stereoisomer (Ki = 864 nM) to inhibit the specific binding of [3 H]- 8 -OHDPAT. As expected of a 5 -HT 1 A antagonist, (–) tertatolol prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (Ki = 24 nM) the inhibitory effect of 8 -OH-DPAT on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal homogenates. Furthermore in vivo pretreatment with (–) tertatolol (5 mg/kg s. c.) significantly reduced the inhibitory influence of 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 3 mg/ kg s. c.) on the accumulation of 5 -hydroxytryptophan in various brain areas after the blockade of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase by NSD- 1015 (100 mg/kg i. p.). In vitro (in brainstem slices; Ki 50 nM) and in vivo (in chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats; ID 50 0. 40 mg/kg i. v.), (–) tertatolol prevented the inhibitory effects of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists 8 -OH-DPAT, ipsapirone and <b>lesopitron</b> on the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus. In about 25 % of these neurones, the basal firing rate was significantly increased by (–) tertatolol (up to + 47 % in vitro, and + 30 % in vivo). These data indicate that (-) tertatolol is a potent competitive antagonist at both pre (in the dorsal raphe nucleus) - and post (in the hippocampus) - synaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the rat brain...|$|E
