5|$|The main {{entrance}} {{is at the}} south end of the church at the top of some stone steps on either side. A window (shaped, <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others</b> in the church, like a star) set in mosaic is positioned above the door, and there is a stone cross at the top of the facade. The concrete of the church is dressed with stone on the south side, nearest the main road. The ribs on the outside are visible inside the building; in between them, there are patterns of lights and coloured marble panels on the lower parts of the interior walls. The vestry is to the rear of the church, and there is a parish hall, built from masonry, underneath the church. The altar was replaced in 1995 and again on the reopening of the church in 2011, when a carved crucifix, which was brought to Amlwch from a former convent in Liverpool, was also dedicated. The porch houses a sepulchral slab, dating from the latter half of the 13th century.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{the gradual}} {{influence}} of surrounding cultures raised {{the significance of}} the sky-god in a monolatristic manner, the father god [...] "Ukko" [...] (Old Man) was originally just a nature spirit <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others.</b> Of the animals, the most sacred was the bear, whose real name was never uttered out loud, lest his kind be unfavorable to the hunting. The bear ("karhu" [...] in Finnish) was seen as the embodiment of the forefathers, and for this reason it was called by many circumlocutions: mesikämmen ("mead-paw"), otso ("browed one"), kontio ("dweller of the land"), metsän kultaomena ("the golden apple of the forest") but not a god.|$|E
2500|$|Madhubala's {{illness was}} known to Kishore, but <b>like</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his {{son-in-law}} at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: [...] "She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she {{spent most of her}} time." [...] Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: [...] "After marriage they flew to London where the doctor told her she had only two years to live. After that Kishore left her at our house saying: 'I can't look after her. I'm on outdoors often'. But she wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months, though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn't hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.|$|E
