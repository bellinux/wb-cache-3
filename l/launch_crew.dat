[...] Production plants to modify several hundred standard V-1s to Reichenberg R-III manned aircraft were in the woods of Dannenburg and at Pulverhof, with air-launch trials at Lärz and Rechlin. [...] Flight testing was performed by the Luftwaffe at Peenemünde West and, after the August 1943 Operation Hydra bombing, at Brüsterort. [...] <b>Launch</b> <b>crew</b> training was at Zempin, and the headquarters for the operational unit, FR 155(W), [...] was originally based at Saleux, near Amiens, but was subsequently moved [...] to a chateau near Creil ("FlakGruppeCreil"), with the unit's telephone relay station at Doullens.|$|E

Because the ISS had not been visited by a shuttle for an extended period, a larger than planned amount of waste accumulated, temporarily hindering station operations in 2004. However Progress transports and the STS-114 shuttle flight took care of this problem.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} Mars Direct plan, Mars {{exploration}} advocate Robert Zubrin {{and other}} baselined an [...] "inline" [...] SDV concept developed by engineers at NASA and Martin Marietta. The rocket consisted of a large upper stage and payload shroud mounted {{on top of the}} Space Shuttle external tank, and the Orbiter replaced by a simple engine pod. The rocket would <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> and vehicles directly to Mars. The term [...] "Mars Direct" [...] reflected the idea of <b>launching</b> <b>crews</b> and habitats directly to Mars, without assembly or significant loiter in low Earth orbit. NASA's planned Ares V vehicle would superficially resemble this vehicle due to its [...] "inline" [...] setup, although the Mars Direct Ares used side-mounted Space Shuttle Main Engines and a core with the Shuttle External Tank's diameter for greater commonality with Space Shuttle infrastructure.|$|R

He had 2 sons, a son in law and 2 grandsons in the boat.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} upgrades to the Atlas C was the addition of motion detectors in the gyroscope package to ensure proper operation. This was implemented after the first B-series Atlas had failed in flight due to <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> neglecting to power on the gyroscopes and would soon become a standard part of all ballistic missile guidance systems.|$|R
50|$|<b>Launch</b> <b>crews</b> were {{composed}} of four personnel.

All four crewmembers were together responsible for communications, and final responsibility for launch.

5000|$|The 6555th {{also began}} {{developing}} a military launch capability for the Titan I ballistic missile {{program at the}} Cape in 1959. By the spring of 1960, the Titan Operations Division had completed about 50 percent of the training needed to form an all-military Titan <b>launch</b> <b>crew,</b> {{and many of its}} airmen were working with the Martin Company as members of the contractor's Titanfiring teams.|$|E
50|$|The Augmented Target Docking Adapter, to be {{used for}} the Gemini 9A manned mission, was {{successfully}} placed into orbit by an Atlas SLV-3 in June 1966. But when the Gemini crew rendezvoused with it, they discovered the fairing had failed to open and separate, making docking impossible. Two lanyards, which should have been removed before flight, were still in place. The cause was determined to be a <b>launch</b> <b>crew</b> error.|$|E
50|$|DIRECT's re-exploration of the SDLV idea {{began in}} 2006 in {{frustration}} with the high cost and delays of Ares I and worries that any similar issues with the giant Ares V might put the whole Constellation Program in jeopardy.

5000|$|For {{security}} reasons, the Felixstowe <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> {{were referred}} to as a [...] "Boom-defence" [...] unit, a cover story that was partly true as they were put to work maintaining anti-submarine nets when weather conditions were not right for balloon launches. The Felixstowe golf club site had a number of Lewis Guns for anti-aircraft defence, which the WRNS women were trained to operate, occasionally releasing balloons for the purpose of target practice.|$|R
5000|$|In Rockets and People, {{scientist}} and historian Boris Chertok recounted how Voskresenskiy reacted when a missile being tested developed a leak of a supposedly radioactive substance. As others rushed away, he calmly {{walked up to}} the rocket and climbed the gantry. He ran his finger through the liquid, and {{in full view of the}} <b>launch</b> <b>crew,</b> put his finger on his tongue to demonstrate that the substance was harmless. He then called on everyone to return to work.|$|E
5000|$|The Operations Branch's {{participation}} in Titan II launches remained somewhat limited during this period, but its involvement increased significantly during three test flights on 12 September 26 October and 19 December 1962. Finally, on 6 February 1963, the Titan Weapons Division recorded its first USAF crew {{launch of the}} Titan II. The Operations Branch's second shift <b>launch</b> <b>crew</b> completed their Titan II training on 21 August 1963 with a highly successful test flight from Complex 15.|$|E

50|$|Missiles 63D and 84D on September 9 and 11 lost thrust {{and tumbled}} during the {{sustainer}} phase, {{in the first}} case due to a ruptured vernier hydraulic line, in the second due to thrust section overheating. On October 7, Missile 163D exploded at T+75 seconds when the intermediate bulkhead reversed. Postflight investigation found that <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> had loaded the helium bottles with insufficiently chilled gas, resulting in a lack of helium flow to the propellant tanks, which lost pressure during ascent.|$|R
5000|$|Aerodynamic or [...] "winged" [...] missile testing {{dominated}} {{the activities of}} the 6555th for most of the 1950s. The decade witnessed the introduction of the B-61 Matador, SM-62 Snark, IM-99 Bomarc, XSM-64 Navaho and TM-76 Mace aerodynamic missiles, among which the Matador, with over 280 launches to its credit, stood out as the most-launched missile of its era. The Matador was also the 6555th's first full-fledged weapon system program and its initial deployment overseas included military <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> trained at Cape Canaveral AFS.|$|R
50|$|The senior NMCC officer directs {{preparation}} of the launch order {{in the form of}} an Emergency War Order (EWO) - a message that contains the chosen war plan, time to launch, authentication codes and codes needed to unlock the missiles before firing them. A second officer will validate that order. The order is then broadcast to each worldwide command and directly to <b>launch</b> <b>crews</b> by releasing an Emergency Action Message (EAM) which is an encoded and encrypted message about 150 characters long.|$|R
