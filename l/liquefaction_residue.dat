Characterization of the residue from wood liquefaction provides a new approach to understand some fundamental aspects of the liquefaction reaction.

40|$|Direct coal {{liquefaction}} (DCL) {{is a process}} for converting coal to synthetic oils, which can be refined to make transportation fuels. Residue from this process contains inorganic material such as mineral matter originating from the coal and catalysts, and organic matter such as unconverted coal, heavy oils, pre-asphaltenes and asphaltenes. The conversion of these DCL residues to lighter, high-value products {{is an important step}} in helping to make this technology both commercially viable and environmentally acceptable. This paper provides an overview of the physico-chemical characteristics and processing options available for coal <b>liquefaction</b> <b>residues</b> and compares and contrasts them to those of petroleum residues. Residue properties vary considerably, since they are highly dependent on feed coal, process configuration and operating conditions. Determination of composition and structural parameters of products derived from residue conversion can help determine their stability, coking and solvent hydrogen donating ability. Thermal conversion processes such as visbreaking and gasification offer the greatest promise for handling these heavy materials. The conversion chemistry, reactivity and kinetics of residue gasification are not well-understood but are important in optimising hydrogen production for the process. The literature has been comprehensively reviewed to provide characteristics and properties of residues and their potential for conversion. In addition, the potential for producing high-value carbon products from residues is briefly discussed. © 2013...|$|R

Characterization of the <b>residue</b> from wood <b>liquefaction</b> provides a new approach to understand some fundamental aspects of the <b>liquefaction</b> reaction. <b>Residues</b> were characterized by wet chemical analyses, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The Klason lignin content of the residues decreased, while the holocellulose and a-cellulose contents increased as the phenol to wood ratio (P/W) increased. A peak at 1735 cm-', which was attributed to the ester carbony 1 group in xylan, disappeared in the FTIR spectra of the residues from liquefied wood under a sealed reaction sys-tem, indicating significantly different effects of atmospheric versus sealed liquefaction. The crystallinity index of the residues was higher than that of the untreated wood particles and slightly increased with an increase in the P/W ratio. The SEM images of the residues showed that the fiber bundles were reduced to small-sized bundles or even single fibers as the P/W ratio increased from 1 / 1 to 3 / 1, which indicated that the lignin in the middle lamella had been dissolved prior to the cellulose during liquefaction. 63 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Alkylsulfate-based ionic liquids (ILs) were {{synthesized}} {{and used}} as solid-liquid separation solvents to extract asphaltene-type materials from direct coal <b>liquefaction</b> <b>residue</b> (DCLR). Among the ILs employed, tetraethylammonium ethylsulfate ([E 4 N][ESO 4]) was {{proved to be a}} potential solvent for trapping asphaltene-type materials from DCLR due to the higher extraction yield and the lower H/C atomic ratio of the extract. N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) was added to reduce the viscosity of [E 4 N][ESO 4]. It also increased the extraction yield and decreased H/C atomic ratio of the asphaltene-type materials. The mechanism of extraction might be concluded that the interactions are formed between ILs or [E 4 N][ESO 4]/NMP mixed solvents and asphaltene-type materials, which disturbs the interactions between DCLR and leads to the dissolution of asphaltene-type materials into solvents. The obtained asphaltene-type materials possessed low H/C atomic ratios, high aromaticities, no ashes and no quinoline insolubles, which meet the requirements of preparing carbon materials.

For all the unliquefied wood residues, the contents of cellulose decreased, and the residual ratios after TGA pyrolysis and the contents of lignin increased as a function of liquefaction time.

The values for apparent activation energy were lower at 150 minutes and 180 minutes and higher at 25 minutes. Liquefaction time had a smaller effect on the pyrolysis mechanism, as revealed by TGA.

40|$|Asphaltenes {{in direct}} coal <b>liquefaction</b> <b>residue</b> (DCLR) are highly {{aromatic}} and polydisperse mixtures, which are important precursors for producing high value-added carbon materials.

The extracts were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, C- 13 -NMR, quinoline insolubles tests and so on. The results show that asphaltenes with the potential of precursors of carbon materials can be separated from DCLR at room temperature using PILs and the solid-liquid separation is carried out facilely due to the lower viscosities of PILs. The influences of PILs structures on extraction yields and atomic ratios of H/C were also investigated. As alkyl chain length of PILs anions increases, extraction yields of asphaltenes increase while H/C ratios decrease. Moreover, extraction yields vary with various cations of PILs and increase according {{to the order of}} N-methylimidazolium ([MIM](+)) triethylammonium ([TEtA](+)) > 3 -methylpyridinium ([MPy](+)).

Chemical Engineering Department, Sapienza University of Rome, Italy View references (10) Abstract Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) converts biomass into a crude bio-oil by thermally and hydrolytically decomposing the biomacromolecules into smaller compounds. The crude bio-oil, or biocrude, is an energy dense product that can potentially {{be used as a}} substitute for petroleum crudes. Liquefaction also produces gases, solids, and water-soluble compounds that can be converted to obtain valuable chemical species or can be used as energy vectors. The process is usually performed in water at 250 °C- 370 °C and under pressures of 4 - 22 MPa: depending on the adopted pressure and temperature the process can be carried out in sub-critical or super-critical conditions. In the conditions reached in hydrothermal reactors, water changes its properties and acts as a catalyst for the biomass decomposition reactions. One of the main advantages of this process is that the energy expensive biomass-drying step, required in all the thermochemical processes, is not necessary, allowing the use of biomass with high moisture content such as microalgae or olive residue and grape mark. In this work, the feasibility of a hydrothermal process conducted under sub-critical conditions to obtain a bio-oil from the residue of olive oil production is investigated. The experimental tests were performed at 320 °C and about 13 MPa, using a biomass to water weight ratio of 1 : 5. The influence of two different catalysts on the bio-oil yield and quality was investigated: CaO and a zeolite (faujasite-Na). CaO allows the increase of bio-oil yields, while the selected zeolite enhances the deoxygenation reactions, thus improving the bio-oil quality in terms of heating value. © 2016 WIT Press...|$|R
