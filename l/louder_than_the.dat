25|$|The album {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} the critics. The album received two four-and-a-half-star ratings from About.com and New Release Tuesday, which it got one nine-star-out-of-ten rating from Cross Rhythms. The project got three four-star ratings from CCM Magazine, Christian Music Zine and Indie Vision Music.

25|$|After the breakstrain, {{the trio}} is heard again, either {{for one last}} time or and the 2nd (or third) time. If the trio after the breakstrain is the last, it is usually played in the same style as the first trio. Sometimes this trio has added counter-melodies or obbligatos. After this trio, the breakstrain is played again, then moves on to the final trio. The final trio {{is known as the}} grandioso. It is {{typically}} much <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous playing(s) of the trio and utilizes all sections of the band, bringing everything to a close. The grandioso is considered the most exciting section of the march and serves the purpose of instilling the trio melody into the mind of the listener. The grandioso sometimes adds yet another counter-melody or obbligato, such as the one in Stars and Stripes Forever. The last measure of the march sometimes contains a stinger, a I chord played in unison on the upbeat after a quarter rest. Most, but not all, marches carry a stinger; the Semper Fidelis march is a famous march not to have an ending stinger (when not recapitulated {{back to the beginning of}} the march – see below). Most marches end at the volume forte (loud), but an example that doesn't is Sousa's Manhattan Beach, which ends fading away.|$|E

500|$|... "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} between March 1994 and May 1995, with the composition happening in sessions between band members Duke Erikson, Shirley Manson, Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker's basement recording studio, and the recording itself being done {{at their own}} Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. Bass on [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] was played by Mike Kashou, and additional percussion by Pauli Ryan. In the latter stages of the album recording, Garbage mixed [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] twice before it was sent for mastering. At the last minute, Vig decided to increase the mix of the guitar tracks louder; he later claimed that the song still did not sound {{the way he wanted}} it to, in his head. The mixing was noted for Manson's voice being at the same volume level as the instruments, while in mainstream pop the singing is <b>louder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> musical backdrop. The song is written in the key of G# minor, set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, and the chord progression is G#m–F#–E–C#m–E–F# in the verses and C#-F#-A-B in the chorus.|$|E

[...] Davies of <b>Louder</b> <b>Than</b> <b>the</b> Music gave it a three and a half out of five stars, noting that [...] "there is absolutely nothing wrong with this album", which he expects more out of the band, advising that with [...] "a little bit more creativity musically and this could be a really strong album." [...] Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday gave it a four out of five stars, evoking how the album is [...] "filled with songs that both challenge and encourage believers in their walk", and calling it [...] "the best album by Casting Crowns since Lifesong". Bert Gangl of The Phantom Tollbooth gave it a three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album [...] "taken as a whole, the new record, in spite of its intermittent musical tangents – or perhaps because of them – winds up being one of the Crown collective's most cohesive, and impressive, releases to date." [...] Ed Cardinal of Crosswalk.com said the album was [...] "as strong and yet relatively safe as anything it has done before" [...] and praised it as [...] "sure to be among 2011’s most popular and enduring Christian albums".

2500|$|In Barenboim's {{recording}} of The Well-Tempered Clavier, he makes {{frequent use of}} the right-foot sustaining pedal, a device absent from the keyboard instruments of Bach's time (although the harpsichord was highly resonant), producing a sonority {{very different from the}} [...] "dry" [...] and often staccato sound favoured by pianist Glenn Gould.
