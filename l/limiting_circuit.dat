40|$|Abstract | Switching {{noise is}} one of the major sources of timing errors and {{functional}} hazards in logic circuits. It is caused by the cumulative eect of microscopic spu-rious currents present in all devices during logic transitions. These currents are injected into the substrate and in sup-ply lines, resulting in signicant ripple noise. Individually, such micro-currents, do not usually cause catastrophic fail-ures. However, cumulatively, they can impact power supply and substrate potential across the chip. Thus, the electrical behavior of sensitive digital and analog circuits can be sig-ni cantly changed, hence <b>limiting</b> <b>circuit</b> performance. The analysis of switching noise at a macroscopic level requires one to accurately compute models for all microscopic spuri-ous currents, known as noise signatures. The challenge is to simultaneously account for a myriad of parameters and their process variations in a compact and accurate model. To ad-dress this problem, a new methodology based on Response Surface Methodology and Orthogonal Polynomials approxi-mation is being proposed. Experimental results on a 0 : 35 m library show that the methodology is capable of accurately approximating noise signatures with a single analytical for-mula. A library of such formulae has been created and it is being used to accurately characterize switching noise at a macroscopic level. I...|$|E
