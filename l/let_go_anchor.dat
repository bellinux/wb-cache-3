60|$|Just {{as the sun}} had set, Sancho came to {{announce}} that he had <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> an' take soundin's 'll be the nixt order, I s'pose, Captain Muggins?" [...] said Larry, {{touching}} his cap.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} the {{inspiration}} for the book Sweet Killough, <b>Let</b> <b>Go</b> Your <b>Anchor</b> by Irish politician Maurice Hayes, taken from the publication of the same name.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind, <b>let</b> <b>go</b> your <b>anchor,</b> my lad," [...] cried a {{voice from}} the densest quarter of the smoke, [...] "it's not a bad berth, and good holdin' ground." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> and we {{will finish}} the service after it is down," [...] said Temple, rising and taking up the {{telescope}} to examine the groups of people on shore.|$|R
60|$|It was mid-day, {{and high}} {{water in the}} English port for which the Screw was bound, when, borne in gallantly upon the {{fullness}} of the tide, she <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her <b>anchor</b> in the river.|$|R
60|$|However, {{by giving}} no heed {{to what he}} said, we brought the Avenger into position; but I soon saw that the tide was setting us away from the Britisher, and {{suggested}} that we <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nearly {{opposite}} {{to the mouth}} of the Sacramento, on the southern shores of the bay, stands the famous city of San Francisco, close to which the Roving Bess <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her <b>anchor</b> and clasped the golden strand.|$|R
50|$|After {{testimony}} and questioning, {{the men were}} all were promptly acquitted of any wrong-doing, except for Lieutenant Baynes. He was admonished for not reporting the carpenters sighting of land to the west to the captain, or <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> when ordered.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will do it}} myself, David," [...] cried Barnstable, {{struggling}} to conceal his emotion; [...] "I will call on her the instant we <b>let</b> <b>go</b> our <b>anchor</b> in Boston harbor; and as your credit can't be large, I will divide my own purse with her!" ...|$|R
60|$|With {{that he gave}} {{orders to}} prepare to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> but the sound, over which they were gliding slowly before a light wind, was very shallow, and he had {{scarcely}} ceased speaking when the ship struck with considerable violence, and remained fast upon the sand.|$|R
50|$|Each of {{the first}} three novels ends with a member of the party <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> of their <b>anchor</b> and a new member taking hold.|$|R
60|$|The black land grew higher {{until they}} could make out masses of shadowy pines, and {{eventually}} dropping the jib and peak they ran her in behind a point with very thankful hearts and <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor.</b> Half of their task was finished, and they could take their ease until morning broke.|$|R
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} they were near {{enough to see the}} mast of the [...] "Nancy" [...] dimly in the dark. The coxswain {{immediately}} gave the order to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> and veer down towards the wreck. Just as he did so, a terrific sea came rolling towards them like a black mountain.|$|R
60|$|Much had he to say also {{concerning}} the vileness {{of what we}} had to eat--not fit for a dog; besides enlarging upon the imprudence of intrusting the vessel longer to a man of the mate's intemperate habits. With so many sick, too, what could we expect to do in the fishery? It was no use talking; come what come might, the ship must <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Hermann {{and several}} Kanakas were {{crawling}} for'ard {{on hands and}} knees to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the third <b>anchor.</b> Grief touched Captain Warfield and pointed to the Roberta. She was dragging down upon them. Warfield put his mouth to Grief's ear and shouted: ...|$|R
60|$|It seemed {{probable}} {{that when the}} first of the Frenchmen gained the schooner's deck, after the fury of the tempest had forced them to retreat from the stockade, the wild tossing of the craft as the waves were beginning to rise induced them to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> every <b>anchor</b> on board, under the belief that she could be held at moorings until the storm had subsided sufficiently to admit of her clawing away from the shore.|$|R
6000|$|There were no charts {{covered with}} {{soundings}} {{to guide the}} mariner in those days, {{but it did not}} require much experience to convince a seaman that land was probably too near, with such a sudden change from twenty to fifteen fathoms. Arkal was, however, not unprepared for it, and quickly gave orders to stand by to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchors.</b> At that moment the voice of little Maikar was heard shouting, in stentorian tones, [...] "Land ahead!" ...|$|R
60|$|Notwithstanding these {{sudden and}} {{alarming}} losses, the work went on. Hillson seemed suddenly to become {{conscious of the}} necessity of exertion, and by giving his utmost attention to hoisting out the launch, that boat was got safely into the water. By this time the ship had beaten so far over the reef, as scarcely to touch at all, and Mark had everything ready for <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> his <b>anchors,</b> the instant he had reason to believe she was in water deep enough to float her. The thumps grew lighter and lighter, and the lead-line showed a considerable drift; so much so, indeed, as to require its being hauled in and cast anew every minute. Under all the circumstances, Mark expected each instant, to find himself in four fathoms' water, and he intended to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> the moment he was assured of that fact. In the mean time, he ordered the carpenter to sound the pumps. This was done, and the ship was reported with only the customary quantity of water in the well. As yet her bottom was not injured, materially at least.|$|R
50|$|The skipper <b>let</b> <b>go</b> an <b>anchor</b> but {{it failed}} to hold, and as they were swept towards Maenporth beach, a Mayday was sent. With the wind now gusting force ten and the waves {{breaking}} over the trawler, {{she was out of}} control, and soon piled onto the rocks at the bottom of Newporth Head. As the boat struck the rocks, one of the crew jumped over the side, gravely injuring himself, and others threw out anything to act as life rafts.|$|R
60|$|We soon ran {{inside the}} barrier coral reef, and <b>let</b> <b>go</b> our <b>anchor</b> in six fathoms water, just {{opposite}} {{the mouth of}} a small creek, whose shores were densely covered with mangroves and tall umbrageous trees. The principal village of the natives lay about half-a-mile from this point. Ordering the boat out, the captain jumped into it, and ordered me to follow him. The men, fifteen in number, were well armed; and the mate was directed to have Long Tom ready for emergencies.|$|R
50|$|For {{distinguished}} {{conduct in}} the line of his profession, extraordinary courage, and disregard of his own safety during the attack on the Fleet in Pearl Harbor, by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. During the height of the strafing and bombing, Chief Boatswain Hill led his men of the linehandling details of the U.S.S. Nevada to the quays, cast off the lines and swam back to his ship. Later, while on the forecastle, attempting to <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchors,</b> he was blown overboard and killed by the explosion of several bombs.|$|R
60|$|Great was the {{surprise}} and joy among the settlers that {{morning when the}} fine ship {{in which they had}} traversed the ocean sailed grandly over the lagoon, and <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her <b>anchor</b> in Silver Bay. Some viewed her as a means of continuing the voyage, and escaping from a secluded life, of which they were beginning to tire. Others thought of her as a means of reopening intercourse with home, while not a few thought only of the convenience of having her and her useful cargo so near to them.|$|R
60|$|We sailed, {{and from}} that hour all idling ceased. Such another system of overhauling, general {{littering}} of cabins and packing of trunks we had not seen since we <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor</b> in the harbor of Beirout. Every body was busy. Lists of all purchases {{had to be made}} out, and values attached, to facilitate matters at the custom-house. Purchases bought by bulk in partnership had to be equitably divided, outstanding debts canceled, accounts compared, and trunks, boxes and packages labeled. All day long the bustle and confusion continued.|$|R
60|$|Sail was got off her, {{and a man}} {{placed in}} the chains, and {{soundings}} taken. This was continued until the water shoaled to eight fathoms, when the brig was brought up, head to wind, and the <b>anchor</b> <b>let</b> <b>go.</b> Then an <b>anchor</b> watch of four men was set, {{and the rest of}} the crew allowed to turn in.|$|R
60|$|In {{my cabin}} I summoned Mr. Langely and Mr. White (my second mate) {{to a serious}} consultation, which was the last we were to hold before that great and bloody battle {{concerning}} which so much hath been writ and spoken of late. When we had finished our councils we came upon deck again, {{and found that the}} sloop was rather less than a mile distant from the other craft, and in a little while she hove to nigh to the barque, and <b>let</b> <b>go</b> her <b>anchor</b> with a splash and rattle of the cable which we could hear distinctly whence we lay.|$|R
50|$|Captain Lord William Proby {{commissioned}} Danae in December 1798. In March 1799 a gale {{caught her}} in a bay of shoals and rocks near the ÃŽle de Batz. Two of her anchor cables broke and her crew <b>let</b> <b>go</b> a third <b>anchor,</b> which held. The storm stove in all her boats and Proby slipped and fell down the main hatchway. The fall dislocated his shoulder and broke two ribs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sol Ketchmaid," [...] he said, with dignity, [...] "I â€™ope youâ€™re drunk. I â€™ope itâ€™s {{the drink}} and not Sol Ketchmaid, wot I saved from the shark by â€™aving my leg bit off, talking. I saved your life, Sol, anâ€™ I â€™ave {{come into your}} little harbour and <b>let</b> <b>go</b> my little <b>anchor</b> to stay there till I go aloft to join poor Sam Jones wot died with your name on â€™is lips." ...|$|R
50|$|At 7:30pm on 25 October 1808 {{bad weather}} drove {{her from her}} {{anchorage}} at Plymouth. She dropped a second anchor. By 4am she was near shore and got under way to make for the Sound. She returned three hours later to find an anchorage but a squall hit her as she <b>went</b> about. She <b>let</b> <b>go</b> an <b>anchor</b> but struck a rock off Plymouth Hoe. She fired her guns to signal distress, which brought out several boats from the dockyard. With some assistance she was refloated but she went aground again. She sank in deeper water with her starboard gunwale just clearing the surface. Boats picked up all her crew from the water. She was later broken up.|$|R
50|$|Damage to the Blackthorn {{from the}} initial impact was not extensive. However, Capricorns anchor {{was ready to be}} <b>let</b> <b>go.</b> The <b>anchor</b> became {{embedded}} in the Blackthorns hull and ripped open the port side above the water line. Then as the two ships backed away from each other, the chain became taut. The force of the much larger ship pulling on it, caused Blackthorn to tip on her side until she suddenly capsized. Six off-duty personnel who had mustered when they heard the collision alarm were trapped inside the ship. Several crew members who had just reported aboard tried to escape and in the process trapped themselves in the engine room. Although 27 crewmen survived the collision, 23 perished.|$|R
6000|$|I {{ordered him}} to drop the anchor at the junk's bow, to which he replied, [...] "No sabbe." [...] The crew responded in like fashion, and though I made my meaning plain by signs, they refused to understand. Realizing the inexpediency of {{discussing}} the matter, I went forward myself, overran the line, and <b>let</b> the <b>anchor</b> <b>go.</b>|$|R
5|$|Captain Kane {{then took}} his ship to Sydney, where they {{received}} a hero's welcome. The narrowness of Calliopes escape; the excellence of the engines and {{the dedication of the}} crew, who kept the power plant in operation for many hours during the ordeal; the seamanship of Captain Kane and officers; their bravery in <b>letting</b> <b>go</b> of their <b>anchor</b> and facing the storm, trusting only in their ship and themselves; and the respect and encouragement given to them by the crew of Trenton; made Calliope famous.|$|R
6000|$|All was now ready. A steady five-knot breeze was blowing, so that I was now {{not more}} than {{quarter of a mile}} from the reef. I was soon at the entrance; and as the {{schooner}} glided quickly through, I glanced affectionately at the huge breaker {{as if it had been}} the same one I had seen there when I bade adieu, as I feared for ever, to the island. On coming opposite the Water Garden, I put the helm hard down. The schooner came round with a rapid, graceful bend, and lost way just opposite the bower. Running forward, I <b>let</b> <b>go</b> the <b>anchor,</b> caught up the red-hot poker, applied it to the brass gun, and saluted the mountains with a bang such as had only once before broke their slumbering echoes! ...|$|R
60|$|Truly {{it was a}} grand as well as {{a solemn}} sight to see these majestic ships of war sail quietly down on the devoted city in the midst of dead silence, for as yet not a shot had been fired on either side. And the eyes of many, already wide with eagerness, must have opened wider still with surprise, for Lord Exmouth pursued a course of action that was bold even for a British Admiral. He ran the Queen Charlotte before the wind, close up to the walls, and with the sails still {{standing}} <b>let</b> <b>go</b> three <b>anchors</b> from the stern, so as to keep her exactly in the required position, just before the opening of the mole, and with her vast broadside within pistol-range of the walls, flanking all the batteries from the mole-head to the light-house.|$|R
60|$|Great rejoicings, to be sure, {{were made}} on our arrival. All the flags in the place were hoisted, all the guns in the place were fired, {{and all the people}} in the place came down to look at us. One of those Sambo fellows--they call those natives Sambos, when they are half-negro and half-Indian--had come off outside the reef, to pilot us in, and {{remained}} on board after we had <b>let</b> <b>go</b> our <b>anchor.</b> He was called Christian George King, and was fonder of all hands than anybody else was. Now, I confess, for myself, that on that first day, if I had been captain of the Christopher Columbus, instead of private in the Royal Marines, I should have kicked Christian George King--who was no more a Christian than he was a King or a George--over the side, without exactly knowing why, except that it was the right thing to do.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{discovery}} {{too great to}} be omitted, so I ordered the brigantine to stand in with an easy sail, and see what account could be had of the place; accordingly they stood in, and we followed about a league, and then lay by, waiting their signals. I had particularly ordered them to keep two boats ahead to sound the depth all the way, and they did so; and how it happened we knew not, but on a sudden we heard the sloop fire two guns first, and then one gun; {{the first was a}} signal to us to bring to, and come no farther: the next was a signal of distress. We immediately tacked to stand off, but found a strong current setting directly into the bite, and there not being wind enough for us to stem the current, we <b>let</b> <b>go</b> our <b>anchors</b> in twenty fathoms water.|$|R
