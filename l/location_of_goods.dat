The lighthouse was constructed entirely by government workers, rather than a private contractor, and it is believed to be unique in this sense among Queensland lighthouses. The original apparatus was a fourth order dioptric with a totally reflecting glass mirror.|$|E

40|$|In {{a modern}} economy, “equilibrium” means that {{supply and demand}} is equal. It {{is at this point}} that the al- <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and {{services}} is at its most efficient, this being because the amount of goods and the amount of goods in demand are equally balanced. The market equilibrium therefore is determined by sup- ply and demand. This paper looks at the concept of “equilibrium” in some of the early Confucian texts and its possible implications in economic activities. In the Confucian context equilibrium, or what can be termed as the ultimate equilibrium, is to be understood in a broader sense where balances and harmony at different levels (e. g. individual and society) need to be sought in order to achieve a model of sustainable development. The ultimate equilibrium may provide an alternative approach to social welfare and eco- nomic prosperity creating universal harmony and better living for humans. In Confucian ideology, gov- erning for the welfare of the people is not merely a question of increasing personal income and wealth; it requires implementation on a priority basis, taking into consideration the formation of an orderly society based on the enforcement of moral and ethical standards with the existence of a benevolent government which appropriates things according to the principles of harmony and order to achieve what can be termed as the “great equilibrium”—equilibrium that is not simply defined by balanced economic forces as in modern economic theory; but rather is used to suggest an ideal state of harmony in self fulfilment and socio-political order through incentives and by appropriate means. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{the value}} {{creation}} process {{is based on}} management of {{a large amount of}} data, the Big Data, which are able to connect businesses and customers {{from all over the world}} (Xie et al., 2016). Considering the managerial and industrial points of view, Industry 4. 0 is a new economic model for the industrial world (Peressotti, 2016), based on the evolution of production paradigm, technological change and process logic adoption: companies should change their business models, invest in staff training, adopting new managerial tools. As a result, the change of the market (from standardized to diversified) with the production of customized products. Machines and robots are able to communicate each other, to take decisions and to self-update. The production lines are automated: control and maintenance tasks can be performed remotely. As a consequence, the creation of the agile value chain: it allows you to monitor large amounts of data in real time, to track status and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> to control the production process distantly. To study the level of adoption of 4. 0 industrialization plans, two global indicators have been analyzed: they identify the placement of the largest industrial powers as a result of their industrialization policies adoption. Since the literature review shows few academic contributions and the subject is studied from engineering, computer and industrial design points of view, the objective of the work is to provide a theoretical contribution to managerial and industrial studies: the adoption of innovation in economic policy represents an opportunity to improve the country identity and the competitiveness level. So it is essential to encourage companies to adopt innovative tools, making the production automated. The methodology used is the content analysis technique: literature analysis, reports, conference proceedings, publications and websites are consulted.

40|$|In modern global supply chains, goods travel stochastically from {{suppliers}} to their final destinations through several intermediate installations such as ports and distribution facilities. In such an environment, {{the supply chain}} must be agile to respond quickly to demand spikes. One way to achieve this objective is by expediting outstanding orders from the intermediate installations through premium delivery. In this research, we study the optimal expediting and regular ordering policies of a serial supply chain with a radio frequency identification deployment at each installation. Radio frequency identification technology allows capturing {{the state of the}} system, i. e., the time and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> at any point in time, and thus enables to expedite outstanding orders directly to the destination, which faces stochastic demand. We identify systems, called sequential, that yield simple and tractable optimal policies. For sequential systems, outstanding orders including expediting do not cross in time. For such systems, we find that the optimal policies of expediting and regular ordering are the base stock type policies. The directional sensitivity of the base stock levels with respect to expediting costs is also obtained. We provide an important managerial insight on the radio frequency identification technology: we need to actively use the additional information from the radio frequency identification technology through new business processes such as expediting to unveil more benefits from the supply chain. On the other hand, orders may cross in time for systems that are not sequential, thus in such a case optimal policies are hard to obtain. We propose a heuristic for such systems and discuss its performance and limitation. (cont.) Lastly, as an extension to the model, we study the optimal policies of expediting and regular ordering when there is an expiry date on outstanding orders. The optimal expediting policy identifies a number of base stock levels depending on the age of the orders, but the structure of the optimal policy remains simple for sequential systems. by Chiwon Kim.
