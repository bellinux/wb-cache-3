This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of fuel injected and spark time, as fuel flow needs to be decreased and also self-combustion needs to be avoided when gasoline is used because ethanol engines have compression ratio around 12:1, too high for gasoline.|$|E

50|$|Another {{common cause}} of {{premature}} failure of <b>lambda</b> <b>probes</b> is contamination of fuel with silicones (used in some sealings and greases) or silicates (used as corrosion inhibitors in some antifreezes).

40|$|AbstractTo detect NO {{in the low}} ppm {{range in}} exhaust gases is of high {{interest}} due to the ever tighter emission and immission regulations. Applying the pulsed polarization technique, Pt|YSZ sensors like the classical thimble type <b>lambda</b> <b>probes</b> for automotive applications or planar sensor elements (Pt electrodes {{on both sides of}} YSZ) show very good sensitivities toward NO. To further improve the sensor with respect to simplicity and robustness for exhaust gas applications, a one-sided design is preferred, especially to implement a heater on the reverse side of the sensor element. For that purpose, a design that bases on platinum interdigital electrodes is investigated. Again, by using this polarization technique very strong signals towards NO in the lowest ppm range have been achieved...|$|R
50|$|The sensors {{only work}} {{effectively}} when heated to approximately 316 °C (600 °F), so most newer <b>lambda</b> <b>probes</b> have heating elements encased in the ceramic that bring the ceramic tip up to temperature quickly. Older probes, without heating elements, {{would eventually be}} heated by the exhaust, {{but there is a}} time lag between when the engine is started and when the components in the exhaust system come to a thermal equilibrium. The length of time required for the exhaust gases to bring the probe to temperature depends on the temperature of the ambient air and the geometry of the exhaust system. Without a heater, the process may take several minutes. There are pollution problems that are attributed to this slow start-up process, including a similar problem with the working temperature of a catalytic converter.|$|R

40|$|Haplotypes {{were defined}} in the human {{immunoglobulin}} lambda locus by using three <b>probes</b> [...] V <b>lambda</b> VII, V lambda A, and V lambda I [...] hybridized to BamHI, KpnI, EcoRI, and HindIII digests. Four KpnI alleles were described.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} an update, how transient operation methods {{can improve the}} performance of gas sensors and sensor systems for specific applications. Even new applications can be enabled, if existing state-of-the-art sensors are operated in transient modes adapted {{to the needs of}} the application in mind. Several parameters are available for transient variation, depending on the particular sensing technology: Suspended Gate FET sensors deliver a simultaneous readout of work function and capacitive effects. By applying pulsed gate voltages these effects can be interpreted separately and used e. g. for compensation of humidity effects and improved selectivity. Modulation of the operating temperature of μ-machined metal oxide sensors is creating a type of virtual sensor array. In this case, the dynamic behavior of adsorption and desorption at changing temperature levels delivers a fingerprint for application relevant gas mixtures. The pulsed application of charge voltage on standard exhaust <b>lambda</b> <b>probes</b> and the recording of the related discharge characteristic over time provide an exhaust NOx sensor based on a standard sensor setup. The charging creates a misbalance in oxygen-related surface species not available under continuous operation conditions. The related discharge characteristic is strongly influenced by the interaction of these oxygen species with NOx...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a novel method {{emerged to}} {{determine}} the oxygen storage degree of three way catalysts (TWC) by a microwave-based method. Up to now, this method has been investigated only in lab-scale reactors or under steady state conditions. This work expands those initial studies. A TWC-coated gasoline particulate filter was investigated in a dynamic engine test bench simulating a typical European driving cycle (NEDC). It could be shown that both the oxygen storage degree and the soot loading can be monitored directly, but not simultaneously due to their competitive effects. Under normal driving conditions, no soot accumulation was observed, related to the low raw emissions and the catalytic coating of the filter. For the first time, the quality factor of the cavity resonator {{in addition to the}} resonance frequency was used, with the benefit of less cross sensitivity to inconstant temperature and water. Therefore, a temperature dependent calibration of the microwave signal was created and applied to monitor the oxidation state in transient driving cycles. The microwave measurement mirrors the oxidation state determined by <b>lambda</b> <b>probes</b> and can be highly beneficial in start-stop phases (where lambda-probes do not work) and {{to determine the}} oxygen storage capacity (OSC) without unnecessary emissions...|$|R

Thus, the S protein appears to reside in the inner membrane as a multimer, and the molecular weights of the cross-linked species are consistent with those of S-protein homopolymers.

50|$|By modifying {{these values}} while {{monitoring}} the exhausts using a wide band <b>lambda</b> <b>probe</b> {{to see if}} the engine runs rich or lean, the tuner can find the optimal amount of fuel to inject to the engine at every different combination of RPM and throttle position.

40|$|To {{determine}} the chromosomal localization of murine lambda light (L) chain structural genes, DNA from {{a panel of}} 11 mouse x hamster somatic cell hybrids was scored {{for the presence of}} sequences homologous to cloned <b>lambda</b> DNA <b>probe</b> molecules.

40|$|A gene {{encoding}} the lambda 5 {{light chain}} constant region was isolated from a genomic library from the SPE mouse strain (C lambda 5 S).

Sequence comparison of C lambda 5 genes with C lambda 1 of BALB/c shows only few substitutions in the C lambda 5 coding regions and suggests that the three genes have a common ancestor. These data indicate that the C lambda 5 gene has evolved under strong selective pressure and probably encodes a functional gene product. The conservation of the C lambda 5 gene in various Mus species was observed by high stringency Southern blot analyses using a C <b>lambda</b> 5 S <b>probe</b> on DNA sample from members of four different groups of wild mice. All the laboratory and wild mouse strains tested, including those with amplified sets of C lambda 1 and C lambda 2 hybridizing sequences, showed only single C lambda 5 hybridizing fragments.

5000|$|In the United States, E85 FFVs are {{equipped}} with sensor that automatically detect the fuel mixture, signaling the ECU to tune spark timing and fuel injection so that fuel will burn cleanly in the vehicle's internal combustion engine.

The exotic isotopes far from the neutron drip line can be stabilized by filling in considerable Lambda hyperons. The difference of the binding energy of multi-Lambda hypernuclei from different models is attributed to different symmetry energies. The isovector potential together with the neutron thickness in multi-Lambda hypernuclei investigated is very sensitive to the isoscalar-isovector coupling. The large sensitivity of the Lambda hyperon fraction to the isoscalar-isovector coupling occurs at about 2 - 3 rho_ 0 in beta equilibrated hyperon-rich matter.

40|$|Conventional thimble type lambda sensors {{combined}} with a pulse discharge technique were used for NOx detection in a simulated combustion exhaust gas with varying oxygen and moisture levels. Open circuit discharge characteristics after defined polarization pulses with alternating polarity show strong dependencies on NOx (112 mV / decade) in the lowest ppm range (0. 5 – 50 ppm). Increase in NOx concentration accelerates sensor discharge, whereby the discharge curves following negative pulses are more affected by the NOx content compared to positive pulses. The sensitivities to NO and NO 2 are equal and measurement of total NOx is possible. The discharge curves {{are affected by the}} oxygen and the water content. An increase in O 2 concentration results in a shift of the discharge curves to negative voltages. Additionally a decreased sensor response to NOx is obtained for both polarization polarities. The water concentration has the opposite effect. All discharge curves are shifted to positive voltages with increasing H 2 O content. As a result, the sensor response increases strongly. The voltage shifts due to O 2 and H 2 O are expected from Nernstian behavior of a <b>lambda</b> <b>probe,</b> whereby moisture influence is stronger compared to O 2.
