25|$|A 2005 {{household}} survey {{study shows}} a socio-economic distribution for households in Lima. It used a monthly family income of 6000 Nuevos Soles {{or more for}} socioeconomic level A, 2000 to 6000 Nuevos Soles for <b>level</b> <b>B,</b> 840 to 2000 Nuevos Soles for level C, 420 to 1200 Nuevos Soles for level D and up to 840 Nuevos Soles for level E. In Lima 18% were level E, 32.3% level D, 31.7% level C, 14.6% <b>level</b> <b>B</b> and 3.4% level A. In this sense, 82% of the population lives in households that earn less than 2000 Nuevos Soles monthly. Other salient differences between socioeconomic levels include levels of higher education, car ownership and home size.|$|E

25|$|There {{are certain}} {{requirements}} {{as to how}} many subjects each student has to take and at how high levels.

25|$|In {{the course}} of a {{periodic}} inspection carried out by the operating personnel, a manually operated valve, which should have been open, was found to be closed. As result of the false position, one of three emergency cooling systems of Beznau 1 was not ready for immediate use over a period of two weeks. This breach of the technical specifications led to the incident being assessed as level 1 (Swiss scale <b>level</b> <b>B).</b>|$|E
25|$|After the {{revision}} outage, at 1 to 2% of reactor power, the new protection system for Beznau 1 and its {{internal power supply}} was to be started up with a test program. During synchronization with the new protection equipment, {{one of the two}} turbo groups inadvertently increased the load, and this caused a rise in reactor power to 12.6%. Since only the auxiliary feedwater pumps are in operation during low power, the amount of water supplied was insufficient to feed the steam generator, leading to an automatic reactor scram. The inadvertent demand on the turbo group was caused by an unforeseen reaction of the automatic turbine controller. Besides, the reactor already went critical at 251°C instead of at the prescribed minimum temperature of 276°C. The deviation from the operation specifications led to a level 1 assessment (Swiss scale <b>level</b> <b>B).</b>|$|E

25|$|In August, {{during the}} annual audit of Beznau 2, the 50 kV {{emergency}} power line was inactivated. Consequently, the diesel generator of Beznau 1 was switched on at low regime as prescribed {{by the security}} regulations. After the reconnection of the 50 kV line, the generator ran at higher load because of technical reasons, but it eventually failed due to a defective relay. It was therefore assumed that while the 50 kV line was not active the generator {{would not have been}} able to run at full loading. Since the unit 2 generator was also unavailable due to the planned audit, the emergency power could be provided only by the hydroelectric plant or backup generators activated in case of flood. The decrease in redundancy caused a deviation from the normal operation parameters and was therefore classified as a level 1 event (Swiss scale <b>level</b> <b>B).</b>|$|E

The commission, which was organized by the South Korean government, announced that they acknowledge 83 people among them as victims. The commission said that although the people reluctantly served as guards to avoid the draft, they took responsibility for mistreatment by the Japanese against prisoners of war. Lee Se-il, leader of the investigation, said that examination of the military prosecution reports for 15 Korean prison guards, obtained from The National Archives of the United Kingdom, confirmed that they were convicted without explicit evidence.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a case study that demonstrates how design to experiments (DOE) information {{can be used to}} design better accelerated reliability tests.

Before starting an accelerated reliability test, it is advisable to have a plan that helps in accurately estimating reliability at operating conditions while minimizing test time and costs. A test plan should be used to decide on the appropriate stress levels that should be used (for each stress type) and the amount of the test units that need to be allocated to the different stress levels (for each combination of the different stress types' levels). For the case study it used ALTA 7 software what provides a complete analysis for data from accelerated reliability test...|$|R

50|$|Level B: <b>Level</b> <b>B</b> {{protection}} {{requires a}} garment (including SCBA) that provides protection against splashes from a hazardous chemical. Since the breathing apparatus is sometimes worn {{on the outside}} of the garment, <b>Level</b> <b>B</b> protection is not vapor-protective. <b>Level</b> <b>B</b> suits can also be fully encapsulating, which helps prevent the SCBA from becoming contaminated. It is worn when vapor-protective clothing (Level A) is not required. Wrists, ankles, facepiece and hood, and waist are secured to prevent any entry of splashed liquid. Depending on the chemical being handled, specific types of gloves and boots are donned. These may or may not be attached to the garment. The garment itself may be one piece or a two-piece hooded suit. <b>Level</b> <b>B</b> protection also requires the wearing of chemical-resistant boots with steel toes and shanks {{on the outside of}} the garment.
