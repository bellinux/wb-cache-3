5|$|Transferred to the Channel Fleet, <b>Leviathan</b> was {{attached}} to service under Lord Howe and served with him during the Atlantic campaign of May 1794 alongside John Willett Payne, captain of HMS Russell. The campaign culminated in the Glorious First of June, when a French fleet was defeated by Howe's innovative tactics, but was ultimately successful in protecting a large grain convoy from the United States. Seymour's command of <b>Leviathan</b> was vitally important in the victory, the ship fighting at the initial engagement of the 28 May and seeing extensive action during the battle itself. Seymour {{was one of only}} a few of Howe's commanders to successfully close with the French line, although he was unable to break through it. <b>Leviathan</b> then engaged closely with America, which she reduced to a battered wreck in a duel that lasted two hours. <b>Leviathan</b> was also badly damaged, having taken fire from Éole and Trajan during the fighting. At Howe's order, Seymour then left America (which was later captured) and joined the reformed fleet that held off a French counter-attack in the latter stages of the battle. In the aftermath of the action, Seymour was one of the captains marked out for praise, being presented with a medal commemorating his service during the engagement. <b>Leviathan</b> had suffered 11 killed and 32 wounded in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the <b>Leviathan</b> {{joined the}} {{similarly}} named Behemoth at Canada's Wonderland, stripping the Behemoth of its titles as tallest ride in Canada and fastest ride in Canada. It {{was the first}} new ride in Medieval Faire {{in more than a}} decade. <b>Leviathan</b> is ranked as the seventh tallest, and the eighth fastest roller coaster in the world. It is Canada's Wonderland's 16th roller coaster. The addition came quickly after the launch of the 230-foot-tall Behemoth roller coaster in 2008, and the 301-foot-tall swing ride WindSeeker in the 2011 season.|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Meet the New Boss", Castiel begins {{exacting}} his new supremacy {{over the}} planet, working miracles and punishing religious hypocrites alike. However, when Castiel's vessel begins to become damaged and {{he begins to}} lose control of his power, Death reveals that he also absorbed creatures known as <b>Leviathans</b> from Purgatory. The <b>Leviathans</b> will destroy him {{if they are not}} released. Castiel seeks out the Winchesters' help, and reopens the portal with Death's assistance. Although the souls are returned, the <b>Leviathans</b> evade reentering Purgatory and take control of Castiel's vessel. In [...] "Hello, Cruel World", the vessel begins to quickly break down. The <b>Leviathans</b> are forced to leave, dispersing into the local water supply nearby and leaving behind only Castiel's trench coat.|$|R
5|$|Originally themed {{around the}} Middle Ages, Medieval Faire is {{a section of}} Canada's Wonderland, a theme park in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. As such, early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights, Don Quixote, Vikings, dragons, bats, and beasts. Throughout the Paramount Parks era, the section's new attractions lacked {{appropriate}} theming. The introduction of the <b>Leviathan</b> roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 {{was the first major}} investment in the section since 2000; the park is now under ownership of Cedar Fair. The section includes four roller coasters (The Bat, Dragon Fire, <b>Leviathan,</b> and Wild Beast) and six other rides.|$|E
5|$|A month later, Samus awakens {{aboard a}} Galactic Federation starship, where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have {{corrupted}} her. The Federation equips her {{suit with a}} Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with <b>Leviathan</b> Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine {{what happened to her}} missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the <b>Leviathan</b> Seeds; and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this.|$|E
5|$|A third frigate {{was visible}} on the horizon. Emerald {{immediately}} set off in pursuit but Duckworth recalled her and instead ordered her to locate the merchant ships; she secured four of the largest vessels by nightfall. The {{need to make the}} two captured frigates ready to sail delayed <b>Leviathan,</b> and by the time this was completed the third frigate had made her escape. <b>Leviathan</b> then returned to rendezvous with Emerald, managing to take a further enemy brig before night fell. The following day, both British vessels sailed for Gibraltar with their prizes. On arrival, they encountered Incendiary, which had made port the previous day with two captured vessels of its own. The small British squadron managed to secure nine merchant vessels and two frigates in total.|$|E

50|$|Julia {{participated in}} a seance to contact Josette's ghost, but she warned Barnabas that, if Josette were truly a {{prisoner}} of the <b>Leviathans,</b> she {{might not be able}} to appear. After Josette's spirit revealed no knowledge of the <b>Leviathans,</b> Barnabas decided to take action against Jeb and the other members of the cult. Julia worried that Barnabas would be punished for fighting the <b>Leviathans,</b> and when Quentin told her that Barnabas had failed to destroy the Naga Box and had not been killed for trying, she decided that Jeb had probably turned Barnabas back into a vampire.|$|R
5|$|His plan in tatters, Howe {{responded by}} example, leading his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte towards the French line which was rapidly slipping {{ahead of the}} British, steering around the meandering Caesar as he did so. Queen Charlotte first attempted {{to break through the}} French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to reach this gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship Eole from close range. Bellerophon and Lord Hugh Seymour in <b>Leviathan</b> followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; Bellerophon successfully, <b>Leviathan</b> prevented by damage to her helm. This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the Terrible, Tyrannicide, and Indomptable, forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.|$|E
5|$|Symbolically, the sea {{has long}} been {{perceived}} as a hostile and dangerous environment populated by fantastic creatures: the gigantic <b>Leviathan</b> of the Bible, the shark-like Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the ship-swallowing Kraken of late Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: The Book of Satan, The Book of Lucifer, The Book of Belial, and The Book of <b>Leviathan.</b> The Book of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. The Book of Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses the book to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In The Book of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. The Book of <b>Leviathan</b> provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E

5|$|Within an hour {{of their}} opening volleys the British and French lines were hopelessly confused, with three {{separate}} engagements being fought within sight of one another. In the van, Caesar had finally attempted to join the fight, only to have a vital spar shot away by Trajan which caused her to slip down the two embattled fleets without contributing significantly to the battle. Bellerophon and <b>Leviathan</b> were {{in the thick of}} the action, the outnumbered Bellerophon taking serious damage to her rigging. This left her unable to manoeuvre and in danger from her opponents, of which Eole also suffered severely. Captain William Johnstone Hope sought to extract his ship from her perilous position and called up support; the frigate HMS Latona under Captain Edward Thornbrough arrived to provide assistance. Thornbrough brought his small ship between the ships of the French battleline and opened fire on Eole, helping to drive off three ships of the line and then towing Bellerophon to safety. <b>Leviathan,</b> under Lord Hugh Seymour, had been more successful than Bellerophon, her gunnery dismasting America despite receiving fire from Eole and Trajan in passing. <b>Leviathan</b> only left America after a two-hour duel, sailing at 11:50 to join Queen Charlotte in the centre.|$|E

After besting the giant moogle, the Warrior of Light encounters a white-robed Ascian named Elidibus who tests the player's might before disappearing. Shortly thereafter, refugees arrive from Doma, a city subjugated by the Garlean Empire, and seek asylum in Ul'dah, which refuses their request. Alphinaud recommends they work as tradesmen and manual labor in the construction of Revenant's Toll. In gratitude, the Doman leader, an Au Ra named Yugiri, accompanies the party to reconnoiter the Sahagin spawning grounds where their primal <b>Leviathan</b> is summoned.

5|$|In the Spanish {{armament}} of 1790, Seymour {{was called}} to service {{in command of the}} ship of the line HMS Canada, opening his commission with a cruise off the Isle of Wight. Passing through shallow water, Seymour ordered the use of a lead line to measure the depth ahead, but was accidentally struck in the head by the lead weight while soundings were being taken. Although little immediate damage seemed to have been caused, during the firing of a salute several days later Seymour suddenly suffered a severely adverse reaction and had to be taken ashore for emergency medical treatment. The head injury rendered him unable to endure any loud noises or bright lights and {{for the next three years}} he lived as an invalid at his country estate in Hambleton. By 1793 he was sufficiently recovered to return to service, and escorted Lord Hood to the Mediterranean in HMS <b>Leviathan.</b> There Hood led the occupation, defence and ultimate withdrawal from Toulon during the Republican siege of the city. Following the collapse of the city's defences, Seymour was sent back to England with dispatches but returned shortly afterward to convoy <b>Leviathan</b> back to Britain.|$|E
