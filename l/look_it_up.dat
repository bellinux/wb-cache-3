25|$|The {{network address}} {{was placed in}} an unused field in the Fido message database, which {{formerly}} always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would <b>look</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.|$|E

"The Oxford English Dictionary has a {{definition}} for 'truthy' {{dating back to}} the 1800s....'The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows that they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said Thursday.

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} season's use of 1940s terminology, Fazekas stated that terms like [...] "broad" [...] and [...] "dame" [...] were preferably avoided, while {{research}} {{was done to}} ensure terms {{that were used in}} the series were actually in use during that time, with Fazekas giving the example, [...] "you know what didn't exist in 1946? Smart ass. I looked up the etymology on that, didn't exist in 1946. Turns out it was a term that came around in the 60s. But for instance, I wrote a line that said, [...] "Oh I think someone's yanking your chain." [...] And I had to <b>look</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> did that exist in 1946? And actually it did; it's a mining term that exists from a long time ago. That's our research that we do." [...] Research was also done on radio shows of the time to ensure realism when creating the fictional Captain America Adventure Program, with details discovered and replicated on the series including the use of lobsters and ham to create sound effects for the radio show. The Griffith Hotel, the all-women boarding house where Carter lives, is based on the real-life Barbizon Hotel for Women. Butters felt that while working in the time period, it became an issue to not sound [...] "too period". Additionally, it was difficult to write British people from the time in order to avoid stereotypes such as the [...] "typical British butler". However, D'Arcy, who is British, felt the writing staff wrote the British characters better than anyone else he had worked with, despite there not being any British writers on the staff.|$|E
2500|$|A {{buyer of}} a {{second-hand}} vehicle can in theory determine {{the year of}} first registration of the vehicle without having to <b>look</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> [...] However, a vehicle is permitted to display a number plate where the age identifier is older (but not newer) than the vehicle. The wide awareness of how the [...] "age identifier" [...] works has led to it being used in advertising by used car showrooms instead of simply stating a year.|$|E
2500|$|Often the {{minister}} reads passages from well-known historical, sociological, or anthropological works, and finds in them inconspicuous {{references to the}} Blackman’s true history in the world.... Occasionally {{the minister}} chides the audience for its scepticism: “I know you don't believe me because I {{happen to be a}} Black man. Well, you can <b>look</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in a book I’m {{going to tell you about}} that was written by a white man.” He then reads off references that his hearers are challenged to check for themselves. A single documented statement, however, may become the basis of a wide range of generalized non-sequiturs. The fact that a North Carolina slaveholder had an Arabic-speaking Muslim slave of unusual mathematical ability may be offered as evidence that all slaves brought to America were Moslem, Arabic-speaking, and learned. Similarly, historical facts may be indiscriminately mingled with myths and countermyths. (The Black Muslims in America, pp. 120–121) ...|$|E

50|$|Reverse indexes {{are just}} as {{efficient}} as unreversed indexes for finding specific values, although they aren't helpful for range queries.

2500|$|Conversely, specifying a given kanji, or {{spelling}} out a kanji word—whether the pronunciation is known or not—can be complicated, {{due to the}} fact that there is not a commonly used standard way to refer to individual kanji (one does not refer to [...] "kanji #237"), and that a given reading does not map to a single kanji—indeed there are many homophonous words, not simply individual characters, particularly for kango (with on'yomi). Easiest is to write the word out—either on paper or tracing it in the air—or <b>look</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> (given the pronunciation) in a dictionary, particularly an electronic dictionary; when this is not possible, such as when speaking over the phone or writing implements are not available (and tracing in air is too complicated), various techniques can be used. These include giving kun'yomi for characters—these are often unique—using a well-known word with the same character (and preferably the same pronunciation and meaning), and describing the character via its components. For example, one may explain how to spell the word [...] via the words , , and —the first two use the kun'yomi, the third is a well-known compound—saying [...] "kaori, karai, ryō as in inryō." ...|$|E
