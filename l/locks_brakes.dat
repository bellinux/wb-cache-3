40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 50 - 51) Automobile {{vehicles of}} today have {{the need of}} continuously adjusting their speeds as per changing roads and traffic conditions. With the increase of speed and density of road vehicles, Anti Lock Breaking systems are being developed and implemented in these vehicles {{taking into account the}} safety performance issues. These Anti <b>Lock</b> <b>Braking</b> systems are used in modern cars to prevent the wheels from <b>locking</b> after <b>brakes</b> have been applied. The control target for the Anti <b>Lock</b> <b>Braking</b> systems is to maintain the frictional coefficients within the maximum range in corresponding operating conditions in order to obtain a maximum frictional force from the varying road surfaces and ensure the safety of the vehicle at the same time. The controller of the system in this project is developed using fuzzy logic control. The objective of the ABS controller in this project is to maintain the wheel slip ratio {{as close as possible to}} a fixed slip value of 0. 2 which is ideally the desired slip value in order to reduce the stopping distance and ensure safe operation of vehicle while braking takes place. The vehicle model is also simulated using a PID controller. A comparison is made between the fuzzy controller and PID controller based on angular velocity, slip ratio and stopping time. The vehicle has been simulated under dry asphalt road condition and considering only straight line braking. It was observed that the fuzzy controller has a shorter stopping time of 0. 25 seconds as compared to the PID controller and shows a better tracking capacity...|$|R

40|$|The adapted {{recumbent}} {{project was}} to redesign a disabled veteran’s recumbent bicycle. The main areas of concern were the crank pedal, chain tension, braking and steering system, and ergonomics. Since the customer is an avid biker, this bike will be used often, so the design {{is based on the}} ease of repair and replacement. The crank system was redesigned to a lightweight, adjustable part with chain clearance and high strength. The chain tension was improved by replacing the existing single idler wheel/chain tube system with a dual idler wheel system. The dual idler has a titanium sprocket in one of the wheels and a smooth low friction surface for the other wheel. A rear mechanical disc brake was added with a <b>locking</b> <b>brake</b> lever. The <b>locking</b> <b>brake</b> was added {{to make it easier for}} the user to get in and out of the seat. A weld was made on the rear seat stay in order to place a bracket for the rear brake calipers. The front hydraulic brakes were replaced with two mechanical disc brakes with mechanical lines routed to a single dual pull lever. Additional custom seat padding was made specifically for this recumbent tricycle. Using closed cell foam in a nylon cover with sewn on straps, the new seat simply attaches to the existing seat for increased comfort. Total cost for the entire project was $ 1489. 86. A cost breakdown for each specific system is provided in the report. Testing for all implemented systems was conducted and verified using the design specifications as stated in the report. All systems have passed specified design criteria...|$|R
40|$|Members of an Ergonomic Change Team of a {{transport}} sector company utilised a participatory ergonomic approach to address several {{problems associated with}} courier mall delivery.

The impacts of these changes included decreased cumulative L 4 -L 5 output measures and shoulder moment during material handling seen through the elimination of double handling of boxes as well as elimination of the safety hazard of entering and exiting the trailer. A proposed mall cart redesign is also discussed demonstrating further potential improvements. Overall, the ECT introduced an ergonomic change that eliminated root causes of the problems, reduced the risk factors for injury...|$|R
50|$|Many {{unsatisfactory}} {{test flights}} showed that, because of interference between the propeller airstream and the wing, the engines {{needed to be}} both lowered {{in relation to the}} leading edge and moved further forward. These modifications were completed by February 1933 and by August the two aircraft, piloted by Jean-Charles Bernache-Assollant, were undergoing official technical trials with the STIAé; these ended in November, and the aircraft were returned to the factory for further modification. They were returned for official testing at the newly formed Centre d'Essais du Matériel Aérien, in the early summer of 1934, but both aircraft suffered serious damage to undercarriage legs caused by <b>locking</b> <b>brakes.</b> Though they were both returned to the factory for repair, they were instead eventually scrapped.|$|R

40|$|Monitoring gains {{importance}} for many technical {{systems such as}} robots, production lines or anti <b>lock</b> <b>brakes.</b> A monitoring system for technical systems {{must be able to}} deal with incomplete knowledge of the supervised system, to process noisy observations and to react within predefined time windows. This paper presents a new approach to monitoring technical systems based on imprecise models. Our approach repeatedly partitions the uncertainty space of an imprecise model and checks the derived model's state for consistency with the measurements. Inconsistent partitions are then refuted resulting in a smaller uncertainty space and a faster failure detection. This paper further focuses on the extension of our basic approach to monitoring systems that exhibit both continuous and discrete behaviors. Our monitoring system has been implemented using COTS components and has been demonstrated in online monitoring of a non-trivial heating system...|$|R
