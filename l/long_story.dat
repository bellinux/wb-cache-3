5|$|Charles Onyett of IGN {{found the}} {{gameplay}} enjoyable and {{enough to be}} appreciated by any genre fan. Yet he stated that if players were not Dragon Ball fans, then they will not {{want to play the}} game. Robert Thompson of Nintendojo felt that the game would satisfy fans of both the series and the genre, but he would complain about the ki and Sparking Combo attacks being repetitive, and the story shifting control of the characters, stating it could make unfamiliar gamers disoriented. Ryan Olsen of Kombo.com praised the battle system, calling it more engaging than the ones found in the average RPG. Still he would call the game a cut and dry RPG, calling the Active Guard system the only exotic aspect of the game. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report called the game vanilla with an interesting twists, stating that the fans should be the ones playing the game. He also drew comparisons of the Active Guard system to the Timed Hit system from Super Mario RPG, and Rage Gage to the Limit Break from Final Fantasy. Brittany Vincent of RPGFan would call side quests like Krillin's return home an added treat to the <b>long</b> <b>story.</b> She pointed out the game's difficulty being frustrating, stating that the game will cause players to revert to the start screen many times, yet is still beatable.|$|E

5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season of The Wire consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards <b>long</b> <b>story</b> arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E
25|$|The novella is {{generally}} not as formally experimental as the <b>long</b> <b>story</b> and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains something of the unity of impression that is {{a hallmark of the}} short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.|$|E

At the end both died together upon the long and lonely shore of a lake.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill {{was married}} to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910–1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a {{successful}} writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey after their marriage. The years of their marriage—during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona—are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of a <b>Long</b> <b>Story.</b> They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married {{less than a month}} after he officially divorced his previous wife.|$|E
25|$|In 1274 a {{long and}} {{expensive}} suit was begun between the prior and convent of Dunstable and Eudo la Zouche, who had become lord of Houghton and Eaton Bray by his marriage with Millicent de Cantelow. Eudo refused to recognise {{the rights of the}} prior (established not only by charter, but by long custom) to a gallows and prison in Houghton; he released one of his men from the prison and overthrew the gallows. Under the next prior, William le Breton, the gallows was restored; but Eudo still refused to recognise the prison as the prior's right, and presently erected a gallows of his own. The dispute went on for some years, and, after the death of Eudo, was continued by his wife Millicent until the year 1289, when it was finally decided in favour of the prior. The poverty and difficulties of the house went on increasing, although great efforts were made, after the deposition of William le Breton and other officers of the monastery in 1279, to curtail expenses and get in ready money for the payment of debts. Corrodies and chantries were granted to several persons, manors and churches were let out to farm, and in the year 1294 the usual allowance for one canon was made to serve for two. It was just at this time that the king was asking for subsidies for his Welsh war. By an accumulation of misfortune, in the same winter the outer walls of the priory had collapsed in the wet weather, and their hayricks had been destroyed by fire; and the tithes due to the Hospitallers from North Marston church were in such long arrears that a new arrangement had to be made to pay them off. In 1295 the house at Bradbourne was so poor that all the wool produced there had to be granted to the support of the three brethren who served the church and chapels. The later pages of the annals are a <b>long</b> <b>story</b> of poverty and struggle to get clear of debt; and the continuous narrative ends dismally enough with the account of the expenses of the installation of John of Cheddington, which amounted (with the addition of the debts of the previous prior) to £242 8s. 4d.|$|E
500|$|In 1997 American poet Frank Bidart wrote Desire, {{which was}} another retelling {{of the myth}} of Myrrha as it was {{presented}} in the Metamorphoses by Ovid. The case of Myrrha, critic Langdon Hammer notes, is the worst possible made against desire, because the story of Myrrha shows how sex can lead people to destroy others as well as themselves. He comments that [...] "the [...] "precious bitter resin" [...] into which Myrrha's tears are changed tastes bitter and sweet, like Desire as a whole". He further writes: [...] "The inescapability of desire makes Bidart's <b>long</b> <b>story</b> of submission to it a kind of affirmation. Rather than aberrant, the Ovidian characters come to feel exemplary".|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Martin gave to his agent, Kirby McCauley, {{the first}} 200 pages and a two-page story {{projection}} {{as part of}} a planned trilogy with the novels A Dance with Dragons and The Winds of Winter intended to follow. When Martin had still not reached the novel's end at 1400 manuscript pages, he felt that the series needed to be four and eventually six books long, which he imagined as two linked trilogies of one <b>long</b> <b>story.</b> Martin chose A Song of Ice and Fire as the overall series title: Martin saw the struggle of the cold Others and the fiery dragons as one possible meaning for [...] "Ice and Fire", whereas the word [...] "song" [...] had previously appeared in Martin's book titles A Song for Lya and Songs the Dead Men Sing, stemming from his obsessions with songs. Martin also named Robert Frost's 1920 poem [...] "Fire and Ice" [...] and cultural associations such as passion versus betrayal as possible influences for the series' title.|$|E
500|$|Two {{minutes and}} {{fourteen}} seconds into the song, a vocal glitch is present as Spears sings the lyrics [...] "and {{the light in}} your eyes", over which Orbit revealed that [...] "there is actually a <b>long</b> <b>story</b> behind all of this which [...] would love to tell", and noted that [...] "what {{has been called the}} ‘demo’ is not in fact the actual original demo." [...] Orbit joked about the matter, saying that the true cause of the glitch is that they [...] "were kidnapped by Aliens and actually spent a year on their ship making friends, doing shows, creating Alien music [...] Then we travelled back to 2:14 in the track, with just that glitch to show for it." [...] On January 25, 2014, Orbit hinted on Twitter that the glitch might be a fail of production held by the album's executive producer, will.i.am: [...] "Remember 'Glitchgate'?

In a March 2000 article for Game Studies, Diane Carr called the setting [...] "a freak show, a <b>long</b> <b>story,</b> a zoo, and a cabinet of talkative curiosities" [...] and described the creatures and monsters in the game as [...] "grotesque rather than scary". [...] Cindy Yans of Computer Games Magazine describes the setting as [...] "a world where knowledge and thoughts wield more power than the sword. Belief has the ability to reshape worlds, kill and resurrect powers and change the laws of physics." [...] Cindy Vanous of Computer Games Magazine notes that [...] "Planescapes bestiary features legions of the unknown, and its landscape is an ever-changing tapestry of the bizarre."

500|$|Throughout the 1980s, George Lucas remarked he had {{no desire}} to return to Star Wars and had unofficially {{canceled}} his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. Because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him. In the early 1990s, Star Wars saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film. In 1993, it was announced in Variety and other sources that he would be making the prequels. Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the main protagonist and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series, [...] "filling-in" [...] the history, backstory, existing parallel or tangential to the originals and beginning a <b>long</b> <b>story</b> that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} sought to be {{different}} from the previous series of Enterprise in the way that story arcs worked. In the earlier series there was the ongoing Temporal Cold War plot, with the Xindi attack {{at the end of the}} second season resulting in a season <b>long</b> <b>story</b> arc during season three. Instead season four was split up into several smaller arcs which had been planned before the start of the season. The first of these arcs was a resolution to the long running Temporal Cold War, with Braga stating that the intention was [...] "to resolve ... once and for all". This would also mark the final appearance of the Suliban in Enterprise as they were tied into that storyline. However, the episodes wrapping up the cold war did not reveal the identity of [...] "future guy", the person from the future who was advising the Suliban. Braga explained in a pre-season interview that [...] "Well, we've been debating that for quite some time, and I'll leave that question open. We haven't decided yet. We have some ideas about him — or her — or it. But we haven't settled on any one identity yet. It's still a question mark." [...] The identity of [...] "future guy" [...] was later revealed by Braga on Twitter as Archer from the future.|$|E

500|$|Like most {{episodes of}} Parks and Recreation, {{a great deal}} of the scenes in [...] "Boys' Club" [...] were improvised by the actors.

Schur thought the line was [...] "my {{favorite}} thing in the show", and they made him say in it every subsequent take during filming. Aziz Ansari also improvised a majority of the scene in which he helped Leslie prepare for her ethics board review. Dean Holland, Parks and Recreations editor, said it was his favorite scene from the entire first season. Amy Poehler improvised the line at the courtyard gathering, after she accidentally spilled several beer bottles, [...] "I feel like I'm already in the boys' club. Look at those bitches cleanin' up after me." [...] Schur said the line helped develop Leslie's character in future episodes because [...] "we realized that Leslie can be a little bit cooler than we had originally thought". The scene with Ron describing his ideal government was written for a different episode, but was moved to [...] "Boys' Club" [...] when the producers decided it fit better there. Schur said it was his favorite moment in the episode. [...] "Boys' Club" [...] ends with Leslie and Mark toasting a beer to each other because Schur said, [...] "It's a running joke in the writer's room that every episode should end with clinking beers." ...|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} <b>long</b> <b>story</b> arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You have to ask yourself, in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E
