40|$|In {{this thesis}} the optical changes of beers and model beer {{solutions}} during their photodegradation were studied. The optical changes - change of absorbance - were measured on {{the prototype of}} apparatus COLORTURB and were correlated with sensory tested intensity of the <b>lightstruck</b> <b>flavour</b> of beer and with riboflavin content in samples. High correlation between the <b>lightstruck</b> <b>flavour</b> intensity, the loss of absorbance at the wavelength of 450 nm and the riboflavin content loss was found. The partial recovery of the absorbance for both beers and model beer solutions was found and was attributed to the riboflavin photoproducts transformation. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|Beer brewing is an {{intricate}} process encompassing mixing and further elaboration of four essential raw materials, including barley malt, brewing water, hops and yeast. Particularly hops determine {{to a great}} extent typical beer qualities such as bitter taste, hoppy flavour, and foam stability. Conversely, hop-derived bitter acids account for an offending <b>lightstruck</b> <b>flavour,</b> which is formed on exposure of beer to light. These various processes are presented in detail, while due emphasis is placed on state-of-the-art hop technology, which provides brewers with efficient means to control bitterness, foam, and light-stability thereby allowing for the production of beers with consistent quality...|$|E
