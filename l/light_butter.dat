40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the consumption determinants of <b>light</b> <b>butter</b> in Portugal, which is a product that contains fat substitutes in its formulation. Specifically uncover the motives behind its consumption and non-consumption, based on socio demographic and behavior variables. This study is divided in two stages, in the first one a bibliographical research centered on the motives underlying food consumption and fat substitutes in light food was conducted. Afterwards a questionnaire was handled to a population of 249, whose results were subsequently analyzed with the aim of answering the questions to which this work is proposed. The most important conclusions were; about 25 % of the population never tried any kind of <b>light</b> <b>butter,</b> sex and age doesn’t influence the consumption but the frequency of it, females tend to consume <b>light</b> <b>butter</b> more often, as well as, persons with at least one child. The most important factors perceived by the population regarding <b>light</b> <b>butter</b> are the well-being and health, and the heavy reasons why people don’t consume it more often is the flavor and the wrong notion of a higher pric...|$|E

5000|$|The {{road from}} Bumthang or Jakar to the Rimochen Lhakhang passing though rugged terrain has many {{historical}} monuments of great religious significance, {{starting with the}} visit of Padmasambhava to the area or the location. Initially, after crossing a bridge across the Bumtang Chuu, the road goes down to Dechen Pelrithang (a sheep rearing farm, at an elevation of 2800 m), then passes the famous Mebartsho gorge (the place in which treasure was found by Rimpoche in the river at deep depths under severe visibility constraints diving down with a <b>lighted</b> <b>butter</b> lamp, and hence named as the [...] "Blazing Fire Lake") of the Tang valley. It then climbs steeply and reaches the Kungzandra Monastery, a site originally visited by Padmasambhava in the 8th century and later became a monastery 1488 under Pema Lingpa, and three more temples (Wangkhang, Ozerphuk and Khandroma Lhakhang) before reaching the Rimochen Monastery, named after Padmasambava's markings on a large rock.|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} types of polish commercial <b>butters,</b> namely: <b>light,</b> regular and high fat content were under study. Studied samples were stored at two different temperatures (5 or 20 °C) {{for a period of}} 8 weeks. Measurements of the content of fat, water, Acid Value (AV) and Peroxide Value (PV) were determined in the fresh butter and at one week interval. The AV and PV were determined by the conventional titrimetric method. IR spectra of every sample were registered. The relation between the AV values obtained by titration and by spectral measurements were studied by the Partially Least Square (PLS) regression, to built a statistical model for rapid determination of acid value. Two independent models, one for <b>light</b> type <b>butters</b> (model I) and the second one for regular and high fat content butters (model II) were calibrated. The characteristic parameters of the models are: R 2 = 0. 97, PRESS (Prediction Residual Error Sum of Squares) = 2. 91, factors number = 5 and R 2 = 0. 84, PRESS = 3. 64, factors number = 6, for model I and model II, respectively. The developed models correctly predict acid values of unknown samples of {{different types}} of butters...|$|R
30|$|The temple {{economy at}} Vijayanagar {{and in many}} temple cities in the empire, was tied to the {{charities}} of the king. Its dynamic workings on temple economics and political power can be understood {{with the help of}} royal images within the built environment of temple cities in the capital city of Vijayangar. Dividing the city on the basis of natural and man-made features, Michell and others distinguish two major zones, the sacred center which is {{in the northern part of}} the city, and a royal center, within the innermost fortification, within an urban core. 18 The sacred center is dominated by four large temple complexes: the Virupaksa, Krisna, Tiruvengalanatha (or Acyuta Raya) and Vitthala temples. These large temple complexes, or cities (puras) were known by the name of the temple; thus there is the Virupaksapura, Krisnapura, Vitthalapura and Tiruvengalanathapura (or Acyutarayapura) The main feature of a pura is the large temple complex with its high enclosure walls and towered gateways, approached by a long chariot street flanked on both sides by shops (angadi), which functioned as a bazaar. 19 The architectural assemblage of the temple cities of Krisnapura, Vitthalapura, Virupaksapura and Tiruvengalanathapura, were agro-urban creations. These complexes were built from large grants made by kings and nobles. Distinguished by a large enclosure within which were tanks, wells, schools, they were entered through a towered gate and approached by a long colonnade street which functioned as a market or bazaar for the exchange of goods. In these markets along the chariot streets, were sold gold, rubies, pearls, diamonds openly in the bazaars. 20 In fact, each temple complex was surrounded by an agricultural hinterland, residences, craft industries, markets and water facilities which were strongly tied to local economy. The temples particularly in the sacred center, utilized a variety of food articles, including coconut, rice, turmeric, incense, leaves, flowers, <b>lights,</b> <b>butter,</b> salt, pepper, betel leaves and nut, oil, mustard, sugar, plantain leaves, flowers, lamps, butter, salt, pepper, mustard, pulses, sugar, bananas, firewood, cotton clothing, as well as articles from foreign markets, musk, camphor, saffron for the multiple functions of worship, ritual celebration, teaching and feeding. Indirectly, the demand promoted industries such as cotton, jewelry and stone workers. The important industries that grew around Vijayanagar temple towns were those of artisans, weavers, oil pressers, ceramic vessels, textiles, jewelry, armor, weapons, stone carvers, leather workers, barbers, potters and washers. The temples even constructed the road system for effective transportation of food and distribution of goods around the capital, thereby playing a significant role in the urban landscape in the temple cities or puras in the capital city of Vijayanagar.|$|R
