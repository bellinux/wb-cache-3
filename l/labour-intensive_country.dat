40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of trade liberalisation on the firm-level profit-enhancing effects of mergers and its dependence on whether the technology is labour intensive or capital-intensive, under an oligopolistic competition framework. Mergers, as considered in this paper, cause an increase in the firm-level profits. The extent to which they enhance the profits is inversely proportional to the number of firms in the country. With a freer trade, the profit effect of mergers depends on the extent to which the fall in profit due to fall in price outweighs the gain in profit due to increased output. A firm in the capital-intensive country can gain more from a merger than one in the <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>country,</b> if the aggregate output is at sufficiently large scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effects of trade liberalization on profits of a capital-intensive exporting country and a labour-intensive one with different cost functions and the welfare of the importing country under an oligopolistic competition framework. The results show that output is increasing in the degree of trade liberalization and price falls with it. However, the effects of freer trade on profits of the exporting countries are ambiguous and depend on the net gains in profit from free trade. Given the same level of output for both countries, a suffciently high output would bring more profits to the capital-intensive country than to the <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>country.</b> Welfare of the importing country, at least within this framework, is increasing in the degree of trade liberalization, provided that the initial level of restrictions in trade are not too high. ...|$|E

Even in the poorest countries in the world, {{the share of the}} population with access to telecommunications and the Internet has increased at double-digit growth rates during the last few years. Privatisation, deregulation and liberalisation of trade and investment in the service sectors have further contributed to this development. The paper analyses the impact of better access to information services on development. For this purpose a two-country model of trade in differentiated intermediate services, which captures some of the most significant properties of information services is developed, and the effects of better access to information services under various assumptions on technology, preferences and relative size of the two countries are explored. Our results suggest that there are significant welfare gains from liberalisation of trade and investment in information services, and that small, poor or <b>labour-intensive</b> <b>countries</b> gain the most in all our scenarios. Small developing countries will benefit a lot from better access to information services, while developing countries in which consumers have relatively low preference for information-intensive goods are less likely to obtain large benefits. It is further shown that improvements of infrastructure and increases in human capital in one country improve welfare in both countries. Thus, investments in rich countries to some extent spill over to poorer countries, which get access to a broader variety of services. We finally derive the welfare optimum and the taxes that reproduce the social optimum as a competitive equilibrium...|$|R
50|$|Mr Lim Chee Onn, then Secretary-General of NTUC, {{considered}} May Day 1980 as {{a significant}} milestone {{in the history of}} Singapore’s labour movement’s development for two reasons. Firstly, it marked the beginning of a national effort to transform the <b>country’s</b> <b>labour-intensive</b> economy to one driven by middle-technology industris and a high-skilled labour force. Secondly, it signified the start of a plan by Singapore’s union movement to enhance the status of unionists.|$|R
40|$|Poor {{countries}} must {{specialize in}} standardized, <b>labour-intensive</b> commodities. Middle-income <b>countries</b> {{may have a}} richer menu of options available to them if their labour force is reasonably well-educated and skilled. This paper is motivated by {{the possibility that there}} may exist multiple specialization patterns for countries of the second type. What creates the multiplicity of equilibria is a coordination problem inherent in high-tech activities. It is assumed that high-tech production requires a range of differentiated intermediate inputs that are non-tradable. For the high-tech sector to become viable, a sufficiently large number of intermediates has to be produced domestically. But if none is currently being produced, there is little incentive for any single firm to do so on its own. The economy may get stuck in a low-wage, low-tech equilibrium [...] even though the high-tech sector is viable. As long as the high-tech sector is more capital-intensive than the low-tech sector, a high-wage policy would stimulate the high-tech sector and be welfare-enhancing.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} roles of {{comparative}} advantage and market size in the international location of manufacturing production. Building on the conventional Helpman and Krugman (1985) general equilibrium framework, our analysis extends the present literature by incorporating both effects in the same model, while allowing trade costs to vary almost continuously from autarky to free trade. The main result of our exercise is that market size effects offset comparative advantage if countries have similar factor proportions. A large country with a slight comparative disadvantage in manufacturing production may thus be a net exporter of manufactures. A small country with the same comparative disadvantage would be a net importer of manufactures. When countries are very dissimilar in their relative factor endowments, land-abundant countries specialize {{in the production of}} food, irrespective of market size, if manufactures are a <b>labour-intensive</b> sector. Labour-rich <b>countries</b> of any size are manufacture cores. However, land-abundant countries with large markets can sustain a domestic manufacturing industry until trade costs are very low, and in some cases only specialize in agriculture at free trade.

Incorporating the most recent data available, this volume provides valuable analysis of the current labour market trends around the world and identifies the factors contributing to the downturn affecting many workers today. The impact of the global economic slowdown and the developments since 11 September 2001 have been different in the various regions of the world, and this report reveals how women and young people have been especially hard hit, particularly in the developing world. Covering Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia, South-East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the transition economies and industrialized countries, this volume focuses on the distinct labour market characteristics and challenges faced by each region and economic group. The report traces the various factors contributing to the global employment decline - such as the increase in employment in the informal economy, the decrease in employment in the informal economy, the decrease in employment in information and communication technology, as well as extensive job losses in the travel and tourism industries and the export and <b>labour-intensive</b> manufacturing sectors. <b>Countries</b> in fragile financial situations and those experiencing armed conflict and violence have also seen rising unemployment and poverty.

40|$|South Africa is a <b>labour-intensive</b> industrially {{developing}} <b>country.</b> As a result, {{in excess}} of 200 000 workers suffer from musculoskeletal injuries in a year. Research is thus essential to develop more effective strategies in the reduction and rehabilitation of occupational musculoskeletal disorders within industry. It was the hypothesis of this study that by improving the physical work capacity of manual labourers, through participation in an occupationspecific work-hardening programme, that the ergonomic stress index and therefore the occurrence of musculoskeletal injuries within industry, may be reduced. Twenty-five male Black and Coloured manual labourers volunteered {{to participate in this}} study. In addition to in situ task analyses, the subjects participated in cardiovascular and strength assessments in the laboratory, both pre- and post-participation in the ten-week work-hardening programme. The data were statistically analyzed in order to identify any significant • improvements in the workers' physical work capacity, as measured by cardiovascular, strength and perceptual responses, following the period of work-hardening. Two significant reductions were noted in measures of working heart rate together with significant improvements in grip strength and trunk strength tested at a velocity of 60 °. sec· 1 at the post-conditioning assessments. In conclusion, the ten-week work-hardening programme resulted in nominal improvements in all the cardiovascular measures and significant improvements in the subjects' strength performance. However, industrialists must recognise that this study dealt with only one aspect of reducing the ergonomic stress index at the workplace and realise that, in addition to this focus, it remains essential to design the task to fit the human operator.

40|$|Excerpt] Since {{the first}} issue of this report in January 2003, a slow {{economic}} upturn has once again resulted in a deteriorating global employment situation. For the second time, this report provides a valuable analysis of current labour market trends around the world. It incorporates the most recent information available, shedding light on possible factors contributing to the downturn affecting many workers today. The impacts of the sluggish global recovery in 2003, of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and its effect on tourism, of the ongoing conflict in Iraq and of the worldwide threat of terrorism have been different in different regions of the world, and this report reveals how women and young people have – once again – been especially hard hit, particularly in the developing world. Covering Latin America and the Caribbean, East Asia, South-East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the transition economies and industrialized countries, this volume focuses on the distinct labour market characteristics and challenges faced by each region and economic group. The report traces the various factors contributing to the global employment decline – such as the increase in employment in the informal economy, the decrease in employment in information and communication technology, as well as extensive job losses in travel and tourism and in the export and <b>labour-intensive</b> manufacturing sectors. <b>Countries</b> in fragile financial situations and those experiencing armed conflict and violence have also seen rising unemployment and poverty.

40|$|A broad {{stream of}} {{management}} literature {{has focused on}} resource-based firm strategies for achieving competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Conner, 1991; Peteraf, 1993; Wernerfelt, 1984). However, relatively little is known on when and how these strategic resources {{can and should be}} activated. Gaining a head-start over competitors requires timely responsiveness, reaction to market intelligence as well as rapid and flexible product innovation (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Brockhoff, 1997). At the same time, competitive pressures from globalisation have forced firms to make every effort to streamline and rationalise their workflow (Franko, 1989). This has often led to outsourcing and offshoring strategies, that is, the shift of <b>labour-intensive</b> manufacturing to <b>countries</b> with significantly lower labour costs in order to decrease product prices (Teece et at., 1997). Some - and not by coincidence the most successful - companies in their sector, however, have created their own approach to coping with this situation. Spanish fashion retailer ZARA, for example, has been the prototype for a new kind of competitive strategy. It competes within the market in a dynamic manner through its rapid launch of new products. We call this a rapid response capability, which is also referred to in the literature as dynamic capabilities (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Hoopes et at., 2003). More precisely, we explore its roots and antecedents to discover how firms may create and take advantage of employing such capability. This is particularly interesting as the development of rapid response capabilities is an important way to overcome competition based on price/cost advantages through speed and flexibility (Berger, 2006). Building on Nelson and Winter's (1982) view of organisations as a nexus of operational and administrative routines, we define rapid response capabilities specifically as a result of learning mechanisms directed at matching internal strategic resources with the external strategic context (Zollo and Winter, 2002). The goal of this analysis is twofold. First of all, we aim to develop a theoretical framework dealing with this particular type of capability whilst testing it empirically. As Helfat and Peteraf (2003 : 997) argued, 'it is difficult to fully explain how firms use resources and capabilities to create a competitive advantage', we provide some initial indications for management on the understanding of rapid response capability development. Our study is designed to, first of all, provide a conceptual framework with accompanying hypotheses. It also presents our empirical study that validates our hypotheses. In addition, the results of this quantitative analysis are also provided here. Based on these results, we discuss our findings on rapid response capabilities and, finally, we offer our concluding remarks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the competitiveness}} of the manufacturing industry in the CEE candidate countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia) with special emphasis on trade with the European Union {{during the second half}} of the 1990 s. Changing specialization patterns, the evolution of sectoral trade balances and market shares, as well as price/quality gaps at detailed product level, are used as indicators of trade competitiveness. The CEE candidate countries' market share in extra-EU manufacturing imports grew from 9. 5 % in 1995 to 11. 4 % in 1999, the EU export surplus in manufacturing trade is diminishing. Candidate countries' exports to the EU have been increasingly specialized on a few key industries textiles and textile products, basic metals and fabricated metal products, electrical & optical equipment and transport equipment; in the Baltic states also on wood and wood products. The manufacturing industry in Slovakia features the highest number of branches with a trade surplus while the weakest competitive position in trade with the EU has been identified for the manufacturing industry in Slovenia, Poland and Latvia. Textiles, wood products, basic metals and furniture were identified as branches where candidate countries enjoy revealed comparative advantages (RCAs) in trade with the EU. Apart from chemicals, rubber and plastic products, nearly all candidate countries show negative RCAs also in pulp and paper, machinery and equipment n. e. c. and electrical and optical equipment. Technology-driven industries account for a growing share of exports in nearly all candidate <b>countries,</b> <b>labour-intensive</b> industries have growing export shares in Bulgaria, Romania and the Baltic states. The representation of labour-intensive industries in candidate countries' exports to the EU is still - with the notable exception of Hungary - much bigger than in the present EU member states; the representation of technology-driven industries in candidate countries' exports to the EU is usually smaller (Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovakia are exceptions). Nevertheless, the initial export specialization pattern of CEE candidate countries has nearly completely reversed in many candidate countries export specialization is evolving towards more sophisticated and less capital-intensive industries. Labour-intensive industries accounted for a major part of competitive export gains in Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. Finally, using very detailed information on export unit prices, an analysis of the 'quality' of candidate countries' export products shows that there were substantial price gaps between CEE producers and EU incumbents over the 1990 s. However, some countries have closed these gaps (Hungary and Slovenia in particular), while others maintain very substantial price gaps (Bulgaria and Romania in particular). The largest price/quality gaps are found in 'technology-driven' and 'mainstream' industries, as well as in 'high-skill-intensive branches'; the lowest price gaps in capital-intensive and low-skill-intensive branches. Over time, however, the strongest 'quality catching-up' can be observed in 'technology-driven' and 'high-skill-intensive' industries. Again, Hungary occupies the position of an 'outlier' amongst the candidate countries, especially with regard to 'quality catching-up' in the 'technology-driven' and skill-intensive industries.

40|$|To {{date the}} SADC region {{has managed to}} develop a {{manufacturing}} base but this base is still small as evidenced by its low contribution to GDP. For example, only three out of the fourteen SADC countries, viz. Mauritius, South Africa and Swaziland, had over 20 percent of their GDP originating from the manufacturing sector throughout the 1990 s. Also to note {{is that while the}} manufacturing sector is quite diversified, the sector is dominated by industrial processes which are more of resource and labour-intensive in nature than those processes of scale-intensive, differentiated and science based in nature. TIle trade performance of the manufacturing sector supports these observations and as such the region is heavily dependent on imports for scale-intensive, differentiated and science based commodities. However, {{despite the fact that the}} region tends to focus more on resource- and labour-intensive manufacturing activities, products from these manufacturing activities are still significant components of manufactured goods imports into the region. Also to note is that since resource- and labour-intensive industries dominate manufacturing activities; these are the areas in which investment opportunities abound. For example, agro-based manufacturing presents most of the investment opportunities, with food processing presenting the majority of the investment opportunities followed by garments and textiles production. Mineral processing also presents significant investment opportunities. The analyses of the nature of the manufacturing sector also show that in a few SADC countries, viz. Mauritius, South Africa and Zimbabwe; scale-intensive, differentiated and science based industries also form a significant component of the industrial base implying more technologically complex manufacturing sectors. Since high technology and technologically complex manufacturing activities are limited, investment opportunities in these manufacturing sub-sectors are also limited to just a few countries However, with the SADC ITA in place, opportunities could arise for these limited technology-related manufacturing facilities to expand or engage in import substitution production so as to meet the demands of the growing regional market. It is also important to note that, while the region may not have as competitive advantage in these industries as in the resource- and labour-intensive industries, there is a need for the region to selectively identify and target such industries for priority development, a lesson SADC could learn from the East Asian NIC's took in their industrialisation strategy. The study also shows that the manufacturing sector has been a priority sector for both domestic and foreign investors. This has implications for industrial development because a strong and dynamic manufacturing sector would be developed, forming a sound basis for industrialisation as well as being able to effectively link and support all the other sectors of the economy. FDI could help the region to fully utilise the labour-intensive industries and use them as a stepping-stone to higher levels of industrial development. This is a lesson to SADC from the experiences of the East Asian NICs where while industrialisation was initiated by <b>labour-intensive</b> manufacturing, the <b>countries</b> were able to move into capital-intensive manufacturing due to FDI as it enabled the establishment of the industrial bases, thus leading to a rise in the share of manufactured exports. FDI could also help to develop the resource-intensive industries further by promoting further processing of raw materials into products of more value, thus propelling industrialisation through a resource-led industrial development programme as the current resource-intensive industries become fully utilised. The raw materials which occur in great abundance in the region's primary sector would have a ready market in the manufacturing sector where they would serve as inputs to the production of high value products. The currently smaller industrial base for scale-intensive products, differentiated and science-based manufactured products would benefit from the improved technological capabilities and managerial skills that result from FDI. Therefore, by impacting positively on manufacturing activities of both low and high MVA, FDI would thus have a facilitating role in establishing a more solid industrial base, broadening the current manufacturing base, and improving installed capacity utilisation. The study also shows that investment in productive capacity in the form of machinery and equipment is of great importance in the sampled SADC countries. Investment towards the acquisition of this capital is very important as this is directly relevant towards improving productive capacity. FDI could thus play a facilitating role by augmenting the current domestic investment in machinery and equipment. While the manufacturing sector within the region is still small and the current utilisation of installed industrial capacity is low, there is potential for further industrial growth. The current process to usher in the SADC Free Trade Area would have a facilitating role through various ways: viz. increasing the market size and enabling easier access through the reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers, promoting regional competitiveness, improved utilisation of regional corridors, increasing opportunities for utilising identified intra-industry trade potentials, and providing opportunities for increased regional cross-border investment. Apart from the SADC FTA, the USA African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the Cotonou Agreement will also motivate the identification and utilisation of existing and new potentials within the manufacturing sector in SADC. In order to improve the current nature of industries in the region, there is also a need to design and implement appropriate industrial policies and strategies. Such policies should consider the region's trade policies and the recently launched Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (RISDP) so as to complement them. The industrial policies should also address issues relating to industrial investment, technology and local technological capabilities development, human resources development, the structure and nature of industry, the competitiveness of industries, as well as facilitating the complementarities between the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. To this end therefore, instead of relying solely on individual national industrial policies, SADC is in the process of formulating a regional industrial policy and strategies which seek to promote and support sustainable industrial growth across the region, thus facilitating industrial development...|$|R
