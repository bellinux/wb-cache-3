5|$|As {{there were}} only six seismometers {{operating}} in Washington state and western British Columbia even as late as 1969, there are insufficient instrumental records for older events in the region. Focal depths are unknown for shocks that occurred before that time, but seismologists Bakun et al. concluded that the event occurred on a shallow fault {{on the east side}} of the Cascade Range. They employed a method that was developed by W. H. Bakun and C. M. Wentworth for using earthquake intensity information that could be mapped to a corresponding moment magnitude. The intensities for twelve 20th-century Pacific Northwest earthquakes were used for calibration before analyzing the known intensities for the 1872 event in an attempt to resolve the location and magnitude. The reports were interpreted in a way that placed the epicenter near the south end of Lake Chelan, but other considerations <b>left</b> <b>other</b> plausible focal points both north and northeast of the lake. The magnitude was estimated to be 6.5–7.0 with 95% confidence.|$|E
5|$|Some {{distinctive}} {{characteristics in}} Garamond's letterforms are an 'e' {{with a small}} eye and the bowl of the 'a' which has a sharp hook upwards at top <b>left.</b> <b>Other</b> general features are limited but clear stroke contrast and capital letters {{on the model of}} Roman square capitals. The 'M' is slightly splayed with outward-facing serifs at the top (sometimes only on the left) and the leg of the 'R' extends outwards from the letter. The x-height (height of lower-case letters) is low, especially at larger sizes, making the capitals large relative to the lower case, while the top serifs on the ascenders of letters like 'd' have a downward slope and ride above the cap height. The axis of letters like the ‘o’ is diagonal and the bottom right of the italic 'h' bends inwards.|$|E

25|$|ASIO {{has been}} accused of {{executing}} an agenda against the Left of politics since its inception. In the 1960s, ASIO was also accused of neglecting its proper duties because of this supposed preoccupation with targeting the Left. Like other Western domestic security agencies, ASIO actively monitored protesters against the Vietnam War, Labor politicians and various writers, artists and actors who tended towards the <b>Left.</b> <b>Other</b> claims go further, alleging that the Organisation compiled a list of some 10,000 suspected Communist sympathisers who would be interned should the Cold War escalate.|$|E

500|$|The rest of {{the island}} is {{composed}} of {{a great variety of}} Paleozoic rocks of sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic origin. Along the west coast lie the Long Range Mountains, which are formed by an elongated block of the Earth's crust (a horst) which rises to about [...] above sea level. This part of the island was once part of the eastern margin of continental North America. The island's highest points, the Lewis Hills and [...] Gros Morne are located within this mountain range. To the east is a depression or graben about [...] wide, which is occupied by Deer Lake and Grand Lake. The main plateau of {{the central part of the}} island, which was once the sea bottom of the ancient Iapetus Ocean, has been heavily eroded by water and ice. Steep, solitary rock knobs, called [...] "tolts" [...] in Newfoundland (elsewhere known as inselbergs or monadnocks), which jut [...] or more above the generally flat terrain are the remnants of a former higher landscape level. Glaciers which helped shape these tolts <b>left</b> <b>other</b> evidence around Newfoundland. Large blocks of stone called glacial erratics have been left scattered across much of the landscape. The long narrow lakes of the west coast, notably those in Gros Morne National Park resulted from glacial erosion. The lack of good soil on most parts of the island is a result of the scouring effect of glaciers during the most recent ice age. Newfoundland's nickname, [...] "The Rock", is partially a result of the ice ages.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had <b>left</b> <b>other</b> jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a very scary time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987 Vainio {{concentrated}} on 10,000 metres and ran 27:42.65 in Helsinki on 2 July. The World Championships 10,000 metres race {{ended in a}} farce. The {{first half of the}} race was slow, 5000 metres lap time being only 14:13.07. At 5800 metres, Paul Kipkoech changed pace and <b>left</b> <b>other</b> runners behind. Francesco Panetta, Salvatore Antibo and Vainio started their pursuit a little bit later and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently, Kipkoech was far ahead of the other runners and the officials decremented the lap table, which displays the remaining laps for the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps, started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their [...] "first finish", but Vainio was too tired to realize the situation. Vainio also competed in the Marathon, but after a fairly good start he did not finish. At the Track & Field News annual world ranking, Vainio was recognized as the seventh best runner in 10,000 metres.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} (FDR) was an antiquated analog model which used metal foil strips scratched by moving pins. Here, it did not record vertical acceleration readings and misrecorded heading indications. One needle recorded some lines twice, initially confusing the investigators, leading the team to send the FDR to the American company which manufactured it. The manufacturer asked an ex-employee, the highest expert regarding the company's {{flight data recorder}}s, to temporarily leave retirement to examine the recorder. The expert concluded that the needle {{supposed to have been}} recording the altitude had been shaking so much that it <b>left</b> <b>other</b> stray marks on the foil. This particular FDR was able to record for hundreds of hours; further investigations found that the needle had been shaking abnormally for months. This told investigators that another component, not just the APU with the broken mount, had also been vibrating. The investigators charted the vibrations and found that two months before the crash, the vibrations stopped for two weeks, since during that period the aircraft received a major overhaul in Canada by the airline's previous owner. Afterward, the vibrations increased up to the accident flight. During the Canadian company's test flights of the aircraft and its first several passenger flights for Partnair, the FDR recorded almost no abnormal vibrations. A review of the maintenance records of the aircraft revealed that during the overhaul, the mechanic discovered wear on one of the four bolts and sleeves that held the vertical fin and fuselage together and replaced them. The vibrations stopped after the parts were replaced, but gradually worsened afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|During the Rhodesian Bush War, {{almost the}} entire white male {{population}} between eighteen and fifty-eight was affected by various military commitments, and individuals spent up to five or {{six months of the}} year on combat duty away from their normal occupations in the civil service, commerce, industry, or agriculture. These long periods of service in the field led to an increased emigration of men of military age. In November 1963, state media cited the chief reasons for emigration as uncertainty about the future, economic decline due to embargo and war, and the heavy commitments of national service, which was described as [...] "the overriding factor causing people to leave". Of the male emigrants in 1976 about half fell into the 15 to 39 age bracket. Between 1960 and 1976 160,182 whites immigrated, while 157,724 departed. This dynamic turnover rate led to depressions in the property market, a slump in the construction industry, and a decline in retail sales. The number of white Rhodesians peaked in 1975 at 278,000 and rapidly declined as the bush war intensified. In 1976 around 14,000 whites left the country, marking the first year since Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 that more whites had left the country than arrived, with most leaving for South Africa. This became known as the 'chicken run', the earliest use of which was recorded the following year, [...] often by Rhodesians who remained to contemptuously describe those who had <b>left.</b> <b>Other</b> phrases such as 'taking the gap' or 'gapping it' were also used. As the outward flow increased, the phrase 'owl run' also came into use as leaving the country was deemed by many to be a wise choice. Disfavour with the biracial Zimbabwe Rhodesia administration in 1979 also contributed to a mass exodus.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 Akil joined John Liebeskind, an {{assistant}} professor at UCLA who was interested in the neurobiology of pain, and more specifically focused on the neural circuitry of phantom pain, and the idea that phantom pain was not a purely physical phenomenon, but had a psychological role as well. Another member of the lab observed that electrical stimulation reduced, rather than enhanced pain experience, which inspired Akil and fellow graduate student, David Mayer, to continue to research this phenomenon, which they later referred to as “stimulation produced analgesia" [...] (SPA). Working on rats, they found that stimulation at several mesencephalic and diencephalic sites eradicated responsiveness to painful stimuli and <b>left</b> <b>other</b> sensory modes relatively unaffected. This idea of SPA became the topic of Akil’s Ph.D. dissertation. Further research in this area was conducted in the rat by employing the D'Amour and Smith tail flick test in order to investigate role played by the cerebral monoamines, dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Akil and colleagues used four different approaches to alter transmission in monoamine pathways: depletion of monoamine stores, replacement of depleted monoamine stores, potentiation of monamine systems, and blockade of catecholamine receptors; the four approaches produced internally consistent results. In 1977, they discovered that the narcotic antagonist naloxone partially reverses analgesia produced by focal electrical stimulation of the brain. [...] In this study analgesia was produced in the periaqueductal gray matter, which is an area of the brain that is known to contain a large number of opiate binding sites. This study along with results from other studies conducted at the time suggested that there is a natural neural system in the brain, which uses a morphine-like substance to produce analgesia, however it was not known if the activation of this system was brought about pharmacologically by direct receptor stimulation or electrically by release of the endogenous substance.|$|E
2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has <b>left</b> <b>other</b> tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E
