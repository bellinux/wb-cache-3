5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (<b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash {{crops such as}} cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E

5|$|Although As I Lay Dying {{has stated}} on {{numerous}} occasions {{that all of the}} members of the group are practicing Christians, the band is usually described by media as being in the metalcore genre, not Christian metal. This is <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> band's lyrics do not directly focus on pro-Christian themes the way many praise music bands do nor do they treat their music as a direct extension of their private Christian worship or proselytizing efforts. For example, not once do the names God or Jesus appear in any As I Lay Dying song, nor do any of their songs explicitly invoke Christian doctrine or quote the Bible. Most songs tend to address broader spiritual concepts like existential angst or the struggle between reason and spirituality.|$|E
5|$|For decades, {{research}} on the Polish Underground State was restricted, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> communist People's Republic of Poland {{did not wish to}} fully acknowledge the role of the non-communist resistance. During the first postwar Stalinist years, efforts to explore this topic were regarded as dangerous, bordering on illegal. Research into the events occurring in the Soviet-annexed territories in the 1939–1941 period was particularly difficult. The limited research devoted to the Underground State that did take place was done mainly by Polish émigré historians living in the West. The communist state downplayed the importance of the non-communist resistance movements, while the communist movement (Armia Ludowa) was emphasized as being of primary importance; in fact, the opposite was true. The absence of research by Polish scholars, along with obstacles presented to foreign scholars seeking access to source material in communist Poland, contributed to a situation in which there was virtually no discussion by Western scholars of one of Europe's largest resistance movements—the non-communist Polish resistance movement. The bulk of Western research centred on the much smaller French Resistance (la Résistance).|$|E
5|$|The Partisan Prohibitions were {{repealed}} {{during the}} Yellow Turban Rebellion and Five Pecks of Rice Rebellion in 184 AD, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> {{court did not}} want to continue to alienate {{a significant portion of the}} gentry class who might otherwise join the rebellions. The Yellow Turbans and Five-Pecks-of-Rice adherents belonged to two different hierarchical Daoist religious societies led by faith healers Zhang Jue (d.184 AD) and Zhang Lu (d.216 AD), respectively. Zhang Lu's rebellion, in modern northern Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, was not quelled until 215 AD. Zhang Jue's massive rebellion across eight provinces was annihilated by Han forces within a year, however the following decades saw much smaller recurrent uprisings. Although the Yellow Turbans were defeated, many generals appointed during the crisis never disbanded their assembled militia forces and used these troops to amass power outside of the collapsing imperial authority.|$|E

5|$|In the West, the Muslims {{continued}} to make steady advances, as the local Byzantine forces proved inadequate: the Empire was forced {{to rely on the}} aid of their nominal Italian subjects, and had to resort to the transfer of the eastern fleets to Italy to achieve any progress. Following the fall of Enna in 855, the Byzantines were confined to the eastern shore of Sicily, and under increasing pressure. A relief expedition in 868 achieved little. Syracuse was attacked again in 869, and in 870, Malta fell to the Aghlabids. Muslim corsairs raided the Adriatic, and although they were driven out of Apulia, in the early 880s they established bases along the western Italian coast, from where they would not be completely dislodged until 915. In 878, Syracuse, the main Byzantine stronghold in Sicily, was attacked again and fell, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Imperial Fleet was occupied with transporting marble for the construction of the Nea Ekklesia, Basil's new church. In 880, Ooryphas' successor, the droungarios Nasar, scored a significant victory in a night battle over the Aghlabids who were raiding the Ionian Islands. He then proceeded to raid Sicily, carrying off much booty, before defeating another Muslim fleet off Punta Stilo. At the same time, another Byzantine squadron scored a significant victory at Naples. These successes allowed a short-lived Byzantine counter-offensive to develop in the West in the 870s and 880s under Nikephoros Phokas the Elder, expanding the Byzantine foothold in Apulia and Calabria and forming the thema of Longobardia, which would later evolve into the Catepanate of Italy. A heavy defeat off Milazzo in 888, however, signalled the virtual disappearance of major Byzantine naval activity in the seas around Italy for the next century.|$|E

25|$|Unlike wolf {{populations in}} the lower 48 states, which {{declined}} steadily as settlers moved west, the Canadian wolf population fluctuated between growth and decline, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> human population in Canada never reached {{the same level as}} in the lower 48, thus leaving large areas of land free for the wolves.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the plant}} is allowed to flower, it may produce seed pods {{containing}} small black seeds, which can be saved and planted the following year.

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to place the point in which the definite article, absent in Latin but present in all Romance languages, arose, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> highly colloquial speech in which it arose was seldom written down until the daughter languages had strongly diverged; most surviving texts in early Romance show the articles fully developed.|$|E
25|$|Ferrers {{lived on}} for another ten years, during which he {{attempted}} to regain his estates, with little success, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> machinations at Cippenham had been quietly supported by the King and his council.

25|$|After World War II, coal lost {{favor to}} {{oil and natural}} gas as a heating fuel, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> latter types were more {{convenient}} to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and Luzerne counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} student awards available, varying in prestige, from local {{university}} awards to national awards. Considered {{the most prestigious}} award for a medical student in the UK is the currently Medical Student of the Year, hosted by The Royal Society of Medicine and the Royal College of Psychiatrists. This is <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> other colleges have no such award, with the normal national prizes being named after experts in that field.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies Federation had {{an unusually}} weak federal structure. For instance, its provinces were not {{contained}} in a single customs union. Thus, each province functioned as a separate economy, complete with tariffs, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> smaller provinces were afraid of being overwhelmed by the large islands' economies. Also, complete freedom of movement within the Federation was not implemented, as the larger provinces were worried about mass migration from the smaller islands. In this sense, the current European Union {{can be said to}} have implemented a more unified economic space than the West Indian attempt.|$|E

25|$|ESPN Thursday Night Baseball was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} 2006 season because the broadcast {{rights to the}} package were lost to TBS. TBS shows the games on Sunday afternoons that ESPN previously aired on Thursday nights. This is <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> games were a byproduct of a deal Fox made to air games on its own cable channels, before opting to sell what is now ABC Family which is now Freeform and to Disney. The games were then moved to ESPN and ESPN2. Thursday Night Baseball was replaced with MLS Primetime Thursday.|$|E
25|$|Allied {{bombing in}} April 1944 {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} Macchi and Fiat facilities bringing fighter production to an end. With the interruption of production, the Italians were forced to re-equip their three groups almost fully with Bf 109s, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> Germans were quick to offer some of their best models, including Bf 109G-6s and Bf 109K-4s. The Allies were less generous with the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force (ICAF), and Veltros, including some upgraded C.202s, were slowly replaced with worn-out P-39s and Spitfires, but not before summer 1944.|$|E
50|$|The {{validity}} of subfamilies within the Aromobatidae is also unsettled. Some {{evidence points to}} paraphyly of at least the Anomaloglossinae subfamily, and genus Allobates, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> of <b>the</b> uncertain placement of Allobates olfersioides.|$|R
