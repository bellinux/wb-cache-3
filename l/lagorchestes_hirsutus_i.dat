50|$|The rufous {{hare-wallaby}} (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus),</b> {{also known as}} the mala, is a small macropod found in Australia. It was formerly widely distributed across the western half of the continent but is now confined to Bernier Island and Dorre Island Islands off Western Australia. It is currently classified as vulnerable.|$|R

25|$|The subregion {{contains}} many endemic plant {{species in the}} Eucalyptus, Acacia, Proteaceae such as Grevillea, Hakea and Banksia; and various Asteraceae. It contains numerous rare, endangered and priority flora. It also supports a number of rare or endangered fauna, including some that fall within the critical weight range for predation by foxes. The pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) and crescent nailtail wallaby (Onychogalea lunata) previously occurred in the subregion, but both are now extinct. The rufous hare-wallaby (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> is now extinct in the wild, and a further ten species of mammal are extinct in the subregion. The endangered red-tailed phascogale (Phascogale calura) still occurs in the region, as do the vulnerable black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis) and heath rat (Pseudomys shortridgei), and the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{histology}} of the spleen, lymph nodes, Gut-associated {{lymphoid tissue}} (GALT) and Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) are described for samples collected opportunistically from healthy and mycobacteria-affected specimens {{of the endangered}} marsupial <b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus,</b> the Rufous Hare-wallaby. The structural elements, organization and distribution of T and B lymphocytes determined by immunohistological techniques using species cross-reactive antibodies in the lymph nodes, spleen and GALT of this species demonstrated lymphoid cell distributions that were consistent with other marsupial and eutherian mammals. The tissues of animals identified as acid-fast positive displayed immunopathology consistent with the responses to intracellular bacteria displayed in some eutherian mammals and included the presence of focal lesions, giant cells in the lung and lymphoid aggregations situated adjacent to blood and airway vessels. This is the first study to describe the lymphoid tissue of this rare macropod species {{and the first to}} document the tissue bed response to mycobacteria...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Immunocytochemical {{analysis}} of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was undertaken using a streptavidin biotin–horseradish peroxidase method to detect CD 5 positive lymphocytes {{from the blood}} of several marsupial species. A monoclonal antibody raised to a conserved peptide sequence of the human CD 5 antigen positively labelled lymphocytes in freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the tammar wallaby (Macropus eugenii), the long-footed potoroo (Potorous longipes), the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and the rufous hare-wallaby (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus).</b> A polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibody also positively labelled circulating lymphocytes from the tammar wallaby. Whereas previous studies using flow cytometry reported labelling of T cells in koala lymphocyte preparations using a polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibody, there have been no other reports of marsupial blood immunophenotyping. The current study extends the known applications of monoclonal anti-CD 5 and polyclonal anti-CD 3 antibodies to blood lymphocytes of small wallaby species using an immunocytochemical slide technique that is simple, can be processed within a day and requires no dedicated large equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{of mature}} <b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus</b> spermatozoa is described {{for the first}} time, revealing unusual aspects of sperm structure in macropodid species. The sperm head is ovoid rather than cuneiform, lacks a ventral nuclear groove and has an acrosomal distribution over approximately 85 - 90 % of its dorsal surface. Immediately adjacent to the nuclear membrane the peripheral nucleoplasm in most spermatozoa form an irregular series of distinctive evaginations previously not described in the spermatozoa of any other marsupial. The midpiece is extremely thickened and short, containing no helical network or peripheral plasma membrane specializations. Axonemal structure is unspecialized with no connecting lamellae; dense outer fibres are closely adherent to axonemal doublets. The sperm morphology of this species is highly aberrant in comparison to other macropod taxa and supports the retention of Lagorchestes as a distinctive genus. In light of this new information, skeletal and serological data should be re-evaluated to determine the true taxonomic and phylogenetic position of this species...|$|R
40|$|The {{granules}} of circulating leukocytes contain reactive {{oxygen species}} that are important components of host defence against bacterial invasion. We report the capacity of marsupials and monotremes to mount such a defence {{in a manner similar}} to their eutherian relatives. Using the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, {{reactive oxygen species}} were detected in the peripheral blood cells of five captive marsupial species (the tammar wallaby, Macropus eugenii, the Rufous hare wallaby, <b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus,</b> the Brush-tailed bettong, Bettongia penicillata, the Long-footed potoroo, Potorous longipes, and the Long-nosed potoroo, Potorous tridactylus). The study included animals that were clinically healthy and those that were affected by mycobacterial disease. Animals in poor health elicited weak responses, consistent with the NBT test being used as a diagnostic assay for immunodeficiency. The NBT slide assay was also applied to platypus (Ornithorhyncus anatinus) and short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) granulocytes to confirm the applicability of the test to this unique group of mammals...|$|R
50|$|In 2001 {{there was}} an effort to {{reintroduce}} two species of hare-wallaby, the mala (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> and the merrnie (Lagostrophus fasciatus). The pressures to their habitats over the past 200 years had caused the two species to become extinct on the main land. At the time of reintroduction there were only about 250 L. hirsutus in captivity. The project group decided to translocate 34 wallabies into an area, which would give useful information about future reintroductions, in the Shark Bay area of the Peron Peninsula. The wallabies were tracked throughout their exposure in their new habitat, which had the pastoral sheep and cattle removed that would have ruined the studies measurement of habitat selection. The results of the study demonstrated that the variation and flexibility of habitat selections were such that future re-introductions wouldn’t have to adhere to very strict areas that have vegetation at a high density. This is positive for future attempts because Australia has experienced a thinning of vegetation.|$|R

40|$|The only {{substantial}} wild {{populations of}} banded Lagostrophus fasciatus and rufous <b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus</b> hare-wallabies occur on Bernier and Dorre Islands, {{off the coast}} of Western Australia. Banded hare-wallabies were widespread in southwestern Australia but have not been recorded there since 1906; rufous hare-wallabies had a broad distribution across arid Australia but now have a single mainland population in the Tanami Desert. We assessed distribution and abundance of hare-wallabies on Bernier and Dorre Islands from spotlight sightings of animals on a series of east-west transects across each island. Abundance was estimated using line transects. The banded hare-wallaby is the more abundant species on both islands with a population of about 3, 900 on Bernier and 3, 800 on Dorre Island. This species depends on the shelter afforded by low-spreading shrubs of Heterodendrum oleifolium, Acacia coriacea, A. ligulata, Diplolaena dampiera, and Ficus platypoda. Wallabies occur mainly on the dunes that form the spine of Dorre Island and the travertine of its west coast. On Bernier Island they occur in the north, where dense thickets of Acacia coriacea, A ligulata, H. oleifolium and D. dampiera, and a tall heath of Abutilon exoneum and Scaevola crassifolia are best developed. The rufous hare-wallaby has a population of about 2, 600 on Bernier and 1, 700 on Dorre Island. It occurs throughout both islands in most habitats, but is most abundant in the south of each. It burrows extensively on the inland sandplain and in the dunes...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of threatened animals from one location {{to another in}} order to benefit the species is a technique frequently used by animal conservation managers. However, very few of these relocations have experimentally assessed the relative merits and disadvantages of commonly used release techniques. The premise {{examined in this study}} was that a higher degree of site fidelity should be advantageous for an individual through a soft release protocol. Two species of hare-wallaby, mala (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> and merrnine (Lagostrophus fasciatus), were fitted with radio-collars and reintroduced in August 2001 onto Peron Peninsula in Western Australia. These threatened species were reintroduced using two release strategies (soft versus hard release), and their movements and body condition were monitored, for a period of four weeks post-release, using radio-telemetry and trapping. Each species averaged decreases in body condition index when exposed to both experimental release protocols. A total of 11 animals (32 %) emigrated from the release sites, with 10 of these animals being male. Importantly, no relationship was found between site fidelity and release method, although body condition was significantly higher in mala which dispersed, and there was observational evidence for a male-biased dispersal for merrnine. Although the number of released individuals of each species was low, this study demonstrates an interesting trend which indicates that soft release techniques do not necessarily to confer an advantage to the successful immediate establishment and survival of either hare-wallaby species in the short term. We recommend that managers involved with species reintroduction programs consider the costs and potential outcomes of designing and installing soft release enclosure...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} {{to learn more about}} the {{potential}} for reintroduction of hare-wallabies to sites in Australia, 34 captive-bred hare-wallabies were released onto Peron Peninsula within the Shark Bay World Heritage Property in 2001 as part of an experimental reintroduction program. One objective of this experiment was to characterise their behaviour and daytime refugia to identify suitable habitat for future releases. The mala (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> and merrnine (Lagostrophus fasciatus) were fitted with radio-transmitters and tracked daily. Merrnine were more faithful to a previously occupied shelter than mala. Mala maintained a solitary daytime habit at all times. Within the study area, mala preferentially sought low-lying vegetation primarily comprising the species Lamarchea hakeifolia, which provided dense cover up to 1 m in height, under which they constructed scrapes. L. hakeifolia was preferred as shelter vegetation instead of Triodia (spinifex) hummocks, despite Triodia hummock habitat being preferred by mala in central Australia. Merrnine occupied taller vegetation with an open understorey to 1. 5 m, although the extremity of the understorey remained dense at this height. Individual merrnine sometimes sheltered with conspecifics of the opposite sex. Since both species utilised floristically and structurally variable vegetation, we suggest that they have the ability to cope with vegetation that has been altered by changes in fire regimes and introduced herbivores. This is particularly important for future reintroduction exercises as the results suggest that vegetation characteristics required to support these species, particularly mala, may be variable rather than limited to perceived necessary habitat types in central Australia or on islands. These results should allow future reintroduction projects to consider a wider range of release-site options during their planning phase. ...|$|R
40|$|Since European settlement, {{mainland}} Australia {{has experienced}} a wave of mammal extinctions and population declines. However, some species have persisted on off-shore islands, which are now viewed as important wildlife refuges. In this study, we assessed the level of genetic diversity, at 7 - 11 microsatellite loci, in island and remnant mainland populations of three endemic species of macropodid marsupial; the tammar wallaby Macropus eugenii (n = 92); rufous hare-wallaby <b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus</b> (n = 40) and black-footed rock-wallaby Petrogale lateralis (n = 164). There was a consistent pattern of {{significantly higher levels of}} microsatellite diversity in the remnant mainland population (A = 4. 9 - 13. 9; He = 0. 61 - 0. 86) of each species compared to conspecific "pristine" island populations (A = 1. 2 - 3. 7; He = 0. 05 - 0. 44). These marked differences are even apparent where island populations currently have a substantially larger census size. In addition, island populations were substantially inbred (Fe = 0. 49 - 0. 91). Although island populations have been insulated from the relatively recent threatening processes operating on the mainland, they have nevertheless been significantly impacted by increased inbreeding and the substantial erosion of genetic diversity. Despite the difficulties of ensuring the survival of remnant mainland populations, they appear to retain substantially more genetic diversity than their island counterparts and therefore are more likely to contribute to the long-term persistence of their species. These data also demonstrate that small remnant mainland populations (n < 10 - 20) are often capable of rapid recovery and are not necessarily genetically depauperate. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Montebello {{archipelago}} {{consists of}} 218 islands; 80 km from the north-west coast of Western Australia. Before 1912 the islands had a diverse terrestrial fauna. By 1952 several species were locally extinct. Between 1996 and 2011 rodents and cats were eradicated, and 5 mammal and 2 bird species were translocated to the islands. Monitoring {{of the broader}} terrestrial ecosystem over time has been limited. We used 20 dry-season Landsat images from 1988 to 2013 and estimation of green fraction cover in nadir photographs taken at 27 sites within the Montebello islands and six sites on Thevenard Island to assess change in vegetation density over time. Analysis of data averaged across the 26 -year period suggests that 719 ha out of 2169 ha have increased in vegetation cover by up to 32 %, 955 ha have remained stable and 0. 6 ha have declined in vegetation cover. Over 492 ha (22 %) had no vegetation cover {{at any time during}} the period analysed. Chronological clustering analysis identified two breakpoints in the average vegetation cover data occurring in 1997 and 2003, near the beginning and end of the rodent eradication activities. On many islands vegetation cover was declining prior to 1996 but increased after rodents were eradicated from the islands. Data for North West and Trimouille islands were analysed independently because of the potential confounding effect of native fauna being introduced to these islands. Mala (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> and Shark Bay mice (Pseudomys fieldi) both appear to suppress native plant recruitment but not to the same degree as introduced rodents. Future research should assess whether the increase in vegetation cover on the Montebello islands is due to an increase in native or introduced plants...|$|R
40|$|As {{evidence}} mounts {{that the}} feral Cat (Felis catus) {{is a significant}} threat to endemic Australian biodiversity and impedes reintroduction attempts, uncertainty remains about the impact a residual population of cats following control will have on a mammal reintroduction programme. Also, behavioural interactions between cats and their prey continue to be an area of interest. Within the framework of an ecosystem restoration project, we tested the hypotheses that successful reintroductions of some medium-sized mammals are possible in locations where feral cats are controlled (but not eradicated) {{in the absence of}} European Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), and that hare-wallabies that dispersed from their release area are more vulnerable to cat predation compared with those that remain at the release site. We used radiotelemetry to monitor the survivorship and dispersal of 16 Rufous Hare-wallabies (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus</b> spp.) and 18 Banded Hare-wallabies (Lagostrophus fasciatus fasciatus) reintroduced to four sites within Shark Bay, Western Australia. Nearly all foxes were removed and feral cats were subject to ongoing control that kept their indices low relative to prerelease levels. All monitored hare-wallabies were killed by cats within eight and 10 months following release. Significant predation by feral cats was not immediate: most kills occurred in clusters, with periods of several months where no mortalities occurred. Once a hare-wallaby was killed, however, predation continued until each population was eliminated. Animals remaining near their release site survived longer than those that dispersed. The aetiology of predation events observed offers new insights into patterns of feral cat behaviour and mammal releases. We propose a hypothesis that these intense per capita predation events may reflect a targeted hunting behaviour in individual feral cats. Even where feral cats are controlled, the outcome from consistent predation events will result in reintroduction failures. Managers considering the reintroduction of medium-sized mammals in the presence of feral cats should, irrespective of concurrent cat control, consider the low probability of success. We advocate alternative approaches to cat-baiting alone for the recovery of cat-vulnerable mammals such as hare-wallabies...|$|R
40|$|Sex ratio, reproduction, body {{condition}} and morphology of banded (Lagostrophus fasciatus) and rufous (<b>Lagorchestes</b> <b>hirsutus)</b> hare-wallabies were assessed on Dorre and Bernier Islands. Data {{are derived from}} 236 banded hare-wallabies and 161 rufous hare-wallabies captured between 1959 and 1999. The sex ratio of captured banded hare-wallabies tended to be female-biased (0. 79 : 1 male: female) but {{was not a significant}} departure from parity. In contrast, pouch young tended towards a male bias at 1. 35 : 1. Females produced 1 - 2 young per year. They were capable of producing young at 1000 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 39 % for females of 1000 - 1400 g to 80 % for females of 1401 - 1800 g, then decreased slightly to 76 % for females > 1800 g. Births occurred throughout the year but there was some indication of a decline {{in the latter half of}} the year. Captured banded hare-wallabies ranged in weight from 850 to 2300 g. Animals on Dorre Island were in significantly better {{body condition}} than those on Bernier Island, although this could be an artefact of their shorter pes length. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism and no differences in morphological measurements taken, other than pes length, between the two island populations. The sex ratio of captured rufous hare-wallabies was close to parity at 0. 99 : 1 and for pouch young tended to be male-biased at 2 : 1. The smallest female with young weighed 1215 g, but the incidence of females carrying pouch young or lactating increased from 43 % for females of 1215 - 1660 g to 61 % for females of 1661 - 2015 g and 100 % for females > 2015 g. Females carried pouch young in all months sampled (March-September) and one incidence of twinning was noted. Captured rufous hare-wallabies weighed 600 - 2550 g. Body condition was similar for males and females and between islands, but smaller females of reproductive age were in poorer body condition than larger females. There was no evidence of sexual dimorphism but pes lengths of animals on Dorre Island were significantly shorter, head lengths longer and tail lengths shorter, than those on Bernier Island. Rufous hare-wallabies appear to show regional variation in body size, being smaller in the wetter and warmer Tanami/Alice Springs region and larger on the drier and cooler Shark Bay islands...|$|R
