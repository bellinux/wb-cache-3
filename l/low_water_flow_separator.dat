50|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the present <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> (and {{subsequent}} silting up) of the river has been the erection of two dams in the middle reaches of the river—the Barragem (Dam) de Arade and above it the Barragem do Funcho.|$|R
50|$|Coral {{bleaching}} may {{be caused}} by a number of factors. While localized triggers lead to localized bleaching, the large scale coral bleaching events of the recent years have been triggered by increased sea surface temperatures.

25|$|Pre-spawn {{mortality}} {{is a phenomenon}} where adult coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, die before spawning when returning to freshwater streams to spawn. In the Klamath River, mortality before spawning was due to disease, thermal stress, a <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> and increasing numbers of salmon migrating within the same time period.|$|R

50|$|The Ascutney Mill Dam Company {{was formed}} to build the dam. Construction began in June 1834, and was {{finished}} in November. The purpose of the dam was to regulate seasonal <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> and provide hydropower for nearby sawmills and gristmills, which previously could not operate during periods of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in Mill Brook. The dam allowed water to be stored in the impound during the winter for release during lower flow seasons.|$|R

25|$|Health issues {{regarding}} Kingman Lake again became {{prominent in the}} mid-1950s. An American University biologist found that the bed of Kingman Lake was composed almost entirely of fecal matter, and warned {{that no one should}} swim in the lake due the extensive pollution. The immense amount of raw sewage in the lake was attributed to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows,</b> and the lack of southern locks to allow water to more freely pass out of the lake. Nonetheless, a year later city officials were advocating that a playground be built on the shores of Kingman Island.|$|R
50|$|The falls {{is located}} at the base of Mount Mitchell, the tallest {{mountain}} in the United States east of the Mississippi River, on Setrock Creek, a small tributary of the South Toe River, which itself is a tributary of the French Broad River. The creek falls over multiple steep to near-vertical sections of rock under a solid canopy of trees. It has <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> which can slow to a mere trickle in dry weather. The water clings to the rocks on its way down and ends in a nice pool at the bottom.|$|R

It can also grow in extremely shallow waters, with its leaves floating on the surface, although this often results in leaf damage and loss. The species tolerates a range of habitats. It has been found growing {{on a variety of}} substrates, including sand-covered rock, gravel, sand and clay. It grows in areas of both high and <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> and occurs in areas of very high salinity.|$|R
50|$|Qin armies {{finished}} their {{conquest of the}} kingdoms of Shu and Ba by 316 BC. Any written records and civil achievements of earlier kingdoms were destroyed. Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. Li Bing, engineered the Dujiangyan irrigation system to control the Min River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of movable weirs which could be adjusted for high or <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin's unification of China.|$|R
40|$|During the 19 th-century many {{lakes in}} Sweden were lowered because {{the need of}} {{agriculture}} land was high. The population was increasing so the government decided to lend money to farmers that wanted to expand their land. Today we are experiencing the environmental results of these actions. Hydrological effects like changed flowing directions and the damping effects of the lakes have been taken away. The management of the forest is also affecting the water system. In the catchment of Gråskaån several lakes has been lowered {{and a lot of}} land has been drained. The result is a quick outflow of water to the sea, when it's raining or when the snow is melting. Measurements in the field and also simulations with the HBV light model shows a quick decrease in flow when it's receiving water, during the summer months anyway. Computer simulations shows that during the 1980 's the flow was higher, that is probably because of larger amount of precipitation during the 80 's. The winters were also colder and that gives a larger amount of snow accumulation and more melting water in the spring. The <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> are also affecting the fishes. The county administrative board of Stockholm wants to have a stock with salmon trout in Gråskaån. Therefore there have been projects going on, since the year of 1976, with putting out salmon trout in the river. In May 2003 were the last time for that, and test fishing in October the same year showed that there was no trout left in the river which is probably because of the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> during the summer months. The fish are responding to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flows</b> with heading downstream, and in this case, the fish probably swims out to Edeboviken. During the flow measurement the stream velocity varied between 37 cm/s and 1 cm/s. The salmon trout needs at least 15 cm/s to survive. So the big variation in <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> causes big problems. The salmon trout was reproducing in the stream during the 1980 but not anymore and that is probably because of the larger amount of precipitation during that time compared to now. So {{in order to keep the}} salmon trout in the river some counter measures has to be made. Countermeasures like damming of lakes to ensure a <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> during summer when the stream sometimes is completely dry, is one of the things that can be done. Also countermeasures like the removal of plants and construction of god playing grounds for the salmon trout has to be done in order to keep the fish in the stream...|$|R
40|$|I {{examined}} the physiological response of two marine macrophytes, the brown alga Saccharina latissima and the angiosperm Zostera marina, to <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> {{in nature and}} in controlled experiments. Limitation of photosynthesis of both species by the availability of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) was increased under low current velocities. Physiological acclimation to <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> occurred via upregulation of DIC uptake mechanisms in both S. latissima and Z. marina. Both species increased their ability to generate CO 2 in the boundary layer by increasing external carbonic anhydrase and in Z. marina by also increasing proton extrusion and photosynthetic capacity. Changes in the xanthophyll-cycle in low-flow grown S. latissima increased non-photochemical quenching, thus reducing photodamage when photosynthesis was limited by DIC uptake. <b>Water</b> <b>flow</b> also affected root length in Z. marina but root length and below ground biomass were also significantly affected by sediment type, an indirect effect of <b>water</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R

40|$|A wild adult Atlantic {{salmon and}} sea trout fish kill {{occurred}} on the River Tyne {{in the summer of}} 2003. Similar mortalities have occurred in past summers on this river. The mortality in 2003 was attributed to Vibrio anguillarum and it is suggested that infection with this pathogen was most likely exacerbated by the <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow,</b> which impaired fish movement upstream and lead to large aggregations of fish, and high water temperatures, which increased the replication rate of the bacteria and stressed the fish.

However, experience {{has shown that the}} immersion tank is usually large, awkward, and tedious to work with. An alternative method which does not require immersion would increase the time efficiency of the UT inspection.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1767, several sawmills and gristmills were {{operating}} {{along the banks}} of Mill Brook in Windsor. However, during periods of <b>low</b> <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> the mills stood idle. Like many early towns, their location was often selected on the availability of such a resource. Water-powered mills have been used to save human labor since ancient times, but like all renewable energy resources, their power is not always available when needed. Sawmills were needed to provide boards for construction, and gristmills were necessary to ground grain into flour. In post-colonial Vermont, these mills were essential for the building and food supply needs of the growing cities.|$|R
