40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{confidence}} among forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> concerning the performance of the cutting planners. There is a need to investigate the reasons behind and the possible solutions for, the lack of trust between these two groups. Forest <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> in Ockelbo municipality where interviewed in October 2015. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were asked to subjectively grade their level of trust on a scale of 1 to 10 were 1 was the lowest and 10 was the highest. The results showed the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> trust in the cutting planners averaged 6. 9. The <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> expressed a clear preference for cutting planners who had practical experience operating a forest machine...|$|R

40|$|Abstract − Today the scanning-technology on {{coordinate}} measuring machines (CMMs) is {{used for}} tactile detection of form deviations. Many companies apply CMMs instead of form measuring devices because of their high flexibility {{and the possibility of}} fast workpiece inspection. However, the kinematic of CMMs is more complex than the one of specialized form measurement devices. Dynamic effects, like centrifugal force of roundness measuring, result in a rising measurement uncertainty. The right setup of scanning parameters, like point density and scanning speed, is a challenging task. It is <b>up</b> to the <b>machine</b> <b>operator</b> because guidelines for the setup of optimal parameters do not exist. The dynamic characteristics of the used CMMs are not sufficiently identified and the detection of the measuring task dependent uncertainty is very complex. At the chair for Production Metrology and Quality Management of RWTH Aachen University the characteristic behaviour of tactile scanning CMMs are analysed. These studies built the basis for the practical and object oriented optimisation of the measurement strategy. An actual research project deals with the development of optimisation strategies by considering the maximum allowed measurement uncertainty. A knowledge-database was defined containing basic information about the used CMM, ranges for parameters and the main dynamic characteristics based on experiments...|$|R
6000|$|After {{taking her}} elderly cousin across, Fleur did not land at once, but pulled {{in among the}} reeds, into the sunshine. The {{peaceful}} beauty of the afternoon seduced for a little one not much given to the vague and poetic. In the field beyond the bank where her skiff <b>lay</b> <b>up,</b> a <b>machine</b> drawn by a grey horse was turning an early field of hay. She watched the grass cascading over and behind the light wheels with fascination--it looked so green and fresh. The click and swish blended with the rustle of the willows and the poplars, and the cooing of a wood-pigeon, in a true river song. Alongside, in the grey-green water, weeds like yellow snakes were writhing and nosing with the current; pied cattle on the farther side stood in the shade lazily swishing their tails. It was an afternoon to dream. And she took out Jon's letters--not flowery effusions, but haunted in their recital of things seen and done by a longing very agreeable to her, and all ending [...] "Your devoted J." [...] Fleur was not sentimental, her desires were ever concrete and concentrated, but what poetry there was in the daughter of Soames and Annette had certainly in those weeks of waiting gathered round her memories of Jon. They all belonged to grass and blossom, flowers and running water. She enjoyed him in the scents absorbed by her crinkling nose. The stars could persuade {{her that she was}} standing beside him in the centre of the map of Spain; and of an early morning the dewy cobwebs, the hazy sparkle and promise of the day down in the garden, were Jon personified to her.|$|R

Figures from Holmen Skog show low reporting frequency. The purpose of this study is to investigate the reason and find suggestions for improvement. A total of 17 <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> were interviewed using a questionnaire combined with open questions. The results show that the majority of the <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> find it simple to use the reporting system, although, some of them reports that it doesn’t always work as supposed to. About 25 percent of the interviewed answered that the reason for low reporting frequency is the lack of timber order number. To solve this specific problem increased routine among production leaders is needed. Other suggestions of actions aiming to increase the reporting frequency are using a production technician for support of the production leaders make it possible for <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> to report service stops Finally, most of <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> sees the reporting as a natural part of their job and are positive concerning their relation to Holmen Skog...|$|R

30|$|We did not {{estimate}} separate gender-specific earnings {{functions for}} managers and for plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators,</b> {{because the number}} of women in these two occupation groups was too small for meaningful analysis.

However, when wage equations are estimated for all managers and for all plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> with a dummy variable for women included in the list of independent variables, the coefficient on women is negative and significant: ceteris paribus, women in managerial jobs or working as plant and <b>machine</b> <b>operators</b> have between 30  percent and 33 percent lower hourly earnings than men (see Appendix, Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|R
