5|$|The {{first two}} novels were {{published}} in 1894 to mixed reviews. <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> a Mortal Lease (title from George Meredith) was released in June, followed in November by The Journey of High Honour, at 30,000words considerably shorter than the 355 pages of <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> a Mortal Lease. Each novel sold {{only a few hundred}} copies. Harwood describes the early work such as <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> a Mortal Lease as showing stylistic similarities to contemporary women novelists such as Craighie and Rhonda Broughton, with witty dialogue in Craighie's style, although he thinks Olivia brought a more serious voice to her work. He describes <b>Love</b> <b>on</b> a Mortal Lease as a work in which the heroine is well-characterised but the background is weak.|$|E

On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left.

5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 NBA {{season with the}} newly-renamed Pelicans {{with a pair of}} double-doubles, posting 20 points and 12 rebounds against Indiana on October 30 and 26 points and 17 rebounds against Orlando on November 1. In the Orlando game, Davis became the {{youngest}} player in franchise history to record 25 points and 15 rebounds in a game. In the third game of the season against Charlotte on November 2, Davis established career-highs with 6 blocks and 6 steals, while helping New Orleans to its first victory. He also became the first player with 6 blocks, 6 steals and 25 points in a game in the last 20 years and only the fifth with at least 5 blocks, 5 steals and 25 points in that period. For the week, Davis earned an NBA Player of the Week nomination, but lost out to Kevin <b>Love.</b> <b>On</b> November 8, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Davis scored a career-high 32 points and tied a career high with 6 blocks, along with 12 rebounds, becoming the youngest player ever to have at least 30 points, 10 rebounds and 5 blocks in an NBA game. On November 16, he established a new career high with 8 blocks against Philadelphia. He again had 8 blocks on November 20 against the Utah Jazz. With two 8-block games in the Pelicans' first 11 games of the 2013–14 NBA season, Davis matched the number of 8-block games that Roy Hibbert had at that time in the 2012–13 and 2013–14 NBA seasons combined. No other players had two 8-block games as recently. According to ESPN, while drawing a charging foul from Amar'e Stoudemire, Davis suffered a non-displaced fracture in his left hand in the first quarter against the New York Knicks on December 1. Yahoo! Sports claims the injury came on an attempted alley oop. On December 3, the Pelicans announced a 4-6 week layoff was expected. The injury came the night before he was supposed to play in his hometown of Chicago, marking {{the second year in a}} row that he was sidelined for his chance to play in his hometown.|$|E
