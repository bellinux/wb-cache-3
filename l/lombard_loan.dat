40|$|We {{model the}} Central Bank's {{management}} of intraday liquidity in modern real-time gross settlement systems as a linear programming problem parameterized by different intraday monetary policies, such as reserve requirements, net debit caps and <b>Lombard</b> <b>loans.</b> We then use duality theory {{to determine the}} shadow-prices of constraints of each bank. These shadow-prices {{can be used by}} the Central Bank to set personalized intraday monetary policies in order to reduce idleness of money and to give a microfoundation of the too-big-to-fail policy.

40|$|There {{was a need}} to {{establish}} an independent central bank and effective instruments after getting independent. Slovenia dismissed the non-market instruments of monetary policy {{that were used in}} the former Yugoslavia. Old, selective instruments of monetary policy were replaced by new instruments: open market policy, <b>lombard</b> <b>loans,</b> bills with warrants, twice bills, foreign currency bills, minimum reserve requirements. Slovenia has to use open market policy instruments as the core instrument, refinancing policy should have a safety valve function to satisfy unexpected needs for the central bank money. open market policy, refinancing, loans, securities, minimum reserve requirements...|$|R
50|$|Currently CMB has bank {{deposits}} and savings of 7.5 billion euros and a {{market share of}} 11%, in line with that of Crédit Foncier in France.It also works in client financing {{in collaboration with the}} government of Monaco, for which it has acted as lead manager of financing consortium for certain infrastructural projects and with local companies such as Monaco Telecom (MT), which CMB owns 6% share. It also offers <b>Lombard</b> <b>loans</b> and real estate loans in support of its private banking activity. The CMB group includes several companies in addition to the holding company and in particular a fund management company (CMG), three real estate companies that own properties occupied by the holding company, and the CMB subsidiaries in the Principality. The company employs 190 people. CMB has been granted the reward “Best Local Private Bank in Monaco 2014” by the financial magazine Euromoney.|$|R
40|$|I {{model the}} {{functioning}} of real-time gross settlement systems for large-value interbank transfers as a linear programming problem in which queueing arrangements, splitting of payments, <b>Lombard</b> <b>loans,</b> and interbank credit exposures arise as primal solutions. Then I use the dual programming problem associated with the maximization of the total flow of payments {{in order to determine}} the shadow-prices of banks in the payment system. We use these shadow-prices to set personalized intraday monetary policies such as reserve requirements, availability of Central Bank credit to temporarily illiquid banks, extension of intraday interbank credit exposures, etc., so as to make the payment system more efficient and less costly in terms of systemic liquidity. The dual approach shows us how to make banks correctly internalize the intraday network externalities they create in the real-time gross settlement system and provides an objective standard for the daily microprudential surveillance of the payment system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{monetary}} policy process has two stages: (1) setting {{the value of}} intermediate or final monetary targets {{on the basis of}} available information, and (2) setting the instruments of {{monetary policy}} in order to neutralize stochastic disturbances and to render the actual value of the intermediate target {{as close as possible to}} the targeted value. After becoming independent, Slovenia had to establish an independent central bank and create effective instruments of monetary policy. Slovenia did away with the nonmarket instruments of monetary policy that were used in the former Yugoslavia. Old, selective instruments of monetary policy were replaced by new instruments: an open market policy, <b>Lombard</b> <b>loans,</b> minimum reserve requirements, bills with warrants, twin bills, and foreign currency bills. Slovenia must use open-market policy instruments as the core instrument; the fiscal component should be eliminated; minimum reserve requirements should not change frequently due to fluctuations deriving from reserve ratio movements; refinancing policy should have a safety valve function to satisfy unexpected demand for the central bank's money. ...|$|R

50|$|Lombard {{launched}} Lombard Direct as {{a personal}} finance brand in 1995, initially as a telephone <b>loans</b> service. <b>Lombard</b> Direct provided <b>loans</b> within the limit of £800 to £15,000, and became known for their advertising featuring an animated anthropomorphic talking blue telephone. In August 2009, Lombard Direct discontinued writing new personal loans, and closed to new business.|$|R
50|$|The Brussels Mont de Piété, first {{founded in}} 1618, {{is still an}} active institution. The founder was Wenceslas Cobergher, {{who went on to}} {{establish}} fifteen such institutions in different towns in the Spanish Netherlands in the years between 1618 and 1633, financed by the provision of annuities in return for direct capital investment. Prior to this date the provision of consumer credit was largely in the hands of <b>Lombards</b> whose <b>loans</b> were at high rates of interest. Criticism of the Monts de Piété as themselves usurious institutions that both borrowed and lent at interest were countered by the Jesuit moral theologian Leonardus Lessius in an appendix to the 1621 edition of his De justitia et jure.|$|R
