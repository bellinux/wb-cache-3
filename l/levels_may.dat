5|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> affect thyroid behavior. For example, {{during the}} luteal phase (when {{estrogen}} levels are lower), {{the velocity of}} blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen levels are higher).|$|E
5|$|Analogous to its lighter congeners, the nonbonding {{electrons}} on unbiunium in UbuF {{are expected}} to be able to bond to extra atoms or groups, resulting {{in the formation of the}} unbiunium trihalides UbuX3, continuing the trends of existence of ScX3, YX3, LaX3, and AcX3. Hence, the main oxidation state of unbiunium in its compounds should be +3, although the closeness of the valence subshells' energy <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> permit higher oxidation states, just like in elements 119 and 120. The standard electrode potential for the Ubu3+/Ubu couple is predicted as −2.1V.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is due to}} {{elevated}} levels of uric acid in the blood. This occurs due {{to a combination of}} diet and genetic factors. At high levels, uric acid crystallizes and the crystals deposit in joints, tendons and surrounding tissues, resulting in an attack of gout. Gout occurs more commonly in those who eat a lot of meat, drink a lot of beer, or are overweight. Diagnosis of gout may be confirmed by seeing the crystals in joint fluid or tophus. Blood uric acid <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be normal during an attack.|$|E
5|$|High {{potassium}} levels {{tend to be}} {{a feature}} of severe rhabdomyolysis. Electrocardiography (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of T wave changes or broadening of the QRS complex. Low calcium <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms and signs which {{vary depending on the}} individual and the duration of lead exposure. Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle, and someone with elevated lead <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> have no symptoms.

5|$|The Sweet Track {{was used}} only for about ten years; rising water <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> have engulfed it, and {{therefore}} curtailed its use. The variety of objects found alongside the track suggest {{that it was in}} daily use as part of the farming life of the community. Since its discovery, it has been determined that parts of the Sweet Track were built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, which was constructed thirty years earlier in 3838 BC.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent can dramatically affect the environment. The collision of plates will result in mountain building, thereby shifting weather patterns. Sea <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> fall because of increased glaciation. The rate of surface weathering can rise, resulting {{in an increase in}} the rate that organic material is buried. Supercontinents can cause a drop in global temperatures and an increase in atmospheric oxygen. This, in turn, can affect the climate, further lowering temperatures. All of these changes can result in more rapid biological evolution as new niches emerge.|$|E
5|$|The swollen, {{inflamed}} muscle may directly compress {{structures in}} the same fascial compartment, causing compartment syndrome. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, phosphate ions, the heme-containing protein myoglobin, the enzyme creatine kinase and uric acid (a breakdown product of purines from DNA) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate disseminated intravascular coagulation. High potassium <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> lead to potentially fatal disruptions in heart rhythm. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to low calcium levels in the blood.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. This decline has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, suggesting that they can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead levels is more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E

5|$|Cholesterol <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Myxedema coma {{or severe}} decompensated {{hypothyroidism}} usually requires {{admission to the}} intensive care, close observation and treatment of abnormalities in breathing, temperature control, blood pressure, and sodium levels. Mechanical ventilation may be required, as well as fluid replacement, vasopressor agents, careful rewarming, and corticosteroids (for possible adrenal insufficiency which can occur together with hypothyroidism). Careful correction of low sodium <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be achieved with hypertonic saline solutions or vasopressin receptor antagonists. For rapid treatment of the hypothyroidism, levothyroxine or liothyronine may be administered intravenously, particularly if the level of consciousness is too low {{to be able to}} safely swallow medication.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is not a}} benign, holistic {{or natural}} treatment for epilepsy; as with any serious medical therapy, there may be complications. These are generally less severe and less frequent than with anticonvulsant medication or surgery. Common but easily treatable short-term side effects include constipation, low-grade acidosis and hypoglycaemia {{if there is an}} initial fast. Raised levels of lipids in the blood affect up to 60% of children and cholesterol <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> increase by around 30%. This can be treated by changes to the fat content of the diet, such as from saturated fats towards polyunsaturated fats, and, if persistent, by lowering the ketogenic ratio.

5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot off the ground, and rising water <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The recommendation is stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E
5|$|Blood Money is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players move through four stages on the planet, {{taking control of}} a different vehicle in each level: a helicopter in the metal world, a submarine in a water world, a spacesuit in an ice world, and a fighter jet in a fire world. Each vehicle features unique weaponry, which players use to attack all advancing enemies. Players can upgrade their vehicle with power-ups, which grant them additional weapons and upgrades, such as support missiles and neutron bombs. The vehicles' energy acts as players' health, and is depleted when the vehicle makes contact with enemies and walls. When all energy is lost, players lose a life; three lives are provided {{at the beginning of}} the game, and additional lives can be collected as players progress through the levels. When all three lives are lost, the game ends and players are sent to the title screen. The first two <b>levels</b> <b>may</b> be selected from the beginning of the game; after one level is complete, players can select any remaining world without restrictions. At the end of each level, players must defeat a boss.|$|E
