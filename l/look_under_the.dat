[...] "Caesar Barrand Hull, of the crinkly hair and the croaky voice, the laughing warrior whose idea of a lark was to change seats in the air... who had a phobia about worms or slugs, who would <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> bed 'in case there are any feenies about', then kneel beside it and say his prayers." [...] Bolitho took a similar line in his 1943 book Combat Report, attesting to Hull's [...] "bubbling, unquenchable gaiety". According to Bolitho, Hull was [...] "possessed of a magic power of creating happiness in others; making them belittle their cares, of inspiring them with confidence, not simply in him but in themselves. Of imbuing them with his own abounding love of life. Where Caesar was, laughter was." ...|$|E
500|$|Public {{interest}} in the story grew when {{it was discovered that}} the ghost appeared to follow Elizabeth Parsons. [...] She was removed to the house of a Mr Bray, where on 14January, in the presence of two unidentified nobles, more knocking sounds were heard. [...] A few days later she was returned to Cock Lane, where on 18January another séance was held. [...] In attendance were Kent, the apothecary, and local parish priest and incumbent of St John Clerkenwell, Stephen Aldrich. [...] On that occasion, when a clergyman used a candle to <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> bed, the ghost [...] "refused" [...] to answer, Frazer claiming [...] "she [...] loving not light". [...] After a few minutes of silence the questioning continued, but when Moore asked if the ghost would appear in court against Kent, Frazer refused to ask the question.|$|E

Also, {{a baby is}} {{able to understand the}} concept of items that are hidden in containers. [...] If a toy is hidden in a matchbox then the matchbox put under a pillow and then, without the child seeing, the toy is slipped out of the matchbox and the matchbox then given to the child, the child will <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> pillow upon discovery that it is not in the matchbox. The child is able to develop a mental image, hold it in mind, and manipulate it to solve problems, including object permanence problems that are not based solely on perception. The child can now reason about where the object may be when invisible displacement occurs.|$|E

500|$|Mendes {{found that}} he still had to {{convince}} DreamWorks' production executives to let him direct. He had already discussed the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. Ball was also keen; having seen Cabaret, he was impressed with Mendes' [...] "keen visual sense" [...] and thought he did not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> story's surface, a talent he felt {{would be a good}} fit with the themes of American Beauty. Mendes' background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, Walter Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, the second with Cooper alone—Mendes pitched himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent's commission, he only earned $38,000. In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film.|$|E
2500|$|Central {{adopted the}} Carlton 'Star' {{branding}} on 6 September 1999, shortly before {{much of the}} network adopted the second generic <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> theme of 'Hearts'. The Carlton idents featured an opening film featuring a heart at the end, before a star shaped light came from the heart, engulfing the screen, and showing the endboard, which featured a background of spinning stars in different colours with the brand name centre screen above an ITV logo. The ident itself technically was praised, however the presentational package received complaints and criticisms {{due to the fact}} that the Central brand was replaced by the Carlton brand. These idents only featured the Carlton name on screen but the announcements that featured with idents used the name [...] "Carlton for the Central Region" [...] and separate continuity was retained.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2008, a {{man from}} Sydney was convicted of {{possessing}} child pornography after sexually explicit pictures of children characters from The Simpsons were found on his computer. The NSW Supreme Court upheld a Local Court decision that the animated Simpsons characters [...] "depicted", and thus [...] "could be considered", real people. Controversy arose over the perceived ban on small-breasted women in pornography after a South Australian court established that if a consenting adult in pornography were [...] "reasonably" [...] deemed to <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> age of consent, then they could be considered depictions of child pornography. Criteria described stated [...] "small breasts" [...] as one of few examples, leading to the outrage. Again, the classification law is not federal or nationwide and only applies to South Australia.|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{banning of}} the kirpan was not {{proportionate}} to the objective. [...] It was noted the claimant could not wear the kirpan at school at all, even though the claimant would have accepted limitations. [...] The council had said that the kirpan could be stolen, or it could encourage other students to bring weapons to school. [...] The Supreme Court replied the claimant himself was not violent, and the limitations accepted by the claimant made a theft unlikely. [...] The thief would have to seize the claimant and <b>look</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> claimant's clothing. [...] Additionally, {{there was little to}} no proof students have used kirpans as weapons in schools. [...] Although cases involving airline security have resulted in {{the banning of}} kirpans on planes, the Court quoted the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal as saying whereas people know each other in a school, planes will always carry different people who never know each other. [...] There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent. [...] As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. [...] Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. [...] The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. [...] The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism. [...] If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.|$|E
