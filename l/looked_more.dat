5|$|Crystal Palace's two Dicynodon {{models are}} based on {{incomplete}} Permian fossils found in South Africa, along with Owen's guess that they were similar to turtles. There {{is no evidence of}} any shelled Dicynodon, and recent more complete fossils show that they <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like Hippopotamus.|$|E

5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought he <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood {{was offered a}} playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything {{to escape from the}} mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|The dispute did not delay work. Although {{progress}} on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict {{the scope of the}} project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site. At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state. Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago. Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.|$|E
5|$|A year earlier, Murdoch's Fox Entertainment Group {{purchased}} the Los Angeles Dodgers for $311m. Fox also held {{exclusive rights to}} Major League Baseball which meant from a strategic point of view, Murdoch’s acquisition <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> appealing. He was now able to control both programming content on his network and distribution rights to the Dodgers. For the very same reason BSkyB replicated Fox’s formula and went ahead with a takeover of a Premier League club. Manchester United thus was the unanimous choice of Murdoch and board members. The club was the most valuable in English football, making £30.1million from gate receipts and programmes in 1997 alone. At the same time, more than 200 supporters’ groups were established worldwide and the club's fanbase exceeded 100million, despite only a million having been to Old Trafford to watch the first team play. As a means of capitalising on this growing market, MUTV, a television station operated by the club was launched in August 1998. In co-operation with Granada Media Group and BSkyB it was the world’s first channel dedicated to a football club, funded entirely through subscriptions. On the pitch United's success was largely down to the nurturing talents of manager Ferguson, who assembled a team capable of dominating in the long haul.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine a}} {{generalized}} version of Flam and Helpman’s (1987) model of vertical differentiation that maps cross-country differences in income distributions to variations in import variety and price distributions. The theoretical predictions are examined and confirmed using micro data on {{income from the}} Luxemburg Income Study for 30 countries over 20 years. The pairs of importers whose income distributions <b>look</b> <b>more</b> similar have more export partners in common and more similar import price distributions. Similarly, the importers whose income distributions <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like the world buy from more exporters and have import price distributions that <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like the world...|$|R

25|$|The Lord Nelsons {{were the}} last British battleships to have an {{armoured}} ram built into their bow. They cost just over £1,600,000 each, the 2005 equivalent of about £110,000,000. The ships as completed were homely but intimidating in appearance, and <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like French battleships than the previous British pre-dreadnought pattern.|$|E
25|$|High {{oil prices}} {{typically}} affect less-affluent countries first, particularly {{the developing world}} with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation as well as private transport.

Just when Sehwag seemed set for another big innings, he edged a good-length ball from Gillespie after lunch, and was caught behind for 72 (123 for 1).|$|E

25|$|The town whose {{economic}} privileges {{were reduced}} by the Karnkowski Statutes, {{wanted to use the}} situation to regain its preferential position within the Polish Crown. It also preferred Maximilian, who <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> likely to support the towns' economic privileges, and who could also threaten serious economic repercussions (boycott by the Habsburgs). Thus the city, encouraged by its immense wealth and almost impregnable fortifications, {{as well as by the}} secret support of Denmark and Emperor Maximilian himself, had supported the latter's election.|$|E

The yellow blobs were also seen in BBC Kids' current idents. They directly oppose the CBBC blobs, as these blobs are gentle in their actions and to look at, whereas the green CBBC blobs <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> outgoing and violent—one of the CBBC idents at the time involved karate.|$|E
25|$|From {{at least}} {{the late nineteenth century}} in Europe, there was {{speculation}} that the range of human sexual response <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a continuum than two or three discrete categories. Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld published a scheme in 1896 that measured the strength of an individual's sexual desire on two independent 10-point scales, A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual). A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5; a homosexual individual may be A5, B0; an asexual would be A0, B0; and someone with an intense attraction to both sexes would be A9, B9.|$|E

25|$|During the 18th century, {{some of the}} {{students}} at colleges such as those in Sárospatak and Székelyudvarhely were minor nobles from rural areas who brought with them their regional styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, {{the students}}' songbooks indicate a growth in the popularity of homophonic songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of Ádám Pálóczi Horváth’s Ötödfélszáz Énekek in 1853. These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> to other (Western) European styles for influence.|$|E
25|$|After Crystal Palace's {{failure to}} return to top-flight football, {{speculation}} about Johnson's future at the club began with a transfer to a Premier League club seeming highly likely. However, when an initial bid from Everton of £7.25million was rejected, it <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> likely that the club {{would be able to}} keep Johnson for a further year after all. Nevertheless, the departure of manager Iain Dowie only increased the likelihood of Johnson's departure, and on 24 May 2006 Palace accepted an £8.5mmillion offer from Wigan Athletic for Johnson. This bid was matched by fellow Lancashire club Bolton Wanderers a day later, which was also accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{most diverse}} group of labyrinthodonts was the Temnospondyli. Temnospondyls {{appeared}} the Late Devonian and came in all sizes, from small salamander-like Stereospondyli that scurried along the waters edge and undergrowth, to giant, well armoured Archegosauroidea that <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like crocodiles. Prionosuchus was an exceptionally large member of the Archegosauridae, estimated to have been up to 9 meters long, {{it is the largest}} amphibian ever known to have lived. Temnospondyls typicall had large heads and heavy shoulder girdles with moderately long tails. A fossil trackway from Lesotho shows larger forms dragged themselves by the front limbs over slippery surfaces with limited sideways movement of the body, very unlike modern salamanders.|$|E
