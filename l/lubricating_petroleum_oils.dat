5000|$|The Imperial Oil - Strathcona Refinery is an oil {{refinery}} located adjacent to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, owned by Imperial Oil. The refinery provides oil products, primarily gasoline, aviation fuel, diesel, <b>lubricating</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>petroleum</b> waxes, {{heavy fuel oil}} and asphalts.|$|R
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as <b>lubricating</b> <b>oil,</b> <b>petroleum</b> jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|R
40|$|Lipids {{extracted}} from human skin contain variable amounts of paraffin hydrocarbons. Although {{the composition of}} these alkanes strongly resembles petroleum waxes, it has been proposed that they are biosynthetic products of human skin. To investigate this question, skin surface lipids from 15 normal subjects were analyzed for the amount and composition of alkanes, using quantitative thin-layer chromatography and quarts capillary gas chromatography. The alkanes were found to constitute 0. 5 % to 1. 7 % of the skin lipids. Subjects differed greatly in the chain length distribution of their alkanes between 15 and 35 carbon atoms, and in the relative amounts of normal alkanes (like those in petroleum waxes) and branched chain alkanes (like those in <b>petroleum</b> <b>lubricating</b> <b>oils).</b> In 6 subjects, the alkane content of cerumen from each ear was examined to investigate whether alkanes arrive at the skin surface by a systemic route or by direct contract with environmental surfaces. No trace of alkanes was found in 11 of the 12 cerumen samples. Using a tandem accelerator mass spectrometer for carbon- 14 dating, a combined sample of the skin surface alkanes {{was found to have}} a theoretical age of 30, 950 years, similar to that of a sample of petrolatum. These analyses indicate that the alkanes found on the surface of human skin are mixtures of a variety of petroleum distillation fractions that are acquired by direct contamination from the environment...|$|R
40|$|Phenols in our {{environment}} come from various sources. For example, many {{are found in}} the waste waters of industries such as petroleum refineries, glue and resin manufacturers, coal processing, pulp and paper mills, and from the leaching of municipal landfills. Phenol is toxic to fish at a level of 0. 05 mg/l, therefore the removing of phenols from waste water is therefore of great importance. Produced water is the water pumped from aquifers associated with <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> production, gas production or coal bed methane production. Produced water from <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> reservoirs was produced in huge amounts and it contained several pollutants, such as phenol and <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> droplets. New methods were required to reduce the amounts of toxic pollutants to permissible limits before rejecting this produced water to the environment. The produced water contained the following 4. 5 mg/L phenol, 300 mg/l <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil,</b> Cl- 62 mg/L and pH 6. 0. The effect of addition of <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> on the activity of horseradish peroxidase was determined. It was found that <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil</b> has strong depressing effect on the activity of the horseradish peroxidase at concentrations up to 1 gm/L of <b>petroleum</b> <b>oil.</b> The effects of treating the produced water with enzyme peroxidase extracted from horseradish plant, peroxide (H 2 O 2) and polyethylene glycol have been studied. The horseradish peroxidase–hydrogen peroxide system decreased the amount of phenol present in produced water by 80 %. The most effective concentrations for treating produced water were peroxidase at 2 U/mL and 0. 5 mM hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) at neutral pH...|$|R
