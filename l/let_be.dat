500|$|In {{a letter}} to his friend and {{landlord}} Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: [...] "Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be [...] "the most ungrateful creature". He was said to have describe Wolfgang as [...] "The miracle which God <b>let</b> <b>be</b> born in Salzburg". Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: [...] "Too soon, [...] father dragged [...] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child..." [...] However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.|$|E
