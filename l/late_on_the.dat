5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located across central Canada built {{down into the}} Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|Carleton ordered {{most of the}} British army to sail upriver toward Sorel on June 9, {{but they}} did not {{actually}} leave until he joined them on June 13. A detachment of 1200 men under Fraser marched up the northern shore toward Berthier and Montreal. The British fleet arrived at Sorel <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 14th; the Americans had left there just that morning. Elements of the British army entered Montreal on June 17, and also arrived at Fort Saint-Jean {{in time to see the}} last Americans (the very last one reported to be Benedict Arnold) push away from its burning remnants.|$|E
5|$|Deutschland {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the High Seas Fleet until 1913, when she {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron. With the outbreak of World War I in July 1914, she and her sister ships were tasked with defending the mouth of the Elbe and the German Bight from possible British incursions. Deutschland and the other ships of the II Battle Squadron participated in most of the large-scale fleet operations {{in the first two years}} of the war, culminating in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day of the battle, Deutschland and the other pre-dreadnoughts briefly engaged several British battlecruisers before retreating.|$|E

5|$|Early {{during the}} morning of September 2, {{hurricane}} watches were extended southward to Craig Key. Later that morning, hurricane watches were upgraded to hurricane warnings for the lower east coast of Florida while a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning was raised {{for most of the}} Florida Keys and Florida Bay. Hurricane warnings were dropped for the Turks and Caicos Islands <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morning of September 1 and for the Southeast Bahamas late that night. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> morning of September 3, hurricane watches were issued for the northeast coast of Florida, while early that afternoon tropical storm warnings were issued for the same area. Hurricane warnings were dropped for the central Bahamas that afternoon. That night, tropical storm warnings were issued for the southwest coast of the Florida peninsula with watches issued for the northwest Florida peninsula. On the morning of September 4, tropical storm warnings were extended northward to Anna Maria Island and along the Georgia coast. Tropical storm watches were extended northward to St. Marks, Florida. That afternoon, hurricane watches were dropped for most of the northwest Bahamas while warnings were extended up the coast to St. Marks, and watches were extended westward to Panama City, Florida.|$|E

5|$|In December 1917, Emden led {{a raid on}} British {{shipping}} in the North Sea. Early on the 11th, Emden and the II Flotilla left port; the torpedo-boat flotilla {{split in}} half off the Dogger Bank {{to search for the}} British convoy, while Emden stood by in support at the Dogger Bank.

5|$|In the {{following}} match against Essex, Loxton returned as Australia won the toss, batted first {{and went on}} to score a world record of 721 first-class runs in one day’s play. Loxton came in at 4/452 and put on 56 with Ron Hamence and 166 with Ron Saggers in 65 minutes before falling at 6/664 for 120. Loxton's innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes. During the innings, Loxton also passed 1,000 first-class career runs. Australia collapsed after Loxton's departure, losing their last five wickets for 57 <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day.|$|E

5|$|Only very <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{night of}} 15 June was Wellington {{certain that the}} Charleroi attack was the main French thrust.

5|$|The Action of 16 October 1799 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates of the Spanish Navy close to the Spanish naval port of Vigo in Galicia. The Spanish ships were a treasure convoy, carrying silver specie and luxury trade goods across the Atlantic Ocean from the colonies of New Spain to Spain. Sighted by British frigate HMS Naiad enforcing the blockade of Vigo <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 15 October, the Spanish ships were in the last stages of their journey. Turning to flee from Naiad, the Spanish soon found themselves surrounded as more British frigates closed in.|$|E
5|$|The Smokers {{began their}} innings <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day. By that stage, the pitch had {{deteriorated}} and light was poor, making batting more difficult. By {{the end of}} the day's play forty minutes later, they had lost four wickets and only scored 25 runs. They fared better the following morning, but only three batsmen reached double figures—Billy Gunn, 18, Monty Bowden, 29, and Charles Clarke, 20 not out—as they were bowled out for 111 just before the lunch break. W. G. Grace was the pick of the bowlers, taking five wickets for 29 runs. A first-innings deficit of 139 runs meant that the Smokers were forced to follow on.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} gradually {{developed over the}} extreme southeastern Caribbean Sea on November 1. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. By November 4, the system stalled to the north of Curaçao, which was followed by a turn to the northeast. Convection slowly organized as a surface circulation formed, and on November 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen. Initially weak with only 20mph (32km/h) winds, the depression steadily organized as it moved northeastward, and a Reconnaissance Aircraft mission confirmed the existence of the cyclone on November 6 as it was located midway between Puerto Rico and the Netherlands Antilles. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 6th, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Klaus while located a short distance south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC to downgrade it to a tropical depression when it turned northward and emerged into the Philippine Sea. <b>Late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a stationary front early on January 21.|$|E

5|$|Alex {{turned to}} the east-northeast after passing the Outer Banks in {{response}} to becoming embedded within the west-southwesterly flow. The hurricane briefly weakened to a Category1, but restrengthened due to warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Water temperatures remained 3.6 °F (2 °C) above normal, resulting in Alex intensifying into a 120mph (195km/h) major hurricane on August 5 while located 450miles (710km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Due to low vertical shear and favorable conditions, Alex remained a Category3 hurricane until passing over cooler waters <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 5th while 290miles (465km) south of Newfoundland. Alex rapidly weakened, degrading into tropical storm status on August 6. Later on the 6th, Alex became extratropical while 950miles (1530km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland, and lost its identity shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As the division's assault units {{began their}} {{approach}} march towards {{the line of}} departure <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening of 6 June, the German artillery opened up with a gas bombardment that severely hindered the march, breaking up the assaulting units as men became lost. Suffering over 2,000 casualties before the battle even began, many of the division's assault units reached their assembly points with less than 200 men, nevertheless they arrived on time and at the appointed hour, {{after a number of}} mines were exploded in front of their positions, the assault began. The exploding mines had destroyed {{a large part of the}} German line and as a result initial resistance was quickly overcome by the division's lead battalions—the 33rd, 34th, 38th and 39th—and by 5am, the division had gained the crest of the Messines ridge and began digging in to defend against a possible counter-attack. In the engagements that followed the division largely played only a supporting role.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the first hour. The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E
