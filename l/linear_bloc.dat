40|$|In {{this paper}} a three stage {{procedure}} is presented for deriving parameters bounds of SISO Wiener models when the nonlinear block is modeled by a possibly noninvertible polynomial and the output measurement errors are bounded. First, using steady-state input-output data, {{parameters of the}} nonlinear part are bounded by a tight orthotope. Then, given the estimated uncertain nonlinearity and the output measurements collected exciting the system with an input dynamic signal, bounds on the unmeasurable inner signal are computed. Finally, such bounds, together with noisy output measurements, are used for bounding {{the parameters of the}} <b>linear</b> <b>bloc...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chlorophyll {{fluorescence}} is a non-invasive {{approach to}} energetics of the photosystem II (PSII). Light energy transfer to quantum chlorophyll acceptor (QA) and its conversion intophotochemical and non-photochemical energy {{is characterized by}} some chlorophyll fluorescence parameters measured under the experimental framed conditions. Literature data has shown the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are certainly influenced by plant water provisions (Lenham, 1994, Oogren, 1990), frost and mineral nutrition (Mohamed et al., 1995) and light intensity (Groninger et al., 1996). Sometimes the entire photosystem II (PSII) equilibrium is significantly upset by many environmental factors, {{as well as by}} the foliar applied fertilizers and growth control chemicals. Consequently, chlorophyll fluorescence, as an applicative method might be used to acknowledge the response of plant to foliar treatments as a perturbation factor in chlorophyll photosynthesis. The experimental plan concern the application of Frucol product as polyfunctional foliar fluid (nutritive, growth enhancing and fungicide biological effects). Six experimental variants were set up in <b>linear</b> <b>blocs</b> with three repetitions. Three main factors were considered in the development of experiments: Factor A - apple cultivar (a 1 -‘Jonathan’, a 2 -‘Idared’); Factor B – foliar treatment (b 1 blank – untreated, b 2 – 4 treatments with Frucol 1 0. 5 % over the entire vegetation period with the first treatment after fruitlets abscision and the next 3 treatments at 20 days interval, b 3 - 3 treatments with Frucol 2 0. 5 % over the entire vegetation period with the first treatment after fruitlets abscision and the next 2 treatments at the same 20 days interval, b 4 - 5 treatments with Frucol 1 0. 5 %, first after fruitlets thinning and the next 4 treatments every 20 days, b 5 – 3 treatments with Frucol 2 0. 5 % over fruits growth period at 14 days intervals, b 6 – 2 treatments with Frucol 2 0. 5 %, the first 10 days before harvesting and the second in the day of harvest); and Factor C - the days when the measurements were made: c 1 – 30 July, c 2 - 5 August, c 3 - 17 August, c 4 - 24 August, c 5 - 13 September. Duncan test was applied for statistical confidence computation of the results. For the treated Jonathan plots, according to the factor B variation, namely variant b 5 and variant b 6 were exhibiting significant differences againstblank in the Fv/Fm ratio in epicarp fruit area. These differences grew very slowly but significantly up to 20 August and then with rising rate until full fruit ripening, accounting for Frucol 2 product capacity to accelerate the chlorophyll degradation to anthocyanins. More intensive effects of the Frucol 2 products were noticed in the case of Idared cultivar. For both cultivars the Fv/Fm ratio in foliage was poorly affected by all the applied treatments. Nevertheless, the loss in chlorophyll synthesis rate due to foliage senescence over the August-September interval was as usually higher for Jonathan cultivar and much more intense due to the applied treatments...|$|R
