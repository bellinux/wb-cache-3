Airflow direction transducers and an impact pressure transducer are the primary instruments for measuring vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> velocity, and a sensitive incremental pressure transducer is used to measure longitudinal gust velocity.

Their reactions to a <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> and control power required by each for simple maneuvers were determined and compared. Both types of airplanes require almost identical aileron control power to perform a given maneuver; tailless airplane requires about 1 - 2 to 1 - 3 directional control power of conventional airplane. Tailless airplane also shows greatest displacement for a given disturbance and has least damping in oscillatory mode...|$|E
40|$|A {{standard}} FE-analysis {{of large}} aeroplanes reveals one or several 2 - 4 Hz modes of the horizontal tailplane (HTP), termed coplanar modes. They describe a coplanar or a fore / aft {{motion of the}} HTP. Due to their low eigenfrequencies, these modes can be easily excited by <b>lateral</b> <b>gust,</b> in particular by continuous turbulence on the fin. As the aerodyamic damping of these modes is small, strong resonance phenomena occur, yielding high loads at the HTP root. Via a mode control system, consisting of a dynamic feedback of the x-acceleration at the HTP-tip to the rudder, active damping and thereby a loads reduction of more than 20 % is demonstrated. The system is termed HTP-contol(ler) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{approach to}} the gust-load problem which consists in considering flight through turbulent air to be a stationary random process is extended by including the effect of lateral variation of the instantaneous gust intensity on the aerodynamic forces. The forces obtained in this manner are used in dynamic analyses of rigid and flexible airplanes free to move vertically, in pitch, and in roll. The effect of the interaction of longitudinal, vertical, and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> on the wing stresses is also considered...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the effect of gusts on aircraft wake vortices. Aircraft wake vortices present a potential risk to following aircraft, particularly during final approach and landing, as wake vortices may remain in the flight corridor for a long time. Wind and turbulence are key factors that influence the wake vortex evolution and the wake vortex generation in the aircraft. Flying through a gust influences the wake vortex roll-up process and its evolution. Note that vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> may affect counter-rotating wake vortices differently. Both vortices influence each other by inducing a downward velocity...|$|R

The gust generator design, construction, and testing is described. Typical test results are presented in the form of <b>lateral</b> and longitudinal <b>gust</b> perturbation velocities as a function of generator reduced frequency...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{demand for}} robust, low-computation sensing {{and control of}} micro-air {{vehicles}} motivates development of new technology. A MEMS wind ow sensor has been developed in-house, drawing inspiration from setae structures seen in biology. The goal of this work is to validate {{the use of these}} new sensors for wind frame state estimation and gust rejection. Three of these sensors were mounted on the surface of a fuselage-like structure to estimate wind speed, angle of attack, and sideslip angle. Static linear and nonlinear estimation model structures and parameters were designed with time-domain equation-error system identication techniques. For small angles, state estimation was demonstrated for both estimation schemes. Gust rejection control was implemented to improve state regulation {{in the presence of a}} <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> stream. A robust controller was implemented and displayed lateral velocity and path perturbation attenuation...|$|E
40|$|A light {{airplane}} {{equipped with}} an automatic control system which drives large wing flaps and the stabilator so as to produce a constant pitch attitude in all flight modes was analyzed for its response to a specific gust. The aircraft was also equipped with a bank-angle steering, zero sideslip automatic control system which was studied for its effectiveness in suppressing a specific <b>lateral</b> <b>gust.</b> The gusts were assumed to be comprised of 200 lateral and 400 vertical sinusoids. Each was used to excite the controlled aircraft and the time response to {{the sum of all}} sinusoids was plotted. The assumption was that the gust may be treated as stationary in space but variable in time rather than the reverse. Results indicate that such a control system can suppress vertical gusts up to the limit of control authority. Either the lateral accelerations or the yawing velocity response to lateral gusts can be suppressed with this system but not both simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} methods for modeling of gusts {{have been implemented}} into the CFD-code TAU. The first one is the so called disturbance velocity approach, a simplified method which allows predicting {{the influence of a}} gust on the aircraft, but not the influence of the aircraft aerodynamics on the shape of the gust. Alternatively, an unsteady boundary condition has been implemented to feed in the gust into the flow field. Thereby the mutual interaction of gust and aircraft is captured. Both methods are compared in order to access the validity range of the simplified approach. A result is that for gust wavelength larger than two reference chords the agreement of the highly accurate method and simplified approach is good. For such a case the simplified approach has been used to simulate the interaction of a generic fighter aircraft with a <b>lateral</b> <b>gust.</b> Here, the reaction of the aircraft due to the additional loads has been taken into account by coupling of aerodynamics and flight-mechanics...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{approach to}} the gust-load problem which consists in considering flight through turbulent air to be a stationary random process is extended by including the effect of lateral variation of the instantaneous gust intensity on the aerodynamic forces. The forces obtained in this manner are used in dynamic analyses of rigid and flexible airplanes free to move vertically, in pitch, and in roll. The effect of the interaction of longitudinal, normal, and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> on the wing stresses is also considered. The method of analyzing the rigid-body motions {{is similar to that}} used for analyses of the dynamic stability of airplanes, in that the equations of motion are referred to stability axes and expressed in terms of conventional stability derivatives. The method of analyzing the dynamic effects of structural flexibility consists in an extension of a numerical-integration {{approach to the}} static aeroelastic problem and is in a form which offers the possibility of calculating divergence and flutter speeds with relatively little additional effort. The mean-square values, correlation functions, and power spectra of some of the aerodynamic forces required in this type of analysis are calculated for one special correlation function of the atmospheric turbulence. It is shown, for instance, that if the span is relatively large compared with the integral scale of turbulence, the mean- square lift and root bending moment directly due to the gust are substantially reduced when the differences in instantaneous intensity of the turbulence along the span are taken into account. However, if the motions of the airplane are taken into account the mean-square root bending moment may be increased {{as a result of these}} differences. Also, the mean-square pitching moment is shown to be substantially increased if the tail length is relatively large compared with the scale of turbulence. Finally, the wing stresses due to longitudinal, normal, and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> are shown to be statistically independent under certain conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} a vehicle moving through a <b>lateral</b> wind <b>gust</b> {{has always been a}} {{difficult}} task due to the difficulties in granting the right similitude. The facility proposed by Ryan and Dominy {{has been one of the}} best options to carry it out. In this approach, a double wind tunnel is used to send a <b>lateral</b> moving <b>gust</b> on a stationary model. Using this idea as a starting point, the ISAE has built a dedicated test bench for lateral wind studies on transient conditions. Experimental work has been carried out by means of time-resolved PIV, aiming at studying the unsteady interpenetration of the two flows coming from each wind tunnel. Meanwhile, a 3 D CFD model based on URANS was set up, faithfully reproducing the double wind tunnel. Both the experimental and numerical results are compared, and the evolution of the reproduced wind gust is discussed. Conclusions are finally determined about the validity of this kind of test bench for ground vehicle applications...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft wake {{vortices}} {{present a}} potential risk to following aircraft, particularly during final approach and landing, as wake vortices may {{remain in the}} air lane for a long time. Wind and turbulence are the key factors influencing the wake vortex evolution, but also the wake vortex generation behind the aircraft. Flying through a gust influences the wake vortex roll-up process and its evolution. Note that vertical and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> may affect counter-rotating wake vortices differently. Both vortices influence each other by inducing a downward velocity. Disturbances may therefore lead to local vortex tilting and later to complex three-dimensional deformation. This work employs two different hybrid RANS-LES approaches to investigate the effect of gusts on wake-vortex evolution. In a one-way coupling, a pre-calculated RANS velocity field of the aircraft’s near-field is being swept through an LES domain. The effect of a sine gust on the turbulent wake is modelled by manipulating the RANS-field accordingly. As a more sophisticated approach the concept of two-way coupling is being presented. Here an LES and a URANS solver are coupled bi-directionally, exchanging values at every physical time step...|$|R

The ground test articles were tested to a high bending dynamic <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> condition. The first unit failed during static testing at 98 percent Design Ultimate Load. Failure began within the front spar cap. A detailed review of the failure was performed to identify all possible modes. This review resulted in a 'production line' type fix being designed for incorporation in the second ground test article prior to installation in the test fixture. The modified second unit sustained 106 percent of Design Ultimate Load without incident. One lifetime (36, 000 flights) of damage tolerance testing was accomplished with the specimen purposely damaged at five locations.

40|$|An {{integrated}} modelling {{approach for}} gust and manoeuvre loads analysis is presented. Typically, the unsteady aerodynamics for gust loads are computed by the Doublet Lattice Method. However, this method {{does not account}} for effects, which are important from a flight dynamics and manoeuvre loads perspective. E. g., the roll-yaw coupling, also responsible for the flight mechanical eigenmodes like the dutch roll mode, are unaccounted for by the DLM. Since, the dutch roll mode might also be excited by lateral gusts, this might have an influence on the loads response. In this paper, the unsteady aerodynamics are computed by a 3 D panel method, capable of capturing the flight dynamics accurately and provide complex Aerodynamics Influence Coefficients for gust loads analysis as a function of reduced frequency similar to the DLM. The aerodynamics of the panel method are validate by comparison with CFD results. Differences in the flight mechanics between the DLM and the panel methods are assessed for a parametric variation of the wing dihedral of an aircraft model. Finally, results from a frequency domain gust loads analysis of a <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> for the DLM and the 3 D panel method are compared...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Structural {{optimization}} {{tools and}} computer simulations have gained the paramount importance in industrial applications {{as a result}} of innovative designs, reduced weight and cost effective products. Especially, in aircraft and automobile industries, topology optimization has {{become an integral part of}} the product design process. In this paper nonparametric topology optimization has been applied on a commercial aircraft vertical stabilizer component using ANSYS software. Suitable loads and constraints are applied on the initial design space of the component to accommodate for fin gust, rudder deflection, <b>lateral</b> <b>gust,</b> and other loads experienced by an aircraft during actual flight maneuvering. An integrated approach has also been developed to verify the structural performance and to overcome the problem of nonmanufacturable topology optimization results. Post machining distortions are also simulated by using element deactivation technique first by developing an initial residual stress field through Sequential Coupled Field analysis. CATIA is used to convert the optimized FE model into geometry based CAD model and then virtual machining is done.

It is inferred that topology optimization results in a better and innovative product design with enhanced structural performance and stability...|$|E
40|$|All three {{components}} of turbulence were measured simultaneously in flight at each wing {{tip of a}} Beech D- 18 aircraft. The flights were conducted at low altitude, 30. 5 - 61. 0 meters (100 - 200 ft.), over water {{in the presence of}} wind driven turbulence. Statistical properties of flight measured turbulence were compared with Gaussian and non-Gaussian turbulence models. Spatial characteristics of the turbulence were analyzed using the data from flight perpendicular and parallel to the wind. The probability density distributions of the vertical gusts show distinctly non-Gaussian characteristics. The distributions of the longitudinal and <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts</b> are generally Gaussian. The power spectra compare in the inertial subrange at some points better with the Dryden spectrum, while at other points the von Karman spectrum is a better approximation. In the low frequency range the data show peaks or dips in the power spectral density. The cross between vertical gusts {{in the direction of the}} mean wind were compared with a matched non-Gaussian model. The real component of the cross spectrum is in general close to the non-Gaussian model. The imaginary component, however, indicated a larger phase shift between these two gust components than was found in previous research...|$|R

40|$|Ground vehicle {{travelling}} along a road {{is subject}} to unsteady crosswinds {{in a number of}} situations. In windy conditions, for example, the natural atmospheric wind can exhibit strong <b>lateral</b> <b>gusts.</b> Other situations such as tunnel exits or overtaking induce sudden changes in crosswinds, as well. The interaction of this unsteady oncoming flow with the vehicle and the resulting aerodynamic forces and moments affect the vehicle stability and comfort. The objectives of the current study are to improve the understanding of flow physics of such transient flow and ultimately to develop measurement techniques to quantify the vehicle’s sensitivity to unsteady crosswind. A squareback simplified car model is exposed to a forced oscillating yaw and results are compared to static measurements. Tests are conducted at Reynolds number Re= 3. 7 x 105 and reduced frequencies ranging from 0. 265 x 10 - 2 to 5. 3 x 10 - 2. Unsteady side force and yawing moment measurements are associated to Particle Image Velocimetry flow fields to interpret dynamic loads in link with flow topology evolution. Phase average force and moment measurements are found to exhibit a phase shift between static and dynamic tests that increases with oscillating frequency. Velocity fields reveal that the phase-shift seems to originate from the rear part of the car model. Moreover, lateral vortical structures appearing on lee side from ß= 15 ° increase this phase-shift and consequently appear to be favourable to the lateral stability of the vehicle. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} effectiveness in simulating aircraft maneuvers with both current and newly developed motion cueing algorithms was assessed with an eleven-subject piloted performance evaluation {{conducted on the}} NASA Langley Visual Motion Simulator (VMS). In addition to the current NASA adaptive algorithm, two new cueing algorithms were evaluated: the optimal algorithm and the nonlinear algorithm. The test maneuvers included a straight-in approach with a rotating wind vector, an offset approach with severe turbulence and an on/off <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> that occurs as the aircraft approaches the runway threshold, and a takeoff both with and without engine failure after liftoff. The maneuvers were executed with each cueing algorithm with added visual display delay conditions ranging from zero to 200 msec. Two methods, the quasi-objective NASA Task Load Index (TLX), and power spectral density analysis of pilot control, {{were used to assess}} pilot workload. Piloted performance parameters for the approach maneuvers, the vertical velocity upon touchdown and the runway touchdown position, were also analyzed but did not show any noticeable difference among the cueing algorithms. TLX analysis reveals, in most cases, less workload and variation among pilots with the nonlinear algorithm. Control input analysis shows pilot-induced oscillations on a straight-in approach were less prevalent compared to the optimal algorithm. The augmented turbulence cues increased workload on an offset approach that the pilots deemed more realistic compared to the NASA adaptive algorithm. The takeoff with engine failure showed the least roll activity for the nonlinear algorithm, with the least rudder pedal activity for the optimal algorithm...|$|E

The “dry-line ” at the cT/mT boundary is shown to be characterized by an extremely abrupt gradient of watervapor content and temperature, accompanied by a wind-shift zone with appreciable horizontal convergence. On the moist air side, there were pronounced wavelike perturbations in the nioisture and temperature fields, connected with systematic variations of the vector wind velocity. Special pilot-balloon observations show the low-level jet as a flat sheet of southerly winds, with maximum strength generally 300 to 500 m. above ground, and illustrate the great variations of wind speed associated with diurnal variability of stability in the surface layers. Appreciable streakiness of the velocity field is indicated by both pibal and aircraft measurements. A description is given {{of a series of}} intense low-pressure systems observed at the surface, in association with the northwest sides of radar echoes. These depressions, which form at night, are warm and very dry relative to their surroundings, and are attended by strong, gusty surface winds. High-level aircraft observations are illustrated, demonstrating particularly the significant disturbances of the wind field around cloud tops. An example of gust measurements in the upper portion of a thunderstorm (imbedded in strong vertical shear) shows that the <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> components, up to 30 m. /sec., are of the same order as the vertical gusts.

40|$|The strong {{search for}} {{lightweight}} materials {{has become a}} trend in the aerospace industry. Aircraft manufacturers are responding to this trend and new aerospace materials are introduced to build lighter aircrafts. However material manufacturers, like Tata Steel, are unfamiliar with the determination of running loads and the behavior of materials in fuselage structures. Therefore an evaluation tool is needed for determining the running loads and evaluating the performance of new materials. This will give material manufacturers better insight in what properties and performance are specifically needed for materials in aircraft structures. The goal of this project is to develop an analytic design, analysis and evaluation tool for both metal and composite fuselage configurations in Visual Basic Application {{in order to gain}} insight into the structural performance of these material classes and to estimate the weight and required structural dimensions for both aluminum and composite fuselages. The fuselage geometry is setup parametrical and modeled as a simplified tube with variable crosssection without cut-outs and wing box, and it is divided in bays and skin panels. By modeling the aerodynamic-, gravity-, ground reaction forces and internal pressure a free body diagram and force/moment distribution is created for several flight and ground load cases, like 1 G flight, <b>lateral</b> <b>gust</b> or landing load cases. The critical load cases are used for analysis. The running loads, like bending stress, longitudinal stress, circumferential stress and shear stress are calculated for the entire aircraft fuselage. A clear load pattern is created in order to evaluate the materials. The materials are evaluated for strength, stability and several other failure modes, like fatigue and crack growth. The skin panels are optimized for these evaluation methodologies and after doing so a minimum fuselage weight is obtained for conventional aircraft configurations. The Airbus A 320 is taken as reference aircraft and the running loads and optimization results of the model are validated with this aircraft. The model proved to be valid and is therefore considered suitable to be used as an analysis and evaluation tool.

Research {{completed}} at Department of Psychology, College of Liberal Arts and SciencesThe effect of cognitive load on lane variation is inconsistent and theoretically unclear. The lateral prioritization hypothesis proposes that smaller lane deviation is due to more attention to steering control and active prioritization of lane keeping; the automatic steering hypothesis argues that it is due to less attention to the automatic behaviors of steering control. Would more attention to lane keeping improve or impair lane-keeping performance? Participants in a driving simulator performed a lane-keeping task while performing an N-back task. Participants were asked to prioritize lane-keeping, car-following or the secondary task. When drivers prioritized lane-keeping, lane-variability was significantly smaller than that in the drive-only condition and secondary-task prioritization condition.

40|$|A non-Gaussian {{model of}} {{atmospheric}} turbulence is presented and analyzed. The model {{is restricted to}} the regions of the atmosphere where the turbulence is steady or continuous, and the assumptions of homogeneity and stationarity are justified. Also spatial distribution of turbulence is neglected, so the model consists of three independent, stationary stochastic processes which represent the vertical, <b>lateral,</b> and longitudinal <b>gust</b> components. The non-Gaussian and Gaussian models are compared with experimental data, and it is shown that the Gaussian model underestimates the number of high velocity gusts which occur in the atmosphere, while the non-Gaussian model can be adjusted to match the observed high velocity gusts more satisfactorily.

40|$|Small UAVs, due {{to their}} easy {{handling}} and lesser logistic support requirements are attracting lot of interest for applications ranging from military to commercial, and even for scientific data collection. In present day scenario, they are mostly used to conduct surveillance, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions for military and civilian outfits. In order to complete the assigned tasks they are usually equipped with surveillance cameras. Unlike their larger counterparts, smaller UAVs {{by virtue of their}} size cannot carry sophisticated gyro stabilized cameras. It therefore becomes important to address this shortcoming, in terms of non availability of gyro stabilization by ensuring a smoother flight even inturbulent weather to receive a stable and good quality video from UAV. Growing interest in small UAVs has motivated many equipment manufacturers to develop OffThe Shelf autopilots. Being cost effective, simple, flexible and reliable, PID based autopilots are generally preferred for the purpose. Besides number of advantages, PID controllers have a limitation thatthey sometimes require retuning of the gains when subjected to external disturbance. UAVs perform satisfactorily if the atmospheric conditions do not change much. However, if the UAV moves to a location where the atmospheric conditions change substantially, the PID gains may require readjustment / retuning, which is a tedious job and requires numerous UAV flights; otherwise performance degradations in terms of pitching and rolling oscillations are observed. The above premise formed the basis and source of motivation for this research. It was considered thatinstead of going for retuning, gain scheduling or replacing the existing, conveniently available PID controller with some intricate or complex controller, a simpler, realizable and effective scheme should be adopted. The basic idea of the proposed scheme was derived from a situation in which a boy sometimes requires a bit of extra hand from his father sitting beside him, while driving through a bumpy and wavy patch of road. Father closely monitors the driving performance of his son on bumpy road and when he thinks that slight help in terms of applying an extra force by holding the steering can improve the capability of his son to negotiate the bad patch, he does so. After passing through bumpy part of road when father senses that the extra effort is no more required, he gradually removes it and his son takes over the car back again as a solo driver. Following the same analogy, the idea was conceived to propose a supervising mechanism which can act like a human pilot and can be augmented with an existing control system of a UAV for improving its performance in presence of atmospheric disturbances without going into exercise of retuning the controller gains. Our supervisory mechanism is composed of two modules, â€œobserver moduleâ€� and â€œcorrection generator moduleâ€�. We developed a human thinking like logic for observer module so that it keeps monitoring the status of flight through specified inputs and outputs of the system and instructs the correction generator module to augment main controller by adding compensation commands when required i. e. in case undesired attitude error is observed. The second module for correction generation is based on Fuzzy rules, where rule set was developed using input from a UAV pilot. Effort is made to maintain a logical layout of this thesis so that the reader can be familiarized with the theoretical concepts and analysis tools related to UAVs. A small UAV with already published aerodynamic data is taken as a reference bird. In chapter two and three of this thesis detailed explanation about the formulation of its nonlinear mathematical modeling, linearization process to achieve decoupling and simplicity, conducting static and dynamic stability analysis, criteria for flying qualities assessment is given. Designing of PID controllers for attitude, altitude and heading control using linearized UAV models is covered in chapter four. Performance of designed controller is also validated by using nonlinear UAV model. Atmospheric disturbances such as wind shear and turbulence significantly influence the attitude of UAVs. Rotary moments, rolling moments, vertical and <b>lateral</b> wind <b>gusts</b> generated due to moderate to severe turbulence are simulated as atmospheric disturbance. Pitch and roll response in presence of these disturbances are presented. In chapter five the functionality of proposed scheme is discussed in detail and simulations are run to demonstrate improved pitch and roll response under atmospheric disturbance by augmenting the supervisory mechanism. Simulation results showing significant reduction in attitude errors with slight increase in control effort after augmenting the supervisory mechanism are presented. Simulations are run using liner as well as nonlinear model of UAV.

40|$|The {{response}} of aircraft to stochastic atmospheric turbulence {{plays an important}} role in aircraft-design (load calculations), Flight Control System (FCS) design and flight-simulation (handling qualities research and pilot training). In order to simulate these aircraft responses, an accurate mathematical model is required. Two classical models will be discussed in this thesis, that is the Delft University of Technology (DUT) model and the Four Point Aircraft (FPA) model. Although they are well estabilished, their fidelity remains obscure. The cause lies in one of the requirements for system identification; it has always been necessary to relate inputs to outputs to determine, or identify, system dynamic characteristics. From experiments, using both the measured input and the measured output, a mathematical model of any system can be obtained. When considering an input-output system such as an aircraft subjected to stochastic atmospheric turbulence, a major problem emerges. During flighttests, no practical difficulty arises measuring the aircraft motion (the output), such as the angle-of-attack, the pitch-angle, the roll-angle, etc [...] However, a huge problem arises when the input to the aircraft-system is considered; this input is stochastic atmospheric turbulence in this thesis. Currently, during flighttests it still remains extremely difficult to identify the entire flowfield around an aircraft geometry subjected to a turbulent field of flow; an infinite amount of sensors would be required to identify the atmospheric turbulence velocity component's distribution (the input) over the vehicle geometry. In an attempt to shed some more light on solving the problem of the {{response of}} aircraft to atmospheric turbulence, the subject of this thesis, it depends on the formulation of two distinct models: one of the atmospheric turbulence itself (the atmospheric turbulence model), and the other of the aircraft response to it (the mathematical aircraft model). As concerns atmospheric turbulence, stochastic, stationary, homogeneous, isotropic atmospheric turbulence is considered in this thesis as input to the aircraft model. Models of atmospheric turbulence are well established. As for mathematical aircraft models, many of them have been proposed before. However, verifying these models has always been extremely difficult due to the identification problem indicated above. As part of the mathematical aircraft model, (parametric) aerodynamic models often make use of (quasi-) steady aerodynamic results, that is all steady aerodynamic parameters are estimated using either results obtained from windtunnel experiments, handbook methods, Computational Aerodynamics (CA) which comprises Linearized Potential Flow (LPF) methods, or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which comprises Full-Potential, Euler and Navier-Stokes methods. In this thesis the simplest form of fluid-flow modeling is used to calculate the time-dependent aerodynamic forces and moments acting on a vehicle: that is unsteady Linearized Potential Flow (LPF). The fluid-flow model will result in a so called "unsteady panel-method" which will be used as a virtual windtunnel (or virtual flighttest facility) for the example discretized aircraft geometry, also referred to as the "aircraft grid". The application of the method ultimately results in the vehicle's steady and unsteady stability derivatives using harmonic analysis. Similarly, both the steady and unsteady gust derivatives for isolated atmospheric turbulence fields will be calculated. The gust fields will be limited to one-dimensional (1 D) longitudinal, <b>lateral</b> and vertical <b>gust</b> fields, as well as two-dimensional (2 D) longitudinal and vertical gust fields. The harmonic analysis results in frequency-dependent stability- and gust derivatives which will later be used to obtain an aerodynamic model in terms of constant stability- and gust derivatives. This newly introduced model, the Parametric Computational Aerodynamics (PCA) model, will be compared to the two classical models mentioned earlier, that is the Delft University of Technology (DUT) model and the Four-Point-Aircraft (FPA) model. These three parametric aircraft models are used to calculate both the time- and frequency-domain aerodynamic model and aircraft motion responses to the atmospheric turbulence fields indicated earlier. Also, using the unsteady panel-method the aircraft grid will be flown through spatial-domain 2 D stochastic gust fields, resulting in Linearized Potential Flow solutions. Results will be compared to the ones obtained for the parametric models, i. e. the PCA-, DUT- and FPA-model. From the results presented, it is concluded that the introduced PCA-model is the most accurate for all considered gust fields. Compared to the Linearized Potential Flow solution (which is assumed to be the benchmark, or the model that approximates reality closest) the new parametric model shows increased accuracy over the classical parametric models (the DUT- and FPA-model), especially for the aircraft responses to 2 D gust fields. Furthermore, it shows more accuracy in the aircraft responses to 1 D longitudinal gust fields. Although results will be presented for a Cessna Ce 550 Citation II aircraft only, the theory and methods are applicable to a wide variety of fixed-wing aircraft, that is from the smallest UAV to the largest aircraft (such as the Boeing B 747 and the Airbus A 380) ...|$|R
