40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{investigated}} the possibility of rerecruiting <b>lapsed</b> blood donors. Reasons for donation cessation, motivation to restart donation, and modifiable components of donation motivation were examined. We distinguished between <b>lapsed</b> donors who had passively withdrawn by merely not responding to donation invitations and donors who had contacted the blood bank to actively withdraw. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was sent to 400 actively <b>lapsed</b> donors and to 400 passively <b>lapsed</b> donors, measuring intention to restart donation and psychological correlates of restart intention. The {{data were analyzed using}} multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: The response rate among actively <b>lapsed</b> donors was higher than among passively <b>lapsed</b> donors (37 % vs. 25 %). Actively <b>lapsed</b> donors typically ceased donating because of physical reactions, while passively <b>lapsed</b> donors quit because of a busy lifestyle. Nonetheless, 51 % of actively <b>lapsed</b> responders and 80 % of passively <b>lapsed</b> responders were willing to restart donations. Multiple regression analysis showed that, for passively <b>lapsed</b> donors, cognitive attitude was the strongest correlate of intention to donate in the future (beta= 0. 605, p< 0. 001), with affective attitude (beta= 0. 239, p< 0. 05) and self-efficacy (beta= 0. 266, p< 0. 001) explaining useful proportions of the variance as well. For actively <b>lapsed</b> donors, cognitive attitude was also the strongest correlate of intention (beta= 0. 601, p< 0. 001), with affective attitude (beta= 0. 345, p< 0. 001) and moral norm (beta=- 0. 118, p< 0. 05) explaining smaller proportions of the variance. CONCLUSION: The majority of <b>lapsed</b> donors indicated a moderate to high intention to restart donations. Interventions focusing on boosting cognitive and affective attitudes and self-efficacy could further raise such intentions...|$|R

Yet marketing practitioners and academics know very little about what happens to customers after they stop buying the brand. This research investigates the brand equity of <b>lapsed</b> customers of five major financial institutions. The analysis compares the propensity for positive and/or negative brand associations, overall brand evaluation, and the propensity to consider the brand in the future across the main segments of <b>lapsed</b> customers. The results show that the group of <b>lapsed</b> customers is not homogenous, but consists of distinct segments. Customers who defected for different reasons also differ in their post-defection brand equity. The paper concludes with implications for winback strategies for <b>lapsed</b> customers and brand equity measurement and management. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many high-risk occupations, it is {{critical}} that a person remains alert at all times. There is much to be gained by being able to monitor a person on-line and detect <b>lapses</b> of consciousness (LoC) so that remedial action can be taken (e. g., a rest break) to ensure that safety is maintained. In this study, 15 normal subjects were observed on two sessions while they performed a continuous tracking task for a period of 1 hour. EEG, eye movements, tracking performance data and a video of the subject were recorded during the session. This paper presents some preliminary results on the phenomenon of <b>lapsing.</b> Only 4 of the 15 subjects did not have a LoC at some stage. Seven subjects had LoCs more than 45 times and 4 more than 100 times during the 2 hours. The mean rate of <b>lapsing</b> over all subjects was 29. 1 LoC/h. In contrast, <b>lapses</b> in performance were caused by both <b>lapses</b> of consciousness (30. 1 %) and attention (69. 9 %). There was no correlation found between age of subject and number of <b>lapses</b> of consciousness. Keywords—Alertness, <b>lapses</b> of consciousness, visuomotor tracking...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lapses</b> of {{attention}} are characteristic for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) {{and as such}} may impair performance of daily activities. Data from an on-road driving study were reanalyzed to determine <b>lapses</b> in patients with ADHD after treatment with methylphenidate and placebo. A total of 18 adult ADHD patients performed a 100 -km on-road driving test and were instructed to drive with a steady lateral position and constant speed. The SD of lateral position (SDLP), that is, the weaving of the car, <b>lapses,</b> and alertness, was assessed. Driving was significantly better (P = 0. 006) with methylphenidate (SDLP, 18. 8 cm) when compared with placebo (SDLP, 21. 2 cm). Both the reduction in SDLP {{and the number of}} <b>lapses</b> (P = 0. 003) confirm this significant improvement, which is further supported by subjective assessments of perceived driving performance. Although <b>lapses</b> were common in the placebo condition (11 / 18 patients), they were much less frequently observed (5 / 18 patients) after treatment with methylphenidate. Postdriving assessments suggest that <b>lapses</b> often go unnoticed by drivers. In conclusion, methylphenidate significantly improves driving of patients with ADHD by significantly reducing the number of <b>lapses...</b>|$|R

Comparison between the sociodemographic characteristics and motivational factors between <b>lapsed</b> and regular donors is then required. The objectives {{of this analysis}} were: (1) to compare the sociodemographic characteristics of <b>lapsed</b> donors and current donors; (2) to compare the motivations to donate blood expressed by <b>lapsed</b> and current donors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from a 2008 survey, representative of the population by crossed quotas method, of 1400 individuals questioned by phone were used to reach these objectives. Chi(2) tests and binary logistic regressions were used. RESULTS: Results show that socio-occupational categories and motivational factors are different between <b>lapsed</b> and regular donors. Workers, senior management and higher intellectual professions are more often <b>lapsed</b> than regular donors. Concerning motivations, results show that <b>lapsed</b> donors more frequently mention the first experience with blood donation (with colleagues, friends, and parents) than regular donors, for whom altruistic and community motivations are more frequently cited. CONCLUSION: Workers, senior management and higher intellectual professions should be targeted uppermost, in order to convert them in regular donors. Finally, concerning motivations, the social pressure applied to <b>lapsed</b> donors for their first blood donation appears crucial, whereas regular donors have internalized their motives, more often altruistic and community motivations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of trait anxiety on {{self-reported}} driving behaviours through its negative impacts on Central Executive functions. Following a self-report study that found trait anxiety to be significantly related to driving behaviours, the present study extended the predictions of Eysenck and Calvo’s Attentional Control Theory, proposing that anxiety affects driving behaviours, in particular driving <b>lapses,</b> through its impact across the Central Executive. Seventy-five Australian drivers participated in the study, completing the Parametric Go/No-Go and n-back tasks, {{as well as the}} State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Driving Behaviour Questionnaire. While both trait anxiety and processing efficiency of the Central Executive was found to significantly predict driving <b>lapses,</b> trait anxiety remained a strong predictor of driving <b>lapses</b> after processing efficiency was controlled for. It is concluded that while processing efficiency of the central Executive is a key determinant of driving <b>lapses,</b> another Central Executive function that is closer to the driving <b>lapses</b> in the trait anxiety – driving <b>lapses</b> relationship may be needed. Suggestions regarding how to improve future trait anxiety – driving behaviours research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|A brief self-report {{scale was}} {{developed}} to assess everyday performance failures arising directly or primarily from brief failures of sustained attention (attention-related cognitive errors—ARCES).

Although the ARCES and MAAS were highly correlated, structural modelling revealed the ARCES was more directly related to SART errors and the MAAS to SART RTs, which have been hypothesized to directly reflect the <b>lapses</b> of attention that lead to SART errors. Thus, the MAAS and SART RTs appear to directly reflect attention <b>lapses,</b> whereas the ARCES and SART errors reflect the mistakes these <b>lapses</b> are thought to cause.

Objective The aim {{of the study was to}} examine ratings of d-amphetamine drug liking among individuals with high, moderate, and low attention <b>lapses.</b> Methods Ninety-nine healthy volunteers were divided into three equal-sized groups based on their performance on a measure of <b>lapses</b> of attention. The groups, who exhibited low, medium, and high attention <b>lapses</b> (i. e., long reaction times) on a simple reaction time task, were compared on their subjective responses (i. e., ratings of liking and wanting more drug) after acute doses of d-amphetamine (0, 5, 10, and 20 mg). Results Subjects who exhibited high <b>lapses</b> liked 20 mg d-amphetamine less than subjects who exhibited low <b>lapses.</b> These subjects also tended to report smaller increases in “wanting more drug ” after d-amphetamine.
