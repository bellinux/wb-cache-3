50|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus, founder Neils Children members John Linger and Brandon Jacobs played shows with {{original}} bassist James <b>Hair,</b> focusing <b>on</b> material from their 2003-2005 period. The shows put the band {{in touch with}} French promoter and label owner Damien Louchet, who proposed the group recording an album for his label Boudoir Moderne. Once {{the decision was made}} to record a new album Linger completed demos for various songs that feature on the album, and once the material was chosen the sessions for the album were booked. <b>Without</b> <b>Hair</b> <b>on</b> board (who decided against further band work in favour of building up his homemade food business) Linger and Jacobs decamped to Toulouse, France to record an album's worth of new material as a two piece, sharing the instrumental duties of drums, bass, guitar, percussion and keyboards between them.|$|R

50|$|After a {{temporary}} retirement announced {{immediately after the}} Olympic race, 4 time champion, seven time medalist Ezekiel Kemboi (Kenya) was back, now as a 35 year old <b>without</b> a <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> his head. His historic record was well known, but his semi-final was his fastest race of the year making him an unknown quantity. In fact, the entire 2015 podium and the 2016 Olympic podium were in this event, though 2008 Olympic champion and 2015 bronze medalist Brimin Kipruto (Kenya) at age 33 didn't make the final.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, {{down the}} Lone Little Path came the Possum family, and a funny looking sight they were. Unc' Billy was whitish-gray, his face whiter {{than the rest}} of him. He {{looked as if he had}} just gotten out of bed and {{forgotten}} to brush his hair; it pointed every which way. His legs were dark, his feet black and his toes white. His ears were <b>without</b> any <b>hair</b> at all, and were black for the lower half, the rest being white. He had a long whitish tail <b>without</b> any <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> it. Altogether, with his sharp face and naked tail, he looked a great deal as though he might be a giant Rat.|$|R

60|$|He was not beautiful, {{but very}} impressive; being big, <b>without</b> a white <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> him. One eye was blue and one green, {{and the green}} one was always half shut, {{as if he was}} winking at you, which gave him a rowdy air comical to see. Then he swaggered in his walk, never turned out for any one, and if {{offended}} fell into rages fit to daunt the bravest soul.|$|R

In summer, during the hottest part of the day, he rests. His eyes are small and weak because he has little use for them, coming out on the surface very seldom and then usually in the dusk. He has a funny little tail <b>without</b> any <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> it; this is very sensitive and serves him {{as a sort of}} guide when he runs backward along his tunnel, which he can do quite fast. A funny thing about those long claws on his front feet is that he folds them under when he is walking or running. Do any of you know why Farmer Brown plows his garden?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Shakespeare says {{something}} about worms, {{or it may be}} giants or beetles, turning if you tread on them too severely. The safest plan is never to tread on a worm--not even on the last new subaltern from Home, with his buttons hardly out of their tissue paper, and the red of sappy English beef in his cheeks. This {{is the story of the}} worm that turned. For the sake of brevity, we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne, [...] "The Worm," [...] although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy, <b>without</b> a <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> his face, and with a waist like a girl's when he came out to the Second [...] "Shikarris" [...] and was made unhappy in several ways. The [...] "Shikarris" [...] are a high-caste regiment, and you must be able to do things well--play a banjo or ride more than a little, or sing, or act-- to get on with them.|$|R

[...] In Spain today, rejoneadores wear smooth chaps attached with a single strap behind the knee.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of tambora for the merengue style of music. The oldest kind is the rope-tuned tambora with black-colored heads. This is seen more in folkloric music of the Dominican {{republic}} and Afro-Caribbean slaves. The second type is a rope tuned tambora played with goatskin, or [...] "chivo" [...] heads, either with or <b>without</b> the <b>hair</b> left <b>on.</b> The third type, as made by modern companies, is bolt-tuned with rawhide conga heads. This kind usually has metal or wooden rims to hit as a filler for rhythms, sounding, if one strikes it correctly, something reminiscent of a wood block. This type can also be tuned to higher pitches and can sound like a conga.|$|R
6000|$|Two of {{the most}} [...] "refined" [...] women in the store--a forelady and a cashier--had a few [...] "swell gentlemen friends" [...] with whom they now and then dined. Once they {{included}} Nancy in an invitation. The dinner {{took place in a}} spectacular café whose tables are engaged for New Year's eve a year in advance. There were two [...] "gentlemen friends"--one <b>without</b> any <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> his head--high living ungrew it; and we can prove it--the other a young man whose worth and sophistication he impressed upon you in two convincing ways--he swore that all the wine was corked; and he wore diamond cuff buttons. This young man perceived irresistible excellencies in Nancy. His taste ran to shop-girls; and here was one that added the voice and manners of his high social world to the franker charms of her own caste. So, on the following day, he appeared in the store and made her a serious proposal of marriage over a box of hem-stitched, grass-bleached Irish linens. Nancy declined. A brown pompadour ten feet away had been using her eyes and ears. When the rejected suitor had gone she heaped carboys of upbraidings and horror upon Nancy's head.|$|R
5000|$|Bryony Andrews: Bryony is a {{very pretty}} girl, with long black hair and is very neat and organized. She {{is also a very}} skilled dancer and is {{especially}} close friends with Sophie. After the Half-Term Break and the news that Sophie was assessed out, Bryony's parents also got a divorce. She bottled it up all at school so it wouldn't get into the way of her schooling. She hates people being dispensed of and just replaced, like her father replacing her mother with his new girlfriend Wendy. She was especially rude to Molly Baker at first, who replaced Sophie, as she hates thinking about Sophie being thrown out and just being replaced by Molly. Bryony wakes up every morning <b>without</b> a single <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> her head out of place and is usually a morning person.|$|R
50|$|This {{plant has}} {{initially}} green but eventually blackish stems that show leaf-scars when {{the bases of}} the dead leaves have fallen. The light green leaves are set densely along the stem. They {{do not have a}} petiole, are linear in shape, 1-3¼ cm (0.4-1.3 in) long, 1-2½ mm (0.04-0.1 in) wide, a little bit narrowed above a wider and membraneous base, entire or with minute saw teeth, with a blunt tip, and a row of short <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the margins near the base, otherwise <b>without</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|R

40|$|White Twisted-stalk is an {{herbaceous}} perennial with {{a mostly}} hairless, often branched stem that may grow to 3 feet (1 m) in height. The leaves are alternately arranged, thin in texture, hairless, lance-shaped or egg-shaped, clasping the stem {{at the base}} {{and pointed at the}} tip, 2 - 5 inches (5 - 13 cm) in length and - 2 inches (2 - 5 cm) in width, and <b>without</b> teeth or <b>hairs</b> <b>on</b> the margin. The greenish-white flowers, appearing in May and June, have 6 petal-like segments about 3 / 8 inch (1 cm) in length that bend outward from their middle. The flowers generally occur singly or in pairs and attach to stalks from the bases of the middle and upper leaves. The fruit is berry-like, reddish at maturity, and contains many minute seeds. A very similar species, Rose Mandarin (Streptopus roseus), has pinkish flowers and hairy stems and leaf margins. Ph ot o so ur ce: P...|$|R

If I had known the truth at first, I would have met him instantly; would have conquered him <b>without</b> hurting a <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> his head; and carrying him bound to the capital city, would have claimed the Autocracy, and would now have been sitting upon the throne. Instead of that, look at the delay and annoyance to which I have been subjected.

60|$|I {{could never}} {{make out what}} his age could be, nor could Jim Horscroft either. Sometimes we {{thought that he was}} an oldish man that looked young, and at others that he was a youngish man who looked old. His brown, stiff, {{close-cropped}} hair needed no cropping at the top, where it thinned away to a shining curve. His skin too was intersected by a thousand fine wrinkles, lacing and interlacing, and was all burned, as I have already said, by the sun. Yet he was as lithe as a boy, and he was as tough as whalebone, walking all day over the hills or rowing on the sea <b>without</b> turning a <b>hair.</b> <b>On</b> the whole we thought that he might be about forty or forty-five, though {{it was hard to see}} how he could have seen so much of life in the time. But one day we got talking of ages, and then he surprised us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, there I {{left her}} {{to work out the}} thing for herself, having come to the {{conclusion}} she was capable of doing it; and so for another couple of weeks I merely watched. There was no doubt about his being in love with her. He had entered that Cafe {{at the beginning of the}} month with as good an opinion of himself as a man can conveniently carry without tumbling down and falling over it. Before the month was out he would sit with his head between his hands, evidently wondering why he had been born. I've seen the game played before, and I've seen it played since. A waiter has plenty of opportunities if he only makes use of them; for if it comes to a matter of figures, I suppose there's more love-making done in a month under the electric light of the restaurant than the moon sees in a year--leastways, so far as concerns what we call the civilised world. I've seen men fooled, from boys <b>without</b> <b>hair</b> <b>on</b> their faces, to old men without much on their heads. I've seen it done in a way that was pretty to watch, and I've seen it done in a manner that has made me feel that given a wig and a petticoat I could do it better myself. But never have I seen it neater played than Marie played it on that young man of hers. One day she would greet him for all the world like a tired child that at last has found its mother, and the next day respond to him in a style calculated to give you the idea of a small-sized empress in misfortune compelled to tolerate the familiarities of an anarchist. One moment she would throw him a pout that said as clearly as words: 'What a fool you are not to put your arms round me and kiss me'; and five minutes later chill him with a laugh that as good as told him he must be blind not to see that she was merely playing with him. What happened outside the Cafe--for now and then she would let him meet her of a morning in the Tuileries and walk down to the Cafe with her, and once or twice had allowed him to see her part of the way home--I cannot tell you: I only know that before strangers it was her instinct to be reserved. I take it that on such occasions his experiences were interesting; but whether they left him elated or depressed I doubt if he could have told you himself.|$|R
