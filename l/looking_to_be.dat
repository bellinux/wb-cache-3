5|$|Critchell {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with newly relegated Conference Premier side Wrexham on 24 June 2008. He made his debut in a 2–0 victory over Oxford United, {{where he played}} in right midfield. After making a further appearance for Wrexham he suffered from an ankle injury during a training session. He underwent surgery on this ankle in October, which had been delayed due to illness. After recovering from this injury four months later, {{he said he was}} <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> loaned out to help improve his first-team chances at Wrexham. He eventually joined fellow Conference Premier side York City on a one-month loan on 5 January 2009. He was due to make his debut a day later against former club Weymouth, but the match was postponed. He eventually made his first appearance after playing in the 2–1 victory over Oxford on 13 January {{in the second round of}} the FA Trophy. This was followed by his league debut on 17 January in a 3–0 victory over Lewes. The loan was extended for a second month on 4 February and finished his time at York with 11 appearances.|$|E

25|$|The {{second edition}} of the {{competition}} was planned for Spain in 2001, and was supposed to feature 12 clubs. The draw was performed at A Coruña on 6 March 2001. However, it was cancelled on 18 May, due {{to a combination of}} factors, most importantly the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure. The participants of the cancelled edition received US$750,000 each in compensation; the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) also received US$1million from FIFA. Another attempt to stage the competition in 2003, in which 17 countries were <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the host nation, also failed to happen. FIFA agreed with UEFA, CONMEBOL and Toyota to merge the Intercontinental Cup and Club World Championship into one event. The final Intercontinental Cup was in 2004, with a relaunched Club World Championship held in Japan in December 2005.|$|E
25|$|Torquay {{started the}} 2014–15 {{season in the}} National League poorly losing to Gateshead 1–3 with Ryan Bowman missing a penalty. After that match Torquay had a {{brilliant}} unbeaten run, first beating Welling United 3–0 then drawing 0–0 with Southport and then with Dartford. Yet another draw came when they drew with Aldershot Town 1–1 at home. That was their last draw for a while as they went on a six-game unbeaten run. Starting with a 1–3 away win at Lincoln City then playing at home beating Nuneaton Town 4–0, they were 3–0 up after 30 minutes. The Gulls {{then went on to}} win two away games winning 0–2 in both of them. First winning at Chester then Grimsby (manager Chris Hargreaves' home town). The next game was a home game that was <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a 0–0 draw until the 90th minute when can The Gulls captain Luke Young scored an incredible 35 yard free kick to give Torquay the 3 points. A 2–0 win at home against Dover followed, however this was {{to be the end of}} Torquay's 10 game unbeaten run and an indifferent run-in would see United end the season in 13th position.|$|E

25|$|Bangladeshi captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss {{and elected}} to field on an easy-paced track at the Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo. Bangladesh's opening bowler Syed Rasel got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} good start dismissing Zimbawean opener Hamilton Masakadza for a duck in the opening over. After five years out of the International game, Mark Vermeulen and number three Chamu Chibhabha, stabilised the innings with a second-wicket partnership of 25 from 37 balls, before Chibhabha was dismissed by Nazmul Hossain for seven. Joining Vermuelan at the crease was Wicket-keeper Brendan Taylor, and with the score on 2-25, looked to be giving Vermuelan support with 20 from 39 balls. Starting with a flicked boundary, Taylor was unlucky to be given out leg before wicket (lbw) to Shakib—after an inside edge—breaking the innings highest partnership (49). Joined at the crease by Charles Coventry, Vermuelan who was lucky to survive a lbw appeal off Shakib Al Hasan in the 13th over, went on to register his fifth ODI half century from 73 deliveries. <b>Looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aggressive, Coventry was caught on the boundary with Mohammad Ashraful's first ball, after scoring 19.|$|E
25|$|The {{first of}} United's {{last two games}} was at home to West Ham United at midday on Saturday, 3 May. Needing the win, United {{got off to a}} great start, as Ronaldo put them ahead in the third minute with a {{deflected}} shot. 20 minutes later, he got his second of the game and 30th league goal of the season. West Ham failed to deal with Owen Hargreaves' left-footed cross, which dropped onto Ronaldo's thigh and bounced over the line. Former West Ham player Carlos Tevez made it 3–0 in the 26th minute, rifling a 25-yard shot over Robert Green in the Hammers goal. However, Dean Ashton pulled one back for West Ham with an audacious bicycle kick after Wes Brown's clearing header only went straight upwards. Just before half-time, as West Ham were <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> settling into a rhythm, an altercation between Lucas Neill and Nani resulted in the Portuguese international headbutting the Australian, before going to ground himself, only to find a red card waiting for him when he got back to his feet. This left United a man down, with a whole half left to play. Nevertheless, despite the man advantage, West Ham were unable to capitalise, and ended up going 4–1 down in the 59th minute. Michael Carrick picked the ball up in midfield off a poor West Ham clearance, before letting rip from 30yards. His shot took a large deflection off Lucas Neill, wrong-footing Robert Green, and the ball nestled in the bottom-left corner of the net. Darren Fletcher also came close to scoring late in the game, after coming on as a substitute, but his shot deflected back off the inside of the post. The match finished 4–1 to United, but Chelsea's win against Newcastle United two days later kept the two teams level on points, meaning that the title race would go to {{the last day of the}} season for the first time since 1999.|$|E

500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, we are only <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E

He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply {{in love with his}} wife and sympathetic to her concerns about {{what will happen to the}} girls if they don't marry." [...] Joe Anderson portrayed Henry Austen, while Lucy Cohu played the widowed Eliza de Feuillide, the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character [...] "needs security. She is <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> safe. She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family." ...|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four, {{calling it a}} disappointment. Vitaris heavily criticized Mulder's line: [...] "I'm not a psychologist"—reportedly an ad lib from Duchovny himself—noting that it {{undermines}} established continuity within the series including the character's background in psychology. Tom Kessenich, in his 2002 book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files, praises the installment, saying, [...] "Place a devil in the plot and I'll follow you {{to see what you}} can cook up.... I enjoyed this tale of a devil <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just a normal dad immensely." [...] In his view the episode showed a return to the earlier horror-based narratives the series was known for; though he praises the casting of Campbell, he writes that moments between Mulder and Scully are lacking.|$|E

500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly {{commented on}} the {{original}} news that several characters would be leaving the cast when they graduate, and said, [...] "Indeed, a rolling cast list has done some shows good in the past. I'll admit that it took me some time to warm up to the 'new kids' on Friday Night Lights, which ends its run tomorrow on NBC, {{but it was a}} well-done transition. What I loved most was that the new blood didn't try to be the new versions of the old characters. They were new characters with completely different outlooks and goals. Glee could learn a lot from what Friday Night Lights accomplished: a seamless, realistic transition. The problem? 'Seamless' and 'realistic' have never been Glee strong points, {{which is not to say}} they couldn't be.

[...] Michael Menachem of Billboard wrote that Lovato, like Miley Cyrus before her, [...] "has also stepped away briefly from the tween sound with her album's title track, 'Don't Forget'." [...] Menachem wrote, [...] "She may be reaching a new level with a poised vocal performance, as she too is <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken seriously."
