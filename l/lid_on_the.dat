His burial chamber {{was found in the}} Valley of the Kings in the Theban Necropolis in 1922, but was not opened until a year later. It would be another two years before the mummy and its famous death mask were discovered inside the tomb.|$|E
500|$|After the race, NASCAR {{announced}} it {{had found a}} problem with the <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oil reservoir encasement during a post-race inspection on Edwards' car, which was later taken to the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord, North Carolina, for further analysis. Three days after the race, Roush Fenway Racing was given penalties for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing", [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules", and a device or duct work that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another, or to the outside of the car. The penalties included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for Edwards' crew chief Bob Osborne, who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30, 2008, and placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order. Edwards was allowed to keep the victory; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. On March 12, Roush Fenway Racing {{announced it}} would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

2500|$|In 1904, {{while living}} in Amsterdam, he wrote his {{controversial}} novel Pijpelijntjes ("Lines from De Pijp"), which pretends to be a thinly veiled version of his own gay life with Aletrino in Amsterdam's [...] "Pijp" [...] working-class district. The homo-eroticism of the book, shocking in the early 20th century, led to his dismissal from his teaching job and social-democratic political circles. Aletrino and Johanna van Maarseveen, de Haan's fiancée, bought almost the entire print run of the book, to keep a <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scandal.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{democratic}} changes after 1989, {{the symbols of}} communism in the decoration of the Largo were removed, with the most symbolic act being the removing of the red star on a pole atop the former Party House using a helicopter and its substitution by the flag of Bulgaria. In the 1990s there have been suggestions to reshape the former Party House, sometimes regarded as an imposing remnant of a past ideology, by introducing more modern architectural elements. According to the new architectural plan of Sofia, Nezavisimost Square is [...] being reorganized. The lawn and the flags in the centre are to be substituted by a glass <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, so that {{the ruins of the}} ancient Thracian and Roman city of Serdica can be exposed in an impressive way, thus becoming a tourist attraction. The two underpasses, the one in front of the former Party House and the one with the medieval Church of St Petka, are also planned to be connected, and could be repurporsed as entrance ponts to the nearby metro stations.|$|E

He shows her a photo of a house that he and Hook were looking at for their Operation Light Swan, which Hook planned to obtain for Emma after she was free of the Darkness. Henry tells her that it was a reminder of something she could look forward to. Emma shuts the <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spark and says that she's not ready to give up the darkness just yet, because she has to use her dark magic one more time.|$|E

60|$|He {{glanced at}} Charnock, but the latter's legs alone stuck {{out from under}} the table, and as it was obvious that he could not see, Festing dusted the {{portrait}} and put it in his pocket. By and by Charnock crept out and got upon his feet. It was dark now, but the glow of the burning paper flickered about the room and touched his face. His hair was ruffled, his eyes were dull, and his mouth had a slack droop. Festing felt some pity for the man, though he was also sensible of scornful impatience. The smell of burned paper disturbed him with its hint of vanished romance. Putting the <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stove, he took the lamp from Charnock's unsteady hand, and, when he had lighted it, found a brush and set to work. Presently Charnock made a vague sign of relief as he looked at the swept floor.|$|E
60|$|He mixed the {{shortening}} {{with the}} flour, and, adding water, {{he began a}} thorough kneading. When {{the consistency of the}} mixture appeared to satisfy him he took a handful of it, rolled it into a ball, patted and flattened it into a biscuit, and dropped it into the oven he had set aside on the hot coals. Swiftly he shaped eight or ten other biscuits and dropped them as the first. Then he put the heavy iron <b>lid</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pot, and with a rude shovel, improvised from a flattened tin can, he shoveled red coals out of the fire, and covered the lid with them. His next move was to pare and slice potatoes, placing these aside in a pan. A small black coffee-pot half full of water, was set on a glowing part of the fire. Then he brought into use a huge, heavy knife, a murderous-looking implement it appeared to Carley, with which he cut slices of ham. These he dropped into the second pot, which he left uncovered. Next he removed the flour sack and other inpedimenta from the table, and proceeded to set places for two--blue-enamel plate and cup, with plain, substantial-looking knives, forks, and spoons. He went outside, to return presently carrying a small crock of butter. Evidently he had kept the butter in or near the spring. It looked dewy and cold and hard. After that he peeped under the lid of the pot which contained the biscuits. The other pot was sizzling and smoking, giving forth a delicious savory odor that affected Carley most agreeably. The coffee-pot had begun to steam. With a long fork Glenn turned the slices of ham and stood a moment watching them. Next he placed cans of three sizes upon the table; and these Carley conjectured contained sugar, salt, and pepper. Carley might not have been present, for all the attention he paid to her. Again he peeped at the biscuits. At the edge of the hot embers he placed a tin plate, upon which he carefully deposited the slices of ham. Carley had not needed sight of them to know she was hungry; they made her simply ravenous. That done, he poured the pan of sliced potatoes into the pot. Carley judged the heat of that pot to be extreme. Next he removed the lid from the other pot, exposing biscuits slightly browned; and evidently satisfied with these, he removed them from the coals. He stirred the slices of potatoes round and round; he emptied two heaping tablespoonfuls of coffee into the coffee-pot.|$|E
40|$|A fluid {{convection}} flow {{driven by}} a uniformly movable lid with thermosolutal stratification in a square enclosure filled with a porous medium is studied. A wide range of Grashof numbers, 104 ≤ Gr ≤ 106, and Reynolds numbers, 500 ≤ Re ≤ 2500, have been investigated for the flow, heat, and mass transfer characteristics. The porosity inside the enclosure is chosen to be 0. 4 for the Darcy number varying from 10 − 4 to 1. 0. A detailed comparison of the flow, heat, and mass transfer is made in this article.
