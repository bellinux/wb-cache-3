40|$|The {{development}} and modernization of our country’s agriculture {{is related to}} the revitalization of the animal breeding sector along with the implementation of new genotypes of animals and diversification of fodder production, balanced in terms of quantity and quality throughout the year, suitable for the physiological requirements of animals, and qualitative products as required in the market. Scientific research conducted in the Botanical Garden (Institute) of the ASM over decades was aimed at mobilization, improvement and implementation of new non-traditional plant species that use efficiently photosynthetic active radiation and land resources to obtain fodder {{with a high level of}} vegetable protein, the <b>fodder</b> <b>leguminous</b> grasses (fam. Fabaceae Lindl.) play an important role. We have studied the biological peculiarities, productivity, chemical composition and nutritional value of new <b>fodder</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plant</b> species Astragalus galegiformis, Onobrychis inermis and Medicago tianschanica of the collection of non-traditional <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> of the Botanical Garden (Institute) of the ASM, the traditional forage crop alfalfa served as control variant. The nutritional value of fresh mass accounts: the Astragalus galegiformis - 0. 27 nutritive units, 3. 26 MJ metabolizable energy and 146 g digestible protein/nutritive unit; Onobrychis inermis - 0. 25 nutritive units, 2. 56 MJ metabolizable energy and 154 g digestible protein/nutritive unit; Medicago tianschanica - 0. 24 nutritive units, 2. 86 MJ metabolizable energy and 173 g digestible protein/nutritive unit and alfalfa - 0. 21 nutritive units, 2. 28 MJ metabolizable energy and 164 g digestible protein/nutritive unit. Due to the productivity and high and stable quality of fodder, use of the plantation for a long period of time, capacity of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, the new <b>fodder</b> <b>leguminous</b> species Astragalus galegiformis, Onobrychis inermis and Medicago tianschanica can serve as initial material for enriching the range of forage crops...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiments}} {{placed in}} the year 2011 for a superiour valuing of pastures, by their results, lead to the elaboration of some ecological systems of mountain agriculture. The production levels record growths of 13 % on the organically fertilised variants and a growth in the weight which can reach 153 g/head/day at the young sheep. The selectivity of pasture {{is reflected in the}} preference of animals for a more intense grazing on the organically fertilized pastures as compared to the unfertilized ones. The experimental variants (gradual organic fertilization, fertilization + oversowing) support a long-lasting pratological system which can lead to an evolution of the floristic composition favourable to the fixation of perennial <b>fodder</b> <b>leguminous</b> <b>plants,</b> obtaining significant growth in weight and improving the quality of the carcasses. The suggested system does not pollute the environment and it is conceived to be achieved besides the protection of prato-ecosystems and acceptable economical results by integrating natural resources and the natural mechanisms of adjustment in agricultural practice so as to replace at maximum the inputs from outside the system, ensures a long-lasting protection of food and high quality products by ecologically preferable technologies, ensures the income of the farmers and supports the multiple functions of agricultur...|$|R
40|$|This study {{arose from}} {{the need to develop}} {{strategies}} that optimize the use of available feed resources from natural range fallow and crop residues in combination with the fodder bank innovation. The paper discusses the interactive effects of feeding both forage legume and urea molasses supplements. Since rumen flora can use non protein nitrogen (NPN) to satisfy its nitrogen (N) requirement. It was hypothesized that feeding urea molasses would raise the efficiency of utilization of natural pasture and would have a positive interactive effect with forage legume supplementation. Five treatment groups were therefore formed so that animals were either solely grazed on natural range or 2) supplemented by having access to conserved natural pasture, or 3) molasses urea blocks or 4) <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> banks and molasses urea blocks or 5) <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder</b> banks...|$|R

50|$|Planting two {{crops in}} close {{proximity}} can especially be beneficial when the two plants interact {{in a way that}} increases {{one or both of the}} plant's fitness (and therefore yield). For example, plants that are prone to tip over in wind or heavy rain (lodging-prone plants), may be given structural support by their companion crop. Climbing plants can also benefit from structural support. Some plants are used to suppress weeds or provide nutrients. Delicate or light-sensitive plants may be given shade or protection, or otherwise wasted space can be utilized. An example is the tropical multi-tier system where coconut occupies the upper tier, banana the middle tier, and pineapple, ginger, or <b>leguminous</b> <b>fodder,</b> medicinal or aromatic plants occupy the lowest tier.|$|R

The {{study was conducted}} with the help of Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) tool to document the diversity of <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> of Betalghat Block of Nainital District (Western Himalaya). Total 210 <b>fodder</b> <b>plants</b> species belonging to 70 families, 164 genera of different habits such as trees (35 %), shrubs (31 %), herbs (25 %), and climbers (9 %), were recorded. Out of 70 families, 12 dominant families were Poaceae (18 species), followed by Fabaceae (16 species), Moraceae (10 species), Rosaceae (10 species), Asteraceae (8 species), Euphorbiaceae (7 species), Mimosaceae (6 species), Caesalpinaceae (5 species), Ranunculaceae (5 species), Rhamnaceae (5 species), Urticaceae (5 species) and Rubiaceae (5 species). Of the total recorded species, 41 % of the species were used during winter days, 38 % during summer and 21 % throughout the year. For each species, scientific and vernacular names, multipurpose uses (Fuel, medicinal, timber, agricultural tools, religious and fiber) were used. For the conservation of <b>fodder</b> <b>plant</b> species prioritization, mass multiplication with afforestation, reforestation and forest rehabilitation must be done.
