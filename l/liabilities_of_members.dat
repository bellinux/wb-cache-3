40|$|Similarly to German law, Estonian {{company law}} {{provides}} two-tier management for all public limited companies. Legal regulation <b>of</b> the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> {{the management board}} and supervisory board is the same, and therefore the question arises of whether there is any difference in <b>liability</b> between <b>members</b> <b>of</b> different boards. The Estonian Supreme Court recently made two decisions regarding the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the supervisory board. The main research question of the article is ‘what is {{the scope of the}} duties of the supervisory board in comparison to the duties of the management board, and how does the difference in duties affect the liability?’ As the main task of the supervisory board is to exercise supervision, the question is what the actual standard of supervision is. The main conclusions in the article are that the Supreme Court of Estonia has not given an answer to the question about the standard for the <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the supervisory board and leaves open many other important questions about boundaries of their duties. ...|$|R

The main aim of the Thesis {{is to provide a}} comprehensive explanation of how the law enshrined in the creditors'pursuit of their rights directly to the <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Board compared with the international rules. The thesis is composed of tree chapters. Chapter one is a general introduction to an organization, functions, duties and responsibilities of a joint-stock company.

Part one describes generaly the Board of directors and focuses on its nature, actions, {{as well as on the}} casting <b>of</b> its <b>members,</b> on the membership itself and the relationship between the company and its members.

40|$|Primary and {{secondary}} <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Board of Directors against third persons The aim of my thesis is to analyse thoroughly {{the regulation of}} primary {{and secondary}} <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> the Board of Directors against third persons (so-called 'outside liability') under {{the laws of the}} Czech Republic. The reason for choosing this topic is that it is relatively overlooked by most of the authors since they primarily focus on <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the Directors against their own company (so-called 'inside liability'). By conducting my research I intend to redress such an omission and prove the significance of this issue. Chapter one provides a general overview <b>of</b> the inside <b>liability</b> issue. It explains why the Directors are in discharging their duties primarily accountable to the company for the damage caused by a breach of their duties and why third persons are entitled to claim damages from the Directors only in cases laid down in special statutory provisions. Chapter two together with chapter three form a substantial part of the text and provide the basis for the analysis in the subsequent chapters. Examining the currently effective regulation, these chapters deal with special provisions which constitute direct <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> the Directors for the damage caused to the third persons (most [...] ...|$|R
