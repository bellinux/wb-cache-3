40|$|This chapter {{describes}} {{the growth and}} risks of and regulatory responses to shadow banking—financial intermediaries or activities involved in credit intermediation outside the regular banking system, and therefore lacking a formal safety net. The largest shadow banking systems are found in advanced economies, where more narrowly defined shadow banking measures indicate stagnation, while broader measures (which include investment funds) gener-ally show continued growth since the global financial crisis. In emerging market economies, the growth of shadow banking has been strong, outpacing that of the traditional banking system. Although shadow banking takes vastly different forms across and within countries, {{some of the key}} drivers behind its growth are common to all: a tightening of banking regulation and ample liquidity conditions, as well as demand from institutional investors, tend to foster nonbanking activities. The current financial environment in advanced economies remains conducive to further growth in shadow banking. Many indications there point to the migration of some activities—such as lending to firms—from traditional banks to the nonbank sector. Shadow banking can play a beneficial role as a complement to traditional banking by expanding access to credit or by supporting market <b>liquidity,</b> maturity <b>transformation,</b> and risk sharing. It often, however, comes with bank-like risks, as seen during the 2007 – 08 global financial crisis. Although data limitations prevent a comprehensive assessment, the U. S. shadow banking system appears to contribute most to domestic systemic risk; its contribution is much less pronounced in the euro area and the United Kingdom.

40|$|Financial {{systems are}} {{inherently}} fragile {{because of the}} very function which makes them valuable: <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation.</b> Regulatory reforms can strengthen the financial system and decrease the risk of liquidity crises, but they cannot eliminate it completely. This leaves monetary policy with a very important task. In a framework that recognizes the interactions between monetary policy and <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation</b> 'optimal' monetary policy would consist of a modified Taylor rule in which the real rate reflects the possibility of liquidity crises and recognizes the possibility that <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation</b> gets subsidized. Failure to recognize this point risks leading the economy into a low interest rate trap: low interest rates induce too much risk taking and increase the probability of crises. These crises, in turn, require low interest rates to maintain the financial system alive. Raising rates becomes extremely difficult in a severely weakened financial system, so monetary authorities remain stuck in a low interest rates trap.

30|$|Moral hazard occurs {{where one}} party takes higher risk because the {{consequences}} will be borne by another. Many {{studies have been}} conducted regarding a moral hazard problem after the seminal paper of Jensen and Meckling (1976) (Zhang et al. 2015; Foos et al. 2010; Shrieves and Dahl 2003; Gorton and Rosen 1995). It is a phenomenon which cannot be observed directly, but it is detected by other behaviors, and in case of banks, it is excessive risk taking in lending. Almost all of the existing studies use loan growth rate as a measure of bank risk taking (Zhang et al. 2015; Foos et al. 2010; Shrieves and Dahl 2003; Berger and Udell 1994). Some other studies investigate a moral hazard problem by a using shareholder structure, and it is believed that banks controlled by shareholders take greater risk than their counterparts controlled by managers (Saunders et al. 1990; Demsetz and Strahan 1997; Zhou 2014).

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} recent bank runs {{in seven}} transition economies (Russia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Romania), comparing {{them against the}} older US experience and theoretical research. Bank runs seem to usually be information based. For example, improvements in bank transparency such as new accounting rules can reveal a bank’s insolvency and trigger a run. However, bank runs, as seen {{a few years ago}} in East Asia, Bulgaria and Russia, may also be accompanied by runs on national currencies. We include a bank run model that shows a bank may issue liquid demand deposits and avoid runs without deposit insurance as long as it also issues less liquid time deposits. Self-fulfilling runs are prevented through elimination of the maturity mismatch. The well-known Diamond & Dybvig (1983) model is modified to account for depositors’ risk affinities, whereby high-risk depositors hold their savings as demand deposits and low-risk depositors prefer time deposits. These deposit choices transfer liquidity optimally from low-risk to high-risk depositors who value liquidity. By exploiting these choices, a bank can improve its intertemporal risk-sharing by issuing deposits of varying degrees of <b>liquidity.</b> This maturity <b>transformation</b> does not necessarily raise the economy’s total liquidity. ansition economies; bank panics; bank regulation; financial crises...|$|R

As {{long as there is}} a price such that these groups willingly exchange the funds across time, the economy will be better off. This exchange can be performed without intermediation. Savers transfer the funds directly to borrowers, which acquired the obligation to return them at an agreed price at a later date. However, direct lending between savers and borrowers has three mayor problems which reduce the execution of profitable exchanges. First, the risk that the borrower defaults on its obligation may be too high for a single saver, the so called credit risk problem. Secondly, the period of time for which the saver wishes to lend the funds must match that in which the borrower wishes to have them, the maturity problem. Finally, the saver may want to transform the obligations against the borrower into money before maturity {{and not be able to}} do so without a loss, the liquidity problem.

IDLC Finance Ltd commenced its journey, in 1985, as the first leasing company of the country with multinational collaboration and the lead sponsorship of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of The World Bank Group. In its arduous journey since, IDLC Finance has succeeded in realizing the dreams of those who established it. Today {{it is one of}} the country’s leading NBFI, contributing significantly to the Country’s economy. In most of our life, we will be earning and spending money. Core financial services provided by financial intermediaries include payments and <b>liquidity,</b> maturity <b>transformation,</b> store of value, information processing and pooling of risks. Banks have traditionally provided most of these services and are increasingly diversifying into other areas. However, banks typically have an edge in providing payment and liquidity related services and they usually select a portfolio mix with an overriding objective of providing a certain return. Non-banking financial institutions (NBFI’s), on the other hand, tend to offer enhanced equity and risk based products. NBFI’s play a crucial role in broadening access to financial services, enhancing competition and diversification of the financial sector. They are increasingly being recognized as complementary to the banking system capable of absorbing shocks and spreading risks at times of financial distress. Traditionally our banking or financial institutions are involved in term lending activities. In this case human resources are very much important to run the operation as well as their motivation too.

40|$|Shadow banking, {{as one of}} {{the main}} sources of {{financial}} stability concerns, is the subject of much international debate. In broad terms, shadow banking refers to activities related to credit intermediation and <b>liquidity</b> and maturity <b>transformation</b> that take place outside the regulated banking system. This paper presents a first investigation of the size and the structure of shadow banking within the euro area, using the statistical data sources available to the ECB/Eurosystem. Although overall shadow banking activity in the euro area is smaller than in the United States, it is significant, at least in some euro area countries. This is also broadly true for some of the components of shadow banking, particularly securitisation activity, money market funds and the repo markets. This paper also addresses the interconnection between the regulated and the non-bank-regulated segments of the financial sector. Over the recent past, this interconnection has increased, likely resulting in a higher risk of contagion across sectors and countries. Euro area banks now rely more on funding from the financial sector than in the past, in particular from other financial intermediaries (OFIs), which cover shadow banking entities, including securitisation vehicles. This source of funding is mainly shortterm and therefore more susceptible to runs and to the drying-up of liquidity. This finding confirms that macro-prudential authorities and supervisors should carefully monitor the growing interlinkages between the regulated banking sector and the shadow banking system. However, an in-depth assessment of the activities of shadow banking and of the interconnection with the regulated banking system would require further improvements in the availability of data and other sources of information...|$|R
40|$|<b>Liquidity</b> <b>transformation</b> is a {{pre-eminent}} {{function of}} the banking system. By utilising at-call deposits to fund long-term and illiquid loans, and by making funds available to depositors and borrowers upon demand, banks contribute to economic welfare. However, <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation</b> exposes banks to significant risks. As banks do not choose to hold socially optimal liquidity exposures on their own, bank regulations are an important tool for enhancing the safety of individual banks and improving {{the stability of the}} financial system. This thesis sheds new light on the causes of liquidity risk by examining the supervisory liquidity risk ratings of Australian deposit-taking institutions. It is shown that liquidity risk ratings are predictable and that the Basel III liquidity regulations are likely to reduce risk in the banking system. By conducting the first microeconomic cost-benefit analysis of the Basel III liquidity standards, this thesis also illustrates that the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) have net social benefits under a range of reasonable assumptions. This is particularly important as past macroeconomic cost-benefit analyses of Basel III liquidity standards are shown to be misspecified and potentially spurious.

This article shows that the usual asymmetric information problem in credit markets can result in an oversupply of trade credits, eventually leading to overproduction of liquidity and underinvestment in log-term projects.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of the market-based {{financial}} system since the mid- 1980 s {{changed the nature of}} financial intermediation in the United States profoundly. Within the market-based financial system, "shadow banks" are particularly important institutions. Shadow banks are financial intermediaries that conduct maturity, credit, and <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation</b> without access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees. Examples of shadow banks include finance companies, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, limited-purpose finance companies, structured investment vehicles, credit hedge funds, money market mutual funds, securities lenders, and government-sponsored enterprises.; Shadow banks are interconnected along a vertically integrated, long intermediation chain, which intermediates credit through a wide range of securitization and secured funding techniques such as ABCP, asset-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and repo. This intermediation chain binds shadow banks into a network, which is the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system rivals the traditional banking system in the intermediation of credit to households and businesses. Over the past decade, the shadow banking system provided sources of inexpensive funding for credit by converting opaque, risky, long-term assets into money-like and seemingly riskless short-term liabilities. Maturity and credit transformation in the shadow banking system thus contributed significantly to asset bubbles in residential and commercial real estate markets prior to the financial crisis.; We document that the shadow banking system became severely strained during the financial crisis because, like traditional banks, shadow banks conduct credit, maturity, and <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation,</b> but unlike traditional financial intermediaries, they lack access to public sources of liquidity, such as the Federal Reserve's discount window, or public sources of insurance, such as federal deposit insurance. The liquidity facilities of the Federal Reserve and other government agencies' guarantee schemes were a direct response to the liquidity and capital shortfalls of shadow banks and, effectively, provided either a backstop to credit intermediation by the shadow banking system or to traditional banks for the exposure to shadow banks. Our paper documents the institutional features of shadow banks, discusses their economic roles, and analyzes their relation to the traditional banking system.

40|$|An {{economy in}} which deposit-taking banks of a Diamond/ Dybvig style and an asset market coexist is modelled.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence and}} intensity of crises in the international financial markets during the 1990 s have given new impetus to the debate on reform of the international financial system. Much of the discussion focuses {{on the idea of}} an international lender of last resort which could provide liquidity to ensure the stability of the international financial system. This paper responds {{to the question of whether}} an international lender of last resort is necessary by presenting both the differences and the similarities between a domestic financial market and an international one. This comparison will show that in regard to those aspects which justify the existence of a lender of last resort at the national level, the two types of financial markets are no different: If commercial banks are engaging in maturity and <b>liquidity</b> <b>transformation,</b> then the existence of a lender of last resort is a prerequisite to stable and crisis-free development of financial markets. Both the recent financial crises, and the developments which can be observed in the banking sectors of Latin America and Eastern Europe, provide empirical evidence for this thesis. In these regions, banking sectors are emerging which are increasingly dominated by foreign banks, and thus have indirect access to an international lender of last resort. At the same time, there is an increasing tendency within emerging markets to introduce regulations which limit the extent to which transformation is performed in financial markets, and thus to limit as far as possible the risks which make an international lender of last resort necessary.

It is the combination of asymmetric information and illiquidity that gives rise to the possibility of a banking crisis, a situation whereby all depositors want their cash back. A securities-based financial system has the same attributes as the classic banking business model. Providing liquidity in securities markets by buying relatively illiquid securities and selling more liquid securities is the same risky activity as banking. Therefore, a security crisis is associated with an increase in demand for liquidity, or more liquid securities. This puts strain on the balance sheets of those intermediaries who provide liquidity in securities markets: their assets fall in value, including sovereign bonds of troubled countries, and their liabilities increase in value. To restore their own financial equilibrium, those intermediaries sell their assets in a situation where buyers are relatively fewer. Securities prices fall further, and this causes the “panic”, the “flight to quality”, the “run”, or whatever one chooses to call it. Short term credit dries up, including the normally straightforward repurchase agreement (“the run on repo”), interbank lending, and commercial paper markets. This panic is usually followed by a very sharp recession. The chapter also deals with the argument if financial crises are predictable by the usual economic models, or they are rare unpredictable phenomena (black swans), and finally the extension of the global crisis to the European sovereign debt and banking sector is shortly analyzed...|$|E
