These simulation programs allow the designer to test out different parameters and {{applications of the}} garment instead of producing several real-world prototypes. From modeling human characters to shading cloth material BRDF and BSSRDF these programs require state-of-the-art rendering and animation systems to closely reflect cloth material attributes.

40|$|An energy {{shortage}} arose in Lebanon {{during and after}} the civil war (1975 - 1990). 62 % of the national electricity generation is consumed by building stock, of which 70 / 0 is consunled in the conlnlercial sector. Given the acute shortages and increased consumnption, {{there is a need to}} rationalise the use of energy in the building sector. There is growing evidence that buildings which adopt passive design solutions, such as daylighting and natural ventilation, have good energy performance and show higher occupant satisfaction. Daylighting can be a good contributor to energy efficiency in the buildings of Beirut. where the climate is typically Mediterranean and daylight is available 12 hours per day on average. During the last century, the development of façade configurations and the widespread adoption of international design trends in Beirut, particularly in office buildings, changed the energy consumption pattern. The lack of any building regulations that considered the potential of daylighting led to an underestimation of the impact of façade design on the internal environment and building energy behaviour. The aim of this study is to develop design guidelines for office building façade configuration and plan morphology that will contribute to the best use of daylighting, with associated potential energy savings, in Beirut. To achieve this, the study has three main parts. Firstly, the literature relating to daylighting design principles, glazing façades and human comfort in workspaces is reviewed in order to identify design parameters and variables that are significant for daylighting performance in office buildings. Thereafter, the seven historical phases of architectural development in Beirut are identified. Examples of office buildings from each phase are evaluated for their daylighting efficiency, in accordance to four parametric levels describing the 'Building Shape, 'Window/Façade' and Window/Office' relationships, and the 'Shading Devices' used. Finally, the <b>lighting</b> <b>behaviour</b> of 14 selected case studies is simulated using ADELINE. Electrical lighting consumption and the possible savings due to the implementation of different lighting control strategies are calculated. The simulation outputs are validated by empirical energy data. Finally design guidelines for the best practice in the office buildings of Beirut are produced, by coupling the evaluation of daylighting design variables and energy savings measures.

The metrics in which we examine the light motion include, among other, a general relativistic Dark Matter metric, a dirty Black Hole and a Worm Hole metric, the last two inspired by non-commutative geometry. The lensing in a Holographic Screen metric is discussed in detail. We study also the bending of light around naked singularities like, e. g., the Janis-Newman-Winicour metric and include other cases. A generic property of <b>light</b> <b>behaviour</b> in these exotic metrics is pointed out.

The <b>light</b> saturation <b>behaviour</b> of the transition S 2 → S 3 also shows a pH dependence.

This result is explained by the existence of a second donor in the S 2 state (different from the main donor), which contributes to about 30 % of the S 2 → S 3 transitions at pH 6. 5.

Several different molecules are excreted with urine, depending on hormonal level, and can indicate {{the sex of the}} emitter. In male mice, these chemicals are the major urinary proteins (MUPs) and some small volatile odorant molecues that are found bound to them. We tested adult males for <b>light</b> avoidance <b>behaviour</b> in a two-chamber apparatus, with one light and one dark side, in {{the presence or absence of}} male urinary substances.

The results show that mice can use the information carried by the odorant molecules released by MUPs to recognize the urine of male mice, and respond appropriately.

40|$|AbstractDue {{to recent}} {{advanced}} communication possibilities between traffic infrastructure, vehicles and drivers, the optimization of traffic lights control can be approached in novel ways. At the same time, this may introduce new unexpected dynamics in transportation systems. Our research aims {{to determine how}} drivers and traffic lights systems interact and influence each other when they are informed one about another's behaviour. In order to study this, we developed an agent based model to simulate transportation systems with static and dynamic traffic lights and drivers using information about the traffic <b>lights</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Experiments reveal that the system's performance improves when a bigger share of drivers receive information for both static and dynamic traffic lights systems. This performance improvement is due to drivers managing to avoid stopping at red light rather them adapting their speed to different distances to the traffic lights systems. Additionally, it is demonstrated that {{the duration of the}} fixed phases also influences the performance when drivers use speed recommendations. Moreover, the results show that dynamic traffic lights can produce positive effects for roads with high speed limits and high traffic intensity, while {{in the rest of the}} cases static control is better. Our findings can be used for building more efficient traffic lights systems...|$|R

Many of the images generated for this purpose are photorealistic, but no attempt has been made to ensure they are physically and perceptually valid. We are attempting to rectify these inadequacies through the use of accurate lighting simulation. By determining the appropriate spectral data of the original light sources and using them to illuminate a scene, the viewer can perceive a site and its artefacts in close approximation to the original environment. The richly decorated and well preserved frescoes of the House of the Vettii in Pompeii have been chosen as a subject for the implementation of this study. This paper describes how, by using photographic records, modelling packages and luminaire values from a spectroradiometer, a three dimensional model can be created and then rendered in a lighting visualisation system to provide us with images that go beyond photorealistic, accurately simulating <b>light</b> <b>behaviour</b> and allowing us a physically and perceptually valid view of the reconstructed site.

Non-linear <b>light</b> <b>behaviours</b> within MRRs, such as chaotic signals, {{can be used to}} generate logic codes (digital codes). The soliton signals can be multiplexed and modulated with the logic codes using an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique to transmit the data via a network system. OFDM uses overlapping subcarriers without causing inter-carrier interference. It provides both a high data rate and symbol duration using frequency division multiplexing over multiple subcarriers within one channel. The results show that MRRs support both single-carrier and multi-carrier optical soliton pulses, which can be used in an OFDM based on whether fast Fourier transform or discrete wavelet transform transmission/receiver system. Localised ultra-short soliton pulses within frequencies of 50 and 52 GHz can be seen at the throughput port of the panda system with respect to full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and free spectrum range of 5 MHz and 2 GHz, respectively.

Very recently it has been proposed to use a nanometric optical probe to observe in near-field the light confinement and propagation within PC devices. In this work we analyze the optical properties of PC nanostructures by using a SNOM probe in collection mode in association with transmission measurements. We also explore the possibility to use the nanometric tip for a new class of Near-field Optics Nanometric Silicon Systems (NONSS) dedicated to on-chip information routing and processing. In a first step, we show that with to the SNOM probe it is possible to evidence different <b>light</b> <b>behaviours</b> depending on optical mode profile. Mode coupling in PC waveguides and quality factor changes in PC nanocavities will be discussed.
