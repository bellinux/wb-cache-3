500|$|Buckley {{wrote that}} Bowie [...] "mined sexual intrigue {{for its ability}} to shock", and was {{probably}} [...] "never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual", instead experimenting [...] "out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional. Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie [...] "created their bisexual fantasy". Sandford wrote that Bowie [...] "made a positive fetish of repeating the quip {{that he and his wife}} had met while 'fucking the same bloke'... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and <b>laughing</b> <b>matter.</b> That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women". The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was [...] "far more tolerant of difference" [...] and that gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, and gender equality would not have [...] "enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago".|$|E
500|$|The defence's {{witnesses}} {{included some}} of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real. [...] Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons' apartment and Catherine Friend, who to escape the knocking noises had left the property. [...] One witness's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter, at which she replied [...] "I assure you gentlemen, it is no <b>laughing</b> <b>matter,</b> whatever you may think of it." [...] Thomas Broughton was also called, as was a priest surnamed Ross, one of those who had questioned the ghost. [...] Judge Murray asked him [...] "Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost, or the Ghost had puzzled him?" [...] John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker, Archbishop of Canterbury, who sought to intercede on his behalf. [...] Murray placed the letter in his pocket, unopened, and told the court [...] "it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question." [...] Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses, some of whom although acknowledging Parsons' drink problem, told the court they could not believe he was guilty.|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the family}} tries to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the simple fact is, it's no <b>laughing</b> <b>matter.</b> To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Director Andrey Zvyagintsev {{said the}} project took him {{nearly three years}} to complete, {{starting}} from when he first thought about the plot. The film's screenplay was presented to Zvyagintsev by Artyom Melkumian, an Armenian friend of his {{who worked as a}} television cameraman. Melkumian loved William Saroyan's The <b>Laughing</b> <b>Matter</b> and spent ten years adapting the novel. Originally, the script had a lot of dialogue but Zvyagintsev said that when he started testing it with actors [...] "it was a disaster" [...] and had to remorselessly cut the dialogue. [...] "The long dialogue would be impossible to film in a satisfying way. It would be very difficult for the actors to hold the viewers' attention for that long," [...] said Zvyagintsev.|$|E
