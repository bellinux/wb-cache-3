50|$|Other {{than the}} use of leis on Lei Day, they are {{incorporated}} in special occasions such as graduations, weddings and birthdays. The tradition was brought over by Polynesian voyagers sailing from Tahiti. In the past, maile leis, {{known as one of}} the most sacred leis, was used in peace agreements between opposing peoples. In addition to wearing the <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> a source of beautification, the lei was a way to distinguish groups of people from one another. The lei comes with a set of unspoken rules such as wearing it over your shoulders, not removing it while around the person that gave you the lei, and refusing a <b>lei</b> is seen <b>as</b> disrespectful. Over the years the lei has grown to become an accepted symbol of Hawaii that greets many visitors each year.|$|R

Speaking on his show, Brucan had called Lupu [...] "astute to the square" [...] and [...] "trained Securitate informant", {{indicating}} that [...] "any good-faithed National Peasantist who still views himself as a party colleague with Vasile Lupu is self-excluding himself from the PNŢCD". In 2002, courts decided in Lupu's favor, and Brucan was found guilty of calumny; he was required to pay Lupu the sum of 30 million <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> compensation.|$|R

2500|$|Batzaria {{returned}} to Macedonia as a schoolteacher, educating {{children at the}} Ioannina school, and subsequently at his alma mater in Bitola. In 1899, {{he and his colleagues}} notably persuaded Take Ionescu, the Romanian Education Minister, to allocate some 724,000 <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> a grant to Macedonian schools, and virulently protested when later governments halved this annual income. He afterward became chief inspector of the Romanian educational institutions in the Ottoman provinces of Kosovo and Salonika. Historian Gheorghe Zbuchea, who researched the self-identification of Aromanians as a Romanian subgroup, sees Batzaria as [...] "the most important representative of the national Romanian movement" [...] among early 20th century Ottoman residents, and [...] "without doubt one of the most complex personalities illustrating the history of trans-Danubian Romanianism". Batzaria's debut in Macedonian cultural debates came at a turning point: through her political representatives, Romania was reexamining the scope of her involvement in the Macedonian question, and asserting that it held no ambition to annex Aromanian land.|$|R
5000|$|Discussions {{aimed at}} winding down the SovRoms began in March 1953. The first measure {{was taken in}} 1954 (through accords signed in March and September): Soviet shares in 12 of the 16 {{enterprises}} were {{taken over by the}} Romanian state, in exchange for a sum to be paid in installments of merchandise exports (in 1959, the debt was set at over 35 billion lei). Payments were completed in 1975. The initial sum at which the Soviet side estimated its contribution was 9.6 billion lei, in contrast to the 2.9 billion lei at which it had been valued by Romanian sources; discussions on the matter reduced the sum to a total of 5.3 billion lei, which was construed by the two sides not as a corrected result, but as a concession owing to past irregularities in SovRom activities. At the same time, the Soviet Union announced that it gave up interests in formerly German-owned enterprises and equipment on Romanian soil, for which Romania paid 1.5 billion <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> compensation (deducted from the total 5.3 billion).|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} troubles fitting the entire game {{on a single}} Game Boy Advance cartridge: while {{they had the same}} amount of memory <b>available</b> <b>as</b> when they made the first Ace Attorney game, Trials and Tribulations was 2.3 times as large content-wise. To accomplish this, they made use of [...] "tricks and workarounds" [...] they had figured out since working on the first game: for instance, they worked to create better structures for storing data efficiently, better compression of the graphical data, and good sounds that only use little data. Takumi found these constraints fun, as it was a chance to improve the team's abilities and a source of inspiration for doing as much as possible within the memory limitations. They still ended up having to cut or change several features: along with the art of the younger Mia, Phoenix and Edgeworth in the flashback episodes, they had planned to have new art assets for a younger Gumshoe, with his tie tied tightly and with only one hair spike, but had to settle for giving him a new coat. The character Oldbag from the first game was first cut, then included as a cameo at the end when they realized that they had just enough space for her; Takumi wanted to have her wear a <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> she would have just come back from a Hawaii trip, but was unable to due to memory limitations. Due to miscalculations of the game asset size, they had to make the character Bikini shorter in order to save some memory.|$|R

5000|$|On 1 July 2005, the leu was revalued at {{the rate}} of 10,000 [...] "old" [...] lei (ROL) for one [...] "new" [...] leu (RON), thus psychologically {{bringing}} the purchasing power of the leu back in line with those of other major Western currencies. The term chosen for the action was [...] "denominare", similar to the English [...] "denomination".The first day brought difficulties adjusting to the new paper currencies and closed ATMs (that needed reprogramming) and forcing a new calculation habit that slowed down shops and annoyed some sales staff and older shoppers. The old ROL currency banknotes remained in circulation until December 31, 2006 (coins remained in circulation only until December 31, 2005), but all accounts have been converted starting July 1, 2005. There is no conversion time limit between the currencies. Retailers had to display prices in both old and new currency from March 1, 2005 until June 30, 2006. The appreciation of the leu during 2005 was about 20% against a basket of major currencies. As of 2006, the revaluation was a potential source of confusion, especially to visitors, since both old and new currency values were commonly quoted. When written, the very large amounts in old currency are usually obvious, but in speaking inhabitants might refer to an amount of 5 new <b>lei</b> <b>as</b> simply [...] "fifty" [...] in reference to its value of 50,000 old lei.|$|R
