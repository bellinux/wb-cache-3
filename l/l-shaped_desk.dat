50|$|The first {{offices to}} {{incorporate}} Action Office products {{were in the}} Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which had contracted with George Nelson and Herman Miller in 1963 to design an innovative office space that could maximize efficiency in a small area. The resulting design was based on Nelson’s CPS (Comprehensive Panel System), and featured “pods” of four cubicles arranged in a swastika pattern, each with an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>desk</b> and overhead storage. Surviving photos of the Federal Reserve Bank offices reveal a design that would not appear much different from a cubicle of today.|$|E
50|$|Lean {{focuses on}} {{optimizing}} the end-to-end {{process as a}} whole. This enables a focus in the process on creating a finished product at the lowest cost (instead of lowering the cost of each step.) A common approach to achieving {{this is known as}} the workcell. Machines involved in building a product are placed next to each other to minimize transportation of both parts and people (an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>desk</b> with upper shelves is a good office example, which enables many office equipment to be within the reach of a worker). This will minimize waste in both transportation and in the storage of excess inventory.|$|E
5000|$|On September 29, 2011 WCBS-TV {{moved into}} a {{temporary}} set after the final newscast in the set they had been using for 10 years. The final newscast used in the temporary set was on October 20, 2011 for [...] "CBS 2 News This Morning", on October 20, 2011, WCBS-TV debuted a new set on its noon newscast. The modernized set features a projection screen which changes backgrounds for each newscast (morning, noon and night) behind the anchors with blurred glass panels {{on both sides and}} the weather center includes additional blurring panels, plenty of monitors, an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>desk</b> and dimensional letter {{along the top of the}} set.|$|E
5000|$|A small boom {{in office}} work and desk {{production}} {{occurred at the}} end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th with the introduction of smaller and less expensive electrical presses and efficient carbon paper coupled with the general acceptance of the typewriter. Steel desks were introduced to take heavier loads of paper and withstand the pounding meted out on the typewriters. This also gave rise to the Typewriter Desk; a platform, sometimes on wheels and with expandable surface via flaps, that was built to a specific height to make typing easier and more comfortable than when using a standard or traditional desk. The <b>L-shaped</b> <b>desk</b> also became popular, with the [...] "leg" [...] being used as an annex for the typewriter.|$|E
5000|$|Peck writes {{exclusively}} on a typewriter, described here in 'Publishers Weekly:When {{the author is}} not traveling, he works at an <b>L-shaped</b> <b>desk,</b> which affords a sunny window. He writes everything on an electric typewriter because [...] "it {{has to be a}} book from the first day," [...] he explains. He has no daily routine because of all the traveling he does, but follows a very disciplined writing process. He writes each page six times, then places it in a three-ring binder with a DePauw University cover ("a talisman," [...] he calls this memento from his alma mater). When he feels that he has gotten a page just right, he takes out another 20 words. [...] "After a year, I've come to the end. Then I'll take this first chapter, and without rereading it, I'll throw it away and write the chapter that goes at the beginning. Because the first chapter is the last chapter in disguise." [...] He always hands in a completed manuscript, and his editor is his first reader.|$|E
