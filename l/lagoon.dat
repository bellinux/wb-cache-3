50|$|Tuzly <b>Lagoons</b> (Тузловські лимани, Limanele Tuzlei) are a {{group of}} marine <b>lagoons</b> (limans) in {{southern}} Bessarabia (Budjak), Ukraine.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Okhotsk Sea, but {{separated}} from it by a depositional feature, <b>lagoons</b> have a particular hydrology and specific conditions for bottom sediment accumulation. Marine organisms in <b>lagoons</b> can be exposed to water temperature and salinity fluctuations of significant range. The Okhotsk Sea <b>lagoons</b> are grouped by size into large (100 – 500 km 2), medium (10 – 100 km 2), small (1 – 10 km 2) and very small (less than 1 km 2) ones. The largest <b>lagoons</b> in terms of area are Baikal, Schastya, Piltun, and Perevolochnaya. Many small <b>lagoons</b> are linked to river estuaries. In terms of water depth, <b>lagoons</b> are grouped into shallow (less than 1 m deep), medium-depth (1 – 5 m), deep (5 – 20 m) and very deep (more than 20 m) ones. The evolution of Okhotsk Sea <b>lagoons</b> {{is associated with the}} Holocene transgression, during which time they came into existence. As evidenced by well-studied coastal-marine depositions, large sea water bodies, separated by sand banks and morphologically close to modern <b>lagoons,</b> started to form at a higher level in the sub-boreal period. During subsequent sea level fluctuations above the present-day level, the inner shoreline contour of <b>lagoons</b> was reshaping. Today, some <b>lagoons</b> are {{separated from}} the sea, partly filled with alluvial-marine, eolian, and biogenic depositions and have turned into lakes. <b>Lagoons</b> are used as harbors for sheltering small fishing and transport vessels. Some <b>lagoons</b> are used for aquaculture farms where fish, seaweeds, and scallops ar...|$|R

The framework presented extends to a rudimentary classification of the eight example coastal <b>lagoons,</b> relative to the other 70 or so intermittently open coastal <b>lagoons</b> in NSW, which can be used to provide an indication of the relative importance of these <b>lagoons</b> with respect to future management, such as remediation or conservation...|$|R

40|$|Dairy waste <b>lagoons</b> are earthen {{structures}} {{designed for}} biological treatment and long-term storage of dairy waste. L'flgoons are specially construct-ed to prevent leakage of dairy waste to ground water. The la-goon system allows manure {{to be handled}} with water-flushing systems, sewer lines, pumps, and irrigation equipment. The natural biological action on the waste results in less odor during land application. Nitrogen con-tent of the waste is reduced in <b>lagoons</b> {{by as much as}} 80 per-cent. This reduction minimizes land area needed for land appli-cation and enhances long-term storage. Anaerobic <b>Lagoons</b> Anaerobic <b>lagoons</b> look like farm ponds at first glance. They are larger than manure storage basins, which do not provide significant biological treatment or long storage periods, but smaller than aerobic <b>lagoons.</b> Even though aerobic <b>lagoons</b> are designed to provide a higher de-gree of treatment with less odor, anaerobic <b>lagoons</b> decompose more organic matter per unit volume. Because of their treat-ment and storage capabilities anaerobic <b>lagoons</b> are a good compromise between storage basins and aerobic <b>lagoons.</b> Anaerobic treatment of waste occurs without free m [...] rygen to liquify or degrade high BOD (biochemical oxygen demand) organic waste.

40|$|The {{composition}} {{and diversity of}} the total and intestinal component and infra-communities were determined in eels Anguilla anguilla from three shallow <b>lagoons</b> on the Adriatic coast of Italy {{to determine whether the}} helminth communities would differ in {{composition and}} structure from those in eels from <b>lagoons</b> on the Tyrrhenian coast. The <b>lagoons</b> differed in respect of their management regimes and the extent of freshwater influx. Both freshwater and marine species of helminths were found in the eels in all three <b>lagoons,</b> but the freshwater component was richer in Valle Figheri. A suite of three digenean eel specialist species occurred in all three <b>lagoons,</b> of which any two members dominated each community. This conferred a high degree of similarity between the communities of the three <b>lagoons.</b> The same three species also dominated helminth communities in eels in <b>lagoons</b> along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy, and compositional similarity levels were similar within and between western and eastern groups. Species richness was higher in the component communities of the eels of the Adriatic <b>lagoons</b> when compared to the Tyrrhenian ones, but diversity and dominance indices were of a similar order of magnitude and range. Intestinal helminth communities were richer and more diverse in two of the Adriatic <b>lagoons</b> because the proportion of eels with zero or one helminth species was, unusually, in the minority. It was nevertheless concluded that infracommunity structure was similar in eels from both western and eastern <b>lagoons</b> and that the hypothesis that it would differ in Adriatic <b>lagoons</b> could not be supported. The findings provide further evidence of the similarity in composition and structure of helminth communities in eels from coastal <b>lagoons</b> throughout Europe...|$|R

5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the <b>lagoon.</b> Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made.
