500|$|Ijaz {{first met}} Sudanese {{president}} Omar al-Bashir and other Sudanese leaders in August 1996 and reported his findings back to U.S. government officials, including <b>Lee</b> <b>Hamilton,</b> ranking {{member of the}} House Committee on International Relations at the time, and Sandy Berger, then Clinton's deputy national security adviser, and Susan Rice, then director for African Affairs at the National Security Council. Initially, Khartoum sought U.S. sanctions relief, particularly for its growing oil sector, in return for access to its intelligence data on Al Qaeda's nascent network and bin Laden's activities there. However, the sanctions continued until U.S. officials exempted some in unrelated policy decisions that benefited U.S. oil companies. Ijaz then argued that Washington should adopt a policy of [...] "constructive engagement" [...] with Khartoum vis-a-vis economic development and political reconciliation in return for Sudanese counterterrorism cooperation.|$|E

2500|$|Allegations {{concerning}} the Bush administration's refusal {{to provide information}} to the 9/11 Commission about the Saudi flights are disputed. The May 18, 2004 article in The Hill says that Commission vice-chairman <b>Lee</b> <b>Hamilton</b> [...] "disclosed the administration's refusal to answer questions on the sensitive subject during a recent closed-door meeting {{with a group of}} Democratic senators, according to several Democratic sources." [...] It also says that Republican Commission member John Lehman [...] "said... that he told the senators the White House has been fully cooperative." [...] President Bush, who met privately with the Saudi Arabian ambassador on the morning of Sept. 13, 2001, is suspected of personally authorizing the controversial flights while all other air travel had been halted.|$|E

[...] Neoconservative media pundit Bill Kristol called the report [...] "an evasion" [...] and [...] "not a serious document". Rush Limbaugh asserted that the members of the [...] "Iraq Surrender Group" [...] are [...] "doing everything they can to unite the American people" [...] in [...] "defeat" [...] and [...] "surrender"; and Glenn Beck called the report [...] "Operation White Flag." ...|$|E
