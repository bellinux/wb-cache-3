25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank.|$|E

6000|$|There {{would be}} {{much to say about}} that golden chain of {{historic}} cities which stretches from Milan to Venice, in which the very names--Brescia, Verona, Mantua, Padua--are an ornament to one's phrase; but I should have to draw upon recollections now three years old and to make my short story a long one. Of Verona and Venice only have I recent impressions, and even to these must I do hasty justice. I came into Venice, just as I had done before, toward the end of a summer's day, when the shadows begin to lengthen and the light to glow, and found that the attendant sensations bore repetition remarkably well. There was the same last intolerable delay at Mestre, just before your first glimpse of the lagoon confirms the already distinct sea-smell which has added speed to the precursive flight of your imagination; then the <b>liquid</b> <b>level,</b> edged afar off by its band of undiscriminated domes and spires, soon distinguished and proclaimed, however, as excited and contentious heads multiply at the windows of the train; then your long rumble on the immense white railway-bridge, which, in spite of the invidious contrast drawn, and very properly, by Mr. Ruskin between {{the old and the new}} approach, does truly, in a manner, shine across the green lap of the lagoon like a mighty causeway of marble; then the plunge into the station, which would be exactly similar to every other plunge save for one little fact--that the keynote of the great medley of voices borne back from the exit is not [...] "Cab, sir!" [...] but [...] "Barca, signore!" ...|$|E
50|$|In the 2nd stage of separation, {{the liquid}} with {{remaining}} gas flows along a horizontal section of pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> in the horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle}} of the pipe. The <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> is controlled by a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> sensor in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to the control valve and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> down. Conversely, as <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> goes goes down, the control valve beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> to rise. In essence, the control valve modulates to maintain the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> {{in the middle of}} the horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream. All of the free gas removed in the horizontal section joins the gas run through a connecting run and is measured in the gas leg. The liquid, now free of gas drops to a liquid run for measurement.|$|E
50|$|Use a {{vertical}} pressure vessel with a length-diameter ratio of about 3 to 4, and size the vessel to provide about 5 minutes of liquid inventory between the normal <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> {{and the bottom}} of the vessel (with the normal <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> being somewhat below the feed inlet).|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} systems {{has evolved from}} a manual to an {{automatic}} status. In order to create an automatic control, a controller is needed to perform pre- established functions in an automatic to perform any desired processes. Electronics gives us solutions to develop automatic control systems using micro controllers. In this case, the problem is to control the <b>liquid’s</b> <b>level</b> according to the desired value using a digital signal controller “dcPIC’s”. The control process is made by acquiring the <b>liquid’s</b> <b>level</b> using a sensor. This value is then digitalized and linearized {{in order to be}} used in automatic control calculus. The desired value is imput trough a keyboard. The controller compares the actual measured value by the sensor and the imput reference value in order to perform the correction according to the existing error. The process of correction is performed trough the actuators which can be the pump or the electro valve depending on the error signal swing. A visualization of both the current <b>liquid’s</b> <b>level</b> and the imput reference value is also presented...|$|R

50|$|Some {{storage tanks}} need a {{floating}} roof {{in addition to}} or {{in lieu of the}} fixed roof and structure. This floating roof rises and falls with the <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> inside the tank, thereby decreasing the vapor space above the <b>liquid</b> <b>level.</b> Floating roofs are considered a safety requirement as well as a pollution prevention measure for many industries including petroleum refining.|$|E
50|$|High- and low liquid-level {{controls}} normally are float-operated pilots that actuate a valve on {{the inlet}} to the separator, open a bypass around the separator, sound a warning alarm, or perform some other pertinent function to prevent damage that {{might result from}} high or low <b>liquid</b> <b>levels</b> in the separator.|$|R
50|$|The roof has {{support legs}} hanging {{down into the}} liquid. At low <b>liquid</b> <b>levels</b> the roof {{eventually}} lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof, similar to a fixed roof tank.

40|$|The {{successful}} {{deployment of}} the Borexino solar neutrino detector required assorted physical and chemical operations to produce exceptional pure fluids and fill multiple detector zones. The composition and flow rates of high purity gases and liquids had to be precisely controlled to maintain <b>liquid</b> <b>levels</b> and pressures. The system was required to meet exceptional requirements for cleanliness and leak-tightness. A large scale modular system connecting fluid receiving, purification and fluid delivery processes was developed for Borexino. At the core is a flow control system that delivers scintillator components to plants for purification, and then fills the Borexino detector volumes with ultrahigh purity buffer or ultrahigh purity scintillator. The liquid handling system maintains precise control over the <b>liquid</b> <b>levels</b> and differential pressures between the different volumes of the detectors that are separated by flexible nylon vessels. The preparation, commissioning and operation of the system for filling the Borexino detector with scintillator is described. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.
