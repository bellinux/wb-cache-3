The Tamil University is a state run institute, started during 1981 and {{obtained}} its statutory recognition from the University Grants Commission in 1983. It {{is the only one of}} its kind for the Tamil language doing higher research in Tamilology and advanced study in various allied branches like linguistics, translation, <b>lexicography,</b> music, drama and manuscriptology.|$|E
25|$|Lu Gusun (陆谷孙), <b>lexicography</b> master.|$|E
25|$|He is {{best known}} for his {{investigations}} on language and culture. His love for <b>lexicography</b> is evident in Dictionary Days: A Defining Passion (2005).|$|E
25|$|Giles {{learned that}} Edmund Backhouse, {{one of his}} first Chinese {{language}} students at Cambridge, had been trying for years to compile a Chinese-English dictionary. In 1925, he used it to metaphorically describe Chinese bilingual <b>lexicography</b> in terms of international sports competition.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Chinese <b>lexicography,</b> fǎnqiè or fan-chieh is {{a method}} to indicate the pronunciation of a monosyllabic character by using two other characters, one with the same initial consonant as the desired syllable and one with the same rest of the syllable (the final).|$|E
25|$|Biruni wrote most of {{his works}} in Arabic, as the {{scientific}} language of his age, however, his Persian version of the Al-Tafhim {{is one of the}} most important of the early works of science in the Persian language, and is a rich source for Persian prose and <b>lexicography.</b> The book covers the Quadrivium in a detailed and skilled fashion.|$|E
25|$|He was {{witty and}} urbane, clean and well mannered. He avoided coarse speech, instead {{displaying}} refined eloquence. He {{had a good}} grounding in grammar, <b>lexicography</b> and philology. Such were considered essential for Qur'anic commentary. He knew Persian and was acquainted with the origins of various foreign loan words in Arabic {{from a number of}} other languages.|$|E
25|$|Zuckermann is Professor of Linguistics and Endangered Languages at the University of Adelaide. He {{is elected}} {{member of the}} Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies and the Foundation for Endangered Languages. He serves as Editorial Board member of the Journal of Language Contact (Brill), {{consultant}} for the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), and Expert Witness in (corpus) <b>lexicography</b> and (forensic) linguistics.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the OEDs entries has {{influenced}} numerous other historical <b>lexicography</b> projects. The forerunners to the OED, such as the early volumes of the Deutsches Wörterbuch, had initially provided few quotations from {{a limited number of}} sources, whereas the OED editors preferred larger groups of quite short quotations from a wide selection of authors and publications. This influenced later volumes of this and other lexicographical works.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Kashi Prasad Jayaswal compared Rahul Sankrityayan with Buddha. Rahul's personality was {{as impressive}} and memorable as are his achievements. He travelled widely and wrote in five languages – Hindi, Sanskrit, Bhojpuri, Pāli and Tibetan. His published works span {{a range of}} genres, which include autobiography, biography, travelogue, sociology, history, philosophy, Buddhism, Tibetology, <b>lexicography,</b> grammar, text editing, folklore, science, fiction, drama, essays, politics, and pamphleteering.|$|E
25|$|The early halakha sought only {{to define}} the compass and scope of {{individual}} laws, asking under what circumstances of practical life a given rule was to be applied {{and what would be}} its consequences. The earlier Midrash, therefore, aims at an exact definition of the laws contained in the Scriptures by an accurate interpretation of the text and a correct determination of the meaning of the various words. The form of exegesis adopted is frequently one of simple <b>lexicography,</b> and is remarkably brief.|$|E
25|$|Sankrityayan was a polyglot, {{well versed}} in several {{languages}} and dialects, including Hindi, Sanskrit, Pali, Bhojpuri, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Tamil, Kannada, Tibetan, Sinhalese, French and Russian. He was also an Indologist, a Marxist theoretician, and a creative writer. He started writing during his twenties and his works, totalling well over 100, covered a variety of subjects, including sociology, history, philosophy, Buddhism, Tibetology, <b>lexicography,</b> grammar, textual editing, folklore, science, drama, and politics. Many of these were unpublished. He translated Majjhima Nikaya from Prakrit into Hindi.|$|E
25|$|The Urdu {{keyboard}} is any {{keyboard layout}} for Urdu computer and typewriter keyboards. Since the first Urdu typewriter was made available in 1911, the layout {{has gone through}} various phases of evolution. With time, the variety of layouts introduced in the 1950s for mechanised compositions have reduced to very few that are compatible with the new digital age. Modern improvements in Urdu keyboard were pioneered by the National Language Authority (Muqtadra-e-Qaumi Zaban) in Pakistan, which standardised the linguistic aspects such as orthography and <b>lexicography.</b> These developments helped the keyboard layout to evolve from the typewriters to be compatible with computers, to increase the productivity and textual efficiency of the language, especially through modern electronic media.|$|E
25|$|Language {{documentation}} combines anthropological inquiry (into {{the history}} and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. <b>Lexicography</b> involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics {{is concerned with the}} statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.|$|E
25|$|The Oytser’s {{broadsheet}} catalogue {{became the}} basis of the Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh (“Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language”), an even more extensive dictionary. Stutchkoff planned on compiling it with the linguists Yudel Mark and Judah A. Joffe and then publishing it at YIVO. In 1955, he left the project for personal and conceptual reasons after only three years: his pragmatic approach to <b>lexicography</b> was not compatible with Yudel Mark’s scientific claim. Finally, only the first four parts of the Groyser verterbukh were published between 1961 and 1980. They covered all words starting with Aleph and most words starting with a vowel (in Yiddish orthography all words starting with /a/, /aj/, /ej/, /o/, /oj/ and /u/ are written with an Aleph).|$|E
25|$|The lexicon is a {{catalogue}} of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered {{to be part of}} the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. <b>Lexicography,</b> closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are called neologisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{three centuries}} after the Sangam age {{witnessed}} {{an increase in}} the mutual interaction of Sanskrit and Tamil. A number of words and concepts relating to ethics, philosophy and religion were mutually borrowed and exchanged between the languages. Around 300CE, the Tamil land was under the influence of a group of people known as the Kalabhras. The Kalabhras were Buddhist and a number of Buddhist authors flourished during this period. Jainism and Buddhism saw rapid growth. These authors, perhaps reflecting the austere nature of their faiths, created works mainly on morality and ethics. A number of Jain and Buddhist poets contributed to the creation of these didactic works as well as grammar and <b>lexicography.</b> The collection the minor eighteen anthology was of this period.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Garner {{became the}} editor in chief of Black's Law Dictionary, whose roots are {{traceable}} to 1891 and which is currently the most widely respected authority on Anglo-American legal <b>lexicography.</b> Since 1995, Garner has overhauled the book over the course of four unabridged editions (7th–10th). He created a panel of international legal experts to improve all the specialized vocabulary in the book, including Roman law, international law, and transactional terminology. With the help of these experts, Garner and his team have rewritten the entire dictionary and added tens of thousands of new entries, amplifying many with dates of linguistic origin; supplementary usage, historical, or other lexicographic information; and exemplary quotations drawn from myriad sources in the literature on Anglo-American law—some as early as the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} his B.A. degree, Garner {{entered the}} University of Texas School of Law, {{where he served}} as {{an associate editor of}} the Texas Law Review. After receiving his J.D. degree in 1984, he clerked for Judge Thomas M. Reavley of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before joining the Dallas firm of Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal, where he worked as a litigation associate from 1985 to 1988. He then returned to the University of Texas School of Law as a visiting associate professor of law and was named director of the Texas/Oxford Center for Legal <b>Lexicography,</b> while teaching upper-division seminars on writing and editing at the law school. In 1990, he left the University to found LawProse Inc., a Dallas firm that provides seminars on clear writing for lawyers and judges and offers consulting services on appellate and high-stakes briefing and revising corporate and other legal documents.|$|E
25|$|In medieval Europe, glossaries with {{equivalents}} for Latin {{words in}} vernacular or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the Leiden Glossary). The Catholicon (1287) by Johannes Balbus, a large grammatical {{work with an}} alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served {{as the basis for}} several bilingual dictionaries {{and was one of the}} earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 Ambrogio Calepino's Dictionarium was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 Robert Estienne published the Thesaurus linguae latinae and in 1572 his son Henri Estienne published the Thesaurus linguae graecae, which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek <b>lexicography.</b> The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by Sebastián Covarrubias' Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española, published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain. In 1612 the first edition of the Vocabolario dell'Accademia della Crusca, for Italian, was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in Rotterdam was published, posthumously, the Dictionnaire Universel by Antoine Furetière for French. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the Dictionnaire de l'Académie française. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the Vocabulario portughez e latino written by Raphael Bluteau. The Real Academia Española published the first edition of the Diccionario de la lengua española in 1780, but their Diccionario de Autoridades, which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The Totius Latinitatis lexicon by Egidio Forcellini was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.|$|E

500|$|The Dictionary {{was finally}} {{published}} in April 1755, {{with the title}} page acknowledging that Oxford had awarded Johnson a Master of Arts degree {{in anticipation of the}} work. The dictionary as published was a huge book. Its pages were nearly [...] tall, and the book was [...] wide when opened; it contained 42,773 entries, to which only a few more were added in subsequent editions, and it sold for the extravagant price of £4 10s, perhaps the rough equivalent of £350 today. An important innovation in English <b>lexicography</b> was to illustrate the meanings of his words by literary quotation, of which there were approximately 114,000. The authors most frequently cited include William Shakespeare, John Milton and John Dryden. It was years before Johnson's Dictionary, as it came to be known, turned a profit. Authors' royalties were unknown at the time, and Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further money from its sale. Years later, many of its quotations would be repeated by various editions of the Webster's Dictionary and the New English Dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|The Dictionary was {{exported}} to America.

[...] For American lexicographers the Dictionary was impossible to ignore: [...] "America's two great nineteenth-century lexicographers, Noah Webster and Joseph Emerson Worcester, argued fiercely over Johnson's legacy ... In 1789 [...] declared that 'Great Britain, whose children we are, and whose language we speak, should no longer be our standard; for the taste of her writers is already corrupted, and her language on the decline.'" [...] "Where Webster found fault with Johnson, Joseph Worcester saluted him ... In 1846 he completed his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language. He defended Johnson's work, arguing that 'from the time of its publication, [...] has been, far more than any other, regarded as the standard for the language'." [...] Notwithstanding the evolution of <b>lexicography</b> in America, [...] "The Dictionary has also played its part in the law, especially in the United States. Legislators are much occupied with ascertaining 'first meanings', with trying to secure the literal sense of their predecessors' legislation ... Often it is a matter of historicizing language: to understand a law, you need to understand what its terminology meant to its original architects ... as long as the American Constitution remains intact, Johnson's Dictionary will have a role to play in American law." ...|$|E
