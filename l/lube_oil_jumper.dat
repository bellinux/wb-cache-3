40|$|Abstract. The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> {{separator}} {{is widely}} used in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> system of merchant vessel. The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator functions to purify the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> to ensure its good working performance. The working condition of the oil separator will greatly influence the normal running of many plants. The <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator used in our laboratory is Mitsubishi SJ 700. In the processing of purifying, oil leakage from the water outlet is found. In order to find failure point, the basic structure and the working principle of the separator is introduced. The separator is dismantled according to the procedure. After cleaning some parts found dirty and replacing some sealing elements, the separator is reassembled. When starting the separating process again, the failure remains. Through further analyzing the structure and working principle of the separator, the trouble spot is found out. After removing the failure, the separator finally is repaired. To prevent similar accident occurring again, some suggestions are presented. Oil Leakage from Water-outlet In {{the operation of the}} <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> separator working for the main engine, failure warning is emitted,and then <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> leakage from the water-outlet is found.

Diesel ash emissions are the non-combustible portion of diesel particulate matter and are mainly derived from metallic <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> additives such as Ca, Mg, and Zn {{as well as}} engine wear metals including Fe. Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are used to filter engine particle emissions and are routinely regenerated, oxidizing the material in the filter. After filter regeneration, metallic ash remains. Over time, this ash can build up in the filter, increasing the filter pressure drop and eventually plugging the filter. Ash emissions {{can also be used}} to calculate engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption. A high temperature oxidation method (HTOM) has been developed to measure ash emissions in real-time. The HTOM uses a tube oven to oxidize the combustible fraction of an engine exhaust sample. The remaining particles are then measured with real-time and near real-time particle sampling techniques. The HTOM system improvements are discussed along with validation testing and further recommendations regarding improvements in the apparatus and procedure. Atomized <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> was used as a test aerosol. Special <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> blends were formulated to determine measurement sensitivity to specific ash constituents. Ca and Mg were readily detectable by the HTOM. However, the HTOM was not very sensitive to Zn based additives. Chemical equilibrium models show that Ca and Mg formed stable oxides at oven temperatures while Zn went to a gaseous phase. Repeatability in <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> spray ash measurements was better than 10 %. Engine exhaust repeats did not show as good repeatability. However engine exhaust is a much less stable and repeatable aerosol. Steady-state engine ash emissions were sampled from two different Diesel engines (1. 9 L VW and Cummins APU) at different speeds and loads. <b>Lube</b> <b>oil</b> doped fuel was also used in the engine tests to artificially increase oil consumption and ash emissions. The engine <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption was predicted from known <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> ash concentrations and measured ash emissions. The non-doped fuel tests yielded lower than expected <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> consumption estimates while the doped tests showed an ash recovery of 31 %. Transient ash measurements were demonstrated. Ash and soot measurements were made downstream a loading DPF. The downstream soot particle surface area concentrations tracked better with the ash than soot volume concentrations. Transient engine speed and loads were also measured by the HTOM. Ash diameter concentrations were measured in real-time showing definite spikes of ash emissions at transient load steps...|$|R
40|$|Nanomanufacturing {{offers an}} {{opportunity}} to create domestic jobs and facilitate economic growth. In response to this need, U. S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy issued a Research Call to develop nanomanufacturing capabilities at the National Laboratories. High performance catalysts represent {{a unique opportunity to}} deploy nanomanufacturing technologies. Re-refining of used <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> offers {{an opportunity to}} create manufacturing jobs and decrease dependence on imported petroleum. Improved catalysts are required to produce a better quality product, decrease environmental impact, extend catalyst life, and improve overall economics of <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> re-refining. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) in cooperation with Universal Lubricants, Inc. (ULI) and Chemical Engineering Partners (CEP) have carried out a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to prepare nanostructured hydrotreating catalysts using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to exhibit superior performance for the re-refining of used <b>lube</b> <b>oil.</b> We investigated the upgrading of recycled <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> by hydrogenation using commercial, synthetically-modified commercial catalysts, and synthesized catalysts. A down-flow (trickle bed) catalytic unit was used for the hydrogenation experiments. In addition to carrying out elemental analyses of the various feed and product fractions, characterization was undertaken using H{sup 1 } and C{sup 13 } NMR. Initially commercial were evaluated. Second these commercial catalysts were promoted with precious metals using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Performance improvements were observed that declined with catalyst aging. An alternate approach was undertaken to deeply upgrade ULI product oils. Using a synthesized catalyst, much lower hydrogenation temperatures were required than commercial catalysts. Other performance improvements were also observed. The resulting <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> fractions were of high purity even at low reaction severity. The products recovered from both the ALD and other processes were water-white (even those from the low temperature, low residence time (high space velocity), low conversion runs). These results indicate that highly upgraded recycle <b>lube</b> <b>oils</b> can be produced using ALD-deposited active metal catalysts.

40|$|LecturePg. 41 - 50 The <b>lube</b> <b>oils</b> in {{self-contained}} reservoirs for turbomachinery in hydrocarbon {{processing plants}} {{are subject to}} contamination and deterioration from airborne dust, component debris, system corrosion, heat, and water.

Excess water and acquired hydrocarbon constituents which adversely influence the viscosity and other characteristics of turbomachinery <b>lube</b> <b>oils</b> must be removed periodically, if machinery distress is to be avoided. As part of a determined effort to maintain the reliability of critically important turbomachinery, a major petrochemical complex has implemented a <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> quality assurance program.

Alkyl itaconates were prepared by the esterification of itaconic acid with different saturated alcohols C 16 /C 18 /NAFOL 20 +A (Cav =  20) /NAFOL 1822 B (Cav =  22).

30|$|All the {{prepared}} compounds impart better oxidation resistance properties to the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> {{compared with the}} undoped oil. Their efficiencies as <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> antioxidants {{are very close to}} each other, since variations in the total acid number (∆T.A.N.), viscosity ratio (V/Vo) and optical density log (I/Io) is very small. This may be attributed to the presence of phenolic and amino groups in their structures. The mechanism of phenolic aromatic amine compounds as antioxidants were explained by phenolic and certain aromatic amine inhibitors function by donation of labile hydrogen from the groups (OH or NH) to stabilize the chain radicals; i.e., these inhibitors destroy the peroxide radicals and thus, the oxidation chain is broken. The marked efficiency of hindered phenols is attributed to their radicals being insufficiently reactive to abstract hydrogen from the hydrocarbon and initiate new oxidation chains. The presence of amine part in the structure of prepared Mannich base compounds neutralize some of the acidic products of oil oxidation. The change in total acid number (∆T.A.N.), viscosity ratio (V/Vo) and optical density log (I/Io) decrease with increasing the NH groups in the molecular of amine used. Thus, using triethylenetetramine gave better results than diethylenetriamine and ethylene diamine. In all cases, results indicate that there is a quite wide difference between the <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> samples mixed with prepared products and that of using <b>lube</b> <b>oil</b> sample without additives.|$|R
