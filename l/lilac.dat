5|$|Carol quarrels with <b>Lilac</b> and storms off. <b>Lilac</b> sends Milla to {{find her}} and then goes to save Torque from Brevon's nearby base, but she is {{captured}} and tortured by Brevon. Meanwhile, Carol and Milla ally with Spade to storm the base, where they rescue Torque and <b>Lilac.</b> However, they are all separated in the ensuing conflict. Neera finds <b>Lilac,</b> arrests her, and brings her back to Shang Tu, where the Magister determines that she is innocent and reveals that Zao is challenging Shuigang for the Stone. <b>Lilac</b> rejoins her friends and convinces Shang Mu and Shang Tu to unite against Dail and Brevon's army. During the battle, Brevon announces that his ship is repaired, and <b>Lilac,</b> Milla, and Carol board it. The team combats Brevon's minions, including a mutated Serpentine. Brevon captures Milla and turns her into a grotesque monster that attacks the other protagonists, who are forced to render her unconscious. Enraged, <b>Lilac</b> and Carol attack and defeat Brevon, but the Kingdom Stone is destroyed in the process. Shortly after the battle, Milla awakens in a medical tent and sees the sky lit up by swirling, crystalline energy released from the Kingdom Stone. The three kingdoms resolve to harness the Stone's power and share it equally, thereby bringing {{an end to the}} war. Torque says goodbye to <b>Lilac,</b> Carol, and Milla and returns to space.|$|E

5000|$|According to Gregory Eiselein: [...] <b>Lilacs</b> {{represent}} love, spring, life, {{the earthly}} realm, rebirth, cyclical time, a Christ figure (and thus consolation, redemption, and spiritual rebirth), a father figure, {{the cause of}} grief, and an instrument of sensual consolation. The <b>lilacs</b> can represent all of these meanings or none of them. They could just be <b>lilacs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gardens were {{established}} by Hulda Klager (1863-1960), who began hybridizing <b>lilacs</b> in 1905. By 1910 she had created 14 new varieties, and in 1920 she started showing her <b>lilacs</b> every spring.|$|R

5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; <b>Lilac,</b> Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. <b>Lilac</b> can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap her ears to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|Among the 115 species {{recorded}} in 2004 on the site, 15 {{are included in}} the red list of the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. In the shrubs near the path where green waste was deposited by people from outside the organization grow yellow club fungus (Clavulinopsis helvola), gray shag (Coprinopsis cinerea), black earth tongues (Trichoglossum hirsutum), Arrhenia spathulata and Marasmius limosus. Those two last species are also in the Calamagrostide's glade of a pioneer wood of willow and birch, with moor club (Clavaria argillacea), Geoglossum cookeanum, <b>lilac</b> leg fibrecap (Inocybe griseolilacina), (Stropharia pseudocyanea), girdled knight (Tricholoma cingulatum) and burnt knight (Tricholoma ustale).

Dog stinkhorn (Mutinus caninus) and Scytinostroma hemidichophyticum for their part, were observed in the shaded path north of the site on the edge of mature wood.|$|E
5000|$|In the American colonies, <b>lilacs</b> were {{introduced}} in the 18th century. Peter Collinson, F.R.S., wrote to the Pennsylvania gardener and botanist John Bartram, proposing to send him some, and remarked that John Custis of Virginia had a fine [...] "collection", which Ann Leighton interpreted as signifying common and Persian <b>lilacs,</b> in both purple and white, [...] "the entire range of <b>lilacs</b> possible" [...] at the time.|$|R

Astra made late ground but could not catch <b>Lilacs</b> Luck. Mad Tanist was retired to stud after the event.|$|R
50|$|<b>Lilacs</b> {{were planted}} along the Ibar River to welcome Helen of Anjou {{to her new}} home in Serbia. Her husband planted them to remind her of her home in Provence. This area {{is now known as}} the Valley of the <b>Lilacs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with <b>lilac</b> blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that {{more than just the}} breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
5|$|Freedom Planet is a {{two-dimensional}} platform video game developed {{and published by}} independent developer GalaxyTrail. The player controls one of three anthropomorphic animal protagonists: the dragon <b>Lilac,</b> the wildcat Carol, or the basset hound Milla.

While the game focuses on fast-paced platforming, its levels are interspersed with slower action scenes.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius trivialis is a European {{species that}} is similar in {{appearance}} to L.argillaceifolius, and they are often confused for each other. L.trivialis can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to the latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich boreal and subalpine forests. Variety megacarpus may be confused with L.pallescens, a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills <b>lilac</b> rather than brown.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Lilacs</b> were a four-piece {{rock band}} from Chicago, formed in Summer 1990 by Ken Kurson, David Levinsky, Tom Whalen and John Packel.

5|$|Potassium is {{the second}} least dense metal after lithium. It is a soft solid with a low melting point, and can be easily cut with a knife. Freshly cut {{potassium}} is silvery in appearance, but it begins to tarnish toward gray immediately on exposure to air. In a flame test, potassium and its compounds emit a <b>lilac</b> color with a peak emission wavelength of 766.5 nanometers.|$|E
5|$|Species of Crepidotus {{having a}} similar shape can be {{distinguished}} by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of P.stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows <b>lilac</b> tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species may have a similar appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.|$|E
5|$|That night, Torque tells <b>Lilac,</b> Carol, and Milla {{that he is}} {{an alien}} sent to {{apprehend}} the intergalactic warlord Arktivus Brevon, whose spacecraft wrecked on the planet. Brevon has invaded Shuigang, murdered its king, and brainwashed Dail to be his servant. He intends to steal the Stone to power his ship. The protagonists decide to reclaim the Stone from Zao, but they are accosted en route by Spade and by Brevon's assistant Serpentine. The delays give Dail and Brevon's forces time to steal the relic. Afterwards, Zao sends the protagonists as emissaries to Shang Tu to discuss an alliance against Shuigang. They are detained by the Magister upon their arrival, as Neera blames them for the Stone's original disappearance. Torque is acquitted when <b>Lilac</b> falsely pleads guilty. She, Carol, and Milla quickly break out of jail to reunite with Torque, only to see him captured by Brevon and Serpentine.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of vanadium is noteworthy for {{the accessibility of}} the four adjacent oxidation states 25. In aqueous solution, vanadium forms metal aquo complexes of which the colours are <b>lilac</b> 2+, green 3+, blue 2+, yellow VO3−. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are oxidizing agents. Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives, which contain the VO2+ center.|$|E
5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it further from Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo had drawn <b>Lilac</b> as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) {{killed off}} all the elms that once {{populated}} the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the <b>lilac</b> shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are compact {{birds with}} short legs, {{compressed}} wings, and square 12-feathered tails. They have long, sturdy, pointed bills and strong toes with long claws. Nuthatches have blue-grey backs (violet-blue in some Asian species, which also have red or yellow bills) and white underparts, which are variably tinted with buff, orange, rufous or <b>lilac.</b> Although head markings vary between species, {{a long black}} eye stripe, with contrasting white supercilium, dark forehead and blackish cap is common. The sexes look similar, but may differ in underpart colouration, especially on the rear flanks and under the tail. Juveniles and first-year birds can be almost indistinguishable from adults.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina is {{a species}} of wood-decay fungus in the family Peniophoraceae. The species {{produces}} fruit bodies which vary in appearance depending on whether they are wet or dry. The wet fruit bodies are waxy and <b>lilac,</b> and attached strongly to the wood. When dry, the edges curl up and reveal the dark underside, while the surface becomes crusty and pink. P.quercina is the type species of Peniophora, and {{was moved to the}} genus upon its creation by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species is found primarily in Europe, where it can be encountered all year. Though primarily growing upon dead wood, especially oak, it is also capable of growing upon still-living wood.|$|E
