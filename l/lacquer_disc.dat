50|$|The {{advantages}} of DMM (hard surface material) over acetate lacquer cutting (soft surface material) are both sonic and practical: {{because of the}} rigidity of the master disc medium, no groove wall bounce-back effects take place after the cutting has been completed. This preserves the original modulation details in the groove walls much better, especially those involved with sudden fast attacks (transients). The improved transient response, {{as well as the}} more linear phase response of DMM improve the overall stability and depth-of-field in the stereo image. In addition, disturbing adjacent groove print-through sounds (groove echoes) are reduced in DMM. Also, {{there is no need to}} rush the finalized master disc directly into a refrigerator for groove preservation, as in conventional <b>lacquer</b> <b>disc</b> cutting, before processing the master disc to produce matrices for the pressing of the records.|$|E
50|$|In 1934, the Pyral Company in France and the Presto Recording Corporation in the United States {{independently}} {{created the}} so-called acetate disc by coating {{a layer of}} nitrocellulose lacquer onto the aluminum, which now served only as a rigid support. Engraving the groove into an easily cut and grainless lacquer, rather than indenting it into bare metal, {{made it possible to}} produce a broadcast-quality recording that preserved high-frequency detail and was nearly noiseless when new. As a result, professional recording services soon abandoned the use of bare aluminum blanks, although some amateur and novelty use persisted into the 1940s. From an archival perspective, the changeover traded long-term stability for superior sound quality. A bare aluminum disc can remain unchanged indefinitely if carefully stored, while the coating on a <b>lacquer</b> <b>disc</b> is subject to chemical deterioration, tending to shrink and become brittle due to the loss of unstable plasticizers, which can cause the lacquer to develop cracks, split off from the aluminum base disc, and in severe cases disintegrate into an unsalvageable rubble of tiny flakes.|$|E
50|$|The {{decline of}} vinyl records {{in favour of}} the compact disc, saw many Neumann VMS82 DMM lathes {{converted}} for cutting <b>lacquer</b> <b>discs</b> as few plants were able to process DMM masters and so many disc cutting facilities conformed to the industry standard - cutting on lacquer.|$|R

5000|$|Although once {{produced}} {{in a wide}} range of sizes (from less than 7 in to more than 16 in in diameter) and sometimes with glass core discs, the examples most commonly encountered today are 10 , 12 or 14 in in diameter and consist of an aluminium core disc coated with black nitrocellulose lacquer, commonly but incorrectly called [...] "acetate". The term [...] "acetate" [...] derives from the material used in examples cut before 1934, when the substrate was in fact cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate was only in use for a short while, but the name [...] "acetate" [...] for these discs persisted. Blank discs were traditionally {{produced in}} several different grades, with the best and costliest grade featuring the sturdiest core, the thickest coating and the most perfectly flawless mirror-like surfaces. These top-quality blanks were intended for cutting the master discs that, once silver-coated, would be electrodeposited with nickel in order to electroform parts used in making stampers (negative profile metal moulds) for pressing ordinary records. Lower-quality blanks were considered adequate for non-critical uses such as tests and demo discs. Lower-grade blanks were formerly made for home use by amateurs and may be very thin and flexible, may have a cardboard rather than a metal or glass base, and may have noticeably dull or slightly orange-peel-textured surfaces. In addition to the usual central spindle hole, there is traditionally at least one drive hole in the label area, meant to be engaged by a special pin that prevents the disc from slipping on the turntable during the recording process if the lathe does not have a vacuum turntable. Drive holes are often hidden by labels applied after the recording was cut, but they can usually be detected by careful inspection of the label or by holding the disc up to a light bright enough to penetrate the labels. Drive holes are no longer standard on lacquer masters, only on [...] "dubs", because the additional holes can interfere with the electroforming process and professional mastering lathes use vacuum turntables that hold the workpiece (<b>lacquer</b> <b>disc)</b> in place with suction. One pump usually provides suction for both the turntable and the chip tube that pulls away the fine string of nitrocellulose lacquer removed by the groove-cutting stylus.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, the Surry Arts Council, using a {{grant from}} the North Carolina Arts Council, began working to {{preserve}} Epperson's extensive collection of recordings, including <b>lacquered</b> <b>discs</b> and reel-to-reel tapes. The recordings had been stored in boxes, but they were moved to a climate-controlled environment. Then, after an inventory, about 1000 hours of recordings went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for cleaning and digital recording, which would allow transfer to compact discs and the Internet. The original recordings were moved to the Southern Folklife Collection.|$|R

25|$|The Mutual network, on {{the other}} hand, had {{pre-recorded}} some of its programs {{as early as the}} 1938 run of The Shadow with Orson Welles. And the new ABC network, which had been formed out of the sale of the old NBC Blue Network in 1943 following a federal anti-trust action, was willing to join Mutual in breaking the tradition. ABC offered Crosby $30,000 per week to produce a recorded show every Wednesday that would be sponsored by Philco. He would also get an additional $40,000 from 400 independent stations for the rights to broadcast the 30-minute show, which was sent to them every Monday on three 16-inch <b>lacquer</b> <b>discs</b> that played ten minutes per side at 33⅓ rpm.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Victor decided to {{demolish}} their Camden warehouse. This warehouse held four floors' worth of catalog and vault masters (most {{of them were}} pre-tape wax and metal <b>discs),</b> test pressings, <b>lacquer</b> <b>discs,</b> matrix ledgers, and rehearsal recordings. A {{few days before the}} demolition took place, some collectors from the US and Europe were allowed to go through the warehouse and salvage whatever they could carry with them for their personal collections. Soon after, collectors and RCA Records officials watched from a nearby bridge as the warehouse was demolished, with many studio masters still intact in the building. The remnants were bulldozed into the Delaware River and a pier was built on top of them. In 1973, when the company decided to release all of Rachmaninoff's recordings on LPs (to celebrate the centennial of the composer's birth), RCA was forced to go to record collectors for materials, as documented by Time.|$|R
40|$|Starting in the 1920 s {{through the}} late 1950 s, Kansas City-based {{broadcasting}} pioneer Arthur B. Church produced {{a broad range of}} syndicated radio programs including Phenomenon, The Brush Creek Follies and the Texas Rangers. The Texas Rangers were a particularly successful franchise, heard on over 100 of the 116 CBS affiliate stations. The eight-man choir played twenty different instruments between them, while garbed in western wear, topped, of course, with classic white hats. Their ability to traverse successfully between hymns, cowboy songs, novelty, and western swing demonstrates their incredible range as musicians both on their own show and on The Brush Creek Follies. Moreover, they displayed their acting skills in Night Time on the Trail and Life on Red Horse Ranch, broadcasts offering “thrills of the old west” that mixed drama, romance, comedy, and music. Skilled as they were, their formidable talents remain in relative obscurity. As part of an NEH-funded grant project, the University of Missouri [...] Kansas City University Libraries is bringing the Texas Rangers and their posse back to light! By providing bibliographic access and digital preservation to a collection of transcription <b>discs,</b> <b>lacquer</b> <b>discs,</b> and negative metal stampers that comprise the KMBC collection, radio aficionados will once again be able to delight in the antics of the Rangers.

2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed <b>lacquer</b> sound <b>disc</b> in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel to electroform a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the <b>lacquer</b> sound <b>disc</b> during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single <b>lacquer</b> sound <b>disc.</b> When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|R
5000|$|During {{the forties}} and fifties, Radio Recorders was {{responsible}} for recording countless radio shows, both network and local, for delayed broadcast, not always for California, but for many western states. Telephone lines ran to all the important stations and the networks. Studio C was the nerve center with at least six recording lathes and turntables and an [...] "on-the-air" [...] playback turntable protected by a railing {{so that it would}} not be bumped while it was playing a program onto the air. The recording lathes were shock mounted in sand to prevent rumble from the street cars on Santa Monica Boulevard. For much of that era, the recordings were made and played back on <b>lacquer</b> coated aluminum <b>discs,</b> before tape recording was introduced. The room could handle several programs at once, 24 hours a day, and quite often a single engineer on duty would have his hands full.|$|R
50|$|Microprocessors {{were added}} to cycle each press based on {{temperature}} rather than the more inaccurate cycling by time, enabling greater operator control over heat and other variables that can create inconsistencies from record to record. Operators inspect each record as it comes off the press.Other technology employed helps mitigate variations in other factors that can compromise a record’s quality, such as pressure and vibration.Uneven contact between {{the surface of the}} press die, to which is attached the stamper (the mold that creates a vinyl record), results in temperature variations. These variations introduce variations in the width and depth of individual grooves on the record. Quality Record Pressings uses a vacuum system to ensure uniform die and stamper contact. As a result, the listener’s turntable needle tracks more smoothly and provides the listener with a more faithful reproduction of the music.QRP also uses an innovative double steam valve system that reduces die temperature cycle time as well as a more finely tuned level of temperature control of the heating and cooling process. Both reduce inconsistencies from record to record in the manufacturing process.And just as ambient temperature, humidity and variations in steam and water pressure affect the quality of a vinyl record, so do the minute environmental vibrations from nearby equipment. Unwanted harmonic vibration transmitted to the die during the pressing process causes distortion of the record’s grooves and other noise as well as other unwelcome changes in the physical structure of the grooves on a record. QRP uses custom-designed press isolation pads to mitigate the effect of these vibrations.As part of its record pressing operation, QRP also operates a plating department, setting it apart from other record pressing plants that don’t have that capability. The plating department headed by Gary Salstrom is where <b>Lacquer</b> master <b>discs</b> are given metal coatings to make the metal stamper that molds the records from heated vinyl.In 2010 the acquisition of Classic Records, of Los Angeles, California, by Acoustic Sounds, was announced by Kassem and Classic Records Mike Hobson. Acoustic Sounds acquisition of Classic Records included the “Quiex SV-P” vinyl formulation/process, “Clarity Vinyl”, the unique 200-gram “flat profile” tooling and all other aspects of Classic’s proprietary vinyl pressing technology.|$|R

Pre-recorded sound effects on The Goon Show, played into each performance by 'Grams Operators', were taken from <b>disc</b> <b>lacquers</b> and shellac.

Church, the broadcasting pioneer responsible for several syndicated radio shows including The Texas Rangers, Phenomenon, and Brush Creek Follies. The sound recordings in the collection are {{a treasure trove of}} local and national history from the late 1930 s through the 1940 s, revealing the American experience during wartime through news broadcasts, political speeches, musical entertainment, rural comedies, and radio soap operas. Coupled with the sound recordings were a large number of stampers [...] metal plates used to press or “stamp” grooves onto plastic to produce vinyl records. These manufacturing parts contain a wealth of musical performances by the Texas Rangers, Tex Owens, Bonnie King, Tune Chasers, and Harry Jenks that had been hidden in our collection, and possibly others. We determined that in order to transfer the audio from these metal stampers, a special stylus would need to be acquired. As these particular styli are difficult to manufacture, we found ourselves in a “waiting game. ” With the impending deadline arose a new concern: How do we discover and provide access to content from these obsolete metal plates? In this poster, we demonstrate the multi-faceted process used to leverage existing resources and acquire additional materials in the most cost-effective way in order to preserve and reveal the hidden contents of an obsolete format. We present the issues, outcomes, and unexpected discoveries that led us to successfully identify and provide access to the recordings in the KMBC Radio Collection...|$|R
5000|$|As {{the supply}} of {{previously}} unheard tunes in the jump blues and more traditional R&B genre began to dry up in the late 1950s, Jamaican producers began recording {{their own version of}} the genres with local artists. [...] These recordings were initially made to be played on [...] "Soft Wax" [...] (a <b>lacquer</b> on metal <b>disc</b> acetate later to become known as a [...] "Dub Plate"), but as demand for them grew eventually some time {{in the second half of}} 1959 (Believed by most to be in the last quarter) producers such as Coxsone Dodd and Duke Reid began to issue these recording on 45rpm, 7-inch discs. At this point the style was a direct copy of the American [...] "Shuffle Blues" [...] style, but within two or three years this had morphed into the more familiar Ska style with the off beat guitar chop that could be heard in some of the more uptempo late 1950s American Rhythm and Blues recordings such as Fats Domino's [...] "Be My Guest" [...] (a hugely popular record on Jamaican Sound Systems of the late 1950s). This [...] "classic" [...] Ska style was of bars made up of four triplets but was characterized by a guitar chop on the off beat — known as an upstroke or skank — with horns taking the lead and often following the off beat skank and piano emphasizing the bass line and, again, playing the skank. Drums kept 4/4 time and the bass drum was accented on the third beat of each 4-triplet phrase. The snare would play side stick and accent the third beat of each 4-triplet phrase. The upstroke sound can also be found in other Caribbean forms of music, such as mento and calypso.|$|R
