5|$|Bart and Lisa excitedly {{discuss their}} visit to Kamp Krusty, {{a summer camp}} run by Krusty the Clown. Homer has made Bart's visit {{conditional}} on him getting at least a C- average on his report card. Bart receives a D- in each subject from Ms. Krabappel, so he changes each grade into straight A+. Homer chides Bart for not faking plausible grades, but <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> go to camp anyway, {{because he does not}} want Bart hanging around throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|In , {{although}} Kenshin and Kaoru {{are married}} he begins wandering again because {{he needs to}} help others; he returns every couple of years. Kaoru <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> go, promising to welcome him home {{with a smile and}} their child. Kenshin develops a mysterious disease, and Kaoru convinces him to transmit it to her. He leaves to help people in the First Sino-Japanese War, as he had promised the Meiji government. When he returns to Japan, Kenshin collapses in Kaoru's arms and dies.|$|E
5|$|Kurt {{has been}} {{receiving}} valentines and gifts all week from a secret admirer {{that he believes}} to be Blaine (Darren Criss), who is still home recovering from eye surgery. He arrives at Sugar's party early to discover his admirer is actually former bully Karofsky (Max Adler), who declares his love for Kurt. Kurt <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> down gently, but their parting words are overheard by a classmate of Karofsky's, and Karofsky flees.|$|E

5|$|At the Asekoff residence, Bo becomes {{upset and}} begins barking. Mrs. Asekoff <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> outside {{but when she}} {{attempts}} to retrieve him, the dog refuses to budge. She turns to go back inside but discovers {{that it has been}} bolted from the inside. Louis hears his mother's screams and climbs out of bed, but a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes corners him.

5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where it is. Indeed, the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E
5|$|Principal Skinner has put Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, {{he finds}} an Aramaic inscription. Lisa uses an app to {{translate}} it which transports the pair to Hell, {{which is a}} school. Bart excels {{in all of his}} diabolical subjects (including torture, destruction, and making sure that Major League Baseball rules ensure the unending dominance of the New York Yankees) and asks his parents if he can study there permanently. For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer <b>lets</b> <b>him.</b> A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as valedictorian.|$|E

6000|$|Baman, {{the second}} suitor, tied up {{a bundle of}} his beloved one's ashes, and followed--somewhat prematurely--the precepts of the great lawgiver Manu. [...] "When {{the father of a}} family {{perceives}} his muscles becoming flaccid, and his hair grey, and sees the child of his child, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> then take refuge in a forest. <b>Let</b> <b>him</b> take up his consecrated fire and all his domestic implements for making oblations to it, and, departing from the town to the lonely wood, <b>let</b> <b>him</b> dwell in it with complete power over his organs of sense and of action.

5|$|Saruman {{makes his}} final {{appearance}} {{at the end of}} the last volume, The Return of the King (1955), after Sauron's defeat. After persuading the Ents to release him from Orthanc, he travels north on foot, apparently reduced to begging. He is accompanied by Wormtongue, whom he beats and curses. When they reach the Shire, Saruman's agents—both Hobbits and Men—have already taken it over and started a destructive process of industrialization. Saruman governs the Shire in secret under the name of Sharkey until the events of chapter 8 ("The Scouring of the Shire") in which Frodo and his companions return and lead a rebellion, defeating the intruders and exposing Saruman's role. Even after Saruman attempts to stab Frodo, Frodo <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> go. When Saruman blames Wormtongue for the damage done to the Shire and curses him, Wormtongue finally snaps and slits his master's throat.|$|E
5|$|Suzy gets {{a job at}} {{a burger}} joint, and moves into an {{abandoned}} boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides {{something has to be done}} ("Thinkin' "). He is unable to come up with an answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E
5|$|The next day, Alan {{discovers that}} his license has {{arrived in the}} mail. Ecstatic, he wishes to drive immediately, asking his family members if they need help with any errands. Later, Hal {{shows up at the}} Dixon home. Knowing that Alan's license had been {{scheduled}} to arrive, he begins to talk to Alan, telling him about things he should know {{in order to be able}} to drive safely. As he finishes giving the advice, Frank Jr. and Betty return home. Alan asks his father if he can drive the car into town.

5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out of pity, not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> win the contest.|$|E

Kyle and Star are subsequently abducted and taken prisoner by Skynet. Later, two Resistance A-10 airplanes are shot down while trying to intercept a machine transport. Wright locates downed pilot Blair Williams (Bloodgood). They then {{make their way to}} John's base, where thereafter, Marcus is wounded by a magnetic land mine. Attempting to save his life, the Resistance fighters discover that Marcus is indeed a cyborg, with a mechanical endoskeleton and a partially artificial cerebral cortex. Although Marcus believes himself to be human, John and his wife Kate think that Marcus has been sent to execute him and orders him to be killed. Blair helps Marcus escape. During the pursuit, Marcus saves John's life from Skynet's hydrobots and the two make a bargain; Marcus will enter Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco, to help John rescue Kyle and the other prisoners, if he <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> live.|$|E
5|$|Before doing so, Marty travels up to Travers' {{house to}} try to {{convince}} Travers to allow him to keep Shiloh. Judd does not see Marty approaching, and shoots a doe out of season, which would mean a stiff fine Judd cannot afford. Marty lets Judd know he knows, and attempts to blackmail him out of Shiloh. Judd and Marty eventually negotiate a deal in which Marty will earn Shiloh for 40 dollars, paid with 20 hours of working for Judd. At {{the end of the first}} week, Judd says that he will not keep his end of the deal because the evidence of the dead doe has with the passage of time disappeared. Second, the contract that Marty had him sign is worthless in the state of West Virginia without the signature of a witness. Despite Judd's pointed disapproval of his work, Marty continues to work for him. They begin discussing dogs and Judd's father who began physically abusing Judd when he was four years old. In the end, Judd warms to Marty, relents, and <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> keep Shiloh.|$|E

Crosetti (Jon Polito) gets agitated when his daughter calls and wants her boyfriend to sleep over. Gee comforts Crosetti and <b>lets</b> <b>him</b> go home to take care of her.

Both of the McBrides have a fondness for cats and have adopted two, Cleopawtra and Nepurrtiti (named after Cleopatra and Nefertiti, two Egyptian queens). Their surname is ironic because a bride is a newlywed woman, but they are two married men.|$|E
