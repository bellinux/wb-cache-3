5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby participants could make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hill led {{the rest}} of the battalion, {{approximately}} 525 strong, in some commandeered trucks towards the town of Béja, an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield. The battalion arrived at approximately 18:00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison, 3,000 strong, which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did, Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times, wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time. A short time after the battalion entered Béja, German aircraft arrived and bombed the town, although they caused little damage and no casualties. The next day, 'S' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N'Sir, about twenty miles away; they were to contact the local French forces, believed to be proBritish, and harass German forces. The detachment found the village and made contact with the French, who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur; by nightfall the force had not reached the town, and decided to encamp for the night. At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment, and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned, with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions. When the convoy returned at approximately 10:00 the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> struck a mine and exploded, blocking the road, and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire, Gammon bombs and the remaining antitank mines. A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner, with two paratroopers being slightly wounded. The detachment returned to Béja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars. After the success of the ambush, Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces, but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties; Béja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers, inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses.|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} part of future collision avoidance systems {{is to be able}} to predict road curvature. This can be based on vision data, but the lateral movement of <b>leading</b> <b>vehicles</b> can also be used to support road geometry estimation. This paper presents a method for detecting lane departures, including lane changes, of <b>leading</b> <b>vehicles.</b> This information is used to adapt the dynamic models used in the estimation algorithm in order to accommodate for the fact that a lane departure is in progress.

40|$|An {{important}} part of any {{advanced driver assistance system}} is road geometry estimation. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian estimation algorithm using lane marking measurements received from a camera and measurements of the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicles</b> received from a radar-camera fusion system, to estimate the road up to 200 meters ahead in highway scenarios. The filtering algorithm uses a segmented clothoid-based road model. In order to use the heading of <b>leading</b> <b>vehicles</b> we need to detect if each vehicle is keeping lane or changing lane. Hence, we propose to jointly detect the motion state of the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicles</b> and estimate the road geometry using a multiple model filter. Finally the proposed algorithm is compared to an existing method using real data collected from highways. The results indicate that it provides a more accurate road estimation in some scenarios...|$|R

25|$|Discs {{are usually}} damaged {{in one of}} four ways: scarring, cracking, warping or {{excessive}} rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where {{the cost of a}} new disc may actually be lower than the cost of labour to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached manufacturer's minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> manufacturers recommend brake disc skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues and brake noises. The machining process is performed in a brake lathe, which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximise the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to {{standardise}} on a colour which became known as Rail Blue. Introduced in 1965, and also known as [...] "Monastral Blue", the colour was defined by British Standards BR28/6001 (Airless spray finish) and BR28/5321 (Brush finish). [...] It was a dark, greyish blue tone which hid the effects of dirt well. The colour often appears inaccurately in photographs, generally appearing brighter and bluer than the real colour. In the early years the colour faded quite badly, becoming lighter and paler with time although this problem had been overcome by the late 1970s. United Kingdom paint code RAL5020 ("Ocean Blue") is a good match to Rail Blue. There is also a British Standard paint colour BS381C 114 called Rail Blue which was introduced in 1964. The new British Rail [...] "double arrow" [...] symbol on locomotives (or <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> as was the case on multiple unit stock) and the vehicle number and other ancillary markings written in the Rail Alphabet typeface were other integral parts of the livery.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the line}} opened, {{there were two}} Fell brake vans in service, each [...] long and [...] from floor to ceiling, with open {{platforms}} at either end. [...] The wear on the brake blocks fitted to these vans was so severe that a set of blocks seldom lasted more than one trip down the incline. [...] Like the positioning and loading of the locomotives, the arrangements for positioning of the Fell vans varied until they were largely standardised by 1897. [...] For ascending trains, Fell vans were placed {{at the rear of}} the train. [...] For descending trains, a Fell van was placed between the locomotives and the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle.</b> [...] If the gross weight of the train exceeded 120 tons or included more than 15 vehicles (excluding the locomotives in both cases) a second Fell van was attached to the rear of the train. [...] These rules applied before the introduction of the Westinghouse continuous air brake. The Fell locomotives were never turned, running cab first on descending trains.|$|E
2500|$|... 2 May 1954. A train {{driven by}} Bob Hobbs and hauled by {{locomotive}} No 5 Hercules was derailed at half mile curve, between New Romney and Greatstone. The {{cause of the}} incident was severe gale-force wind. The train was the 14.50 from Hythe to Dungeness, and the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> (behind the engine) was a light guard's van, of a type nicknamed [...] "jumping jacks", as their relatively light weight made for an uncomfortable ride for the guard. In the severe weather, as the train passed over the exposed embankment of half mile curve, the jumping jack guard's van was blown over, and smashed on the embankment. Fortunately the guard, Mavis Thomas, had decided to ride in another coach, and so avoided injury. As the van turned over in the wind, it also tipped the locomotive's high-sided tender, which in turn tipped the locomotive which ended on its side down the embankment. The engine driver, Bob Hobbs, who was a highly experienced driver, had been alerted to {{the sequence of events}} by noises behind him, and was able to jump from the footplate, sustaining only cuts and grazes. All [...] "jumping jack" [...] guard's vans on the railway were withdrawn from service and scrapped.|$|E

The train was an empty coaching stock (ECS) working which had earlier operated the daily school service for pupils returning home from New Romney. The locomotive was propelling from the rear, and the <b>leading</b> <b>vehicle</b> was Driving Van Trailer (DVT) No 105. The transit van and the railway DVT both fell into the dyke beside the road. The van driver was uninjured. The Guard, Simon Oldfield, who was travelling in the DVT, was briefly trapped under water, but was able to free himself and swim to safety. The DVT was heavily damaged {{and had to be}} completely rebuilt. During this rebuild it was adapted to become the railway's first wheelchair accessible coach. Two other passenger coaches, 804 and 807, were also seriously damaged in the incident. The van driver admitted fault but claimed that his brakes had failed. The subsequent police investigation revealed that the brakes had operated correctly, but that the van driver had vainly hoped to beat the train to the crossing. Police also found that the van's tyres were bald, and that it had no current road tax. A large crane recovered both vehicles from the water.|$|E
