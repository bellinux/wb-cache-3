40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simple "Rule of Thumb" (ROT) method {{to estimate the}} <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of foil air journal bearings, which are self-acting compliant-surface hydrodynamic bearings being considered for Oil-Free turbo-machinery applications such as gas turbine engines. The ROT is based on first principles and data available in the literature and it relates bearing <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> to the bearing size and speed through an empirically based <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient, D. It is shown that <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is a linear function of bearing surface velocity and bearing projected area. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient, D, is related to the design features of the bearing compliant members and operating conditions (speed and ambient temperature). Early bearing designs with basic or "first generation" compliant support elements have relatively low <b>load</b> <b>capacity.</b> More advanced bearings, in which the compliance of the support structure is tailored, have <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> up to five times those of simpler designs.

40|$|This {{investigation}} elucidates the <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> {{of wooden}} shores and adjustable steel tube shores that {{are commonly used}} in construction. A series of loading tests was performed based on actual setups used on construction sites. Research results reveal that the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of an isolated wooden or an adjustable steel tube shore declines as its length increases, and the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of adjustable steel tube shores greatly exceeds that of wooden shores of the same length in isolated and multi-post shoring systems. A wooden shore fails by buckling under compression load. The failure of an adjustable steel tube shore in tests is due to buckling when the shore length exceeds 3. 96 m, and the failure will be resulted from damage of connecting tube lock if the shore length is less than 3. 96 m. When the top block of the adjustable steel tube shore is a wooden stringer, the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is remarkably less than when it is a steel block. Adjustable steel tube shores will be reduced in <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> after reuses. The <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of an isolated shore is reduced when the shore is placed on an inclined base. Reinforcing an isolated wooden shore with horizontal wooden bars and iron wires increases its <b>load</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, when an isolated wooden shore is reinforced with lateral cable bracings, the <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is not affected.

40|$|Ball screw {{mechanisms}} (BSM) {{and planetary}} roller screw mechanisms (PRSM) belong to promising energy-saving mechanisms converting rotary motion into linear motion. To calculate and design these mechanisms the static and dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> are used. In case a standard {{size of the}} mechanism to be designed is available in manufacturer’s catalog, the specified <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> can be taken from the catalog, and if not, then the static load for the mechanism being designed can be calculated. To determine the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity,</b> long-term and costly experimental studies are to be conducted. Therefore, the crucial task is to forecast the BSM and PRSM dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> and, further, the service life of these mechanisms. As follows from the analysis of information provided in manufacturers’ catalogs, there were established correlative relationships of static and dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacities</b> for BSM and PRSM with the parameters determining their standard sizes. Using these relationships and methods of power regression enable us to obtain empirical dependences linking the factor equal to the ratio of static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> to dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> with parameters defining standard sizes of the mechanisms. To predict BSM and PRSM service lives the said ratio is calculated using the empirical dependence, static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> of the mechanism being designed is determined by means of calculation using known procedures, and then dynamic <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> is determined as the quotient of static <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> division by the said factor.

Two Generation III foil air bearings with the same design but possessing different initial radial clearances were tested at room temperature against an as-ground PS 304 coated journal operating at 30, 000 rpm. Increases in radial clearance were accomplished by reducing the journal's outside diameter via an in-place grinding system. From each <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> test the bearing <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient was calculated from the rule-of-thumb (ROT) model developed for foil air bearings. The test results indicate that, {{in terms of the}} <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient, radial clearance has a direct impact on the performance of the foil air bearing. Each test bearing exhibited an optimum radial clearance that resulted in a maximum <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient. Relative to this optimum value are two separate operating regimes that are governed by different modes of failure. Bearings operating with radial clearances less than the optimum exhibit <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficients that are a strong function of radial clearance and are prone to a thermal runaway failure mechanism and bearing seizure. Conversely, a bearing operating with a radial clearance twice the optimum suffered only a 20 percent decline in its maximum <b>load</b> <b>capacity</b> coefficient and did not experience any thermal management problems.
