[...] Hillenburg drew Squidward with six tentacles because [...] "it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight". Show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get a whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it's always like, 'OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?' Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, [...] "it always looks like he's pooping his pants".

500|$|At {{the scene}} of the crime, the pair deduce Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the {{microwave}} not suitable for those with a pacemaker, and read at the magazine rack. They go to Sideshow Bob with the intention of finding if Krusty had any enemies, but are given tickets to his show. At the live broadcast, Bart is invited up on stage with Sideshow Bob, where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine, which Sideshow Bob dismisses. When Sideshow Bob says he has [...] "a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> shoes to fill", Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber's foot, causing him to scream in pain. Bart realizes that despite wearing clown shoes all the time, Krusty never would have felt Homer stepping on them due to his small feet. Bart then deduces that Sideshow Bob is the real robber, since he had the most to gain through Krusty's downfall and has large feet. To prove his theory, he hits the end of Sideshow Bob's shoe with a mallet, causing Sideshow Bob to scream in pain and exposing him as the robber to the public. The police, having watched the show, realize they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and head down to the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob.|$|E

He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and [...] "a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as [...] "the only compelling scene in the whole episode". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining [...] "A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on-island plot." [...] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing [...] "it felt appropriate for Losts third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others {{was a big part}} of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin have had a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> issues in their marriage' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point." ...|$|E

In an interview with People, she revealed that she has no plans on getting into acting, and even calls herself an [...] "awful actor" [...] and admits that she cannot memorize lines. However, she enjoyed recording for this episode and hired an acting coach to help her get through the lines. Even though she enjoyed the experience, she said that [...] " [...] not really something I'm interested in." [...] She {{had to do a}} lot of research before recording, because [...] "there were a lot of facts and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> words" [...] and she [...] "had to say it as if it was coming to [...] very easily."

[...] He ultimately praised her performance, calling it [...] "surprisingly fantastic", and said: [...] "She came in, and she'd prepared before she even arrived. She hired an acting coach, with her own money, and she nailed it. She never once complained, and it was a long session. There was a lot of dialog. Her stamina was astonishing." ...|$|E

Ted Cox of the Daily Herald called the entry [...] "creepy" [...] and [...] "visually captivating", particularly praising the installment's [...] "use {{of light and}} dark symbolism". Ultimately, he noted that [...] "it's good to once again see Mulder and Scully temporarily set free from the show's overarching conspiracy." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 5 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "there were a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big,</b> big things going on in this ep , starting with Millenniums ace profiler Frank Black [...] reluctantly helping Mulder and Scully solve the apparent suicides of four FBI agents." [...] Rosell ultimately concluded that the reason the episode was a success was due to Mulder and Scully's kiss, a moment he called [...] "inevitable" [...] although he did note that [...] "many think [...] really signaled the beginning of the end." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files gave the episode a positive review and called it [...] "highly entertaining" [...] and [...] "cause for celebration". He noted that, while he had never seen an episode of Millennium, the series mythology and story-arcs [...] "integrated seamlessly into this episode" [...] in a way that non-Millennium fans could still enjoy it. John Drake of Xposé considered the episode [...] "excellent" [...] and rated it 5 stars out of 5. Drake commended Lance Henriksen's performance, saying that [...] "not only provides continuity with Millennium, but adds a new dimension as Frank tries to leave the wreckage of his professional life behind". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B". He called the entry [...] "tired" [...] and wrote that it was [...] "both too ambitious and not epic enough" [...] to bring closure to Millennium. Furthermore, he felt that the story's basic plot was too confusing and almost laughable. Despite this, he enjoyed Johnson's role as the villain, calling him [...] "interesting", and he wrote that the scene with Mulder and Black in the cellar was [...] "kind of cool" [...] because of the [...] "creepy zombie sequences".|$|E

And that causes us to look at our infrastructure,” said Jackson. “A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> projects are on the table again, and it kind of suggests a Moses era without Moses," [...] he added. Politicians are also reconsidering the Moses legacy; in a 2006 speech to the Regional Plan Association on downstate transportation needs, New York governor-elect Eliot Spitzer stated a biography of Moses written today might be called At Least He Got It Built: [...] "That's what we need today.

And just kooky enough to become a cult classic like the movie it’s loosely based on". Josh Duboff from Vanity Fair described the video as [...] "entertaining and kind of weird. There’s a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> hair; Spears does some endearing waving (and generally seems to be having a good time)". He concluded, [...] "Our favorite part is actually probably the tag at the end, where Spears and Azalea are just goofing around in the car; you can imagine Spears turning to Azalea afterwards and squealing, [...] "That was really cool, I had so much fun," [...] and meaning it". Kirthana Ramisetti for New York Daily News similarly noted, [...] "The two music stars seemed to have a lot of fun filming their video".|$|E

While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred {{to be on the}} stage with the actors instead of [...] "behind glass" [...] in a control room, which he describes as [...] "the norm" [...] while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, Rocko's Modern Life [...] "skewed kind of older". Murray noted, [...] "There's a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>big</b> kids out there. People went to see 'Roger Rabbit' and saw all these characters they'd grown up with and said, 'Yeah, why don't they have something like that anymore?'" [...] When he began producing Rocko, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was [...] "driving me crazy". This led him to allow for other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko's Modern Life production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg's first job in the animation business as a director.|$|E
