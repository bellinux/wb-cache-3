500|$|Big Star {{returned}} in 1993 {{with a new}} line-up when guitarist Jon Auer and bassist Ken Stringfellow joined Chilton and Stephens. Auer and Stringfellow remained members of the Posies, founded by the pair in 1986. Stringfellow is also known for his work with R.E.M. and the Minus 5. Hummel elected not to participate. [...] First-era material dominated Big Star's performances, with the occasional addition of a song from the 2005 album In Space; Stringfellow recalled that during the 1990s, [...] "We were working out the set list {{and we went to}} this little cafe. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know we'd be playing that set for the next ten years". The resurrected band made its debut at the 1993 University of Missouri spring music festival. A recording of the performance was issued on CD by Zoo Records as Columbia: Live at Missouri University. The concert was followed by tours of Europe and Japan, as well as an appearance on The Tonight Show.|$|E
2500|$|The famous Old English riddle Ic wæs be Sonde {{describes}} a conch: [...] "I was by sound, near seawall, at ocean-stream; I dwelt {{alone in my}} first resting place... <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know that I, ere or since, ever should speak mouthless over mead-benches." [...] Another meaning given to this riddle [...] "Ic wæs be Sonde" [...] is that {{the sound of the}} conch corresponds to spiritualised sound as heard in higher realms. In the Hindu tradition, the conch shell is used in ceremony as the sound it makes is said to correspond with higher frequency universal sounds associated with music of the spheres.|$|E

Alderman was hit {{in the back of the}} head by a member of the crowd, Gary Donnison. Alderman recalled, [...] "he ran off, and I could see that there were no police in the {{vicinity}} so I attempted to apprehend him." [...] Alderman charged at Donnison and tackled him to the ground but fell on his shoulder and injured himself. [...] "I can't remember a lot of how I fell ... but I was immediately aware I was injured ... it was very painful indeed," [...] Alderman said. [...] "At the time I thought it would just pop back in - <b>little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know that it would be a year before I could bowl in a competitive match again," [...] he said. [...] "I had to learn to swim a mile a day for eight months. What is tough in sport, is that if you have a physical injury or problem, no one wants to know you. In a way, when I came back, it was like starting another career." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "At 12 noon on the {{eleventh}} {{day of the}} Fifth Month, my train from Hangchow arrived at the North Station Shanghai. In order to go quickly to the bank to send the money, I left my luggage at the depository and carried only a small bag with me. As soon as I {{came out of the}} train station, I saw a rather luxurious automobile and four Westerners standing by it. I did not realize that they were French, because in Shanghai there was a great mixture of Westerners and there were swarms of foreign visitors. It was quite common for cars to be used to pick up hotel guests. <b>Little</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know that this car was there to kidnap someone! When I had gone a few steps from the station, one of the Westerners {{came up to me and}} said in Mandarin: 'This car is very nice; please get in.' I politely refused, saying 'I do not need a car.' Suddenly, one of the Westerners behind the car with a great heave pushed me inside it, the engine accelerated and we were off like a shot. In no time we had already entered the French Concession. The car drew up to the waterfront, where a French warship was docked. I now became a prisoner on this warship." ...|$|E
