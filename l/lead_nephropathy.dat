40|$|Summary: Renal tubular {{reabsorption}} and secretion of urate have been separately assessed {{in patients with}} <b>lead</b> <b>nephropathy</b> by observation of the effect on renal disposition of urate of the drug pyrazinamide, which blocks active tubular secretion of urate. Tubular reabsorption of urate {{was found to be}} greater than expected for the degree of renal failure as reflected by the inulin clearance, whereas active tubular secretion of urate was within the range predicted from the plasma urate concentration. As the hypewricaemia of <b>lead</b> <b>nephropathy</b> {{has been shown to be}} renal in origin, these results suggest that it is mediated by excessive {{tubular reabsorption}} of urate. Though defective tubular secretion of urate has not been demonstrated, more extensive studies over a wide range of plasma urate concentrations would be needed to exclude an additional associated abnormality of the secretory process.

40|$|Environmental and {{industrial}} lead exposures continue to pose major public health problems {{in children and}} in adults. Acute exposure to high concentrations of lead can result in proximal tubular damage with characteristic histologic features and manifested by glycosuria and aminoaciduria. Chronic occupational exposure to lead, or consumption of illicit alcohol adulterated with lead, has also been linked to {{a high incidence of}} renal dysfunction, which is characterized by glomerular and tubulointerstitial changes resulting in chronic renal failure, hypertension, hyperuricemia, and gout. A high incidence of nephropathy was reported during {{the early part of this}} century from Queensland, Australia, in persons with a history of childhood lead poisoning. No such sequela has been found in studies of three cohorts of lead-poisoned children from the United States. Studies in individuals with low-level lead exposure have shown a correlation between blood lead levels and serum creatinine or creatinine clearance. Chronic low-level exposure to lead is also associated with increased urinary excretion of low molecular weight proteins and lysosomal enzymes.

40|$|Renal {{function}} 17 to 23 {{years after}} chelation therapy for childhood plumbism. An elegant retrospective description of {{an epidemic of}} chronic renal failure occurring in patients with histories of untreated childhood lead poisoning in Queensland, Australia established beyond reasonable doubt the existence of <b>lead</b> <b>nephropathy.</b> However, a retrospective uncontrolled report from Boston in 1963 refuted the claim that there are serious renal consequences of untreated childhood lead poisoning. We conducted a controlled prospective, longitudinal study {{to examine the effects}} of childhood lead poisoning on renal function 17 to 23 years after chelation therapy. The present study reports the results of renal functional tests in a unique cohort of study subjects (N = 62) with significant lead poisoning (initial PbB > 100 µg/dl) diagnosed and treated between 1966 and 1972 and their age-matched control siblings (N = 19; initial PbB < 40 µg/dl). During the past nine years serial determinations of renal function on all study subjects and control siblings were obtained. Mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, serum creatinine, serum β 2 -microglobulin, fractional excretion β 2 -microglobulin, urinary protein:creatinine ratio, serum phosphate, tubular reabsorption of phosphate, serum uric acid, and urinary specific gravity were similar in study subjects compared with sibling controls. The frequency of abnormal values for these tests was similar in the two groups. Multiple linear regression analyses failed to demonstrate a significant influence of the presence of plumbism or initial PbB on serum creatinine or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. A modest increase in serum creatinine values was observed over a nine year period in four of 62 study subjects (1. 4, 1. 4, 1. 5, 1. 6 mg/dl). There were no statistical differences in either renal function or blood pressure between study subjects and control siblings.

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} is {{a life-threatening}} disease associated with diabetes mellitus. Longstanding hyperglycemia induces pathological reactions of glomerular mesangial cells, such as overproduction of extracellular matrix, which finally <b>lead</b> to <b>nephropathy.</b> However, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis {{have not been}} completely elucidated. Using the Streptozotocin-induced model of diabetes, we report that mice deficient in the growth factor midkine (Mdk−/−) exhibited strikingly milder nephropathy than Mdk+/+ mice, even though both mice showed similar extents of hyperglycemia after Streptozotocin injection. Midkine expression was induced in the glomerular mesangium of Mdk+/+ mice with diabetic nephropathy and in primary cultured mesangial cells exposed to high glucose. Mdk−/− mesangial cells exhibited reduced phosphorylation of protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated kinase as well as reduced production of transforming growth factor-β 1 on high glucose loading. Addition of exogenous midkine restored extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in Mdk−/− cells under high glucose conditions, whereas a midkine antisense oligodeoxynucleotide suppressed midkine in Mdk+/+ cells. Therefore, this study identifies midkine as a key molecule in diabetic nephropathy and suggests that midkine accelerates the intracellular signaling network evoked by hyperglycemia in nephropathy...|$|R

This study followed {{the progression of}} <b>lead</b> <b>nephropathy</b> in male Sprague-Dawley rats (E) administered lead acetate (0. 5 %) continuously in drinking water for periods ranging from 1 to 12 months. Control animals (C) were pair-fed. Observations included renal pathology by light and electron microscopy, wet and dry kidney weights, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to assess renal function. Urinary excretion of lead, the enzymes N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and brush border antigens (BB 50, CG 9, and HF 5) were utilized to explore possible markers of kidney injury. GFR was increased significantly {{after three months of}} lead exposure, but was decreased significantly after 12 months. Kidney wet weights were significantly greater in E than C from three months on. Kidney dry weight/wet weight ratio was constant up to three months, but decreased in E at 12 months. Glomerular diameters were normal at all time periods; the nephromegaly was related primarily to hypertrophy of proximal tubules. Lead inclusion bodies were found in nuclei of proximal convoluted tubules and pars recta at all times. Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis first appeared at six months, and increased in severity thereafter. Brush borders of proximal tubules were disrupted at one and three months, but recovered thereafter. Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis was observed in 2 of 10 rats at 12 months. Arteries and arterioles remained normal at all time periods. Urinary NAG was elevated in E above C after three months of lead exposure. However, urinary NAG in C also increased with age, obscuring changes in the 12 month E rats. GST was elevated after three months of lead administration in E, not without an attendant age-related increase in C rats. In three-month E rats, urinary brush border antigens were increased above C, but were decreased at six and 12 months, correlating with the morphologic changes in brush border. We conclude that a high dose of lead in rats may initially stimulate both renal cortical hypertrophy and an increase in GFR. Later, the adverse effects of lead on the tubulointerstitium predominate, and GFR falls. The urinary marker, NAG, was abnormal {{in the early stages of}} the disease, but age-related changes obscured its utility at later stages; urinary GST appeared to be a more consistent marker of injury...|$|E
40|$|In this mini review, {{we would}} like to {{challenge}} the well-established ‘fact’ that lead exposure causes chronic renal failure (CRF).

Knockout of SGK 1 significantly suppressed obstruction-induced EMT, kidney fibrosis, increased glycogen synthase kinase- 3 β activity, and decreased accumulation of the transcriptional repressor Snail. This caused a reduced expression of the mesenchymal marker α-smooth muscle actin, and collagen deposition in this model. In cultured kidney epithelial cells, mechanical stretch or treatment with transforming growth factor-β not only stimulated the transcription of SGK 1, but also stimulated EMT in an SGK 1 -dependent manner. Activated SGK 1 stimulated Snail accumulation and downregulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin.

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) {{represents}} a major global public health concern. Efforts to prevent and/or slow progression of CKD are essential. <b>Lead</b> <b>nephropathy,</b> characterized by chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, {{is a well-known}} risk of chronic, high-level lead exposure. However, in recent years, lead exposure has declined sharply, particularly in developed countries. We reviewed epidemiologic research in general, occupational, and patient populations to assess whether lead, at current exposure levels, still contributes to nephrotoxicity. Other pertinent topics, such as risk in children, genetic susceptibility, and coexposure to cadmium, are also considered. The data reviewed indicate that lead contributes to nephrotoxicity, even at blood lead levels below 5 μg/dl. This is particularly true in susceptible populations, such as those with hypertension (HTN), diabetes, and/or CKD. Low socioeconomic status is {{a risk factor for}} both lead exposure and diseases that increase susceptibility. Future public health risk for lead-related nephrotoxicity may be most significant in those rapidly developing countries where risk factors for CKD, including obesity and secondary HTN and diabetes mellitus, are increasing more rapidly than lead exposure is declining. Global efforts to reduce lead exposure remain important. Research is also needed to determine whether specific therapies, such as chelation, are beneficial in susceptible populations...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{established}} urinary {{markers of}} kidney integrity the early renal effects of lead have previously been {{considered to be}} mainly tubular or tubulointersti-tial. In a cross-sectional study on 81 male lead-exposed workers and 45 age-matched controls (median blood lead concentrations 2. 03 and 0. 34 umol/ 1 respectively) not only well-established but also new urinary markers of renal integrity preferentially or exclusively located along the different nephron segments were analysed. Markers related to the glomerulus were 6 -keto-prostaglandin^, thromboxane B 2, mainly produced in the glomerulus, and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Markers of the proximal tubule were the brush-border antigens BBA, BB 50, and HF 5 and the intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Prostaglandin E 2 and F ^, preferentially synthesized in the collecting duct and medullary interstitial cells, served as markers of these more distal nephron segments. In contrast to previous studies on the early phase of lead nephrotoxic-ity, not only tubular but also glomerular involvement could be shown in the study presented here by increases in the median values of 6 -keto-prostaglandinla and decreases in fibronectin. The proximal tubular markers intestinal alkaline phosphatase and BBA confirmed that this particular segment of the nephron is affected by lead. Effects on the collecting tubule or medullary interstitial cells could also be observed. It is concluded that lead affects both the glomerulus and the tubular apparatus and that combinations of new and estab-lished markers could be valuable for a better definition and early detection of <b>lead</b> <b>nephropathy.</b> Key words: eicosanoids; fibronectin; glomerulus; lead nephropathy; tubular apparatus; tubular antigen...|$|E

Methods: A cross-sectional study of 190 adults with occupational lead exposure and 80 adults (comparison group), matched for age and sex was performed in Port Harcourt, South-south Nigeria. Blood lead was used as the biomarker of lead exposure while serum urea, serum creatinine, urine albumin (using urine albumin:creatinine ratio), estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and serum uric acid were the renal function indices measured. Results: Occupationally lead-exposed subjects had a significantly (p = 0. 008) higher mean±SD blood lead levels (50. 37 ± 24. 58 μg/dL) than the comparison group (41. 40 ± 26. 85).

A number of laboratories, including ours, have been using genetically engineered and spontaneously occurring mouse models to study the primary causes and the pathogenesis of urinary tract obstruction. These studies have shown that urinary tract obstruction is a very heterogeneous disease that can be caused by a diverse set of factors targeting multiple levels of the urinary system. Accumulating evidence also indicates that the development of the urinary tract requires the integration of progenitor cells of diverse embryonic origins, leading to the formation of multiple junctions prone to developmental errors. In addition, the high sensitivity of the pyeloureteral peristaltic machinery to disturbance affecting the structural or functional integrity of its components also contributes to the high incidence rate of urinary tract obstruction...|$|R
40|$|BK virus, {{a member}} of polyomaviridae, infects humans asymptomatically in their early infancy and remains latent in the kidney and urinary tract cells. Reactivation of BK virus in renal-transplanted {{patients}} occurs frequently and sometimes <b>leads</b> to <b>nephropathy</b> and rejection of grafted organ. In this study, prevalence of this virus in renal allograft recipients is discussed before and after transplantation. This cross-sectional study performed on 78 renal recipient cases. Blood and urine samples of patients were collected three times; before graft, one month following operation and four months after receiving the graft. All the patients were taking similar drug regimen. The extracted DNA of the samples was investigated by double PCR and semi-nested-PCR. PCR results were analyzed by SPSS software version 11. 5 and Mac Nemar test. Out of 78 samples collected from kidney transplanted cases, five urine specimens (6. 4 %) were positive for BK virus, 10 urine samples (12. 8 %) turned out as positive for this virus one month after operation and 30 of urine specimens (38. 5 %) became positive for BK virus four months post-transplantation. Of 78 plasma samples of the same cases, {{none of them was}} positive for BK virus before transplantation. One plasma specimen (1. 3 %) turned out as positive for BK virus and 16 plasma samples (20. 5 %) were positive for this virus four months after grafted kidney. The difference between the results of the urine samples collected before and four months after kidney transplantation from the patients, was statistically significant (P< 0. 05). Based on the gleaned data it is concluded that BK virus infection increased in a considerable fraction of kidney transplant patients. Therefore, investigation for reactivation of BK virus is recommended in these patients after kidney graft...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of minimal change {{nephrotic syndrome}} (MCNS) remains unclear. Respiratory tract viruses {{could contribute to}} MCNS, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) {{is the most common}} one. In this study, we planned to investigate the effects of RSV on the proteinuria and glomerular structure of rats and to explore the role of RSV in the pathogenesis of MCNS. Rats were inoculated with 6 × 102, 104, and 106 PFU (plaque-forming units) RSV and killed on days 4, 8, 14, 28, and 60 postinoculation (RSV 4, RSV 8, RSV 14, RSV 28, and RSV 60). The proteinuria and serum parameters were measured; renal histology was observed by light microscopy and electron microscopy; immune complex deposits were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy; and RSV RNA and RSV titer were determined by in situ hybridization and plaque assay, respectively. After inoculation, the proteinuria increased, especially in 6 × 106 PFU RSV 14, 28. The serum albumin of 6 × 106 PFU RSV 14, 28 and different-titer RSV 60 decreased. Slight hypercellularity in minority glomeruli and swelling in partial tubular epithelial cells were observed in RSV 4, 8, whereas a relief of the above changes and no abnormalities were detected in RSV 14 and RSV 28, 60, respectively, under a light microscope. Extensive foot process effacement was observed in 6 × 106 PFU RSV 14, 28, 60 under an electron microscope. No immune complex deposits were detected in the renal tissues. RSV RNA signal and RSV titer of renal tissues, depending on the dose of inoculum, reached their climax on day 8 postinoculation. Our study reports {{for the first time that}} RSV can <b>lead</b> to <b>nephropathy</b> in rats on days 14 – 60 postinoculation, especially in 6 × 106 PFU RSV-inoculated rats, which may be a new exploration of the pathogenesis of MCNS...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Uric acid (UA) {{activates}} the NLRP 3 -ASC-caspase- 1 axis and triggers cascade inflammatory that <b>leads</b> to hyperuricemic <b>nephropathy</b> and hyperuricemia-induced renal tubular injury. The original study aims {{to verify}} {{the positive effects of}} the traditional Chinese medicinal formula Shizhifang (SZF) on ameliorating the hyperuricemia, tubular injury, and inflammasome infiltration in the kidneys of hyperuricemic lab rats. Method. Twenty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: control group, oxonic acid potassium (OA) model group, OA + SZF group, and OA + Allopurinol group. We evaluated the mediating effects of SZF on renal mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress (OS) products, protein expression of NLRP 3 -ASC-caspase- 1 axis, and downstream inflammatory factors IL- 1 β and IL- 18 after 7 weeks of animals feeding. Result. SZF alleviated OA-induced hyperuricemia and inhibited OS in hyperuricemic rats (P< 0. 05). SZF effectively suppressed the expression of gene and protein of the NLRP 3 -ASC-caspase- 1 axis through accommodating the ROS-TXNIP pathway (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. Our data suggest that SZF alleviates renal tubular injury and inflammation infiltration by inhibiting NLRP 3 inflammasome activation triggered by mitochondrial ROS in the kidneys of hyperuricemic lab rats...|$|R

Dysfunction of macro- and microvessels {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cardio-renovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes. Renal failure and impairment of renal function due to vasoconstriction of the glomerular arteriole in diabetic <b>nephropathy</b> <b>leads</b> to renal volume retention and increase in plasma homocysteine level. Homocysteine, which is a nonprotein amino acid, at elevated levels is an independent cardio-renovascular risk factor. Homocysteine induces oxidative injury of vascular endothelial cells, involved in matrix remodeling through modulation of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) /tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) axis, and increased formation and accumulation of extracellular matrix protein, such as collagen. In heart this leads to increased endothelial-myocyte uncoupling resulting in diastolic dysfunction and hypertension. In the kidney, increased matrix accumulation in the glomerulus causes glomerulosclerosis resulting in hypofiltration, increased renal volume retention, and hypertension. PPARγ agonist reduces tissue homocysteine levels and is reported to ameliorate homocysteine-induced deleterious vascular effects in diabetes. This review, in light of current information, focuses on the beneficial effects of PPARγ agonist in homocysteine-associated hypertension and vascular remodeling in diabetes. 1...|$|R
