40|$|The MSC Napoli was a {{container}} ship that {{got into trouble}} in the English Channel and was intentionally beached {{on the shores of}} Devon in early 2007. Comical scenes ensued as containers floated ashore and looters discovered that motorcycles and Persian rugs were lying around on the beach ready for taking. A <b>limitation</b> <b>fund</b> was soon constituted in England under the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, 1976. Like many container liners, the Napoli had its slot charterers who were quickly sued in Germany (one of few major jurisdictions where it is clear that slot charterers are not entitled to limit) under the bills of lading. In Metvale Ltd v Monsanto International Sarl and others [2008] EWHC 3002 (Admlty), in a judgment dated 9 December 2008 on two preliminary issues, Mr Justice Teare decided that slot charterers were entitled to limit liability under the Convention and that the <b>limitation</b> <b>fund</b> constituted by shipowners in London would be deemed to be constituted also by the slot charterers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} jurisdiction and {{applicable law}} in limitation proceedings. It {{is argued that}} limitation proceedings can be categorised into, at least, three separate groups: proceedings determining the right to limit liability itself; proceedings concerning {{the establishment of the}} limitation fund; and proceedings for the release of secured assets after a <b>limitation</b> <b>fund</b> has been established. The analysis of the three limitation conventions supports such distinction and suggests that the 1996 LLMC Convention does not contain jurisdictional rules in respect of the first category but contains jurisdictional rules in respect of the establishment of the <b>limitation</b> <b>fund.</b> These rules are not uniform between Contracting States and are discretionary in character. Accordingly, we conclude that the jurisdictional arrangements contained in the international conventions are too weak and unclear to override, by virtue of Article 71, the other jurisdictional provisions of Brussels I. The law applicable to limitation of liability with respect to non-contractual obligations under the operation of the Rome II Regulation is also discussed. The English law position that the law applicable was that of the forum appears to have been changed by Rome II. We conclude that the operation of the international limitation regimes is likely to be disrupte...|$|E

In this case the researcher wants to discuss about handling legal aspect of tatterer by civil service police unity of Malang city. This research used sociology juridical approach. The research was conducted in civil service police unity office with the data sources were interview, observation, and documentation. For the methodology, the writer used qualitative descriptive analysis. Based on the research, {{we know that the}} effectiveness in handling of tatteter was depend on the framer of regulation, in this case is the assembly at provincial; the content of laws, that is law no 11 1984 about cleanliness and orderliness; punishment executor that is civil service; and the social where the laws is prevail. The obstacles in handling the tatterer were: 1) the spreading of tatterer was almost around in Malang city so it was difficult to be overcome; 2) the appear of tatterer in Malang city was like spore; 3) the punishment of this violation was not weight; 4) the limitation member of civil service; 5) the <b>limitation</b> <b>fund</b> in founding of tatterer handling; 6) less support from social in overcome this problem. In this case, the writer gave suggestion that the local laws related with the handling of tatterer should be revised. Beside that, it is important to establish the laws and try to use some approach in conducting it. For the social hoped to support the handling of tatterer in their each city. ...|$|E
40|$|At present, three {{international}} conventions (one {{of which has}} been modified by many signatory states to produce a fourth regime), together with certain pre-existing national regimes, provide this entitlement to limit most types of private law liability arising in the ordinary course of the shipowner’s activities. Limitation may be invoked by the shipowner in two principal ways: by way of a defence, or by commencing a limitation action, which latter normally involves constituting a <b>limitation</b> <b>fund.</b> Whether the shipowner should take the initiative and start a limitation action, or whether he or she should wait and use limitation as a defence, will depend on the choice of fora available. Significant differences among jurisdictions inevitably give rise to forum-shopping. In the course of this book’s practical explanation and discussion of shipowners’ rights to limit their liability, the authors consider how the conflict of laws rules of various jurisdictions might be used by parties in international commerce to raise the most advantageous defence or select the most suitable tribunal to commence a limitation action. For each potentially applicable limitation regime, the book identifies the amount to which liability is limited and the tests that apply when a claimant wishes to challenge a shipowner’s right to limit liability. Among the issues brought to the fore are the following:- - right to the lowest limit versus the strongest protection of the right to limit; - circumstances under which the ship against which the action is brought may be arrested and sold; - when the shipowner’s right to limit can be challenged and denied; - action in rem for collisions; - freezing injunctions; - direct action against an insurer. The book also discusses various specific liability regimes that address damage suffered by passengers, damage to cargo interests, oil pollution damage from tankers, damage from bunker oil from non tankers, and damage caused by hazardous and noxious cargoes. As an in-depth exploration and analysis {{of the differences between the}} various limitation regimes that provide shipowners with a global entitlement to limit liability – and the broader legal issues such limitation rights gives rise to – this book will prove invaluable to any party involved in shipping disputes. Lawyers representing either shipowners (and other parties with an interest in the ship’s operations) or claimants will clearly identify the major issues related to the selection of the appropriate forum for the limitation of liability, including procedural details...|$|E

Still, for the first time, IBC and the other indigenous broadcasters had a relatively solid funding base to build on, and a guarantee of at least four years of support.|$|R
