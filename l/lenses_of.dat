5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the trachytic clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to tree—an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> organisms' eyes.|$|E

50|$|Adult {{education}} scholar Stephen Brookfield {{proposed that}} critically reflective practitioners constantly research their assumptions by seeing practice through four complementary lenses: the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> their autobiography as learners of reflective practice, the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> other learners' eyes, the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> colleagues' experiences, and the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> theoretical, philosophical and research literature. Reviewing practice through these lenses makes us {{more aware of}} the power dynamics that infuse all practice settings. It also helps us detect hegemonic assumptions—assumptions that we think are in our own best interests, but actually work against us in the long run. Brookfield argued that these four lenses will reflect back to us starkly different pictures of who we are and what we do.|$|R
50|$|A concave <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> {{flint glass}} is {{commonly}} {{combined with a}} convex <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> crown glass to produce an achromatic doublet. The dispersions of the glasses partially compensate for each other, producing reduced chromatic aberration compared to a singlet lens with the same focal length.|$|R
5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, {{is clear and}} {{transparent}} and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest transmission range in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> telescopes.|$|E
5|$|The decorations are {{all high}} quality and often highly complex. In one decoration, which {{occupies}} a one-inch square {{piece of a}} page, there are 158 complex interlacements of white ribbon with a black border on either side. Some decorations can only be fully seen with magnifying glasses, although <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> the required power are not {{known to have been}} available until hundreds of years after the book's completion. The complicated knot work and interweaving found in Kells and related manuscripts have many parallels in the metalwork and stone carving of the period. Since their gradual rediscovery from the 19th century on, these designs have also had an enduring popularity. Many of these motifs are used today in popular art including jewellery and tattoos.|$|E

Like H97-09, H97-12 contained only fragmentary remains of aquatic vertebrates like crocodiles and turtles.|$|R

25|$|In 1747, Leonhard Euler {{sent to the}} Prussian Academy of Sciences a {{paper in}} which he tried to prove the {{possibility}} of correcting both the chromatic and the spherical aberration of a lens. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a perfect image, {{it should be possible}} by suitable combinations of <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> different refracting media to construct a perfect telescope objective. Adopting a hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently colored rays of light, he proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic objective composed of <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> glass and water.|$|E
25|$|In 1765 Peter Dollond (son of John Dollond) {{introduced}} the triple objective, {{which consisted of}} a combination of two convex <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> crown glass with a concave flint lens between them. He made many telescopes of this kind.|$|E
40|$|The {{government}} {{focuses on}} trafficking as the definitive form of modern day slavery. In doing so, it portrays modern day slavery {{as a private}} act with identifiable wrongdoers and views the Thirteenth Amendment through the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> forced labor. Workers’ advocates, on the other hand, portray modern day slavery as a systemic form of oppression, supported by governmental policies on immigration and occupational exclusions. These groups focus on the Thirteenth Amendment through the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> class. A historical analysis suggests that the proper approach views the Thirteenth Amendment through the <b>lens</b> <b>of</b> both class and labor...|$|R

25|$|Early corneal <b>lenses</b> <b>of</b> the 1950s and 60s were {{relatively}} expensive and fragile, {{resulting in the}} development of a market for contact lens insurance.

25|$|Simple lenses {{are subject}} to the optical aberrations {{discussed}} above.
