50|$|This {{came too}} late for the {{concentration}} camp prisoners within the area who were now within Dönitz's nominal authority, while under the actual control of the SS. These had numbered around 10,000 when Dönitz assumed the Presidency; mainly former inmates of the Neuengamme camp outside Hamburg, which had been shut down in preparation for the surrender of the city to the British. Between 16 and 28 April, the prisoners had been moved eastwards and concealed by the SS in a flotilla of unseaworthy ships anchored in the Bay of Lubeck, where they then remained without food or medical attention. At the time, this action had been protested by Rear Admiral Konrad Englehardt on Dönitz's staff, but when the Flensburg government came into being, Dönitz made no attempt to free the prisoners, and his government avoided any subsequent acknowledgement that they had known they were there. On 3 May 1945, the prison flotilla was sunk by the Royal Air Force in the mistaken belief that the ships were being prepared to evacuate leading SS personnel. Over 7,000 prisoners drowned, mainly on the former <b>liner</b> <b>Cap</b> Arcona.|$|E

40|$|The Landfill Directive {{will require}} the {{pre-treatment}} of MSW prior to landfilling. The removal of progressively increasing proportions of the biodegradable fractions from landfilled waste, and the UK Government’s commitment to increase recycling of key waste fractions, will lead to an inevitable change, from the disposal of raw MSW, to the disposal of MSW treatment residues, to landfill.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the sustainable performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) which are popularly specified as “leachate retaining” or as “water proofing” membranes in the geo-environmental construction industry. Geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs) are composite matting comprising of bentonite clay with two covering geosynthetics. These are innovative labour saving construction material, {{developed over the}} last three decades. The paper outlines the variety of Geosynthetic Clay Liners (GCLs) can be classified essentially into two distinctly different forms viz; (a) air dry (< 8 % m/c) with granular or powdered bentonite or (b) bentonite cake factory prehydrated to a moisture content (~ 40 % m/c) beyond its shrinkage limit and vacuum extruded as a clay cake to enhance its sustainable performance. The dominant mineral in bentonite clay is the three-layered (2 : 1) clay mineral montmorillonite. High quality bentonites need {{to be used in the}} GCL manufacture. Sodium montmorillonite has the desired characteristic of high swelling capacity, high cation exchange capacity and the consequently very low hydraulic conductivity, providing the basis for the hydraulic sealing medium in GCLs. These encapsulate the active montmorillonite clay minerals which depend on the water and chemical balance between the sealing element and the surrounding geo environment. Quantitative mineralogical analyses and an assessment of the adsorbed cation regime, diffusion coefficients and clay leachate compatibility must necessarily be an integral part of the site appraisal to ensure acceptable long term sustainability and performance. Factors influencing the desired performance of bentonite in the GCLs placed in difficult construction and hostile chemical environments are discussed in this paper. Accordingly, the performance specifications for GCLs are identified and the appropriateness of enhancing the cation exchange capacity with polymer treatment and the need for factory prehydration of the untreated sodium bentonite is emphasised. The advantage of factory prehydrating the polymer treated bentonite to fluid content beyond its shrinkage limit and subsequently factory processing it to develop laminated clay is to develop a GCL that has enviable sealing characteristics with a greater resistance to geochemical attack and cracking. Since clay liners are buried in the ground as base <b>liners,</b> <b>capping</b> layer or as structural water proofing membrane, they can easily avoid strict quality and performance monitoring being “out of sight, out of mind!”. It is very necessary that barrier design for leachate containment must necessarily be in accordance with legislative requirement Assessment of long term hydraulic conductivities and clay-leachate compatibility assessment is deemed necessary. The derogatory factors affecting the sustainable performance of the bentonite in GCLs placed in difficult construction and hostile chemical environments are discussed. Sustainability concepts incorporated in waste management practice must aim to achieve 100 % recycling and fully implement the handling of solid waste in developing countries with relatively lower labour costs...|$|R

40|$|As the world's {{population}} has grown {{and become more}} urban and affluent, waste production has risen tenfold. Discarded materials are collected, some are recycled or composted, and most are landfilled or incinerated. But {{in spite of the}} aggressive economic development, the waste management is relatively poor. This will lead to the contamination of soil at the landfill which raised environmental concern and initiated the involvement of geotechnical engineers in environmental matters. Geoenvironmental engineering covers the aspect of contaminated site remediation and the prevention of future contaminated sites. Clays are one of the alternatives used in the management of wastes disposal at landfills. Clays act as environmental barriers around waste disposal site where they are used as <b>liners</b> and <b>capping</b> materials for landfills sites. Highly plastic clays are used as barriers in landfills and nuclear waste repository. For each application the engineering properties of the clays must be carefully designed to obtain the desired result. Studies concerning changes in the water content as affected by a change in the soil suction are extremely crucial for a long-term assessment of the engineering behaviour of clays. Thus, this thesis experimentally investigated the changes in the water content of initially slurried clay during the drying process. The kaolinite clay which is FMC kaolin was use. The osmotic and vapour equilibrium technique were used in this study to establish soil-water characteristics curve (SWCC) which is subjected to drying process.

Clays act as environmental barriers around waste disposal site where they are used as <b>liners</b> and <b>capping</b> materials for landfills sites. The clay liners act as barriers to water and containment flow in landfills and other waste containment facilities. Clays are used because of its hydraulic properties that is the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). This study focuses on the laboratory tests to measure the water retention characteristics of SPV 200 Bentonite. Bentonites have been considered due to their low permeability, high sorption capacity, self-sealing characteristics, and durability in a natural environment. Standard soil tests were conducted to determine the physical properties of the SPV 200. Two available technique that are osmotic technique and vapor equilibrium technique (VET) were used to establish the suction-water content SWCC curves. The osmotic technique is related to the osmosis principle where the water and salt exchanged to achieve equilibrium. This technique measure the matric suction occurred in the clay specimens. The suction is induced by the PEG 20 000 solutions where the suction ability is determined by the concentration. In VET, the clay specimen of SPV 200 are placed in closed thermodynamic environment containing aqueous solution of given alkaline salt solutions. Water exchanges occur by vapor transfer between the salt solution and clay specimen. Suction is applied to specimen when vapor equilibrium is achieved. The graphs of water content over varying suctions and water content over elapsed time are establish for each technique and then combine to show the curve of the drying process ranging from low suction to high suction value.

40|$|The capping {{system is}} one of the major {{structural}} elements in modern landfills. When using artificial sealing materials (e. g. a geomembrane) as the <b>capping</b> <b>liner,</b> the stability of the cover soils and integrity of the geosynthethics need to be assessed. Traditional design methods only consider uniform cover soil thickness with different degrees of saturation and seepage build-up (i. e. parallel submergency ratio). This paper proposes an analytical method which includes the seepage build-up in the stability analysis for the capping slope with a tapered cover soil profile, that is when cover soils become thicker from top to bottom. Both the parallel (modified) and horizontal seepage force build-up patterns have been considered and analysed. The proposed analytical methods are applied to a design case in which uniform thickness cover soils are considered. The results are comparable to those of the traditional methods and therefore they are verified. Parametric analyses have confirmed the tapered profile can effectively improve the capping slope stability and indicated that the interface shear strength (between the cover soil and the underlying geosynthetic) and cover soil shear strength have the most significant effects on the capping slope stability...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} trends in landfill management policy {{over the last}} decade have been the universal adoption of the containment approach to emission control and the increasing legal requirement to install artificial membranes as bottom <b>liners</b> and <b>caps</b> to landfills which is now mandatory in many countries. The landfill cover is one of the {{most important}} aspects when designing and constructing landfills. The cover should minimize the quantity of water that infiltrates to the body of the solid waste landfills, reduce the rate of leachate generation, segregate solid waste from the surrounding environment, and control the risk of additional groundwater contamination and gas migration. Landfill covers are not standardized. Different covers have been proposed and executed all over the world. The selection of the suitable cover type is a big challenge especially in arid and semi-arid countries. Jordan is considered to be a semi-arid country. In Jordan, more than 20 landfills are in operation. Landfilling practiced in Jordan is generally dumping the waste in trenches with leveling and compacting by trash compactors to reduce the size and the thickness of the layers, and finally covering the waste with 0. 5 m from the landfill soil in daily basis. This cover usually ends to be the cap during landfill working time and sometimes after closing. To assess the efficiency of a certain cover with particular concentration on landfills in arid and semi-arid areas, many field studies should be adopted along an extensive time period, confirming the efficiency of the landfill cover. Cost, time, and labor demands are still the major obstacles for conducting such field studies. Other methods should be considered for evaluation of the landfill cover efficiency and also supporting correct evaluation of the performance of landfill covers.

In order to study the tensile compacted clay behaviour, a series of laboratory bending tests were carried out. The analysis of the results and the determination of relevant parameters are difficult.

On the basis of the test results, different numerical simulations using Discrete Element Method were performed and compared with an analytical model, which seems to be the most suitable to interpret bending tests results for the clay soils. As main result, the Discrete Element Method confirms that the compression stress remains linear function of the strain during the bending test until the failure. However, the tensile stresses increase as a non-linear function. For the tensile strength determination, the analytical differential model remains efficient only when the tensile strain field is well measured...|$|R
