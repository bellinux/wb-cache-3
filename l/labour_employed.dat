5|$|The 12th century {{also saw}} a concerted attempt to curtail the {{remaining}} rights of unfree peasant workers and to set out their labour rents more explicitly {{in the form of}} the English Common Law. This process resulted in the Magna Carta explicitly authorising feudal landowners to settle law cases concerning feudal labour and fines through their own manorial courts rather than through the royal courts. These class relationships between lords and unfree peasants had complex economic implications. Peasant workers resented being unfree, but having continuing access to agricultural land was also important. Under those rare circumstances where peasants were offered a choice between freedom but no land, and continued servitude, not all chose freedom and a minority chose to remain in servitude on the land. Lords benefited economically from their control of the manorial courts and dominating the courts made it easier to manipulate land ownership and rights in their own favour when land became in particularly short supply at the end of this period. Many of the labour duties lords could compel from the local peasant communities became less useful over the period. Duties were fixed by custom, inflexible and understandably resented by the workers involved. As a result, by the end of the 13th century the productivity of such forced labour was significantly lower than that of free <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> to do the same task. A number of lords responded by seeking to commute the duties of unfree peasants to cash alternatives, with the aim of hiring labour instead.|$|E

While agriculture employment has fallen over time in percentage of <b>labour</b> <b>employed,</b> services which includes construction and infrastructure have seen a steady growth accounting for 20.3% of employment in 201213. Of the total workforce, 7% is in the organised sector, two-thirds {{of which are in}} the government-controlled public sector. About 51.2% of the workforce in India is self-employed. According to a 200506 survey, there is a gender gap in employment and salaries. In rural areas, both men and women are primarily self-employed, mostly in agriculture.

6000|$|Labour {{alone is}} the primary means of production; [...] "the {{original}} purchase-money which has been paid for everything." [...] Tools and materials, like other things, have originally cost nothing but labour; and have a value in the market only because wages have been paid for them. The <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in making the tools and materials being added to the labour afterwards employed in working up the materials by aid of the tools, the sum total gives {{the whole of the}} <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in the production of the completed commodity. In the ultimate analysis, therefore, labour appears to be the only essential of production. To replace capital, is to replace nothing but the wages of the <b>labour</b> <b>employed.</b> Consequently, the whole of the surplus, after replacing wages, is profits. From this it seems to follow, that the ratio between the wages of labour and the produce of that labour gives the rate of profit. And thus we arrive at Mr. Ricardo's principle, that profits depend upon wages; rising as wages fall, and falling as wages rise.|$|E

60|$|The fine silks and cottons, the laces, {{and other}} {{ornamental}} luxuries {{of a rich}} country, may contribute very considerably to augment the exchangeable value of its annual produce; yet they contribute but {{in a very small}} degree to augment the mass of happiness in the society, and it appears to me that it is with some view to the real utility of the produce that we ought to estimate the productiveness or unproductiveness of different sorts of labour. The French economists consider all <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in manufactures as unproductive. Comparing it with the <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> upon land, I should be perfectly disposed to agree with them, but not exactly for the reasons which they give. They say that <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> upon land is productive because the produce, over and above completely paying the labourer and the farmer, affords a clear rent to the landlord, and that the <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> upon a piece of lace is unproductive because it merely replaces the provisions that the workman had consumed, and the stock of his employer, without affording any clear rent whatever. But supposing the value of the wrought lace to be such as that, besides paying in the most complete manner the workman and his employer, it could afford a clear rent to a third person, it appears to me that, in comparison with the <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> upon land, it would be still as unproductive as ever. Though, according to the reasoning used by the French economists, the man employed in the manufacture of lace would, in this case, seem to be a productive labourer. Yet according to their definition of the wealth of a state, he ought not to be considered in that light. He will have added nothing to the gross produce of the land: he has consumed a portion of this gross produce, and has left a bit of lace in return; and though he may sell this bit of lace for three times the quantity of provisions that he consumed whilst he was making it, and thus be a very productive labourer with regard to himself, yet he cannot be considered as having added by his labour to any essential part of the riches of the state. The clear rent, therefore, that a certain produce can afford, after paying the expenses of procuring it, {{does not appear to be}} the sole criterion, by which to judge of the productiveness or unproductiveness to a state of any particular species of labour.|$|E

60|$|Lieut.-Colonel Laurie {{informed}} {{me on the}} occasion of my last visit to Hadleigh, in July, 1910, that taken as a whole even now the farm does not pay its way.[6] This result is entirely owing to the character of the <b>labour</b> <b>employed.</b> At first sight, as the men are paid but a trifling sum in cash, it would appear that this labour must be extremely cheap.

60|$|We {{have already}} remarked (and the very example {{out of which}} the {{difficulty}} arose presupposes it) {{that the cost of}} production of an article consists generally of two parts,--the wages of the <b>labour</b> <b>employed,</b> and the profits of those who, in any antecedent stage of the production, have advanced any portion of those wages.

That is much more important to our modern world than the ancient conflict of Assyria and Egypt which plays so large a part in the old Bible record.

60|$|Daily {{experience}} {{proves that}} the <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in trade and manufactures is sufficiently productive to individuals, {{but it certainly is}} not productive in the same degree to the state. Every accession to the food of a country tends to the immediate benefit of the whole society; but the fortunes made in trade tend but in a remote and uncertain manner to the same end, and in some respects have even a contrary tendency. The home trade of consumption {{is by far the most}} important trade of every nation. China is the richest country in the world, without any other. Putting then, for a moment, foreign trade out of the question, the man who, by an ingenious manufacture, obtains a double portion out of the old stock of provisions, will certainly not to be so useful to the state as the man who, by his labour, adds a single share to the former stock. The consumable commodities of silks, laces, trinkets, and expensive furniture, are undoubtedly a part of the revenue of the society; but they are the revenue only of the rich, and not of the society in general. An increase in this part of the revenue of a state, cannot, therefore, be considered of the same importance as an increase of food, which forms the principal revenue of the great mass of the people.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} justly {{observed}} by Adam Smith, that 'no equal quantity of productive <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in manufactures can ever occasion so great a reproduction as in agriculture.' If we suppose the rents of land taken throughout the kingdom {{to be one}} fourth of the gross produce, it is evident, that to purchase the same value of raw produce by means of manufactures, would require one third more capital. Every five thousand pounds {{laid out on the}} land, not only repays the usual profits of stock, but generates an additional value, which goes to the landlord. And this additional value is not a mere benefit to a particular individual, or set of individuals, but affords the most steady home demand for the manufactures of the country, the most effective fund for its financial support, and the largest disposable force for its army and navy. It is true, that the last additions to the agricultural produce of an improving country are not attended with a large proportion of rent;(15*) and it is precisely this circumstance that may make it answer to a rich country to import some of its corn, if it can be secure of obtaining an equable supply. But in all cases the importation of foreign corn must fail to answer nationally, if {{it is not so much}} cheaper than the corn that can be grown at home, as to equal both the profits and the rent of the grain which it displaces.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gladstone kept pretty {{closely in}} step with his leader. From Sir Robert he slowly learned lessons of {{circumspection}} that may not seem congenial to his temperament, though for that matter we should remember all through that his temperament was double. He was of opinion, as he told the House of Commons, that a sliding-scale, a fixed duty, and free trade were all three open to serious objection. He regarded the defects of the existing law as greatly exaggerated, and he refused {{to admit that the}} defects of the law, whatever they might be, were fatal to every law with a sliding-scale. He wished to relieve the consumer, to steady the trade, to augment foreign commerce, and the demand for labour connected with commerce. On the other hand he desired to keep clear of the countervailing evils of disturbing either vast capitals invested in land, or the immense masses of <b>labour</b> <b>employed</b> in agriculture.[162] He noted with some complacency, that during the great controversy of 1846 and following years, he never saw any parliamentary speech of his own quoted in proof of the inconsistency of the Peelites. Here are a couple of entries from Lord Broughton's diary for 1844:--'June 17. Brougham said [...] "Gladstone was a d----d fellow, a prig, and did much mischief to the government," [...] alluding to his speech about keeping sugar duties. June 27. Gladstone made a decided agricultural protection speech, and was lauded therefor by Miles--so the rebels were returning to their allegiance.' Gladstone's arguments, somebody said, were in favour of free trade, and his parentheses were in favour of protection.|$|E
