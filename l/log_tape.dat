40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we show that}} the tape bounded {{complexity}} classes of languages over single letter alphabets (sla) are closed under complementation. We then use this results to show by means of diagonalization that there exists an infinite hierarchy of tape bounded complexity classes of sla languages between log log n and <b>log</b> n <b>tape</b> bounds. On the other hand, we show {{that the power of}} diagonalization over sla inputs with less than <b>log</b> n <b>tape</b> is very limited by proving that every infinite sla language accepted using less than <b>log</b> n <b>tape</b> contains infinite regular subsets. From this result it immediately follows that the set of primes in unary notation, P, requires exactly <b>log</b> n <b>tape</b> for its recognition and every infinite subset of P requires at least <b>log</b> n <b>tape...</b>|$|R

She knew exactly where each tape was and the machine time spent on it. Moreover, she was responsible for unwinding tapes into buckets and joining them into a loop. This was an essential step for operating Colossus and Heath Robinson since the tape might not stand up to the speed of the machine. After many experiments, Du Boisson found a unique way to realize it by using a special glue, a warm clamp, and French chalk. After the European war was over, Colossi were smashed into fragments on the orders of Churchill.|$|R

The CRTC intends to hold a call for applications for new aboriginal-focused broadcasters to take on CKAV's frequencies. The CRTC's suspension of licence in all the network's cities, except for Ottawa, was suspended on July 23, 2015, pending an application by the station for a leave to appeal the CRTC's decision.

40|$|This {{article is}} the fifth {{in a series of}} {{articles}} from our study examining information-seeking behavior in relation to information-retrieval (IR) interaction. This article focuses on the examination of the interaction variables within Saracevic's ([1989]) triadic IR model. The analysis involved an examination of the information-searching behavior of academic researchers during a mediated interaction with an IR system, particularly concentrating on the interaction between the information seeker, the search intermediary, and the IR system. To explore the variables during mediated search interaction, two small-scale studies of mediated on-line searching were conducted at the University of Sheffield. The studies involved mainly qualitative data analysis of interview transcripts and on-line search results, together with quantitative data analysis of questionnaire results. The studies specifically investigated: (1) aspects of the mediated search process, (2) relevant information sources, and (3) interaction measures derived from search <b>logs</b> and <b>tape</b> transcripts, and related interaction measures. Findings include: (1) a number of different types of interactions were identified, (2) the presearching interactions between information seeker and intermediary aided the information seeker to identify their idea and problem, and (3) most information seekers in this study were at the problem definition stage or problem resolution stage following the search process. From this research, it is clear that the interaction did affect the search process. The intermediary helped the users to identify their search terms more clearly and focus on the references obtained. In most cases, the users and intermediary considered the communication process very effective, and the interactions that took place during the on-line search were found to affect the users' perceptions of the problem, personal knowledge, and relevance judgments. The interaction process aided the users to obtain very useful results with help from the intermediary.
