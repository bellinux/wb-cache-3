5|$|A common {{subdivision}} system of E. coli, but {{not based on}} evolutionary relatedness, is by serotype, {{which is based on}} major surface antigens (O antigen: part of <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> layer; H: flagellin; K antigen: capsule), e.g. O157:H7). It is, however, common to cite only the serogroup, i.e. the O-antigen. At present, about 190 serogroups are known. The common laboratory strain has a mutation that prevents the formation of an O-antigen and is thus not typeable.|$|E
5|$|Saccharolipids {{describe}} {{compounds in}} which fatty acids are linked {{directly to a}} sugar backbone, forming structures that are compatible with membrane bilayers. In the saccharolipids, a monosaccharide substitutes for the glycerol backbone present in glycerolipids and glycerophospholipids. The most familiar saccharolipids are the acylated glucosamine precursors of the LipidA component of the lipopolysaccharides in Gram-negative bacteria. Typical lipidA molecules are disaccharides of glucosamine, which are derivatized {{with as many as}} seven fatty-acyl chains. The minimal <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> required for growth in E. coli is Kdo2-Lipid A, a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is glycosylated with two 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (Kdo) residues.|$|E
5|$|The first {{region on}} either side of the bilayer is the {{hydrophilic}} headgroup. This portion of the membrane is completely hydrated and is typically around 0.8-0.9nm thick. In phospholipid bilayers the phosphate group is located within this hydrated region, approximately 0.5nm outside the hydrophobic core. In some cases, the hydrated region can extend much further, for instance in lipids with a large protein or long sugar chain grafted to the head. One common example of such a modification in nature is the <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> coat on a bacterial outer membrane, which helps retain a water layer around the bacterium to prevent dehydration.|$|E
50|$|A 2002 {{study showed}} that Chlorella cell walls contain <b>lipopolysaccharides,</b> {{endotoxins}} found in Gram-negative bacteria that affect {{the immune system and}} may cause inflammation. However, more recent studies have found that the <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> in organisms other than Gram-negative bacteria, for example in cyanobacteria, are considerably different from the <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> in Gram-negative bacteria. A 2010 study found that Chlorella contains a peptide, known as Chlorella-11, that actually inhibits the inflammation caused by <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> from Gram-negative bacteria.|$|R

40|$|The {{chemical}} and serological properties of <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> {{isolated from the}} S form and from the R form of cholera vibrios were compared. It {{was found that the}} S-R mutation of cholera vibrios involves total elimination of the two component amino sugars of S-form <b>lipopolysaccharides,</b> i. e. quinovosamine and perosamine. This elimination resulted in the loss of O-specificity of S-form <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> and concomitant appearance of strong serological cross-reactivity, in the passive-haemolysis-inhibition test, among R-form <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> regardless of the serotypes (Inaba and Ogawa) of their S parent strains...|$|R
5|$|Numerous other {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} described in hepatic encephalopathy, although their relative contribution to the disease state is uncertain. Loss of glutamate transporter gene expression (especially EAAT 2) {{has been attributed to}} acute liver failure. Benzodiazepine-like compounds have been detected at increased levels as well as abnormalities in the GABA neurotransmission system. An imbalance between aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) has been described; this would lead to the generation of false neurotransmitters (such octopamine and 2-hydroxyphenethylamine). Dysregulation of the serotonin system, too, has been reported. Depletion of zinc and accumulation of manganese may play a role. Inflammation elsewhere in the body may precipitate encephalopathy through the action of cytokines and bacterial <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> on astrocytes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSmall {{hydrophilic}} antibiotics {{traverse the}} outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria through porin channels. Large lipophilic agents traverse the outer membrane through its bilayer, containing {{a majority of}} <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> in its outer leaflet. Genes controlled by the two-component regulatory system PhoPQ modify <b>lipopolysaccharides.</b> We isolate <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> from isogenic mutants of Salmonella sp., one lacking the modification, the other fully modified. These <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> were reconstituted as monolayers at the air-water interface, and their properties, {{as well as their}} interaction with a large lipophilic drug, novobiocin, was studied. X-ray reflectivity showed that the drug penetrated the monolayer of the unmodified <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> reaching the hydrophobic region, but was prevented from this penetration into the modified <b>lipopolysaccharides.</b> Results correlate with behavior of bacterial cells, which become resistant to antibiotics after PhoPQ-regulated modifications.

25|$|A pyrogen is a {{substance}} that induces fever. These can be either internal (endogenous) or external (exogenous) to the body. The bacterial substance <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> (LPS), present in the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, {{is an example of}} an exogenous pyrogen. Pyrogenicity can vary: In extreme examples, some bacterial pyrogens known as superantigens can cause rapid and dangerous fevers. Depyrogenation may be achieved through filtration, distillation, chromatography, or inactivation.|$|E
40|$|Volk, Wesley A. (University of Virginia, Charlottesville). Cell wall <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> from Xanthomonas species. J. Bacteriol. 91 : 39 – 42. 1966. —The <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> from 20 {{species of}} Xanthomonas were {{extracted}} and purified. Biological {{studies suggest that}} these <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> are analogous to the endotoxins extracted from enteric organisms, as judged by their mouse lethality {{and their ability to}} provoke the local Shwartzman reaction in rabbits. Studies on the composition of the polysaccharides revealed that all contained uronic acid, glucose, mannose, and a compound apparently identical to the 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate previously described in enteric organisms. The polysaccharide also contains organic phosphate, and additional carbohydrates such as rhamnose, xylose, fucose, and galactose are found in some, but not all, species. In contrast to the composition of the enteric <b>lipopolysaccharides,</b> heptose was not found in any of the <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> of the Xanthomonas species studied...|$|R
50|$|<b>Lipopolysaccharides</b> {{are present}} in all cyanobacteria. Though not as potent as other cyanotoxins, some {{researchers}} have claimed that all <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> in cyanobacteria can irritate the skin, while other researchers doubt the toxic effects are that generalized.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the immunogenicity of sodium deoxycholate-disrupted <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> from Escherichia coli cell walls revealed that these fragments, which are nonimmunogenic in the rabbit, have some activity in the mouse. This relationship was independent of the route of immunization and sex, but in both species immunogenicity was restored by dilution or dialysis. Adsorption of disrupted <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> onto bentonite particles or administration with methylated bovine serum albumin and Freund's adjuvant did not appreciably augment activity in vivo. It is postulated that in the mouse the requirements for immunogenicity of these <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> are either less stringent {{with regard to the}} three-dimensional structure of the antigen, or that a reaggregation to toxic, native <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> may occur in vivo...|$|R
25|$|Group I K antigens {{are only}} found with certain O-antigens (O8, O9, O20, and O101 groups), they are further {{subdivided}} {{on the basis}} of absence (IA, similar to that of Klebsiella species in structure) or presence (IB) of amino sugars and some group I K-antigens are attached to the lipid A-core of the <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> (KLPS), in a similar way to O antigens (and being structurally identical to O antigens in some instances are only considered as K antigens when co-expressed with another authentic O antigen).|$|E
25|$|Endotoxemia is {{a serious}} {{complication}} of colic and warrants aggressive treatment. Endotoxin (<b>lipopolysaccharide)</b> is released from the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria when they die. Normally, endotoxin is prevented from entering systemic circulation by the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa, antibodies and enzymes which bind and neutralize it and, for the small amount that manages to enter the blood stream, removal by Kupffer cells in the liver. Endotoxemia occurs {{when there is an}} overgrowth and secondary die-off of gram negative bacteria, releasing mass quantities of endotoxin. This is especially common when the mucosal barrier is damaged, as with ischemia of the GI tract secondary to a strangulating lesion or displacement. Endotoxemia produces systemic effects such as cardiovascular shock, insulin resistance, and coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Another gene {{necessary}} for synthesis of di-rhamnolipids, rhlC, {{has also been}} identified. RhlC catalyses {{the addition of the}} second rhamnose moiety to mono-rhamnolipids forming di-rhamnolipids, hence is often labelled rhamnosyltransferase 2. Like rhlA and rhlB, rhlC is thought to be an ancestral gene controlled by the same quorum sensing system as rhlA and rhlB. The rhamnose moiety for mono- and di-rhamnolipids is derived from AlgC activity and the RmlABCD pathway, encoded on the rmlBCAD operon. AlgC produces sugar precursors directly for alginate and <b>lipopolysaccharide</b> (LPS) as well as rhamnolipids. In rhamnose synthesis, AlgC produces glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which is converted to dTDP-D-glucose by RmlA followed by conversion to dTDP-6-deoxy-D-4-hexulose and then dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose by RmlB and RmlC respectively. Finally, dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose is converted to dTDP-L-rhamnose by RmlD. The rhamnose can then be used in the synthesis of rhamnolipids by RhlB and RhlC.|$|E
40|$|<b>Lipopolysaccharides</b> were {{extracted}} from freeze-dried cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1 (polymyxin B susceptible), isolate A (polymyxin B resistant), and isolate A-reverted (polymyxin B intermediate resistance) {{by either the}} phenol-chloroform-petroleum ether or the modified phenol-water method. Isolate A and isolate A-reverted had drastic losses of 2 -hydroxydodecanoic acid and significant decreases in 3 -hydroxydecanoic acid. Concentrations of amide-linked 3 -hydroxydecanoic acid were similar in all three strains. Minor alterations were noted {{in the composition of}} 3 -deoxy-D-manno- 2 -octulosonic acid, heptose, phosphate, neutral sugars, and amino compounds. The concentrations of rhamnose in isolate A and of rhamnose and glucose in isolate A-reverted were significantly different from those in PAO 1. Trace amounts of mannose and other minor unidentified carbohydrates were detected in all strains. Polymyxin B included in isolate. A growth medium complexed with <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> and remained bound throughout purification. PAO 1 <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> bound more polymyxin B than did isolate A <b>lipopolysaccharides.</b> Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated minor differences in smooth- and rough-form <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> of the different strains.

25|$|This {{regulation}} of cytokines appear to occur via the p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses TLR 4 (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS (<b>lipopolysaccharide).</b> This causes the p38 MAPK to be phosphorylated. This phosphorylation activates the p38 MAPK to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, {{the production of}} cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.|$|E

40|$|<b>Lipopolysaccharides</b> (LPS) 1 {{consist of}} three regions with {{different}} {{chemical and biological}} properties (for a review see reference 1). The O-specific polysaccharide (region I) carries the main serological specificity of bacteria. It is linked to a core polysaccharide (region II) that is common to groups of bacteria. This polysaccharide core is linked through a 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctonate(KDO) -trisaccharide to the lipid component (region III), termed lipid A. Smooth (S) form bacteria contain the full structure of all three regions, while rough (R) form mutants of these bacteria synthesize <b>lipopolysaccharides</b> of different degrees of incompleteness.
