25|$|The first paramedics {{to respond}} to the crash scene {{maintained}} that the seat belts had been loose, but the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> was not broken or cut when the belts were unbuckled to cut Earnhardt from the car. However, NASCAR's investigation concluded that each of the EMTs who attended to Earnhardt after the crash reported that the buckle position of Earnhardt's harness was off-center by , which would have been impossible had the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> not broken.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} of the left <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> was not a result of design or manufacturing defect, but caused by improper installation.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the speculation about the broken <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> in Earnhardt's car, many teams migrated from traditional five to six-point safety harnesses.|$|E
40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> and three-point belts, these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of diagonal belts (as compared to <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> and three-point belts), involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of diagonal belts seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> and three-point belts show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> and three-point belts are highly effective measures for safety in traffic.

25|$|A recall {{was issued}} in 1995, {{regarding}} fuel hose fitting issues. Over 400 models had this defect which {{was caused by}} variances in temperature and environment. Another recall was issued {{in relation to the}} passive restraint system on seat belts not functioning properly, on over 2,000 512TR's. If the restraint system suffered a mechanical or electrical failure only the <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> would provide the occupant protection.|$|E
25|$|At a {{news conference}} {{five days after the}} crash, NASCAR {{officials}} announced that the left <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> on Earnhardt's seat belt harness had broken. Dr. Steve Bohannon, NASCAR's medical expert, said he thought the faulty belt had allowed Earnhardt's chin to strike the steering wheel, causing the fatal basilar skull fracture. This led to speculation that Earnhardt would have survived if his seat belt had not broken.|$|E
25|$|Typically, for {{a smaller}} {{executive}} car, there is ample room up front for the driver and passenger to sit comfortably, with very comfortable seats. However, rear seat passengers may find the design restrictive in overall room. The 156 Sportwagon features the addition of fold down rear seats which increases the luggage area normally covered by a privacy screen. Ideally the 156 is a car for four people, rather than five, although later models did add a full centre seatbelt {{in place of the}} <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> in earlier models.|$|E
50|$|In 1955 (as a 1956 package), Ford offered <b>lap</b> only seat <b>belts</b> in {{the rear}} seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package. In 1967, Volvo started to install <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> {{in the rear}} seats. In 1972, Volvo {{upgraded}} the rear seat belts to a three-point belt.|$|R
50|$|The third safety {{advancement}} was {{the introduction}} of dual front lap-and-shoulder safety belts with emergency locking retractors for outboard occupants in 1975 for the 1976 model year. These replaced the outdated and inadequate <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> previously used. A center <b>lap</b> safety <b>belt</b> with slack adjustment was provided for the center occupant. Ford and Dodge would follow one model year later adding lap-and-shoulder safety belts to their pickups.|$|R
40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model {{cars with}} {{automatic}} or manual belt systems {{was observed in}} suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point belt systems, the use of shoulder belts by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model cars with manual three-point belts. This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including cars with detachable nonmotorized belts, cars with detachable motorized belts, and especially cars with nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic shoulder belts systems include manual <b>lap</b> <b>belts.</b> Use of <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> was lower in cars with automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic three-point belts compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual three-point belts and the rates of use of automatic three-point belts...|$|R
25|$|The Voyage uses two blue, 24-passenger trains {{made by the}} Philadelphia Toboggan Company. Each {{train is}} made up of six cars that hold four riders each. Each car has two rows holding two riders each. Each row has a seat divider that {{separates}} the two riders in that row and ensures each rider remains in a position allowing their restraints to work effectively. Since The Voyage uses the same trains that The Raven and The Legend use, the restraints are the same - an individual ratcheting lap bar and an individual, two-point <b>lap</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was equipped with}} a diagonal shoulder harness {{for each of the}} eight passenger seats when it was delivered new to FLN. However, when Loganair converted the aircraft for ambulance use, they installed the same seats and seat belts they used in the rest of their Islander fleet. The shoulder harnesses were designed to attach to a specific type of <b>lap</b> <b>belt,</b> which was different from the lap belts used by Loganair. At the time of the accident, shoulder harnesses were not required for passengers, and Loganair did not retrofit the seat belts or shoulder harnesses to be compatible with each other.|$|E
25|$|In {{the ensuing}} dogfight, Boelcke and Böhme, unaware of each other's presence, {{closed in on}} the same aircraft, flown by Captain Arthur Knight. Von Richthofen dived in on the flight path of that very same aircraft; he was chasing the other DH.2, piloted by Lieutenant Alfred Edwin McKay. Boelcke swerved to avoid a {{collision}} with the interceding aircraft. Böhme's landing gear brushed Boelcke's upper wing. As the fabric peeled off the upper wing of his aircraft, Boelcke struggled for control. He and his aircraft fell out of sight into a cloud. When it emerged, the top wing was gone. However, Boelcke made a relatively soft crash-landing. The impact seemed survivable. However, his <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> did not restrain him, and he never wore a helmet when he flew.|$|E
50|$|The NHTSA was {{authorized}} to promulgate regulations - the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) - which provide standards that auto makers must follow {{in order to}} allow vehicles to be imported. Of the 68 FMVSS, two standards, 208 and 209, were implemented to standardize <b>lap</b> and shoulder <b>belts</b> in front seating positions as well as <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> in all other positions in the vehicle.|$|R
40|$|Wheelchair-related {{physical}} restraints, <b>lap</b> <b>belts,</b> {{and other}} alternatives {{are intended to}} provide safe and adequate seating and mobility for individuals using wheelchairs. Physical restraints and <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> are also helpful for positioning people in their wheelchairs {{to reduce the risk}} of injury during wheelchair tips and falls. However, when used improperly or in ways other than intended, injury or even death can result. Although widely prescribed, little evidence is available to direct professionals on the appropriate use of these restraints and <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> and for whom these restraints are indicated. The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of available literature from 1966 – 2006 to identify the risks and benefits associated with <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> while seated in wheelchairs. Twenty-five studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. Nine studies reported the frequency of asphyxial deaths caused by physical restraints, nine studies reported the long-term complication and indirect adverse effects of physical restraints and lap-belt use, and seven studies reported the benefits of physical restraints and <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> with individuals using wheelchairs. Despite the weak evidence, the results suggest a considerable number of deaths from asphyxia caused by the use of physical restraints occurred each year in the U. S. The majority of the deaths occurred in nursing homes, followed by hospitals, and then the home of the person. Most deaths occurred while persons were restrained in wheelchairs or beds. Based on that, caution needs to be exercised when using restraints or positioning belts. In addition, other seating and environment alternatives should be explored prior to using restraints or positioning belts, such as power wheelchair seating options. Positioning belts may reduce risk of falls from wheelchairs and should be given careful consideration, but caution should be exercised if the individual cannot open the latch independently. Also, the duration of use of the physical restraint should be limited. Therefore, several factors should be considered when devising a better quality of physical-restraint services provided by health care professionals. These efforts can lead to improved safety and quality of life for individuals who use wheelchairs. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
50|$|Safety {{features}} included 3-point {{seat belts}} {{for the front}} two passengers and <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> for rear passengers.

25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in the back seat and restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A <b>lap</b> <b>belt</b> used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E

5000|$|Until the 1980s, three-point belts were {{commonly}} {{available only}} in the front outboard seats of cars; the back seats were only often fitted with <b>lap</b> <b>belts.</b> Evidence of the potential of <b>lap</b> <b>belts</b> to cause separation of the lumbar vertebrae and the sometimes associated paralysis, or [...] "seat belt syndrome", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require 3-point belts first in all outboard seating positions and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles.
