40|$|Two European <b>leaf-eating</b> <b>beetles,</b> Galerucella calmariensis L. and G. pusilla (Duft.) (Chrysomelidae:Coleoptera) were {{released}} at four sites in Quebec {{to manage the}} semi-aquatic exotic weed, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.). Protocols for monitoring the Galerucella populations and detecting changes in the plant communities were implemented. In addition, the effect of seeding with native plants species in conjunction with Galerucella herbivory was tested in an experiment at a purple loosestrife stand in Ontario. Releases of lab-reared beetles in Quebec in 1996 did not survive to 1997 {{at any of the}} 4 sites, but releases of field collected beetles in 1997 overwintered successfully at 3 of the 4 sites. The density of purple loosestrife in 1998 ranged from 28 % (Cap Tourmente) to 84 % (Hull). The density of Galerucella in 1998 ranged from 6 (Lac St Francois) to 50 (Hull) adults/m 2 /min. In the Ontario experiment, herbivory and seeding together interacted to increase the biomass of other plant species significantly [...] -and thereby reduced the dominance (proportion of the biomass) of purple loosestrife [...] -but did not {{have a significant effect on}} the biomass of purple loosestrife in the first season...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 53 - 56) The beetle Trirhabda eriodictyonis {{lives on}} two shrubs with different plant defenses: Eriodictyon crassifolium has hairy leaves; E. trichocalyx has sticky leaves. The {{relationship between these}} plants and the <b>leaf-eating</b> <b>beetles</b> that depend on them has been unstudied until now. In choice tests, larvae and adults showed unexpected feeding preferences, with larvae from E. crassifolium showing no preference and those from E. trichocalyx preferring E. crassifolium. Adults all strongly preferred eating E. trichocalyx. Larvae and adults that I switched from E. trichocalyx to E. crassifolium died younger than beetles that I continued to feed the original host species. Mating trials showed that the only difference in preference involved males from E. trichocalyx, which were far more attractive to females on E. crassifolium than males on the same host. Finally, females laid more eggs if they ate E. trichocalyx than E. crassifolium, {{even if they had}} started life on the latter. It is clear that E. trichocalyx provides benefit to both males and females and these beetle populations are not differentiating based on host plants. Neither the differentiation hypothesis nor the preference-performance hypothesis are validated by this plant-insect interaction. Instead, it appears that the best explanation of this relationship is phylogenetic conservatism. The plant defenses, which appear dramatically different to humans, are unimportant to the beetles...|$|R
40|$|Hybridization is an {{important}} biological phenomenon {{that can be used}} to understand the evolutionary process of speciation of plants and their associated pests and diseases. Interactions between hybrid plants and the herbivores of the parental taxa may be used to elucidate the various cues being used by the pests for host location or other processes. The chemical composition of plants, and their physical foliar attributes, including leaf thickness, trichome density, moisture content and specific leaf weight were compared between allopatric pure and commercial hybrid species of Corymbia, {{an important}} subtropical hardwood taxon. The <b>leaf-eating</b> <b>beetle</b> Paropsis atomaria, to which the pure taxa represented host (C. citriodora subsp. variegata) and non-host (C. torelliana) plants, was used to examine patterns of herbivory in relation to these traits. Hybrid physical foliar traits, chemical profiles, and field and laboratory beetle feeding preference, while showing some variability, were generally intermediate to those exhibited by parent taxa, thus suggesting an additive inheritance pattern. The hybrid susceptibility hypothesis was not supported by our field or laboratory studies, and there was no strong relationship between adult preference and larval performance. The most-preferred adult host was the sympatric taxon, although this species supported the lowest larval survival, while the hybrid produced significantly smaller pupae than the pure species. The results are discussed in relation to plant chemistry and physical characteristics. The findings suggest a chemical basis for host selection behavior and indicate that it may be possible to select for resistance to this insect pest in these commercially important hardwood trees...|$|E
