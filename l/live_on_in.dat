5|$|Macbeth {{eventually}} {{sees that}} Banquo {{can no longer}} be trusted to aid him in his evil, and considers his friend a threat to his newly acquired throne. Thus he has him murdered. Banquo's ability to <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> different ways is another oppositional force, in this case to Macbeth's impending death. His spirit lives on in Fleance, his son, and in his ghostly presence at the banquet.|$|E
5|$|The Oubangui {{people of}} west Africa plant a tree {{when a child}} is born. As the tree flourishes, so does the child but if the tree fails to thrive, the health of the child is {{considered}} at risk. When it flowers it is time for marriage. Gifts are left at the tree periodically and when the individual dies, their spirit is believed to <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the tree.|$|E

With this album the authors {{concluded}} the entire comic {{series with the}} intention to prevent the series from becoming weak, or staggering behind newer comics. However, Christin has written a 270-page Valérian and Laureline novel, Valérian et Laureline: Lininil a disparu (Valérian and Laureline: Lininil Has Disappeared), and indicated that Valérian and Laureline will continue to <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a yet unspecified form.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> any number of hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} a simple country lane on {{the boundary of}} Hyde Park, separated by a brick wall. Aristocratic properties appeared during the late 18th century, including Breadalbene House, Somerset House and Londonderry House. The road grew in popularity during the 19th century after improvements to Hyde Park Corner and more affordable views of the park, which attracted the nouveau riche to the street and led to it {{becoming one of the}} most fashionable roads to <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> London. Notable residents included the 1st Duke of Westminster's residence at Grosvenor House, the Dukes of Somerset at Somerset House and the British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli at No.93. Other historic properties include Dorchester House, Brook House and Dudley House. In the 20th century, Park Lane became well known for its luxury hotels, particularly The Dorchester, completed in 1931, which became closely associated with eminent writers and international film stars. Flats and shops began appearing on the road, including penthouse flats. Several buildings suffered damage during World War II, yet the road still attracted significant development, including the Park Lane Hotel and the London Hilton on Park Lane, and several sports car garages. A number of properties on the road today are owned by some of the wealthiest businessmen from the Middle East and Asia. Current residents include business mogul Mohamed Al-Fayed and former council leader and Lord Mayor Dame Shirley Porter.|$|E

25|$|Cavendish died in 1810 (as one of {{the wealthiest}} men in Britain) and was buried, along with many of his ancestors, in the church that is now Derby Cathedral.

25|$|The Almanack {{contained}} the calendar, weather, poems, sayings and astronomical and astrological information that a typical almanac {{of the period}} would contain. Franklin also included the occasional mathematical exercise, and the Almanack from 1750 features an early example of demographics. It is chiefly remembered, however, for being a repository of Franklin's aphorisms and proverbs, many of which <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> American English. These maxims typically counsel thrift and courtesy, {{with a dash of}} cynicism.|$|E

Another British legacy in Malta is the widely popular annual Christmas pantomime at the Manoel Theatre. Most Maltese families have adopted turkey and plum pudding as Christmas treats in place of the more traditional Maltese rooster and cassata.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the parents}} would often name their child after an older relative, so that his/her name would <b>live</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the family. Today, however, {{these are not}} binding {{conditions}} and are often ignored: parents often pick a name without conforming with these traditions, however it is really up to the parents as still many of them continue to observe these traditions. Traditions to name a child after the parents' best man or maid of honor or the saint on whose name day the child is born also exist.|$|E

25|$|After the Mexican Revolution {{a number}} of aspects of {{traditional}} Mexican life became revalued, including traditional and rural handcrafts. Today, masked festivals and dances are most prevalent {{in areas of the}} country with large concentrations of indigenous peoples.
