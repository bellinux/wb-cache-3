40|$|Diesel {{engines are}} {{the primary source of}} power for the heavy duty vehicles. The {{advantages}} of diesel engines are high fuel efficiency, reliability and durability. The performance and emission characteristics of diesel engine depend on many parameters. One of the important factors which influence the performance and emission of diesel engine is fuel injection pressure. An experimental study was performed on a light duty direct injection diesel engine at 150 bar, 200 bar and 250 bar injection pressure to study its effect on performance and emission. The injection pressure was changed by adjusting the fuel injector spring tension. The performance and emission characteristics were presented graphically and concluded that they were found better at the fuel injection pressure 200 bar for the <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The high fuel {{efficiency}} and torque of the diesel engine {{has made it}} the obvious choice for heavy duty applications for a long time. In addition, these characteristics of the modern super-charged HSDI diesel engine also make it very suitable and popular for car applications. However, since all engines emit combustion products that can be harmful to the environment, and the transport sector makes a major contribution to total anthropogenic emissions of potentially harmful substances, increasing legislative demands are being placed on manufacturers of diesel (and other) engines to minimise emissions. One of several possible strategies to reduce pollutant formation is to use multiple injections, i. e. to divide injections into two or more parts. In the studies underlying this thesis the effects of multiple injections on diesel combustion were investigated experimentally, in both spray chamber experiments and engine tests. The main objectives of the work were to investigate ways in which multiple injections {{could be used to}} reduce engine-out emissions from diesel engines and to increase the efficiency of diesel engines. Split injections consisting of two injection pulses were shown to have significant effects on the combustion processes in both a heavy duty and a <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine,</b> although the effects differed somewhat between the two types of engine. In the <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine</b> splitting injections into two pulses lowered the engineout particulate and CO emissions and increased the {{fuel efficiency}}. However, they also resulted in increased NOX emissions. Increased air-fuel mixing {{is believed to be the}} main reason for this. In the heavy duty engine a split with a very short dwell time, resulting in a rate-shaped injection rather than a true split injection, resulted in shortened combustion durations, which simultaneously reduced fuel consumption and NOX emissions. Use of multiple injection regimes alone will not meet the tough emissions legislation of the future. However, they seem likely to play a significant role in the continuing efforts to develop cleaner diesel engines...|$|E

40|$|Heat loss {{is one of}} the {{greatest}} energy losses in engines. More than half of the heat is lost to cooling media and exhaust losses, and they thus dominate the internal combustion engine energy balance. Complex processes affect heat loss to the cylinder walls, including gas motion, spray-wall interaction and turbulence levels. The aim of this work was to experimentally compare the heat transfer characteristics of a stepped-bowl piston geometry to a conventional re-entrant diesel bowl studied previously and here used as the baseline geometry. The stepped-bowl geometry features a low surface-to-volume ratio compared to the baseline bowl, which is considered beneficial for low heat losses. Speed, load, injection pressure, swirl level, EGR rate and air/fuel ratio () were varied in a multi-cylinder <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine</b> operated in conventional diesel combustion (CDC) mode. Temperature measurements in the engine cooling media were used to set up the engine energy balance and find out how much heat was lost to cooling media in different parts of the engine. Based on these calculations and heat release analysis, conclusions could be drawn regarding how heat losses in different parts of the engine were affected by changes in these parameters. Results were compared to previously published CFD simulations and it was concluded how the heat transfer characteristics differ between the two piston designs...|$|E
40|$|Heavy {{alcohols}} can {{be mixed}} with fossil diesel to produce blended fuels {{that can be}} used in diesel engines. Alcohols can be obtained from fossil resources, but can also be produced more sustainably from renewable raw materials. The use of such biofuels can help to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport sector. This study examines four alcohol/diesel blends each containing one heavy alcohol: n-butanol, iso-butanol, 2 -ethyl hexanol and n-octanol. All of the blends where prepared to function as drop-in fuels in existing engines with factory settings. To compensate for the alcohols′ low cetane numbers (CN), a third component with high CN was added to each blend, namely hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). The composition of each mixture was selected to give an overall CN equal to that of fossil diesel fuel. The four blends were compared in terms of sustainability, their performance in engine tests using a single-cylinder <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine,</b> and their general physicochemical properties. Lifecycle analyses indicated that replacing fossil diesel with diesel-biofuel blends could reduce GHG emissions by between 22 and 58 %. The greatest reduction was predicted to occur with the isobutanol containing blend and the second greatest with the 2 -ethylhexanol blend. Analysis of the blends' physical properties showed that the ones including octanol isomers resemble fossil diesel more closely than those containing butanol. Engine experiments indicated that the blends' combustion behavior and thermal efficiencies were very similar to those of conventional diesel fuel. However, on average, the blends produced approximately 50 % less soot than diesel...|$|E
40|$|The oil {{distribution}} system of an automotive <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine</b> typically has an oil pump mechanically driven through the front-endancillaries-drive or directly off the crankshaft. Delivery pressure is regulated by a relief valve {{to provide an}} oil gallery pressure of typically 3 to 4 bar absolute at fully-warm engine running conditions. Electrification of the oil pump drive {{is one way to}} decouple pump delivery from engine speed, but this does not alter the flow distribution between parts of the engine requiring lubrication. Here, the behaviour and benefits of a system with an electrically driven, fixed displacement pump and a distributor providing control over flow to crankshaft main bearings and big end bearings is examined. The aim has been to demonstrate that by controlling flow to these bearings, without changing flow {{to other parts of the}} engine, significant reductions in engine friction can be achieved. The study has been conducted on a 1. 5 litre, 4 cylinder turbocharged diesel engine. By reducing the feed pressure to the bearings from a baseline pressure of 3 bar absolute to 1. 5 bar absolute, reductions in engine rubbing friction mean effective pressure of up to 14 % has been achieved at light load. Similar reductions in friction were recorded across a speed range of 1000 - 2000 rev/min and net indicated mean effective pressures up to 3. 5 bar. The ranges were conservatively limited to protect against bearing damage. The paper reports details of the oil system modifications and the test results. The fuel economy benefit due solely to the friction reduction, not including any benefit from a reduction in oil pump work, is around 1 ½ % over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC). The reduction in friction is demonstrably significant and represents an area with great potential to improve engine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{compressed}} {{natural gas}} (CNG) in <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> applications is still restricted to conventional spark ignition engines operating at low compression ratio, so overall efficiency is limited. A combustion concept that has been successfully applied on large stationary engines {{and to some extent}} on heavy-duty engines is dual-fuel combustion, where a compression-ignited diesel pilot injection is used to ignite a homogeneous charge of methane gas and air. CNG is injected in the intake ports during the intake stroke and later in the cycle the premixed air-CNG mixture is ignited via a pilot diesel injection close to top dead center. However, this concept has not been applied to a significant extent on <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engines</b> yet. The main reasons are linked to high temperature methane oxidation requirements and poor combustion efficiency at diluted conditions at low loads. Therefore, in this paper an experimental investigation of the effects of different intake manifold conditions on the dual-fuel combustion process is presented, based on performance and emissions of a <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> rebuilt for dual-fuel operation operated at low loads and lean conditions. The main goal is to understand how intake temperature and pressure affects the combustion process and to identify possible control strategies for those parameters over the low load range of operation. Results show that intake air temperature {{plays an important role in}} the flame propagation process at highly diluted conditions and higher air temperature allows a sharp reduction in total unburned hydrocarbon emissions (TUHC). Reduced intake air pressure can expand the operating range of lean CNG-Diesel dual-fuel engines by means of greater combustion efficiency, despite higher pumping losses. Maximum gross indicated efficiency recorded during the experiments was 42 %. It was possible to run below 4 g/kWh TUHC emissions and with high enough exhaust temperature for high efficiency methane oxidation in the aftertreatment system beyond 5 bar IMEPg. Loads ranged between 3 bar and 8 bar IMEPg...|$|R

40|$|Honeywell has {{completed}} {{working on a}} multiyear program to develop and demonstrate proof-of-concept for an 'on-vehicle' desulfurization fuel filter for both light duty and heavy-duty diesel engines. Integration of the filter into the vehicle fuel system will reduce the adverse effects sulfur has on post combustion emission control devices such as NOx adsorbers. The NOx adsorber {{may be required to}} meet the proposed new EPA Tier II and ' 2007 -Rule' emission standards. The proposed filter concept is based on Honeywell's reactive filtration technology and experience in liquids handling and conditioning. A regeneration and recycling plan for the spent filters was also examined. We have chosen to develop and demonstrate this technology based on criteria set forth for a heavy duty CIDI engine system because it represents a more challenging set of conditions of service intervals and overall fuel usage over light duty systems. In {{the second phase of the}} program a light duty diesel engine test was also demonstrated. Further, technology developed under this proposal would also have application for the use of liquid based fuels for fuel cell power generation. The program consisted of four phases. Phase I focused on developing a concept design and analysis and resolution of technical barriers concerning removal of sulfur-containing species in low sulfur fuels. In Phase II concentrated on prototype filter design and preparation followed by qualification testing of this component in a fuel line application. Phase III studied life cycle and regeneration options for the spent filter. Phase IV focused on efficacy and benefits in the desulfation steps of a NOx adsorber on both a heavy and <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine.</b> The project team included a number of partners, with Honeywell International as the prime contractor.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of bio-diesel fuel is expected to reduce emissions of carbon-containing greenhouse gases. To optimize the application of bio-diesel in internal combustion engines, a theoretical model has been developed. The bio-diesel fuels used in the modeling are Palm Methyl Ether (PME, C 17 H 34 O 2) and Rapeseed Methy Ether (RME, C 19 H 36 O 2), and blends of these methyl ethers with standard diesel oil. The thermo-physical properties of these bio-diesel fuels have been estimated using empirically determined thermodynamic, gas phase formulae. The description of their combustion processes {{has been based on}} the assumption that long chain methyl esters (C 17 ~C 19) decompose into short-chain methyl esters (C 5 }~ C 11), for which combustion mechanisms are available. A comprehensive integrated chemical mechanism (with 98 species involving 395 reactions) was constructed to model the combustion of diesel oil surrogate, DOS, PME and RME. The bio-diesel fuels' physical properties and combustion mechanisms were validated using measured auto-ignition delays and laminar flame speeds. The bio-diesels physical properties and combustion mechanism were implemented into KIVA 3 V, rel. 2 code. The KIVA 3 V fuel model was also extended to include mixing rules approach to calculate properties of blends of the fuel, e. g. RME 50. Models of sprays of the fuels were validated against data acquired using observations of sprays in the Chalmers High Pressure /High Temperature (HP/HT) spray chamber. The liquid penetration, and average Sauter Mean Radius, SMR, for sprays of the different fuels were calculated and compared. To study the effect of bio-diesel fuels on the performance of engines, 3 D CFD simulations of both a heavy duty engine (Volvo D 12 C) and a <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine</b> (Volvo NED 5) were carried our under various operating conditions. The combustion processes of the DOS and PME fuels in the NED 5 engine were studied, and those of DOS, RME and RME 50 in the Volvo D 12 C engine.

This program {{was established in}} 2007 {{in support of the}} Department of Energy’s Vehicles Technologies Advanced Combustion and Emissions Control initiative to remove critical barriers to the commercialization of advanced, high efficiency, emissions compliant internal combustion (IC) engines for light duty vehicles. Work in this area expanded the fundamental knowledge of engine combustion to new regimes and advanced the knowledge of fuel requirements for these diesel engines to realize their full potential. All of the following objectives were met with fuel efficiency improvement targets exceeded: 1. Improve light duty vehicle (5000 lb. test weight) fuel efficiency by 10. 5 % over today’s state-ofthe- art diesel engine on the FTP city drive cycle 2. Develop & design an advanced combustion system plus aftertreatment system that synergistically meets Tier 2 Bin 5 NOx and PM emissions standards while demonstrating the efficiency improvements. 3. Maintain power density comparable to that of current conventional engines for the applicable vehicle class. 4. Evaluate different fuel components and ensure combustion system compatibility with commercially available biofuels. Key accomplishments include:  A 25 % improvement in fuel efficiency was achieved with the advanced LDECC engine equipped with a novel SCR aftertreatment system compared to the 10. 5 % target  An 11 % improvement in fuel efficiency was achieved with the advanced LDECC engine and no NOx aftertreamtent system  Tier 2 Bin 5 and SFTP II emissions regulations were met with the advanced LDECC engine equipped with a novel SCR aftertreatment system  Tier 2 Bin 5 emissions regulations were met with the advanced LDECC engine and no NOx aftertreatment, but SFTP II emissions regulations were not met for the US 06 test cycle – Additional technical barriers exist for the no NOx aftertreatment engine  Emissions and efficiency targets were reached with the use of biodiesel. A variety of biofuel feedstocks (soy, rapeseed, etc.) was investigated.  The advanced LDECC engine with low temperature combustion was compatible with commercially available biofuels as evaluated by engine performance testing and not durability testing.  The advanced LDECC engine equipped with a novel SCR aftertreatment system is the engine system architecture that is being further developed by the Cummins product development organization. Cost reduction and system robustness activities have been identified for future deployment.  The new engine and aftertreatment component technologies are being developed by the Cummins Component Business units (e. g. fuel system, turbomachinery, aftertreatment, electronics, etc.) to ensure commercial viability and deployment  Cummins has demonstrated that the technologies developed for this program are scalable across the complete <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> <b>engine</b> product offerings (2. 8 L to 6. 7 L engines)  Key subsystems developed include – sequential two stage turbo, combustions system for low temperature combustion, novel SCR aftertreatment system with feedback control, and high pressure common rail fuel system An important element of the success of this project was leveraging Cummins engine component technologies.

The samples were collected using C- 18 Sep Pak cartridges coated with an acidic solution of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH). The resulting hydrazones were separated and quantified using HPLC. Samples were collected during 1 - 2 h periods at six sites located in the city of Salvador, Bahia: a bus station, a tunnel, a commercial mall parking lot, a business building parking lot a residential district and a commercial district; and at two other sites far from Salvador: Cacha Pregos and Lagoa Verde. The measured concentrations for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde ranged, respectively, from 0. 20 to 88 ppbV and from 0. 40 to 93 ppbV. The formaldehyde/acetaldehyde concentration ratio determined in these sites were: 0. 66 (commercial mall parking lot); 0. 65 (business building parking lot); 4. 4 (bus station); 1. 2 (tunnel); 1. 0 (residential area), 1. 7 (commercial area), 1. 1 (Cacha Pregos) and 0. 8 (Lagoa Verde).

40|$|Fuel {{economy is}} affected, both by fuel and engine {{lubricant}} quality. Engine lubricant quality plays {{a vital role}} in reduction of fuel consumption by effective reduction of friction between the contact surfaces of engine parts (piston ring assembly, bearings and valve train). Engine components are exposed to various lubrication regimes such as hydrodynamic, elasto-hydrodynamic, boundary and mixed lubrication during engine operation. In each of these regimes, the factors which influence engine friction are different. Hydrodynamic friction is influenced by lubricant rheology, film thickness and sliding speed of interacting surfaces, whereas boundary and elasto-hydrodynamic friction is a function of surface properties like roughness and hardness and the type of friction modifier used in engine lubricant. So the principal factors which influence engine friction power are speed, load, and surface topography of engine components, oil viscosity, oil temperature and type of friction modifiers used. It is generally accepted that both the piston assembly and bearings are predominantly in the hydrodynamic lubrication regime, whereas the valve train is in the mixed/boundary lubrication regime. Hydrodynamic friction is proportional to sliding velocity of a pair, oil film thickness, operating temperature, lubricant viscosity and many other physical parameters. To investigate the effect of engine lubricant viscosity on friction characteristics and fuel consumption of a heavy <b>duty</b> and <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine,</b> an experimental study was carried out on a 4 -cylinder, Direct Injection off-highway, heavy-duty, diesel engine and 4 - cylinder indirect injection, <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> coupled with the appropriate eddy current dynamometers and instrumented with fuel consumption measurement unit, pressure sensor, angle encoder, speed sensor, temperature indicators, data acquisition system etc, to measure the fuel consumption, power/torque etc. Two engine lubricants were selected for both types of engine {{in such a way that}} both lubricants were of same performance category but having different viscosity grade.

40|$|The design {{trend for}} <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engines</b> is towards lower {{compression}} ratio and higher turbocharger boost. This can enable higher specific power and lower pollutant emissions to be achieved, but raises concerns that cold start operation might be adversely affected. This is investigated and quantified through {{the study of}} a modern <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> at two compression ratios and temperatures down to - 20 ºC. Key indicators of cold start performance are the magnitude and cycle-to-cycle variation of indicated mean effective pressure. Initial {{studies were carried out}} at 300 rpm, a speed representative of post-first-fire conditions. Studies were then conducted at higher engine speeds representative of cold idle. The utility of different injection strategies, timings and quantities is investigated when varying test temperature and engine speed through a range of values encountered during the cold start phase of engine operation. The importance of the glow plug as a cold start aid is also investigated by varying its operating temperature and protrusion into the combustion chamber. The indicated mean effective pressure was used to assess the effects of varying input parameters, and gross heat release rate information is used to identify the phenomena responsible for desirable or undesirable characteristics. Reduction in compression ratio led to no deterioration of initial start performance from speeds just above cranking, provided an appropriate injection strategy was chosen. Higher indicated mean effective pressure was possible at low speeds using low compression ratio due to reduced losses and more complete combustion. Cycle-to-cycle variability in indicated mean effective pressure increased markedly for both compression ratios at engine speeds representative of cold idle, especially when test temperature was reduced. Stability reduction was more severe at low compression ratio. Multiple pilot injections at high compression ratio cold idle resulted in better cycle-to-cycle stability. Analysis of heat release profiles suggested that additional pilots assisted fuel mixing, a conclusion supported by a computational fluid dynamics model. Multiple pilots created a more homogeneous fuel distribution through the bowl at time of main injection. Multiple pilots could not stabilise operation at low compression ratio. Improvement in cold idle at low compression ratio was achieved by increasing glow plug temperature, which significantly increased the rate of fuel preparation. This increased the initial rate of heat release and resulted in significantly less variation in the heat release rate profiles. Small changes in glow plug protrusion rapidly degraded cold idle performance, indicating the importance of correct design...|$|R

NTA is able to measure particles in polydisperse solutions and reports the size and volume distribution of soot-in-oil aggregates; it has the advantages of being fast and relatively low cost if compared with TEM...|$|R
40|$|Exhaust {{emissions}} {{especially from}} <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> gasoline <b>engine</b> {{are a major}} contributor to air pollution due to the large number of vehicles on the road. The {{purpose of this study is}} to experimentally analyse the exhaust pollutant emissions of a four-stroke port fuel spark ignition engines operating using secondary butyl alcohol–gasoline blends by percentage volume of 5 % (GBu 5), 10 % (GBu 10) and 15 % (GBu 15) of secondary butyl- alcohol (2 -butanol) additives in gasoline fuels at 50 % of wide throttle open. The exhaust emissions characteristics of the engine using blended fuels was compared to the exhaust emissions of the engine with gasoline fuels (G 100) as a reference fuels. Exhaust emissions analysis results show that all of the blended fuels produced lower CO by 8. 6 %, 11. 6 % and 24. 8 % for GBu 5, GBu 10 and GBu 15 respectively from 2500 to 4000 RPM, while for HC, both GBu 10 and GBu 15 were lower than that G 100 fuels at all engine speeds. In general, when the engine was operated using blended fuels, the engine produced lower CO and HC, but higher CO 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates an {{air system}} {{model for a}} <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> with a dual-loop exhaust gas {{recirculation}} (EGR) system and variable geometric turbocharger (VGT). The proposed model estimates unmeasurable engine states using only equipped sensors on mass product engines. The maximum error of thermodynamic states are only when the temperature, pressure and mass are less than 5 % and the maximum error of the mass flow rate model is less than 0. 003 kg/s. Temperature dynamics and transport delay are obtained to improve the estimation performance in transient engine operating conditions. The model is validated under engine experiments.

40|$|Some {{previous}} research results {{have shown that}} EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) rate, pilot fuel quantity, and main injection timing closely associated with engine emissions and fuel consumption. In {{order to understand the}} combined effect of EGR rate, pilot fuel quantity, and main injection timing on the NOx (oxides of nitrogen), soot, and ISFC (indicated specific fuel consumption), in this study, CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation together with the Taguchi method and the ANOVA (analysis of variance) technique was applied as an effective research tool. At first, simulation model on combustion and emissions of a <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> at original baseline condition was developed and the model was validated by test. At last, a confirmation experiment with the best combination of factors and levels was implemented. The study results indicated that EGR is the most influencing factor on NOx. In case of soot emission and ISFC, the greatest influence parameter is main injection timing. For all objectives, pilot fuel quantity is an insignificant factor. Furthermore, the engine with optimized combination reduces by at least 70 % for NOx, 20 % in soot formation, and 1 % for ISFC, in contrast to original baseline engine...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{high levels}} of {{stratification}} {{is one of the}} main advantages of Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) over the Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) concept. Fuel stratification smoothens heat release 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆eand improves controllability of this kind of combustion. However, the lack of a clear definition of “fuel and combustion stratifications” is obvious in literature. Hence, it is difficult to compare stratification levels of different PPC strategies or other combustion concepts. The main objective of this study is to define the fuel and combustion stratifications based on the fuel tracer LIF and OH* chemiluminescence images, respectively. A <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> optical <b>engine</b> has been used to perform the measurements. Four experimental points are evaluated, with injection timings in both the homogeneous and the stratified regimes. Twodimensional Fourier transforms of fuel distribution and chemiluminescence images provide the range of spatial frequencies in these images. This method gives the opportunity to separate a specific range of frequencies related to fuel and combustion stratification. The signal energy content in this range is used to define the stratification, using an appropriate normalization procedure. The results indicate that this new definition is a promising method to compare the level of stratification between different experiments...|$|R

Larger versions, with a long, {{weighted}} body and heavier <b>duty</b> <b>engines,</b> transmissions, and tow hooks, {{may be used}} for towing of disabled buses, truck tractors, or large trucks. The artificial sizing and weighting must be designed to withstand the greater weight of the towed vehicle, which might otherwise tip the tow truck back.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{alcoholic}} fuels {{have been}} considered as an alternative transportation biofuel even in compression ignition engines either as blended in diesel or as premixed fuel {{in the case of}} dual-fuel configuration. Within this framework, the authors investigated the possibility to improve the combustion efficiency when ethanol is used in a dual-fuel <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine.</b> In particular, the study was focused on reducing the HC and CO emissions at low load conditions, acting on the most influential engine calibration parameters. Since this kind of investigation would require a significant number of runs, the statistical design of experiment methodology was adopted to reduce significantly its number. As required by the DoE approach, a set of factors (injection parameters, etc.) were selected. For each of them, two levels “high” and “low” were defined in a range of reasonable values. Combining the levels of all the factors, it was possible to evaluate the effects and the weight of each factor and of their combination on the outputs. The results identified the rail pressure, the pilot, and post-injection as the most influential emission parameters. Significant reductions of unburnt were found acting on those parameters without substantial penalties on the global engine performances...|$|R
40|$|Lean burn {{gasoline}} and diesel engines provide improved fuel economy {{when compared to}} engines operating under stoichiometric fuel/air conditions. At the same time, lean burn and diesel engines present a problem for emission control. Because they operate under oxidizing conditions, the conventional three-way catalyst is not effective in NOx reduction [1, 2]. In addition, the wide temperature range of automobile exhaust gases present a challenge for catalyst design. The temperature of exhaust gases from a <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engine</b> can vary from 150 to 500 C, depending on the operating conditions. To date, a catalyst that operates with high NOx conversion efficiency over the entire operating range has not been found. Non-thermal plasma assisted catalysis {{has been shown to}} be a promising technology for NOx reduction in lean burn and diesel exhaust gases [3, 4]. The approach exploited in this paper is to use a plasma in combination with several catalysts, each of which are active over unique temperature ranges. It was reported in the literature, that the one of the essential roles of plasma treatment is to oxidize NO to easier reducible NO 2 [7]. In this contribution, the other important function of plasma treatment, namely partial oxidation of propylene, will be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this program was to develop generic aftertreatment technologies applicable for LDV and LDT engines ranging from 55 kW to 200 kW, to develop an optimized and integrated aftertreatment system for a LDT (<b>Light</b> <b>Duty</b> Truck) type vehicle, and to demonstrate the technology which will enable <b>light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engines</b> to meet Federal Tier II regulation with minimum impact on fuel economy. Specifically, the development targets for emissions reduction and fuel injection penalty are given below: (1) NOx conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (2) PM conversion efficiency > 90 % (hot), > 84 % (combined); (3) Fuel penalty over FTP- 75 Less than 5 %; and (4) Fuel penalty at Cruise condition Less than 3 %. Development of cost-effective, highly efficient diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems in combination with very low engine out emission combustion development are essential elements for realization of Federal Tier II emission standards for <b>Light</b> <b>Duty</b> Trucks and Vehicles. Evaluation of several aftertreatment technologies was completed {{as part of this}} program. A combination of Diesel Oxidation Catalyst, NOx Adsorbing Catalyst and Catalyzed Soot Filter was found to provide the levels of conversion efficiency required to achieve the emission targets. While early systems required relatively large catalyst volumes, external dosing, sulfur traps, full bypass configurations and high levels of Platinum metals; the final system is a compact, scalable, flow-through, fully-integrated and engine-managed aftertreatment system capable of commercial application for <b>Light</b> <b>Duty</b> Vehicles and Trucks. NOx adsorber/particulate filter technology is particularly attractive for <b>Light</b> <b>Duty</b> applications due to the lower exhaust flow and temperature requirements as compared to Heavy <b>Duty</b> <b>engines.</b> Despite these strong positive aspects, NOx Adsorbers are challenged by their regeneration requirements and susceptibility to sulfur poisoning and thermal degradation. Capability was developed to regenerate the NOx Adsorber for NOx and SOx as well as the Particulate Filter for soot. This system was fully integrated into a truck and evaluated over the chassis dynamometer for emissions capability and in real-world winter field testing. Durability of the system was evaluated over a variety of accelerated and real-time dynamometer tests. Excellent NOx and PM conversion efficiency was demonstrated, even following 3000 hrs of endurance testing. Unregulated emissions emitted by the system were evaluated as was the fuel penalty associated with the DeNOx and DeSOx regeneration processes. In the final evaluation, the system demonstrated 90 % NOx conversion and 99 % PM conversion at a 6 % fuel penalty over the FTP- 75 test cycle. While target fuel penalty levels were demonstrated using full-bypass configuration systems, the cost associated with those systems was prohibitively high and would preclude successful commercialization of the technology. Although the flow-through configuration fell 1 % short of the 5 % fuel penalty target, the cost of this configuration is such that commercial application is feasible. Cost drivers for the final system configuration were identified and demonstrate areas where future development areas could focus...|$|R
50|$|Diesel, PPC and HCCI engines, rely {{solely on}} heat and {{pressure}} created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via a fuel injector that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines {{are more susceptible to}} cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. <b>Light</b> <b>duty</b> diesel <b>engines</b> with indirect injection in automobiles and light trucks employ glowplugs (or other pre-heating: see Cummins ISB#6BT) that pre-heat the combustion chamber just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a switch or mechanical apparatus), and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic engine control units (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.|$|R
