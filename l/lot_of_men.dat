500|$|After a stint {{with the}} {{short-lived}} Army Service Training Program, Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division {{to serve as}} a surgical technician in Leyte, Okinawa, and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945. The day he landed in the Philippines, Groza saw a soldier shot in the face. He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded. [...] "I saw a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> wounded with severe injuries", he later said. [...] "Lose legs, guts hanging out, stuff like that. It's a tough thing, but you get hardened to it, and you accept it as part of your being there." ...|$|E
500|$|There are no eye witness {{accounts}} of the battle that was fought at North Walsham on 25 or 26 June 1381. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham related {{that there was a}} fierce engagement at North Walsham Heath, south of the town, in which [...] "the warlike Bishop" [...] led a successful attack on the rebels' entrenched position. The Escheators' Inquisitions for the period that name Litster also included the names of rebels from North Walsham who were killed, giving strong evidence that the rebels suffered a severe defeat. According to Thomas Walsingham, the rebels were routed as they fled through woodland and cut down as they were found. Writing in the 19th century, Walter Rye quoted a local man, [...] "They dew say a'mazin' <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> are buried in that [...]" [...] The local belief that the parish church at North Walsham was the scene of a bloodbath after the battle cannot be substantiated using historical documents.|$|E

500|$|On 19February 1942, NWA's {{complement}} of aircraft included seventeen Lockheed Hudson light bombers of Nos.2 and 13 Squadrons based at Darwin and Daly Waters, fourteen obsolescent CAC Wirraway fighters of No.12 Squadron based at Darwin and Batchelor, and ten P-40Kittyhawk fighters of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) that were transitting through Darwin to Java. Half of the Hudsons were without crews, {{five of the}} Wirraways were out of service, and the Kittyhawk pilots were considered inexperienced. Wilson was attending meetings at ABDACOM headquarters in Java, and Scherger was acting AOC. Just before 10am, Darwin suffered its first air raid by the Japanese, a force of 188 aircraft that bombed the harbour and town. A further attack by fifty-four bombers, directed mainly at the RAAF airfield, followed at around midday. The raids on 19February destroyed civil and military infrastructure, twenty-three aircraft and ten ships, and killed approximately 250people. As well, 278RAAF personnel deserted Darwin in an exodus that {{became known as the}} [...] "Adelaide River Stakes". [...] "There was", in Scherger's words, [...] "an awful panic and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> simply went bush". The Kittyhawks and anti-aircraft gunners were credited with shooting down five Japanese aircraft and probably destroying five others.|$|E
500|$|Plans for a {{war against}} the Southern Song began in 1158. That year, Wanyan Liang claimed that the Song had broken the 1142 treaty that banned them from {{acquiring}} horses. In 1159, he began building up his army in preparation for an invasion. He acquired weapons, which he stored in Beijing, as well as horses allegedly numbering 560,000. Wanyan Liang understood that an invasion of the Song would require a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men.</b> He ensured that Han Chinese soldiers were drafted into the war effort alongside Jurchen soldiers. The recruitment drive lasted until 1161. Naval confrontations were likely because the Jin planned on traveling by river. Ships were seized for the war and 30,000 of the recruits {{were assigned to the}} Jin fleet. Wanyan Liang authorized the building of ships for the war in March 1159, {{under the auspices of the}} Ministry of War. Construction began in the Tong (...) prefecture near Beijing. Wanyan Liang appointed himself head of the army and took personal command of the Jurchen forces. The draft was unpopular. Several revolts erupted against it, many of them in the Jin provinces neighboring the Song. But Wanyan Liang allowed no dissent. He had his stepmother executed after hearing that she was critical of the war effort.|$|E
500|$|As well as {{the loss}} of civil and {{military}} infrastructure, twenty-three aircraft and ten ships, {{and the death of}} some 250people, 278RAAF personnel had deserted Darwin in an exodus that became known as the [...] "Adelaide River Stakes". [...] "There was", in Scherger's words, [...] "an awful panic and a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> simply went bush". Praised for his [...] "great courage and energy", {{he was one of the}} few senior Air Force officers in the region to emerge from Commissioner Charles Lowe's inquiry into the debacle with his long-term career prospects undamaged. In the immediate aftermath, however, his outspoken criticism of the RAAF's state of preparedness alienated members of the Air Board, the service's controlling body that consisted of its most senior officers and which was chaired by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS). He was relieved of his position at NWA by the CAS, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett, and shunted through a series of postings for the remainder of the year, including commanding officer at RAAF Station Richmond, [...] at RAAF Headquarters, Director of Defence at Allied Air Forces Headquarters, South West Pacific Area, and Director of Training at RAAF Headquarters. Seeking restitution, he boldly went over the heads of the Air Board and successfully appealed to the Minister for Air, Arthur Drakeford, supported by Commissioner Lowe.|$|E

500|$|Describing her character's personality, Smith has stated: [...] "Dr. Hahn is a {{workaholic}} and she's very professional [...] I think {{she feels that}} there should be professionalism at work, and when other people do things that aren't professional she gets a little upset.", adding: [...] "She has little rules in her head about how you’re supposed to act at work. That doesn’t mean she can’t break the rules. But everyone else is supposed to follow them." [...] Stacy McKee, writer of season four episode [...] "Kung Fu Fighting", which saw the establishment of Hahn as a main character, has deemed her: [...] "hardcore. [...] a kick ass female surgeon". Smith has explained that the show's writers [...] "didn’t want to rush to make [...] likable, and hoped I didn’t mind. A lot of actors don’t want to be unlikable, even if they’re the bad guy. But I’m okay with that— I’m good with being unlikable." [...] Series creator Shonda Rhimes, discussing the rivalry between Hahn and her Resident Cristina Yang – which saw Hahn reprimanded by Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), Seattle Grace's Chief of Surgery, for her lack of encouragement— has given the insight: [...] "Hahn is a brilliant surgeon and is great with her patients but her teaching skills? [...] Well, let's just say she can use a little more loving care with her students, particularly Cristina. [...] I felt sorry for Hahn because Hahn grew up in a surgical world that included even fewer women than there is now (so Hahn is accustomed to a [...] "dog eat dog" [...] kind of surgical world)." [...] Trish Doolan, who consulted with the show's producers on the developing lesbian storyline between Hahn and Callie Torres, said of the character: [...] "She's very strong, very good at what she does, and actually a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>men</b> are threatened by that.
