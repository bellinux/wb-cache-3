40|$|The test {{application}} {{time of a}} scan circuit is {{a significant factor in}} the overall test cost of the circuit. Therefore, reducing the test {{application time}} is an important problem. The test application time of a test set for a scan circuit is determined by the sum of the number of scan shifts required for applying the test set, and the number of primary input vectors in the test set. Compaction procedures that view a full scan circuit as a combinational circuit reduce the number of test vectors, where a test vector consists of a scan vector and a primary input vector. This is not sufficient since for large scale circuits the high test application time {{is a result of the}} number of scan operations (or scan vectors) rather than the number of primary input vectors. Therefore, effective procedures must reduce the number of scan operations further than the combinational circuit view allows. Procedures to reduce the test application time by dropping scan operations have been proposed earlier. The compaction procedures proposed in this research reduce the test application time further by using <b>limited</b> <b>scan</b> operations. Under a <b>limited</b> <b>scan</b> operation, the number of shifts is smaller than the length of a scan chain.

40|$|In {{medical and}} {{industrial}} applications of computed tomography (CT) imaging, {{limited by the}} scanning environment {{and the risk of}} excessive X-ray radiation exposure imposed to the patients, reconstructing high quality CT images from limited projection data has become a hot topic. X-ray imaging in <b>limited</b> <b>scanning</b> angular range is an effective imaging modality to reduce the radiation dose to the patients.

Results: The schizophrenia patients demonstrated significantly fewer saccadic eye movements when viewing context-free images and significantly longer eye-fixation durations when viewing context-embedded images.

Four statistical interpolation methods for recovering these missing traces are compared in this paper: Kriging, Wiener structures, Splines and the expectation assuming an independent component analyzers mixture model (E-ICAMM). Kriging is an adaptation to the spatial context of the linear least mean squared error estimator. Wiener structures improve the linear estimator by including a nonlinear scalar function. Splines are a commonly used method to interpolate GPR traces. This consists of piecewise-defined polynomial curves that are smooth at the connections (or knots) between pieces. E-ICAMM is a new method proposed in this paper. E-ICAMM consists of computing the optimum nonlinear estimator (the conditional mean) assuming a non-Gaussian mixture model for the joint probability density in the observation space.

Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy of an adaptive 70 -kVp (peak) whole-brain CTP protocol with variable sampling intervals and extended duration against an established fixed-sampling, limited-period protocol at 80 kVp. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: A retrospective analysis of 37 patients with stroke scanned with conventional (n 17) and variant-protocol (n 20) whole-brain CTP was performed. We compared radiation dose, parametric map quality, and consistency of full-contrast circu-lation capture between a modified 70 -kVp protocol, with 20 whole-brain passes at variable sampling intervals over an extended sampling period, and a conventional 80 -kVp CTP examination with 24 passes at fixed-sampling intervals and a more <b>limited</b> <b>scanning</b> window. Mann-Whitney U test analysis was used to compare both protocols. RESULTS: The 70 -kVp CTP scan provided superior image quality at a 45 % lower CT dose index volume and 13 % lower dose-length product/effective dose compared with the conventional 80 -kVp scan. With respect to the consistency of contrast-passage capture, 95 % of the adaptive, extended protocol continued through the venous return to baseline, compared with only 47 % by using the conventional limited-length protocol. Rapid sampling during the critical arterial arrival andwashout periodwas accomplished in nearly 95 %with both the variable and fixed-sampling-interval protocols.

40|$|Communication link {{and target}} ranges for {{satellite}} communications (SATCOM) and space-based sensors (e. g. radars) vary from approximately 1000 km (for LEO satellites) to 35, 800 km (for GEO satellites). At these long ranges, large antenna gains are required and legacy payloads have usually employed large reflectors with single beams {{that are either}} fixed or mechanically steered. For many applications, there are inherent limitations {{that are associated with}} the use of these legacy antennas/payloads. Hybrid antenna designs using Phased Array Fed Reflectors (PAFRs) provide a compromise between reflectors and Direct Radiating phased Arrays (DRAs). PAFRs provide many of the performance benefits of DRAs while utilizing much smaller, lower cost (feed) arrays. The primary limitation associated with hybrid PAFR architectures is electronic scan range; approximately +/- 5 to +/- 10 degrees is typical, but this range depends on many factors. For LEO applications, the earth FOV is approximately +/- 55 degrees which is well beyond the range of electronic scanning for PAFRs.

40|$|Beam {{scanners}} have wide {{applications in}} many fields. But conventional scanners have many shortcomings such as <b>limited</b> <b>scanning</b> frequency, high cost and low reliability. At the same time, phase gratings are efficient devices for deflecting light in prespecified direction. We propose {{a new kind}} of optical beam scanner by using a Talbot-encoded phase plate. Our architecture is practical and easily fabricated and has stable capability. It includes a monochromatic light source, a programmed controlled shifter, a detector and a phase plate. This phase plate consists of a pair of complementary phase plates with Talbot phase coding structure. Talbot phase coding structure is {{a new kind of}} binary phase coding structure. There are periodically repeated gratings {{on the surface of the}} phase plates. The complementary plates are placed paralleled to each other and they can be shifted along the direction perpendicular to their central axes. When the light passes through the pair of phase plates, it will be deflected. And the relative shift between the two plates will determine the deflected angle. By changing the shift between the plates with the shifter, we can get accurately deflected angles. When there is no shift between the plates, the light will go straight without any deflection. We have designed the required phase plates according to the number of scanning points N, maximum deflected angle theta and the diffraction efficiency eta. And satisfactory experimental results have been obtained. The phase plates can be mass-produced by employing the binary-optical manufacture technology so that the costs of the scanners can be reduced. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Flash memory devices in the past decades has translated into a constant shrinking of the floating gate transistors. This reduction of the device area will lead to cell planarization where the control gate no longer wraps the interpoly dielectric, causing an important loss of gate capacitance and an increment of the parasitic capacitance with neighboring cells. These problems may be solved by thinning down the interpoly dielectric, yielding to less parasitic coupling and larger gate capacity. However, {{in the near future}} it will not be possible to further thin down the dielectrics without compromising the retention of the memory devices, due to the exponential increase of the leakage currents when decreasing the thickness of the dielectrics. A solution to this problem can be to replace the actual dielectrics by high-k materials that will allow using physically thicker layers without diminishing the capacitances. However, normally the high-k materials present much larger densities of electrically active defects than the current SiO 2 -based dielectrics. These defects affect the retention, the threshold voltage stability, the endurance of the devices, etc. A deep understanding {{of the impact of the}} defects on the memory characteristics, their properties (density, location, charge) and their causes is thus crucial. This work presents a study of two high-k materials that could be used to replace the interpoly dielectric: Al 2 O 3 and HfAlO. First the impact of the fabrication conditions (thermal budget, PDA ambient, material precursor, composition) on the performance of floating gate devices is stated using standard figures of merit of the non-volatile memories, such as program and erase characteristics, retention and endurance. Physical analysis, simulations and other characterization techniques, such as the Stress I-V method, are presented as well, in order to obtain a more complete picture and relate the performance of the memories to the characteristics of the defects present in the layers. It is then concluded that, in order to further understand the impact of the defects on the memory characteristics, more elaborated defect-characterization techniques are needed. An evolved charge pumping technique, a new trap spectroscopy based on charging and sensing and the photo-depopulation technique are discussed in order to illustrate the state of the art in defect characterization. However, all these techniques present several problems such as very <b>limited</b> <b>scanning</b> range, or the need for complex structures in order to maximize its output. The author proposes a recently developed technique, together with a new physics model, to cope with the limitations of the other techniques and to help to further characterize the defects present in the high-k dielectrics. Using this new method, called two-pulse CV or 2 -PCV method, it is possible to obtain a more complete defect map than with the other techniques, since a wider area is scanned (in terms of distance in the dielectric as well as in energy range) using simple large area capacitors. The defect maps obtained from different crystalline-Al 2 O 3 layers show remarkable differences when the fabrication processes are modified. However, two sets of defects are always present: a uniform distribution of traps around 2 eV below the conduction band of the material, and deeper interfacial traps between the SiO 2 and the Al 2 O 3, around ~ 3 - 4 eV below the conduction band of the high-k material. The uniform defect distribution is attributed to the grain boundaries of the crystalline materials, rather than to oxygen or aluminum vacancies or impurities, in contrast with what is suggested in several publications. The deep interfacial defects, which are observed here for the first time, are attributed to impurities or intermixing of the Al 2 O 3 at the interface with the SiO 2 layer. These deep defects help to interpret several phenomena observed in the literature, which could not be easily explained so far. The study of the HfAlO reveals that the material is more affected than Al 2 O 3 by the fabrication processes, mainly the thermal budget, and by the composition of the material itself. The thermal budget can lead to total cell failure due to the large amount of defects created at the SiO 2 and gate interfaces, as revealed by the physical analysis, simulations and trap maps obtained with the 2 -PCV method. The conclusion is therefore that the newly proposed defect-characterization method (formed by the measurement mechanism and the physics model) is a strong tool in order to extract reliable information about the defects in dielectric layers and in order to make predictions about the material performance in memory devices.

Geometric simplicity, {{efficiency}} and polarization purity make slot antenna arrays ideal solutions for many radar, communications and navigation applications, especially when high power, light weight and <b>limited</b> <b>scan</b> volume are priorities. Resonant arrays of longitudinal slots have a slot spacing of one-half guide wavelength at the design frequency, {{so that the}} slots are located at the standing wave peaks. Planar arrays are implemented using a number of rectangular waveguides (branch line guides), arranged side-by-side, while waveguides main lines located behind and {{at right angles to}} the branch lines excite the radiating waveguides via centered-inclined coupling slots. Planar slotted waveguide arrays radiate broadside beams and all radiators are designed to be in phase...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of 18 F- 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) <b>scan</b> <b>limited</b> to the original sites of lymphoma in 1 st follow-up (F/U) post-chemotherapy to reduce patient’s radiation exposure and scan time. Patients and methods: FDG PET/CT scans of 100 lymphoma patients were reviewed and the sites of disease in pre-Chemotherapy and the 1 st F/U post-chemotherapy scans were recorded. The supposed saved time from PET part of the scan and reduction in radiation dose from CT part if PET/CT <b>scan</b> <b>limited</b> to the original sites of lymphoma in 1 st F/U post-chemotherapy scan is used, were calculated. Result: 45 % of 1 st F/U post-chemotherapy PET/CT scans showed no significant residual FDG-uptake indicating complete metabolic response. Significant residual FDG-uptake at known disease sites was seen in 55 % of 1 st F/U post-chemotherapy scans indicating residual disease. No lesions with significant FDG uptake in new sites were detected in the 1 st F/U post-chemotherapy PET/CT indicating no unexpected sites of lymphoma. The supposed reduction in the mean scan time and radiation dose is 5. 3 ± 1. 47 minutes and 4. 2 ± 1. 2 mSv respectively if <b>scan</b> <b>limited</b> to the sites of known disease is used in 1 st FU-P-CHT, without missing any significant findings. Conclusion: It is not mandatory to do WB 18 F-FDG PET/CT scan in assessment of early response to chemotherapy in curable lymphoma {{and it may be}} sufficient to <b>limit</b> <b>scans</b> to the sites of known disease without missing any significant findings, resulting in significant reduction in total radiation dose and time saving...|$|R
40|$|JPL and NASA are in {{the process}} of {{developing}} ground and spacecraft antenna systems at Ka-band frequencies for future deep space applications. The use of Ka-band (32 -GHz down) communication will result in smaller ground and spacecraft antennas and associated equipment, and will provide larger bandwidths necessary for very high data rate communication and radio navigation. In this article, the use of a small phased array as a feed for a reflector antenna system with <b>limited</b> <b>scan</b> capability is addressed. Different feed and antenna configurations, as well as array architectures, are examined. Some theoretical and experimental parameters of a particular breadboard feed array developed by JPL and the University of Massachusetts are presented. Guidelines for the future direction of this effort are provided...|$|R
40|$|LC-MS/MS {{has emerged}} as the method of choice for the {{identification}} and quantification of protein sample mix-tures. For very complex samples such as complete pro-teomes, the most commonly used LC-MS/MS method, data-dependent acquisition (DDA) precursor selection, is of limited utility. The <b>limited</b> <b>scan</b> speed of current mass spectrometers along with the highly redundant selection of the most intense precursor ions generates a bias in the pool of identified proteins toward those of higher abun-dance. A directed LC-MS/MS approach that alleviates the limitations of DDA precursor ion selection by decoupling peak detection and sequencing of selected precursor ions is presented. In the first stage of the strategy, all detect-able peptide ion signals are extracted from high resolution LC-MS feature maps or aligned sets of feature maps. Th...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} Plateau type variational {{problems related}} to the size minimization of rectifiable currents. We realize the limit of a size minimizing sequence as a stationary varifold and a minimal set. Other examples of functionals to be minimized include the integral over the underlying carrying set of a power q of the multiplicity function, with 0 < q &le; 1. Because minimizing sequences may have unbounded mass we make use of a more general object called a rectifiable scan for describing the limit. This concept is motivated {{by the possibility of}} recovering a at chain from a sufficiently large collection of its slices. In case the given boundary is smooth and compact, the <b>limiting</b> <b>scan</b> has finite mass and corresponds to a rectifiable current...|$|R
