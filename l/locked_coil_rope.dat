50|$|The {{lightweight}} cable roof is {{designed as a}} classic looped cable roof containing one compression and one tension ring. While {{the majority of the}} roof is covered with a membrane, the inner edge has a glass roof. The roof of Vodafone Park is composed of 260 tons of 246 rope assemblies. The inner tension ring, which is made of 8 Ø110 mm full <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> with a single length of nearly 200 meters, is connected to the outer compression ring by radial cables that consist of full <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> with Ø110, Ø85, Ø65 and Ø45 mm.|$|R
50|$|In principle, spiral ropes are round strands as {{they have}} an {{assembly}} of layers of wires laid helically over a centre {{with at least one}} layer of wires being laid in the opposite direction to that of the outer layer. Spiral ropes can be dimensioned {{in such a way that}} they are non-rotating which means that under tension the rope torque is nearly zero.The open spiral rope consists only of round wires. The half-locked <b>coil</b> <b>rope</b> and the full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>rope</b> always have a centre made of round wires. The <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> have one or more outer layers of profile wires. They have the advantage that their construction prevents the penetration of dirt and water to a greater extent and it also protects them from loss of lubricant. In addition, they have one further very important advantage as the ends of a broken outer wire cannot leave the rope if it has the proper dimensions.|$|R

50|$|Latch and Batchelor: Founded by Mr Arthur Latch, Mr Telford Clarence Batchelor and Mr Henry Herbert Horsfall {{to develop}} Mr Batchelor’s patent of <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> Wire <b>Rope</b> and Flattened Strand, it {{was formed in}} 1884 on part of the Hay Mills site owned at that time by Webster and Horsfall Ltd. Due to its smooth outer layer <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> became {{increasing}} popular with its use in aerial ropeways and its unexpected yet excellent non-spinning properties and high breaking-strength-to-weight ratio were recognized by the mining industry and adopted worldwide. <b>Locked</b> <b>Coil</b> development continued {{with the advent of}} the half-lock Colliery Guide ropes and more use being made of galvanized wires. The company was one of the first to come under direct Government control in both World Wars. In the 1914-18 war they were the sole manufacturer of shell fuse spring wire, for example, producing 80,260 miles, along with anti-submarine netting, mine, aircraft and balloon cables.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} approach to strength assessment of stay ropes in suspension bridges is considered. The rope working condition is analyzed by in-situ magnetic testing, computational assessment of ultimate breaking load {{and evaluation of}} residual margin of safety. The diagnostic parameters – distributed and/or local faults in wires – are used as input data for mechanical model of rope structure. The model allows calculating the stresses in each wire, simulating the degradation process and evaluating the rope breaking tensile load. The safety factor of deteriorated rope is considered as a generalized parameter that specifies the rope safe operation as an element of bridge stay arrangement. Examples of integrity analysis of stranded stay <b>ropes</b> and <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> stay <b>ropes</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the fire {{behaviour}} of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> under axial loading conditions is addressed. Since there are no standards for these structural elements, ISO 834 standard curve was considered as fire model for its severity. The analysis of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> fire behaviour was carried out both from the experimental and numerical point of view, thus obtaining a complete description of rope responses. Two distinct full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> were tested and heat fluxes, temperature fields in the rope cross-section and fire endurance times were determined. An experimental campaign, aimed to establish how wires mechanical properties change with temperature, was also carried out. Subsequently, a parametric Finite Element model (FE) able to predict the rope response, undergoing to the experimental thermal and mechanical loads, was implemented, thus obtaining the time evolution of damage and the failure mechanisms for the rope. The numerical model was then validated by comparing the predicted fire endurance times with those obtained from the experimental tests {{and a very good}} agreement was found. A method for determining the fire endurance times of full-locked <b>coil</b> <b>ropes</b> by using the numerical model, once the material properties and loading conditions are established, was thus define...|$|R

50|$|Spiral strand is {{slightly}} weaker than <b>locked</b> <b>coil</b> strand. Steel spiral strand cables have a Young's modulus, E of 150±10 kN/mm² (or 150±10 GPa) {{and come in}} sizes from 3 to 90 mm diameter.
