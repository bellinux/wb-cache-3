40|$|We present {{evidence}} that Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) strings pass through {{each other for}} very high speeds of approach due to a double intercommutation. In near-perpendicular collisions numerical simulations give threshold speeds bounded above by ∼ 0. 97 c for type I, and by ∼ 0. 90 c for deep type II strings. The second intercommutation occurs because at ultra high collision speeds, the connecting segments formed by the first intercommutation are nearly static and almost antiparallel, which gives them time to interact and annihilate. A simple model explains the rough features of the threshold velocity dependence with the incidence angle. For deep type II strings and large incidence angles a second effect becomes dominant, {{the formation of a}} loop that catches up with the interpolating segments. The loop is related to the observed vortex - antivortex reemergence in two-dimensions. In this case the critical value for double intercommutation can become much lower.

On the lotus leaf, however, the droplets bounced off with intensive vibrations instead of being partially pinned on the surface because of the irregular distribution of microbumps on the leaf.

The main purpose of this work is to clarify {{the differences between the}} spherical and cylindrical cavity expansion models and their scope of application in predicting the penetration depths of concrete targets. The factors that influence the dynamic cavity expansion process of concrete materials were first examined. Based on numerical results, the relationship between expansion pressure and velocity was established. Then the parameters in the Forrestal's formula were fitted to have a convenient and effective prediction of the penetration depth. Results showed that both the spherical and cylindrical cavity expansion models can accurately predict the depth of penetration when the initial velocity is lower than 800 m/s. However, the prediction accuracy decreases with the increasing of the initial velocity and diameters of the projectiles. Based on our results, it can be concluded that when the initial velocity is higher than the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity,</b> the cylindrical cavity expansion model performs better than the spherical cavity expansion model in predicting the penetration depth, while when the initial velocity is <b>lower</b> than the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> the conclusion is quite the contrary.

40|$|AbstractLife {{safety is}} one of the {{objectives}} of fire engineering design for road tunnels. Fire engineering design requires maintaining a tenable condition {{for a period of time}} to allow occupants to evacuate to safety. This will be achieved by controlling the smoke under credible design fire scenarios in a tunnel. The critical location in a tunnel fire emergency condition is the tunnel region upstream of the fire, where occupants are most likely to reside as traffic jam can usually be created by the fire incident. Tenability for the downstream region of fire is not the main focus of this research because vehicles can generally drive out of the tunnel at a higher speed than that of the smoke flow, and local damper smoke extraction can help keep a tenable condition in the downstream region beyond the local fire zone, in case there is a congestion in the downstream region of the fire. To maintain a tenable condition in the upstream tunnel region from the fire incident, the required minimum longitudinal flow velocity to prevent smoke backlayering can be calculated based on NFPA 502 recommendations. This <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> takes no credit of the smoke extraction or active overhead fixed fire suppression effects. Smoke extraction with a dedicated smoke duct along the entire length of the tunnel is gaining popularity because of its efficiency and robustness in providing a tenable environment in the tunnel with unknown upstream and downstream traffic conditions. In this paper, a modified <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> to control smoke back-layering while smoke extraction and fire suppression systems are operating has been analyzed. This modified <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> is approximately 20 % <b>lower</b> than the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> that is recommended in NFPA 502. This allows significant savings on ventilation capacity for road tunnels which have a local smoke exhaust capability using a dedicated smoke duct. It is concluded that the smoke extraction performance is similar whether using ceiling dampers or vertical wall-mounted dampers for smoke capture to maintain tunnel tenability. However, tunnel gradients play a major role on the modified <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> for a nominated design fire and the required smoke extraction rate...|$|R

These are the Fourier–Repeating-unit method, the Periodic-Fourier method and the Modified-phase method.

The third method, not presented elsewhere before, is faster and simpler; it is only valid for velocities of moving loads <b>lower</b> than the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> of the track, but this “velocity effect” is of no consequence for underground railways. Discontinuity of slab provides a parametric excitation for moving loads over floating-slab tracks. It is shown that in the frequency range of ground-borne vibration, more vibration propagates from such tracks at resonance frequencies of the slabs, compared with tracks with continuous slabs. It is found that the velocity effect is insignificant when calculating displacements of a typical floating-slab track under oscillating moving loads with velocities less than 100 km/hr. However, a correction {{has to be made}} to account for the right phase between the input force and the output displacement. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Smoke back-layering flow {{length is}} {{the length of}} the {{reversed}} smoke flow upstream of the fire when the longitudinal ventilation velocity is <b>lower</b> than the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity.</b> This paper experimentally investigates the smoke back-layering flow length of longitudinal ventilated tunnel fires with a vertical shaft in the upstream (0. 5 - 4. 0 m from the fire source) using a 1 / 10 reduced-scale subway tunnel model. Experimental results show that the vertical shaft in the upstream can control the smoke back-layering flow length within a relatively limited range, compared to the tunnel without vertical shaft. Moreover, for the cases that the fire source is not located exactly below the vertical shaft, the most appropriate dimensionless distance between the vertical shaft and fire source is 3, resulting in the shortest smoke back-layering flow length. By introducing a concept of virtual fire source below vertical shaft, a new empirical model was further deduced to predict the smoke back-layering flow length. Its predictions fit reasonably well when the dimensionless longitudinal flow velocity is less than 0. 19. Beyond that, the predictions are little higher than the experiments, which is because some of the assumptions in this model are invalid under higher longitudinal ventilation velocity...|$|R

40|$|A {{phenomenon}} of energy dissipation in Bose-Einstein condensates is studied {{based on a}} microscopic model for the motion of impurity. <b>Critical</b> <b>velocities</b> for onset of energy dissipation are obtained for periodic motions, such as a dipole-like oscillation and a circular motion. The first example {{is similar to a}} series of MIT group experiments settings where the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> was observed much below the Landau <b>critical</b> <b>velocity.</b> The appearance of the smaller values for the <b>critical</b> <b>velocity</b> is also found in our model, even in the homogeneous condensate in the thermodynamic limit. This suggests that the landau criterion be reexamined in the absence of quantized vortices in the bulk limit. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
