40|$|A {{program to}} detect and monitor the {{presence}} of trace constituents in the earth's atmosphere by using the Limb Scanning <b>Infrared</b> <b>Radiometer</b> (LSIR) is reported. The LSIR, which makes radiometric measurements of the earth's <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> profile from a space platform, contains a detector assembly that must be cooled to a temperature of 65 + or - 2 K. The feasibility of cooling the NASA-type detector package with Vuilleumier (VM) cryogenic refrigerator was investigated to develop a preliminary conceptual design of a VM refrigerator that is compatible with a flight-type LSIR instrument. The scope of the LSIR program consists of analytical and design work to establish the size, weight, power consumption, interface requirements, and other important characteristics of a cryogenic cooler that would {{meet the requirements of}} the LSIR. The cryogenic cooling requirements under the conditions that NASA specified were defined. Following this, a parametric performance analysis was performed to define the interrelationships between refrigeration characteristics and mission requirements. This effort led to the selection of an optimum refrigerator design for the LSIR mission...|$|R

40|$|The SABER {{instrument}} {{on board}} the TIMED Satellite is a limb scanning <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometer</b> designed to measure temperature and minor constituent vertical profiles and energetics parameters in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT). The measurements have been performed continuously since January 25, 2002 to provide excellent coverage for both hemispheres. The Leibniz-Institute of Atmospheric Physics (LAP) at Kuehlungsborn, Germany (54 N, 12 E) operates two lidar instruments, using three different temperature measurement methods, optimized for three altitude ranges. The total altitude range of the lidar installation lies from 1 to 105 km. Another instrument used for intercomparison is the ALOMAR RMR lidar, located at Andoya, Norway (69 N, 16 E). We have searched the SABER and lidar datasets for coincidental common volume measurements within plus or minus 1 degree in latitude, plus or minus 2 degrees in longitude and approx. 1 hour {{in time for the}} sake of (a) comparison of measured temperatures; (b) validation of the models used in SABER data analysis; and (c) extracting new information about MLT parameters. In this work we applied the non-LTE ALI-ARMS code designed to calculate the nonequilibrium radiance in different viewing geometries to the analysis of measurements which satisfied these search criteria. The results of this analysis (a) support the application of higher value of CO 2 -O quenching rate (6 e- 12 cubic centimeters per second) by the non-LTE temperature retrievals from the SABER 15 micrometer <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data, and (b) demonstrate the importance of accounting for the vibrational-vibrational energy exchange among the CO 2 isotopes for accurate temperature retrievals. Using temperature profiles obtained in lidar measurements as inputs for the retrieval algorithm we also retrieved the nighttime CO 2 densities from the SABER 15 micrometer <b>limb</b> <b>radiances</b> and compared them with the model and climatology CO 2 data used in the SABER nighttime temperature retrievals...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>limb</b> {{scattered}} <b>radiance</b> profiles {{to retrieve}} ozone profiles {{is currently being}} investigated. The goal is to produce ozone profiles with better vertical resolution than is available with the Backscattered Ultraviolet (BUV) technique and with much greater spatial and temporal coverage than with the solar occultation method (i. e. SAGE II). This method, which uses UV and visible light scattered from the earth's limb, has recently been proven to work for clear sky cases with data from the STS- 87 flight of the Shuttle Ozone Sounding Limb Experiment/Limb Ozone Retrieval Experiment (SOLSE/LORE). As to be expected, clouds have a substantial impact upon the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> (increasing the radiance as much as 80 - 100 % is some cases). Here we {{use a variety of}} radiative transfer models and limited SOLSE/LORE data to investigate the effect of clouds upon the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> at wavelengths used in the ozone retrieval (approximately 600 nm).

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of global ozone {{in the atmosphere}} is a necessary prerequisite to understanding atmospheric chemistry and managing atmospheric constituents. Satellite systems {{have been developed to}} measure ozone and other constituents accurately on a global basis. However, within this area there is considerable room for advancement in the techniques used to measure ozone from a satellite platform. The Canadian instrument OSIRIS onboard the Swedish-led satellite Odin contains an optical spectrograph that is used for measuring <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> in the atmosphere. There are various proven techniques to convert <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data into ozone density profiles. This work presents a new technique that combines radiance data from both the Chappuis and Hartley-Huggins bands to retrieve ozone density. The new technique extends the current upper limit of Chappuis-only retrievals from 40 km to 60 km. The major portion of this work describes the implementation of this new technique. Briefly, a Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstructive Technique, together with the SaskTRAN radiative transfer model, is used to invert the <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data into ozone density profiles. An overview of the resulting ozone density profiles is presented together with comparisons against other ozone products as a first order verification of the results. This work will be used to produce a new ozone data set from the OSIRIS <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> data consisting of ozone density profiles that are valid to 60 km...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} method for retrieving stratospheric aerosol extinction profiles from a global satellite data set. Ten years of <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> measurements with the instrument SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) onboard the European environmental research satellite Envisat provides the unique opportunity to derive a stratospheric aerosol extinction data set over a long time period (2002 2012) with a good global coverage on a daily basis. Stratospheric sulfate aerosols {{have a significant impact}} on climate but the determination is still subject to large uncertainties. To improve our understanding of climate relevant processes an accurate determination of stratospheric aerosol properties is crucial. Deriving stratospheric aerosol extinction from <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> spectra requires complicated radiative transfer calculations. An algorithm based on a color-index approach combining normalized <b>limb</b> <b>radiance</b> spectra at 470 and 750 nm is applied to retrieve aerosol extinction profiles between 12 and 35 km altitude. A Mie phase function for typical background aerosols is implemented. The resulting SCIAMACHY stratospheric aerosol data set can serve as a foundation for climatological interpretation with respect to natural variability and anthropogenic impact...|$|R
