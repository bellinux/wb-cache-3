5|$|<b>Lipid</b> {{asymmetry}} arises, {{at least}} in part, {{from the fact that}} most phospholipids are synthesised and initially inserted into the inner monolayer: those that constitute the outer monolayer are then transported from the inner monolayer by a class of enzymes called flippases. Other lipids, such as sphingomyelin, appear to be synthesised at the external leaflet. Flippases are members of a larger family of <b>lipid</b> transport molecules that also includes floppases, which transfer lipids in the opposite direction, and scramblases, which randomize <b>lipid</b> distribution across <b>lipid</b> bilayers (as in apoptotic cells). In any case, once <b>lipid</b> asymmetry is established, it does not normally dissipate quickly because spontaneous flip-flop of lipids between leaflets is extremely slow.|$|E
5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of <b>lipid</b> intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of <b>lipid</b> transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for <b>lipid</b> flipping between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates <b>lipid</b> transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for <b>lipid</b> flipping.|$|E
5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was {{made as a}} way of explaining how the various <b>lipid</b> membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through <b>lipid</b> flow from the sites of <b>lipid</b> synthesis. The idea of <b>lipid</b> flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free <b>lipid</b> components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and <b>lipid</b> flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

The fluorescence polarization of perylene was followed in vesicles of unfractionated <b>lipids</b> and polar <b>lipids</b> as a function of temperature in 3. 4 M solutions of NaCl, NaNO 3, and KSCN, and it was found that vesicles of unfractionated <b>lipids</b> were more perturbed by chaotropic agents than polar <b>lipids.</b> The dependence of the relaxation times of perylene on temperature was studied in cell envelopes and in vesicles prepared from polar <b>lipids,</b> unfractionated <b>lipids,</b> and mixtures of polar and neutral <b>lipids...</b>|$|R

5|$|The phase {{behavior}} of <b>lipid</b> bilayers is determined {{largely by the}} strength of the attractive Van der Waals interactions between adjacent <b>lipid</b> molecules. Longer-tailed lipids have more area over which to interact, increasing the strength of this interaction and, as a consequence, decreasing the <b>lipid</b> mobility. Thus, at a given temperature, a short-tailed <b>lipid</b> will be more fluid than an otherwise identical long-tailed <b>lipid.</b> Transition temperature can also be affected by the degree of unsaturation of the <b>lipid</b> tails. An unsaturated double bond can produce a kink in the alkane chain, disrupting the <b>lipid</b> packing. This disruption creates extra free space within the bilayer that allows additional flexibility in the adjacent chains. An example of this effect can be noted in everyday life as butter, which has a large percentage saturated fats, is solid at room temperature while vegetable oil, which is mostly unsaturated, is liquid.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the <b>lipid</b> bilayer in biology is to {{separate}} aqueous compartments from their surroundings. Without some form of barrier delineating “self” from “non-self,” {{it is difficult to}} even define the concept of an organism or of life. This barrier {{takes the form of a}} <b>lipid</b> bilayer in all known life forms except for a few species of archaea that utilize a specially adapted <b>lipid</b> monolayer. It has even been proposed that the very first form of life may have been a simple <b>lipid</b> vesicle with virtually its sole biosynthetic capability being the production of more phospholipids. The partitioning ability of the <b>lipid</b> bilayer is based on the fact that hydrophilic molecules cannot easily cross the hydrophobic bilayer core, as discussed in Transport across the bilayer below. The nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts have two <b>lipid</b> bilayers, while other sub-cellular structures are surrounded by a single <b>lipid</b> bilayer (such as the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi apparatus and lysosomes). See Organelle.|$|E
5|$|A {{supported}} <b>lipid</b> bilayer (SLB) {{as described}} above has achieved commercial success as a screening technique to measure the permeability of drugs.

In ester <b>lipids</b> this is an ester bond, whereas in ether <b>lipids</b> this is an ether bond. Ether bonds are chemically more resistant than ester bonds. This stability might help archaea to survive extreme temperatures and very acidic or alkaline environments.

40|$|Although the {{advantages}} of in vitro n. m. r. analysis of cellular <b>lipids</b> have been documented, this purely n. m. r. approach also has drawbacks. Rapid and quantitative separation of total <b>lipids</b> into neutral <b>lipids,</b> non-esterified fatty acids, non-acidic phospholipids and acidic phospholipids using Bond Elut ion-exchange columns as demonstrated here permitted a more quantitative and complete n. m. r. analysis of glycerides, cholesterol, saturated and unsaturated sphingolipids and ether <b>lipids,</b> {{as well as of}} diacylcholine and ethanolamine <b>lipids.</b> Acidic <b>lipids</b> were also analysed. The fatty acid compositions of the intact <b>lipids</b> {{in each of the four}} Bond Elut fractions were determined from the n. m. r. spectrum of each fraction...|$|R
5|$|Another {{potential}} {{application of}} <b>lipid</b> bilayers is {{the field of}} biosensors. Since the <b>lipid</b> bilayer is the barrier between the interior and exterior of the cell, {{it is also the}} site of extensive signal transduction. Researchers over the years have tried to harness this potential to develop a bilayer-based device for clinical diagnosis or bioterrorism detection. Progress has been slow in this area and, although a few companies have developed automated lipid-based detection systems, they are still targeted at the research community. These include Biacore (now GE Healthcare Life Sciences), which offers a disposable chip for utilizing <b>lipid</b> bilayers in studies of binding kinetics and Nanion Inc., which has developed an automated patch clamping system. Other, more exotic applications are also being pursued {{such as the use of}} <b>lipid</b> bilayer membrane pores for DNA sequencing by Oxford Nanolabs. To date, this technology has not proven commercially viable.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, the {{development}} of model membranes confirmed that the <b>lipid</b> bilayer is a stable structure that can exist independent of proteins. By “painting” a solution of <b>lipid</b> in organic solvent across an aperture, Mueller and Rudin were able to create an artificial bilayer and determine that this exhibited lateral fluidity, high electrical resistance and self-healing in response to puncture, all of which are properties of a natural cell membrane. A few years later, Alec Bangham showed that bilayers, in the form of <b>lipid</b> vesicles, could also be formed simply by exposing a dried <b>lipid</b> sample to water. This was an important advance, since it demonstrated that <b>lipid</b> bilayers form spontaneously via self assembly and do not require a patterned support structure.|$|E
5|$|At a given {{temperature}} a <b>lipid</b> bilayer {{can exist}} in either a liquid or a gel (solid) phase. All lipids have a characteristic temperature at which they transition (melt) from the gel to liquid phase. In both phases the <b>lipid</b> molecules are prevented from flip-flopping across the bilayer, but in liquid phase bilayers a given <b>lipid</b> will exchange locations with its neighbor millions of times a second. This random walk exchange allows <b>lipid</b> to diffuse and thus wander {{across the surface of}} the membrane. Unlike liquid phase bilayers, the lipids in a gel phase bilayer have less mobility.|$|E

500|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} broadly define <b>lipids</b> as hydrophobic or amphiphilic small molecules; the amphiphilic {{nature of}} some <b>lipids</b> {{allows them to}} form structures such as vesicles, multilamellar/unilamellar liposomes, or membranes in an aqueous environment. Biological <b>lipids</b> originate entirely or in part from two distinct types of biochemical subunits or [...] "building-blocks": ketoacyl and isoprene groups.

5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. <b>Lipid</b> bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only fluorescent molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural <b>lipid</b> bilayers are not fluorescent, so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a <b>lipid</b> bilayer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lipid</b> bilayers are {{complicated}} molecular systems with many degrees of freedom.

50|$|Blood <b>lipids</b> (or blood fats) are <b>lipids</b> in the blood, either free or {{bound to}} other molecules.

5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the endoplasmic reticulum, <b>lipid</b> particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} <b>lipid</b> synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane.

The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that <b>lipid</b> transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|The <b>lipid</b> bilayer (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of {{two layers}} of <b>lipid</b> molecules.
