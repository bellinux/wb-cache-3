25|$|During film {{development}} the <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> is {{intensified by}} {{addition of a}} chemical, typically hydroquinone, that selectivity reduces those grains which contain atoms of silver. The process, which is sensitive to temperature and concentration, will completely reduce grains to silver metal, intensifying the <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> {{on the order of}} 1010 to 1011. This step demonstrates the advantage and superiority of silver halides over other systems: the <b>latent</b> <b>image,</b> which takes only milliseconds to form and is invisible, is sufficient to produce a full image from it.|$|E
25|$|Further {{research}} into this mechanism {{revealed that the}} photographic properties of silver halides (in particular AgBr) were a result of deviations from an ideal crystal structure. Factors such as crystal growth, impurities, and surface defects all affect concentrations of point ionic defects and electronic traps, which affect the sensitivity to light and allow {{for the formation of}} a <b>latent</b> <b>image.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first 50 million {{pieces of}} the new RM50 {{banknote}} features Malaysia's first Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the historic declaration of Malaya's independence, and the logo of the 50th Anniversary of Independence on the reverse. Security features on the banknote include a watermarked portrait of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a security thread, micro letterings, fluorescent elements visible only under ultraviolet light, a multi coloured <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> which changes colour when viewed at different angles, and a holographic stripe {{at the side of}} the note and an image that is visible only via a moiré effect to prevent counterfeiting using photocopiers. Circulation for the first edition of this new RM50 banknote was eventually curtailed by the Central Bank due to the various Malaysia banks' automatic teller machines inability to accept it. The bank began to re-release the new series for general circulation beginning 15 July 2009 without the 50th Anniversary logo. This edition include new enhanced security features such as two color number fluorescents and security fibres.|$|E
50|$|Extensive anti-counterfeiting {{measures}} {{are present in}} the banknote. They include intaglio printing, holograms, microprinting, fluorescent ink, <b>latent</b> <b>images,</b> watermarks, and angle-sensitive ink.|$|R

25|$|In 1993 Indigo {{launched}} the E-Print 1000 at IPEX trade show. The E-Print 1000 eliminated the expense and labor of the plate-printing setup process, printing {{directly from a}} computer file, and enabled inexpensive short-run color printing. Images not only could be readily changed, they could be changed from page to page, requiring neither additional setup or pauses in the print run. Instead of printing to metal plates, the E-Print created a <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> on the Photo Imaging Plate or PIP {{through the use of}} an electrostatic charge. This charged area would then attract the charged ElectroInk, which would in turn be transferred to the ITM or blanket, and then again transfer from the blanket to the paper or other substrate. Because 100% of the ink transfers from PIP to blanket to substrate, a different image and color could be printed with each rotation of the press. At the same time, Indigo's ElectroInk-based color inks offered print quality rivaling that of traditional printing processes. Almost 20 years later, and despite the numerous technological improvements, Indigo presses are still based on this core technology.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a British inventor, William Fox Talbot, {{had succeeded}} in making crude but {{reasonably}} light-fast silver images on paper as early as 1834 but had kept his work secret. After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the calotype process, which used the chemical development of a <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent negative {{which could be used}} to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as Daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera. Talbot's famous tiny paper negative of the Oriel window in Lacock Abbey, {{one of a number of}} camera photographs he made in the summer of 1835, may be the oldest camera negative in existence.|$|E

ESR studies of un-irradiated silver halides revealed the presence of at least two instrinsic centres which might act as the special sites at which <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> are formed during the primary photographic process. On irradiation, these materials exhibited additional signals which were thought to be CESR resonances associated with pseudo- molecular silver particles, Ag 0 n. The size of these centres is uncertain. The data suggests that they consist of more than 5 - 6 atoms and are smaller than 45 A.

2500|$|Typically, a lens is used {{to focus}} the light {{reflected}} or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible <b>latent</b> <b>image,</b> which is later chemically [...] "developed" [...] into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on {{the purpose of the}} photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.|$|E
2500|$|Romero {{embarked}} {{upon his}} career in the film industry while attending Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. He directed and produced television commercials and industrial films for The <b>Latent</b> <b>Image,</b> in the 1960s, a company he co-founded with friends John Russo, and Russell Streiner. The trio grew bored making commercials and wanted to film a horror movie during this period. They wanted to capitalize on the film industry's [...] "thirst for the bizarre", according to Romero. He and Streiner contacted Karl Hardman and Marilyn Eastman, president and vice president respectively of a Pittsburgh-based industrial film firm called Hardman Associates, Inc. They pitched their idea for a then-untitled horror film. A production company, conceived by Romero, called Image Ten, was formed which included Romero, Russo, Streiner, Hardman and Eastman. The initial budget was $6,000 with the ten members of the production company, investing $600 each for a share of the profits. Another ten investors were found when it was found that another $6,000 was required but this was also soon found to be inadequate. Image Ten eventually raised approximately $114,000 for the budget.|$|E

40|$|Archetypal {{scenarios}} for change detection generally consider two images acquired through sensors {{of the same}} modality. However, {{in some specific cases}} such as emergency situations, the only images available may be those acquired through different kinds of sensors. More precisely, this paper addresses the problem of detecting changes between two multi-band optical images characterized by different spatial and spectral resolutions. This sensor dissimilarity introduces additional issues in the context of operational change detection. To alleviate these issues, classical change detection methods are applied after independent preprocessing steps (e. g., resampling) used to get the same spatial and spectral resolutions for the pair of observed images. Nevertheless, these preprocessing steps tend to throw away relevant information. Conversely, in this paper, we propose a method that more effectively uses the available information by modeling the two observed images as spatial and spectral versions of two (unobserved) <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> characterized by the same high spatial and high spectral resolutions. As they cover the same scene, these <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> are expected to be globally similar except for possible changes in sparse spatial locations. Thus, the change detection task is envisioned through a robust multi-band image fusion method which enforces the differences between the estimated <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> to be spatially sparse. This robust fusion problem is formulated as an inverse problem which is iteratively solved using an efficient block-coordinate descent algorithm. The proposed method is applied to real panchormatic/multispectral and hyperspectral images with simulated realistic changes. A comparison with state-of-the-art change detection methods evidences the accuracy of the proposed strategy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel probabilistic model for representing objects that {{change in appearance}} {{as a result of}} changes in pose, due to small deformations of their sub-parts and the relative spatial transformation of sub-parts of the object. We call the model a probabilistic montage. The model is based upon the idea that an image can be represented as a montage using many, small transformed and cropped patches from a collection of <b>latent</b> <b>images.</b> The approach is similar to that which might be employed by a police artist who might represent an image of a criminal suspect's face using a montage of face parts cut out of a "library" of face parts. In contrast, for our model, we learn the library of small <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> from a set of examples of objects that are changing in shape. In our approach, rst the image is divided into a grid of sub-images. Each sub-image in the grid acts as window that crops a piece out of one of a collection of slightly larger images possible for that location in the image. We illustrate various probability models {{that can be used to}} encode the appropriate relationships for <b>latent</b> <b>images</b> and cropping transformations among the dierent patches. In this paper we present the complete algorithm for a tree-structured model. We show how the approach and model are able to nd representations of the appearance of full body images of people in motion. We show how our approach can be used to learn representations of objects in an "unsupervised " manner and present results using our model for recognition and tracking purposes in a "supervised" manner...|$|R
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the <b>latent</b> <b>image.</b> [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
6000|$|A curious method {{with paper}} and {{ordinary}} writing ink, lately contrived by Dr. Forgeot, {{is analogous to}} lithography. He has described {{in one of the}} many interesting pamphlets published by the [...] "Laboratoire d'Anthropologie Criminelle" [...] of Lyon (Stenheil, 2 Rue Casimir-Delavigne, Paris), his new process of rendering visible the previously invisible details of such faint finger prints as thieves may have left on anything they have handled, the object being to show how evidence may sometimes be obtained for their identification. It is well known that pressure of the hand on the polished surface of glass or metal leaves a <b>latent</b> <b>image</b> very difficult to destroy, and which may be rendered visible by suitable applications, but few probably have suspected that this may be the case, to a considerable degree, with ordinary paper. Dr. Forgeot has shown that if a slightly greasy hand, such for example as a hand that has just been passed through the hair, be pressed on clean paper, and if common ink be afterwards brushed lightly over the paper, it will refuse to lie thickly on the greasy parts, and that the result will be a very fair picture of the minute markings on the fingers. He has even used these productions as negatives, and printed good photographs from them. He has also sent me a photographic print made from a piece of glass which had been exposed to the vapour of hydrofluoric acid, after having been touched by a greasy hand. I have made many trials of his method with considerable success. It affords a way of obtaining serviceable impressions in the absence of better means. Dr. Forgeot's pamphlet describes other methods of a generally similar kind, which he has found to be less good than the above.|$|E

In crime sense fingerprints have been extensively used for identification of criminals. Fingerprints are classified as rolled, plain and latent fingerprints. Latent fingerprints are lifted from surface of objects that are unintentionally touched by person. Latent means poor quality of images or unclear image i. e. smudgy, blurred, moist, small area or fingerprints that contains fewer amount of minutiae. Matching latent fingerprints over rolled or plain fingerprints that is difficult task. Therefore, it is necessary to extract all fingerprint features that are present in <b>latent</b> fingerprint <b>images</b> for accurate matching. Although tremendous progress has been made AFIS (Auto-mated Fingerprint Identification System), this system works well only in that case where rolled and plain fingerprint images.
