5|$|Eorzea's history {{revolves}} around {{a series of}} Umbral and Astral Eras. Umbral Eras are periods of great calamity—the First Umbral Era {{marked the end of}} the age of gods. The guardian deities of Eorzea, known as the Twelve, retreated from direct involvement with mortals during this time. Umbral Eras are followed by periods of enlightenment and cultural growth called Astral Eras. The Third Astral Era was particularly noted for presiding over the Allagan Empire, an ancient civilization whose technology far exceeds the level of the modern age. Each Umbral and Astral Era pair corresponds to one of the six basic elements—wind, <b>lightning,</b> <b>fire,</b> earth, ice, and water. The Sixth Umbral Era was believed to be the last and the civilized races hoped the Sixth Astral Era would last forever. However, five years {{prior to the start of}} the game, the Garlean Empire catalyzed a series of events that would lead to the Seventh Umbral Era.|$|E
2500|$|The highest {{grade of}} fire is the Atash Behram, [...] "Fire of victory", and its {{establishment}} and consecration {{is the most}} elaborate of the three. It involves the gathering of 16 different [...] "kinds of fire", that is, fires gathered from 16 different sources, including <b>lightning,</b> <b>fire</b> from a cremation pyre, fire from trades where a furnace is operated, and fires from the hearths as {{is also the case}} for the Atash Adaran. Each of the 16 fires is then subject to a purification ritual before it joins the others. 32 priests are required for the consecration ceremony, which can take up to a year to complete.|$|E
2500|$|Moses {{returns to}} Egypt and fails to {{convince}} the Pharaoh to release the Israelites. [...] God smites the Egyptians with 10 terrible plagues (Plagues of Egypt) including a river of blood, many frogs, {{and the death of}} first-born sons. [...] Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage after a final chase when the Pharaoh reneges on his coerced consent (Crossing the Red Sea and Yam Suph). The desert proves arduous, and the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God provides manna and miraculous water for them. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses' father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints judges over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather {{at the foot of the}} mountain, and with thunder and <b>lightning,</b> <b>fire</b> and clouds of smoke, and the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, God appears on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice [...] of God. Moses is told to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the Ten Commandments (the Ethical Decalogue) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the presence of God, who pronounces the Covenant Code (a detailed code of ritual and civil law), and promises Canaan to them if they obey. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain where he remains for 40 days and 40 nights. At the conclusion of the 40 days and 40 nights, Moses returns holding the set of stone tablets.|$|E
40|$|Future {{climate change}} could have {{significant}} repercussions for lightning-caused wildfires. Two empirical fire models are presented relating {{the frequency of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> and the area burned by these fires to the effective precipitation {{and the frequency of}} thunderstorm activity. One model deals with the seasonal variations in <b>lightning</b> <b>fires,</b> while the second model deals with the interannual variations of <b>lightning</b> <b>fires.</b> These fire models are then used with the Goddard Institute for Space Studies General Circulation Model to investigate possible changes in fire frequency and area burned in a 2 X CO 2 climate. In the United States, the annual mean number of <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> increases by 44 %, while the area burned increases by 78 %. On a global scale, the largest increase in <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> can be expected in untouched tropical ecosystems where few natural fires occur today...|$|R

2500|$|Jaime Reyes is a {{featured}} {{character in}} the animated series , voiced by actor Will Friedle. In the pilot episode [...] "The Rise of the Blue Beetle!", Jaime has a central role while fighting Kanjar Ro. Jaime makes another appearance in the episode [...] "Invasion of the Secret Santas!", assisting Batman in fighting the Sportsmaster and his henchmen and inviting Batman to his family's Christmas Eve dinner. Jaime appeared again fighting Planet Master alongside Aquaman in [...] "Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!". Blue Beetle also appears in the episodes [...] "Deep Cover for Batman!" [...] and [...] "Game Over for Owlman!". In {{the first part of}} the story, an alternate universe version named Scarlet Scarab is shown as a member of the Injustice Syndicate led by Owlman. Wearing a red version of the suit that can also talk, Scarlet Scarab mentions to his sentient suit that he has the heart of a true hero, finishing his statement with [...] "I keep it in a jar in the back of my closet". In the episode [...] "Night of the Huntress!", Blue Beetle, Batman, and the Huntress have to stop the gangsters Baby-Face and Mrs. Manface. Blue Beetle develops a crush on Huntress in the episode. Reyes appeared again in [...] "The Fate of Equinox!" [...] where he, along with Doctor Fate, Aquaman, Black Canary, Black <b>Lightning,</b> <b>Fire,</b> the original Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Plastic Man and Red Tornado temporarily gave their powers to Batman, turning the Dark Knight into Bat Monolith to battle the omnipotent Equinox. In [...] "Revenge of the Reach!", Jaime learns that his Scarab is a part of the Reach. His suit temporarily takes control of him and has him shut down the defenses around Oa, allowing the Reach to invade. Fortunately, Jaime regains control of his suit, reminding it that what they did was of their will, not the Reach's. Channeling the energy of the Green Lanterns through his suit, Blue Beetle is able to free all those under the Reach's control. The Guardians of the Universe then ask Jaime for his scarab so it can be destroyed along with the others, but Guy Gardner convinces them that Jaime proved he was the suit's master.|$|E

40|$|In western North America, the carbon-rich {{boreal forest}} is {{experiencing}} warmer temperatures, drier conditions and {{larger and more}} frequent wildfires. However, the fire regime is also affected by direct human activities through suppression, ignition, and land use changes. Models are important predictive tools for understanding future conditions but {{they are based on}} regional generalizations of wildfire behavior and weather that do not adequately account for the complexity of human–fire interactions. To achieve {{a better understanding of the}} intensity of human influence on fires in this sparsely populated area and to quantify differences between human and <b>lightning</b> <b>fires,</b> we analyzed fires by both ignition types in regard to human proximity in urban (the Fairbanks subregion) and rural areas of interior Alaska using spatial (Geographic Information Systems) and quantitative analysis methods. We found substantial differences in drivers of wildfire: while increases in fire ignitions and area burned were caused by lightning in rural interior Alaska, in the Fairbanks subregion these increases were due to human fires, especially in the wildland urban interface. <b>Lightning</b> <b>fires</b> are starting earlier and fires are burning longer, which is much more pronounced in the Fairbanks subregion than in rural areas. Human <b>fires</b> differed from <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> in several ways: they started closer to settlements and highways, burned for a shorter duration, were concentrated in the Fairbanks subregion, and often occurred outside the brief seasonal window for <b>lightning</b> <b>fires.</b> This study provides important insights that improve our understanding of the direct human influence on recently observed changes in wildfire regime with implications for both fire modeling and fire management...|$|R
60|$|Then Hannah {{knew that}} Oyster McShamus {{had seen her}} with Ian beside the burn. She turned and fled from the house. Straight up the road she ran across towards the manor-house of Aucherlocherty to warn Ian. To save him from her father's wrath, that was her one thought. Night {{gathered}} about the Highland girl as she ran. The rain clouds and the gathering storm hung low with fitful lightning overhead. She still ran on. About her was the rolling of the thunder and the angry roaring of the swollen burn. Then the storm broke upon the darkness with all the fury of the Highland gale. They sky was rent with the fierce play of the elements. Yet on Hannah ran. Again and again the lightning hit her, but she ran on still. She fell over the stones, tripped and stumbled in the ruts, butted into the hedges, cannoned off against the stone walls. But she never stopped. She went quicker and quicker. The storm was awful. <b>Lightning,</b> <b>fire,</b> flame, and thunder were all about her. Trees were falling, hurdles were flying, birds were being struck by lightning. Dogs, sheep and even cattle were hurled through the air.|$|E

50|$|Fire {{is also an}} {{important}} regulator of range vegetation, whether set by humans or resulting from <b>lightning.</b> <b>Fires</b> tend to reduce the abundance of woody plants and promote herbaceous plants including grasses, forbs, and grass-like plants. The suppression or reduction of periodic wildfires from desert shrublands, savannas, or woodlands frequently invites the dominance of trees and shrubs to the near exclusion of grasses and forbs.|$|R

50|$|The role of {{fire in the}} {{longleaf}} pine ecosystem was {{and still}} is today a key component in regeneration and shaping of the ecosystem. In pre-European establishment years, Native Americans set fires quite regularly. By doing so, they benefited their needs of establishing hunting grounds, homesteads, and safe havens. While achieving their goals, they were enriching the longleaf pine ecosystem by shaping the dynamics of the system. Wildfire also {{played a role in the}} ecosystem. Thunderstorms moved into the South in the summer months, and <b>lightning</b> strikes ignited <b>fires.</b> Once lit by humans or <b>lightning,</b> <b>fires</b> burned across the landscape for days, weeks, and even months due to the lack of habitat fragmentation by roads, railroads, or cities.|$|R
30|$|This {{assumption}} {{implies that}} the natural (pre-European) fire regime was one of infrequent (at least decadal), extensive, high intensity wildfires ignited by lightning, and that the natural vegetation was mostly thickly wooded. However, prehistoric and historic records of fire regimes and vegetation contradict this. For example, Matthew Flinders (1814) described thickly wooded vegetation and evidence of infrequent high intensity <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> on the uninhabited Kangaroo Island in 1802. He contrasted this environment with continental Australia where human fires were prevalent.|$|R
30|$|We {{examined}} climate, lightning, and lightning-fire data {{to determine}} which cambial phenology phase or phases corresponded with the lightning-fire season. We downloaded daily cloud-to-ground lightning flash (or strike) data from the National Lightning Detection Network for the period 1986 to 2013 for our counties of interest (Gulf County, Florida; Highlands County, Florida; and Thomas County, Georgia) and then calculated a daily mean number of flashes per month for each county. The Florida Forest Service provided lightning-fire data for a similar time period (1981 to 2016) and included the date and county for all <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> in Florida except those on federal and tribal lands. We used these data to calculate {{the total number of}} <b>lightning</b> <b>fires</b> and the total area burned per month during the entire period of record for each county of interest. We assessed monthly temperature and precipitation patterns using divisional data from the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC 2017). We graphed the monthly temperature, precipitation, cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, and lightning-fire occurrence together along with the typical timing of the various cambial phenology phases (i.e., dormancy, earlywood production, transition, latewood production) for each study area. Finally, we compared monthly temperature and precipitation data for the study period against the long-term climate record to determine whether sampled years were typical of long-term climate patterns.|$|R
