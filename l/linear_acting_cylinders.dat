50|$|In general, {{based on}} the application, a {{pneumatic}} cylinder is usually a single <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder,</b> {{where there is a}} single port in the cylinder and were cylinder extension is done by compressed air and retraction by means of open coiled spring. In double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> two ports both extend and retract by means of compressed air.|$|R
50|$|Whenever fluid is {{supplied}} to the cylinder the piston will move. This movement of piston is called as stroke. The piston can move in forward or reverse direction.The cylinders {{can be classified}} as double acting or single acting. In single <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> work will be performed only in the forward stroke. The fluid will be supplied to the cylinder only during the forward stroke. The return stroke is achieved by the spring mounted in the <b>cylinder.</b> In double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{there will be two}} ports for the supply of fluid. Work can be obtained both at forward and reverse strokes. Directional control valves required for the easy operation of double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R

50|$|A double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is {{extended}} and retracted using {{hydraulic or pneumatic}} pressure in both directions. Double <b>acting</b> telescopic <b>cylinders</b> are thus much more complex in design than the single acting type. This additional complexity {{is due to the}} requirement of adding retracting piston faces to all of the cylinder stages and the difficulty in supplying pressurized fluid to the retraction pistons of the intermediate stages.|$|R
5000|$|Single <b>acting</b> <b>cylinders</b> are {{economical}} and {{the simplest}} design. Hydraulic fluid enters through a port {{at one end}} of the cylinder, which extends the rod by means of area difference. An external force, internal retraction spring or gravity returns the piston rod.|$|R

As such, repeatable tasks that are time consuming can be handled automatically and with minimal human attention.

50|$|Single <b>acting</b> {{telescopic}} <b>cylinders</b> are {{the simplest}} and most common design. As with a single <b>acting</b> rod style <b>cylinder,</b> the single <b>acting</b> telescopic <b>cylinder</b> is extended using hydraulic or pneumatic pressure but retracts using external forces when the fluid medium is removed and relieved to the reservoir. This external retraction force is usually gravity acting on {{the weight of the}} load. This external weight must obviously be sufficient to overcome the friction and mechanical losses within the machine design even after the work portion of the machine cycle has been accomplished. In the example above of the dump truck, the weight of the dump body, now raised at an angle of 60 degrees but empty of the load, must be enough to force the unpressurized hydraulic fluid out of the cylinder and cause it to retract to the fully collapsed position.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{erecting}} the mast of a large mobile drilling rig. The mast is erected to the vertical position using a telescopic cylinder. However, to lower the mast, gravity is not available for the initial tilt back from the vertical position. Thus, the plunger stage only of the telescopic actuator is equipped as a double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> to provide the initial force to pull the mast back from vertical. Once the tilt back has been initiated, then gravity takes over and supplies the force to complete the full cylinder retraction. The remaining stages, therefore, are single acting. This special combination is much less complex and much less costly than using an entirely double acting design.|$|R

In accordance with this, we have simulated a mechanism in which the unfolding and folding of the stair is due to the linear motion of the slider at one end. The effect of the change in length of connecting rod that converts linear motion to rotary motion is to be analyzed. Here we consider 10 different lengths of the connecting rod. The force needed to move the slider is measured using MSC ADAMSTM software in each of these cases. Then a linear actuation circuit for the slider using a double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> is designed and simulated using Festo FluidSIMTM software.

40|$|A double <b>acting</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{operation}} has been fully monitored in its key functional parameters, focused on characterization of end-of-stroke cushioning and starting phases. Being the cylinder performance reliant in the piston constructive geometry, {{the number and}} location of piston circumferential grooves is a significant parameter affecting the internal cushioning system performance. An eddy current displacement sensor assembled in the piston allows assessment of piston radial displacement inside the cylinder tube, which is directly related with the studied operating phases. Due to such 3 D displacements, the piston becomes as an active and self-adjusting element along the functional cycle of the cylinder. Mechanical joints orientation and operating pressure are also relevant parameters affecting piston radial displacement and, thus, the cushioning and starting performance. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) results confirm the observed functional role of the perimeter grooves; the flow and pressure distributions, where develops a significant radial force, are also {{in accordance with the}} registered radial displacement.
