25|$|Operationally, the 16 {{lines are}} divided into four groups of lines. The Clifton Hill Group {{comprises}} the two <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> branch at Clifton Hill station. The Burnley Group comprises the four <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> go through Burnley station. The Caulfield Group comprises the three <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> go through Caulfield station, plus the Sandringham line. The Northern Group comprises the remaining lines, which all go through North Melbourne station.|$|R
50|$|The {{lines are}} sorted into an order where each line is after all <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> have preceded it {{at some point in}} history, and before all <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> have {{followed}} it at some point in history. If these constraints do not give a total ordering for all lines, then the <b>lines</b> <b>that</b> do not have an ordering with respect to each other are additions that conflict.|$|R

5|$|Molk {{enrolled}} at the University of Michigan in 2007. He missed portions of the 2008 and 2009 seasons with injury. As a redshirt junior in 2010, Molk was the cornerstone in an offensive <b>line</b> <b>that</b> helped Denard Robinson break the Big Ten Conference single-season record with 4,189 yards of total offense. Molk was recognized as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player {{at the end of}} the 2010 season. As a redshirt senior in 2011, Molk anchored a <b>line</b> <b>that</b> led the way for Denard Robinson and Fitzgerald Toussaint to become Michigan's first duo of 1,000-yard rushers since 1975. At the end of the 2011 season, he won the Rimington Trophy and was a consensus first-team All-American.|$|E

5|$|The West Coast Express was an {{ice hockey}} <b>line</b> <b>that</b> {{played for the}} National Hockey League's (NHL) Vancouver Canucks from 2002 to 2006. Named after Vancouver's {{commuter}} rail service, the line consisted of Markus Naslund at left wing, Brendan Morrison at centre, and Todd Bertuzzi playing right wing. The West Coast Express was a high scoring <b>line</b> <b>that</b> {{was considered to be}} one of the best lines in hockey during its tenure.|$|E
5|$|The rail <b>line</b> <b>that</b> {{the highway}} {{parallels}} between Toppenish and {{just west of}} Prosser has existed since at least 1910.

5|$|According to Russian {{statistics}} of 1889, there were 57.8% Lithuanians, 19.1% Poles, and 3.5% Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate. It is {{generally agreed that}} Lithuanians formed the majority population in the northern Suwałki Governorate, while Poles were concentrated in south. But, Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over {{the location of the}} <b>line</b> <b>that</b> separated the Lithuanian from the Polish majorities. Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians, while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite. The German census of 1916 showed that 51% of Sejny population was Lithuanian.|$|E
5|$|After the village's disincorporation, taxes {{decreased}} {{for former}} village residents, but increased for Rosendale residents {{throughout the rest}} of the town. The population of the former village has grown 24.5percent, from 1,220 to an estimated 1,519 people. The same year that the village chose to disincorporate, the Wallkill Valley rail <b>line</b> <b>that</b> ran through the village also ceased regular service.|$|E

5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a <b>line</b> <b>that</b> {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|BART {{has also}} been {{studying}} ways to improve service and reliability in its core system, where density and ridership is highest.

5|$|Both the {{external}} walls and those around the keep were fitted with merlons and parapets, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along {{the external}} wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive <b>line</b> <b>that</b> enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the external walls. The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E

There was one clear path through the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two rail cars that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely {{similar to the}} car ordered by the Reading, these rail cars were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced with conventional trucks. After being retrofitted, these cars {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin rail cars. They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short <b>line</b> <b>that</b> operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|E
