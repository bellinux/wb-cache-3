Roper stated that [...] "there really isn't any sort of a {{challenge}} here", particularly due to the player character's inability to die; Leadbetter summed up the game's difficulty as [...] "negligible". However, when reviewing the PlayStation Portable version of the game, Justin Calvart of GameSpot took the view that [...] "the game's difficulty masterfully scales to match your skill level", {{so that it does}} not become overly [...] "frantic or frustrating". Reviewers were universally dismissive of the multiplayer mode, with Calvart saying that [...] "whatever it is, it's not good". Leadbetter called the PlayStation 3 version's multiplayer [...] "little more than an afterthought", while Navarro said that it [...] "doesn't add a <b>lick</b> <b>of</b> depth to the experience".|$|E

Chao also parodies popular songs, such as the Justin Bieber hits [...] "As Long as You Love Me" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend", as well as criticizing and poking fun at other people, usually with profane language.

500|$|Musically, {{the album}} sees the band {{moving away from}} nu metal and {{focusing}} on a style categorized as groove metal. With strong elements of groove metal on the album, All Hope is Gone also features elements of death metal and thrash metal. Magazine Yell! wrote that All Hope is Gone [...] "expands on" [...] Slipknot's [...] "thrash metal guitar work and vocal melodies." [...] Prior to the album's release, Slipknot's members displayed interest in making All Hope Is Gone their heaviest album, which Joey Jordison affirmed saying, [...] "It's going to be heavier than , but just as weird and as experimental." [...] Corey Taylor reiterated this, describing All Hope Is Gone as a [...] "very dark" [...] combination of the band's two previous studio albums, Iowa and Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). In All Hope Is Gone, Slipknot expands on their use of traditional song structures, acoustics, and solos that they introduced on their previous album Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses). The song [...] "Snuff" [...] is led by acoustic guitars and has been dubbed as Slipknot's [...] "attempt at a power ballad", though it remains [...] "dark and ominous". In an interview with Artistdirect, Shawn Crahan stated, [...] "Everyone can feel the pain that's in there. It's not forced upon you. You have it in there innately." [...] Slipknot also retained a metal edge reminiscent of their earlier work. Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic wrote that [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] goes from [...] "a cluster of cacophony" [...] to [...] "an onslaught of densely dark intricate riffs". Crahan compared it to the song [...] "(sic)" [...] from their debut album, explaining, [...] "The technique and the style are very reminiscent of the old, brutal shit that we've done." [...] Jim Kaz of IGN stated that the [...] "swaggering, cock-rock groove and an anthemic chorus" [...] of [...] "Psychosocial" [...] gives Slipknot the potential {{to reach out to}} new fans [...] "without sacrificing a <b>lick</b> <b>of</b> intensity". Crahan stated he [...] "loves" [...] his parts of [...] "Psychosocial", in which the band incorporates snare drums, reminiscent of [...] "Before I Forget". He also cited [...] "This Cold Black" [...] as one of his favorite songs, saying that it has a [...] "driving tempo and a lot of attitude". The track [...] "Gehenna" [...] incorporates elements of Slipknot's slower, more cerebral edge reminiscent of [...] "Prosthetics" [...] and [...] "Purity" [...] from their debut album, and [...] "Skin Ticket" [...] from Iowa. Crahan called it a [...] "trippy song", explaining, [...] "It's just somewhere we go." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{found some}} new {{popularity}} after signing with Trent Reznor's Nothing Records in the US, and touring with Nine Inch Nails, {{as well as}} having their songs used on the PlayStation game Loaded. In March 1995 the band released the Dos Dedos Mis Amigos remix album Two Fingers My Friends! which featured remixes by The Orb, Apollo 440 and Renegade Soundwave. [...] Crabb left the band in Summer 1995 - originally proposing to contribute in a non-touring capacity due to fatherhood - however, the band decided to replace him with Kerry Hammond on guitar and backing vocals, with Mansell taking over full vocal duties. The band decided to split in May 1996, (with 12 songs recorded and mixed {{in a state of}} near completion), and toured the UK briefly in June 1996 with a final live show at Roskilde. At this point, their set contained several unreleased songs from the unfinished album. Two tracks from this period were released at the time, a cover version of Gary Numan's [...] "Friends", and an instrumental track called [...] "Zero Return" [...] on a magazine sampler.

A retrospective review in Blender remarked: [...] "Her first 'headphones album'... It's more playful and less pompous than Ray of Light." [...] Rolling Stone stated that the album was a rough and improvised version of Ray of Light, but lauded that Madonna had chosen to make a more [...] "instinctive" [...] record than her previous endeavours. Mojo magazine said that [...] "Music is fitful and its charms aren't all immediate, but Madonna is still doing what she does best--giving a <b>lick</b> <b>of</b> pop genius to the unlikely genre of experimental dance music." [...] NME said that Music is [...] "vocodered, stretched, distorted, warped, deliberately upstaged by beats so showy they belong in a strip joint – quite simply, she's almost managed to make herself disappear. That bluntly explicit title isn't just pointless irony. This record is about the music, not Madonna; about the sounds, not the image." [...] Slant Magazine criticised Madonna's collaborations with William Orbit, {{who had worked with}} her on Ray of Light, calling them repetitive and uninteresting despite being catchy. In 2015, Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that Music is [...] "still [...] hardest-rocking and most seductive album." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{repetitive}} <b>licking</b> <b>of</b> nonfood substrates is {{a common}} stereotypic behavior in captive giraffes. In this study we attempted to reduce stereotypic licking in a Masai giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi) by applying a bitter chemical (marketed as a taste deterrent to prevent the unwanted <b>licking</b> and chewing <b>of</b> substrates) to the areas <b>of</b> the fence <b>licked</b> most frequently by the giraffe. We hypothesized that this treatment would reduce stereotypic licking. However, {{there were no significant}} overall changes in stereotypic licking following treatment with the chemical spray. Although <b>licking</b> <b>of</b> the treated area was observed to decrease, the behavior increased in nontreated areas. These results suggest that the underlying motivation driving the behavior was not affected by the aversive stimulus. Because stereotypic licking in giraffes may be based on a motivation to use their tongues in foraging, more effective techniques for reducing stereotypic fence-licking in giraffes may include increasing feeding duration by increasing the quantity, processing time, or distribution range of food.
