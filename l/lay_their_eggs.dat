5|$|Predatory wasp species {{normally}} subdue {{their prey}} by stinging it, and then either <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on it, leaving it in place, or carry {{it back to}} their nest where an egg may be laid on the prey item and the nest sealed, or several smaller prey items may be deposited to feed a single developing larva. Apart from providing food for their offspring, no further maternal care is given. Members of the family Chrysididae, the cuckoo wasps, are kleptoparasites and <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of unrelated host species.|$|E
5|$|Adult males vigorously defend territories near water; {{these areas}} provide {{suitable}} habitat for the larvae to develop, and for females to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites.|$|E
5|$|Birds of {{variable}} size with slender bodies and long tails. Some species are <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of other birds. There are about 141 species worldwide, {{one of which}} breeds in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
50|$|Green Sea Turtles {{can be seen}} <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on {{the beaches}} between February and September.|$|R
25|$|For instance, an entropic {{argument}} has been recently proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders {{in choosing a}} suitable area for <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Silphids {{are usually}} not {{considered}} a nuisance to humans. They help the environment by <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on carcasses and the larvae break down the detritus, which prevents accumulation of deceased organisms.|$|R
5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis females <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on Lundy cabbage leaf stalks. The white larvae are leaf miners, {{digging into}} the {{petioles}} and stems. After emerging in late summer, they pupate in soil.|$|E
5|$|The Viduidae is {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds native to Africa that includes indigobirds and whydahs. All species are brood parasites, which <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of estrildid finches. Species usually have black or indigo predominating in their plumage.|$|E
5|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes. Like their amphibious tetrapod predecessors, {{they had}} lungs and limbs. Amniotic eggs, however, have internal membranes {{that allow the}} developing embryo to breathe but keep water in. Hence, amniotes can lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in water.|$|E
50|$|Emersonella is a genus of {{hymenopteran}} insects of {{the family}} Eulophidae. Several species {{are known to be}} phoretic parasitoids of female tortoise beetles, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the eggs of the beetle host.|$|R
5|$|Many thrips form galls {{on plants}} when feeding or <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Some of the gall-forming Phlaeothripidae, such as genera Kladothrips and Oncothrips, form eusocial groups similar to ant colonies, with {{reproductive}} queens and nonreproductive soldier castes.|$|R
50|$|They are {{generally}} cleptoparasites, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in host nests, where their larvae consume the host egg or larva {{while it is}} still young, then consuming the provisions. The other subfamilies are parasitoids, of either sawflies or walking sticks.|$|R
5|$|Thrips lay {{extremely}} small eggs, about 0.2mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> singly {{or in small}} groups on the outside surfaces of plants.|$|E
5|$|A female may lay {{from several}} dozen to several {{thousand}} eggs during her lifetime, {{depending on the}} extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by scarab beetles, which house, feed and protect their young. The Attelabidae roll leaves and <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> inside the roll for protection.|$|E
5|$|Adult frogs <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in moist places, {{including}} on leaves, in plants, among exposed roots, and elsewhere. Once {{the eggs}} hatch, the adult piggybacks the tadpoles, {{one at a}} time, to suitable water, either a pool, or the water gathered in the throat of bromeliads or other plants. The tadpoles remain there until they metamorphose, fed by unfertilized eggs laid at regular intervals by the mother.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{lifespan}} of {{the double}} drummer is {{about four or five}} weeks. During this time, they mate and reproduce, and feed exclusively on sap of living trees, sucking it out through specialised mouthparts. Female cicadas die after <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Females do not {{tolerate}} other females in their chambers {{while they are}} nesting and <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Females typically feed the chicks (unless {{they are part of}} a cooperative breeding colony). The diet consists of insects, seeds, and fruit found near the nest.|$|R
50|$|The Magog are human-sized predators {{covered in}} a loose, shaggy pelt. They feed on sapient beings, whether human, alien or Nietzschean, which they paralyse with toxin, and {{reproduce}} by <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in another living being: the larvae hatch and consume their host.|$|R
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on land.|$|E
5|$|In many decapods, {{the first}} (and {{sometimes}} the second) pair of pleopods are specialised {{in the male}} for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the Christmas Island red crab) mate seasonally {{and return to the}} sea to release the eggs. Others, such as woodlice, <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.|$|E
5|$|Cuban iguanas reach sexual {{maturity}} {{at an age}} of two to three years. Males are gregarious when immature, but become more aggressive as they age, vigorously defending territories in competition for females. Females are more tolerant of each other, except after <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The true koels, Eudynamys, are a genus of cuckoos from Asia, Australia and the Pacific. They {{are large}} sexually dimorphic cuckoos which eat fruits and insects and have loud {{distinctive}} calls. They are brood parasites, <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of other species.|$|R
5000|$|Though phenological {{changes may}} not be as {{detrimental}} to birds, between the years of 1971 and 1995, a UK study revealed that 31% of the birds studied were <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> an average of 9 days earlier in 1995 than in 1971. (P. 22) ...|$|R
5|$|Natural predators {{of black}} bean aphids include both adults and larvae of ladybirds and lacewings and the larvae of hoverflies. Certain species of tiny {{parasitic}} wasps <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> inside aphids and the developing wasp larvae devour their hosts from inside. Members of the wasp genera Diaeretiella and Lysiphlebus behave {{in this way}} and may provide a measure of control of the aphids.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{mimic the}} {{presence}} of insect eggs on their leaves, dissuading insect species from laying their eggs there. Because female butterflies {{are less likely to}} <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on plants that already have butterfly eggs, some species of neotropical vines of the genus Passiflora (Passion flowers) contain physical structures resembling the yellow eggs of Heliconius butterflies on their leaves, which discourage oviposition by butterflies.|$|E
5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, go through a diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring. Some temperate region butterflies, such as the Camberwell beauty, <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> {{in the spring and}} have them hatch in the summer.|$|E
50|$|As {{with all}} other sphecoid wasps, the larvae are carnivorous; females hunt for prey on which to <b>lays</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs,</b> mass {{provisioning}} the nest cells with paralyzed, living prey that the larva feeds upon after it hatches from the egg, {{as seen in the}} species Philanthus gibbosus.|$|R
50|$|Kenbro {{belongs to}} Kenchick. Kenbro {{chickens}} can be reared both for eggs and meat. These chickens are fed {{for six months}} before they start <b>laying.</b> <b>Their</b> <b>eggs</b> production {{is lower than the}} layers. Those reared for meat also take longer to mature as compared to broilers.|$|R
50|$|Prior to <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> {{the female}} Prionyx stings a {{grasshopper}} causing paralysis. She will then bury the grasshopper in a shaded hole and lay an egg on the body. When the egg develops it feeds on the grasshopper {{until it has}} matured enough to seek its own food.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} leisure spots and {{conservation}} areas are available around Sandakan. The Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary {{is a place}} where orphaned or injured orangutans are brought to be rehabilitated to return to forest life. Established in 1964, it is one of only four orangutan sanctuaries in the world. Other conservation areas are the Malaysian Turtle Islands where many turtles <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> on the islands. They cover an area of 1,740 hectares which includes the surrounding reefs and seas. The islands are also ideal for swimming, snorkelling and scuba diving.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible if all the trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to <b>lay</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b> Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E
25|$|An old anecdotal {{record of}} these birds <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs</b> in the nests of Turdoides {{babblers}} {{has not been}} supported by later observers. Laboratory studies have demonstrated cyclic changes in the melanin pigmentation of the tissue surrounding the testes. The dark pigmentation is lost during the breeding season and regained later.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the concept}} of entropy was {{originally}} a thermodynamic construct, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including information theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics/ecological economics, and evolution.For instance, an entropic argument has been recently proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders in choosing a suitable area for <b>laying</b> <b>their</b> <b>eggs.</b>|$|R
