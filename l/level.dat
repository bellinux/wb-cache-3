5|$|As players {{walk through}} the <b>level,</b> they are stopped by groups of enemies who must be {{defeated}} before they can continue. The <b>level</b> ends when all the enemies are defeated. Each <b>level</b> contains many identical groups of enemies, making these games notable for their repetition. In beat 'em up games, players often fight a boss—an enemy much stronger than the other enemies—at {{the end of each}} <b>level.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper <b>level,</b> the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to the lower <b>level,</b> merges with the innermost, express tracks located on the lower <b>level,</b> and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper <b>level</b> before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. The lower <b>level</b> tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>level</b> keys, every <b>level</b> has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a <b>level</b> and then take it to the talisman chamber from that <b>level.</b> There are five talismans in the game and every <b>level,</b> except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular <b>level</b> usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next <b>level,</b> except for the Primagen key from the last <b>level,</b> which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

Bike or Die! comes with 25 <b>levels,</b> and additional <b>levels</b> can be downloaded from the Bike or Die! web site. 163 of these <b>levels</b> are currently in the Time Trial competition. Most of these <b>levels</b> were made by players, and selected for the Time Trial by popular demand. <b>Levels</b> are occasionally added to the Time Trial in groups of 10-16 <b>levels.</b> Levelpacks usually consist of about 15 <b>levels,</b> but packs range from three to over 100 <b>levels</b> each.|$|R

5|$|Once a {{particular}} <b>level</b> has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with keys that must be collected in the levels. The keys that unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first <b>level,</b> the keys that unlock the portal to the fourth <b>level</b> are found in the second <b>level,</b> the keys that unlock the portal to the fifth <b>level</b> are found in the third <b>level,</b> and the keys that unlock the last <b>level</b> are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per <b>level.</b>|$|E

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{determining}} <b>levels</b> of serum mucoprotein in inflammatory disease and evaluating serum mucoprotein test {{as a method of}} clinical test, serum mucoprotein hexose (MH), serum protein-bound total hexose (GH), and serum protein-bound hexose fraction (<b>levels</b> of P.

The <b>levels</b> of MH paralleled erythrocyte sedimentation rate, <b>levels</b> of protein fractions, leukocyte count, plasma iron <b>levels</b> and plasma copper <b>levels.</b> MH and GH <b>levels</b> were markedly elevated in acute inflammation and active pulmonary tuberculosis, while they were both nearly normal in chronic ineammation and arrested pulmonary tuberculosis. P. A.

5|$|Specifying power levels over 100% {{may seem}} nonsensical, {{but there was}} a logic behind it. The 100% <b>level</b> does not mean the maximum {{physical}} power <b>level</b> attainable, rather it was a specification decided on during engine development—the expected rated power <b>level.</b> When later studies indicated the engine could operate safely at levels above 100%, these higher levels became standard. Maintaining the original relationship of power <b>level</b> to physical thrust helps reduce confusion, as it created an unvarying fixed relationship so that test data (or operational data from past or future missions) can be easily compared. If the power <b>level</b> was increased, and that new value was said to be 100%, then all previous data and documentation would either require changing, or cross-checking against what physical thrust corresponded to 100% power <b>level</b> on that date. Engine power <b>level</b> affects engine reliability, with studies indicating the probability of an engine failure increasing rapidly with power levels over 104.5%, which was why power levels above 104.5% were retained for contingency use only.|$|E
