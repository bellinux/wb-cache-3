40|$|Protective aprons in imaging departments: {{manufacturer}} stated lead equivalence values require validation Abstract The {{composition of}} pro-tective aprons worn by X-ray per-sonnel to shield against secondary radiation is changing. Lead is {{being replaced by}} either lead-free or com-posite (lead with other high atomic numbered elements) materials. These newer aprons are categorised by manufacturers in terms of <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> values, but {{it is unclear how}} these stated values compare with actual <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> values. In this work, the actual lead equivalence of 41 protective aprons from four man-ufacturers, all specified as having 0. 25 mm lead equivalence, were investigated with transmission ex-periments at 70 and 100 kVp. All aprons were in current use. The aprons were screened for defects, and age, weight and design was recorded along with details of associated quality assurance (QA). Out of the 41 protective aprons examined for actual lead equivalence, 73 % were outside tolerance levels, with actual levels in some aprons demonstrating {{less than half of the}} nominal values. The lack of compatibility between actual and nominal <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> values was demonstrated by aprons from three of the four manufacturers investigated. The area of the defects found on screening of the protective aprons were within recommendations. The results highlight the need for accep-tancy and ongoing checks of protec-tive aprons to ensure that radiation exposure of imaging personnel is kept to a minimum...|$|E
30|$|Phantom {{and patient}} {{measurements}} provided higher {{values for the}} surface dose at thyroid position than expected from MCS (phantom 0.32  mGy; patients 0.38  mGy; MCS 0.16  mGy). Phantom measurements indicated scatter contributions from both breast tissue and collimator/tube system. The value found in our patient study is {{within the range of}} the literature (0.22 – 0.39  mGy). The thyroid protection significantly reduced the surface dose but the dose (0.016  mGy) was higher than that expected from the <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> value. However, the impact of the collar to the effective dose was small (<[*] 4 %). The collar was not visible on mammograms.|$|E

30|$|The authors {{performed}} in vivo dosimetry with thermoluminescence radiation detectors (TLDs) in 15 premenopausal patients receiving ELIOT to the breast (prescribed dose 21  Gy) using two mobile linear accelerators. The TLDs were positioned subdiaphragmatically on the irradiated side, at the medial pubic position, {{and within the}} uterus. A shielding apron (2 -mm <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent)</b> was placed over the viscera from the subcostal to the subpubic region. TLDs showed mean doses of 0.37  Gy (range 0.01 – 0.85  Gy) at subdiaphragm, 0.09  Gy (range 0.003 – 0.02  Gy) pubic, and 0.17  Gy (range 0.06 – 0.32  Gy) in utero, for beam energies in the range 5 – 9  MeV. These findings indicate that ELIOT with a mobile linear accelerator and shielding apron would be safe for the fetus, as doses of a few Gy are not associated with measurable increased risk of fetal damage, and the threshold dose for deterministic effects is estimated at 0.1 – 0.2  Gy.|$|E

30|$|The thyroid {{protection}} used in {{this study}} significantly reduced the air kerma, which was assumed to be proportional to the scattering dose to the thyroid. Due to scatter, the air kerma behind the protective collar was higher than expected from the <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> value (16 [*]±[*] 2 μGy in average for all patients; see Table 2). According the thickness of the lead of 0.25  mm, the incident beam was expected to be attenuated by a factor of 15.10 – 5. The dose we estimated behind the collar is in agreement with the findings reported by Ramalho et al. (18 μGy) [11]. Measurements with phantoms revealed scatter contributions (50 %) from upside (collimator system) and downside (backscatter form breast and detector system, 50 % of the total contribution; see Fig. 3, green triangle), resulting in air kerma values up to >[*] 100 μGy for 6 -cm compression at the surface of thyroid position. This value is clearly greater than the values found in the MCS but corresponds to the values we found in the patient study. In the MCS, 85 % of the dose came from backscatter of breast and detector system and only 15 % was caused by collimator scatter.|$|E
40|$|As interventional {{radiology}} procedures become more sophisticated, so must the radiation shielding apparel protecting the patients and medical personnel. Conventional radiation shielding apparel is constructed from lead impregnated sheet material which has issues with lead toxicity and user discomfort. This research constructed {{a more sophisticated}} material consisting of a textile platform with a bi-layer, non-lead coating {{with the objective of}} achieving a 90 % attenuation percentage. If radiation shielding material can be produced on a common textile substrate rather than on unyielding sheet material, then {{it has the potential to}} be optimised through integration into a textile manufacturing environment. The material was constructed using a solvent casting technique which coated Barium Sulphate (BaSO 4) or Sodium Tungstate (Na 2 WO 4) or Bismuth Oxide (Bi 2 O 3) onto a textile substrate. The results showed that the difference in attenuation between the samples produced and the <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> material ranged from 0. 76 to 2. 1 %. Future research can optimise these results by applying textile engineering processes to the coating techniques and also the textile platform itself. This would mean that radiation shielding apparel would not be a simple adaptation of barrier material but be created for ergonomic fit and comfort from the material design stage...|$|E
30|$|Because of {{the high}} {{sensitivity}} at specific low-energy radiation and radial isotropy (ability to measure backscatter), we used Automess SEQ- 6 R dosimeters (energy range from 18  keV to 3  MeV; dose range 0.01 – 2.00  mGy). All dosimeters were re-calibrated by separated calibration measurement for the radiation quality in use (30 kVp W-Rh target) to the air kerma with a RQM detector (IBA Dosimetry GmbH, Schwarzenbruck, Germany), with Dosimax plus unit, range 500 nGy – 9999  mGy). Energy dependence and linearity were checked by free air measurements with 20 kVp W-target. We compared the back scatter from muscle tissue according to ICRP 110 [15] and muscle tissue under a layer of 0.25  mm Pb (collar <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent)</b> and under a layer of 2.5  mm PMMA, irradiated with 28 and 35  keV W/Rh x-rays by MCS. Based on MCS, {{the effect of the}} thyroid collar to the backscatter was estimated to be <[*] 3 % and therefore, no separated backscatter correction for the collar was applied for patient measurements. It is assumed that the air kerma (in the investigated energy range, this corresponds to the absorbed dose in air and is in the following taken as measure for the entrance surface dose) at the surface in front of the thyroid was representative for the effect on the thyroid dose.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 The recent {{reductions}} to {{the international}} dose limit recommendations for {{the lens of the}} eye have renewed interest in radiation protection strategies in interventional fluoroscopy, where eye-lens radiation exposure occurs frequently. Radiationshielding eyewear can significantly reduce lens dose in these scenarios, but accurate protection factors are elusive because they depend on a variety of factors. This work aims to investigate variables that affect eye shield performance in fluoroscopy rooms, test several shield designs, and rate the shield designs based on shielding performance. Eight separate shields were modeled in MCNP 5 using detailed head and eye geometry, and the shields were evaluated at eight individual source positions. Results showed that shields of different thicknesses and shapes can provide similar protection to the operator. A total protection factor of about 5 is the most protection a 0. 10 mm <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> material can reasonably provide, and small shields constructed of this material can provide protection factors of about 3. Shield performance can vary greatly depending on the irradiation angle, and this could cause an overestimation of the dose reduction provided by the shield if vulnerable angles are exploited. With increasing evidence of cataract risk at low lens doses, fluoroscopy operators need radiation protection equipment that can provide well characterized protection, and radiation-shielding eyewear can provide excellent dose reduction if they are designed well and used correctly...|$|E
40|$|Background: The use and {{effectiveness}} of traditional lead gonad shields in pediatric pelvic radiography has been challenged by several literatures {{over the past two}} decades. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a new radioprotective gonad shields to be use in pediatric pelvic radiography. Materials and Methods: The commercially available 0. 06 mm <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> bismuth garment has cropped squarely and used as ovarian shield to cover the entire region of pelvis. In order to prevent deterioration of image quality due to beam hardening artifacts, a 1 -cm foam as spacer was located between the shield and patients pelvis. Moreover, we added a lead piece at the cranial position of the bismuth garment to absorb the scatter radiations to the radiosensitive organs. In girls, 49 radiographs with shield and 46 radiographs without shield was taken. The radiation dose was measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Image quality assessments were performed using the European guidelines. For boys, the lead testicular shields was developed using 2 cm bismuth garment, added to the sides. The prevalence and efficacy of testicular shields was assessed in clinical practice fromFebruary 2016 to June 2016. Results: Without increasing the dose to the breast, thyroid and the lens of the eyes, the use of bismuth shield has reduced the entrance skin dose(ESD) of the pelvis and radiation dose to the ovaries by 62. 2 % and 61. 7 %, respectively (...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} that personal lead shielding devices can increase absorption of radiation {{has not been}} entertained. The {{purpose of the present}} investigation specifically was to determine whether pituitary dose might be increased when a leaded apron and thyroid collar are used. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used to measure absorbed dose. They were calibrated at the kVp used in the clinical situation and a calibration curve relating light output to dose was generated. Lithium fluoride TLD discs were placed in the pituitary gland region of a Rando-Alderson female human phantom. The equivalent of 100 transpharyngeal exposures were delivered. The resultant light output from recovered dosimeters was converted to a uGy value using the calibration curve. The experiment was repeated using a 0. 25 mm <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> collar and apron fitted to the phantom in the customary manner. The entire process was repeated in order to have 30 dosimeters for the unshielded and 30 dosimeters for the shielded conditions. A further 30 dosimeters were sham irradiated and served as controls. A statistical comparison between unshielded and shielded conditions was performed. When the leaded apron and thyroid collar were used the absorbed dose to the pituitary gland was increased significantly (P < 0. 05). Following this a second group, using a different dosimetry system and a male phantom repeated the experiment. In both cases, the shielded phantom received significantly higher dose to the pituitary region than the unshielded. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2008 ACPSEMThe {{literature}} contains both endorsements of, {{and advice}} against, {{the use of}} protective apparel in nuclear medicine procedures. The main issues usually centre around: Whether the shielding which can be provided by a protective garment light enough to wear (0 to 0. 6 mm <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> at the gamma energies commonly encountered in nuclear medicine) is enough to warrant its use; and (more recently); Whether the dose enhancement behind the protective garment from electron scatter in lead is sufficient to be of concern. In this work, the Monte Carlo code EGSnrc was used to investigate the effectiveness of lead of thicknesses of 0 to 0. 6 mm, in shielding staff from photons of energies of 140 and 511 keV. Furthermore, dose escalation behind the lead was investigated. Reasonable dose reductions are obtained at 140 keV with protective garments of 0. 5 mm lead equivalence. This perhaps warrants their use, in certain circumstances. At 511 keV, the reduction in dose is less than 10 %, and their use is probably not justified (given the weight {{that has to be}} carried) from an ALARA point of view. It should be noted here that protective garments designed for X-ray shielding will generally not have the same lead equivalence at the gamma energies used in nuclear medicine. It {{should also be noted that}} protective garments which do not contain lead do not always attenuate as much as their stated lead equivalence claims. Dose escalation does occur, but the depth of penetration of the scattered electrons beyond the exit side of the lead shielding is such that it is highly unlikely that a significant dose would be delivered to viable tissue in wearers of protective garments.

40|$|An early Tertiary ensimatic island arc, whose {{remnants}} {{are known}} as the Macuchi unit, is exposed in the occidental portion of the Western Cordillera of Ecuador. The Macuchi unit consists of two volcaniclastic and volcanic sequences: the Basal Macuchi, of Paleocene age, which is {{the lower part of}} the arc pile, and the Main Macuchi, of Eocene age, which is stratigraphically higher. The Main Macuchi hosts the Macuchi, La Plata, and El Patiño Au-rich volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits. Despite higher contents of SiO 2 and lower contents of MgO than rocks of the Basal Macuchi, the least evolved rocks of the Main Macuchi have lower or similar concentrations of incompatible elements and higher Sc/Y, V/Ti, and Ti/Zr ratios. This suggests derivation of the Main Macuchi rocks from a depleted source compared to the Basal Macuchi sequence. The VHMS orebodies are characterized by a mineral assemblage including chalcopyrite, pyrite, low Fe sphalerite, bornite, covellite, digenite, tennantite, and by quartz-sericite and quartz-chlorite alteration. Lead isotope compositions of the volcanic rocks of the two sequences(206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 65 - 19. 10, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 53 - 15. 67, and 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 20 - 39. 00) define mixing trends between a MORB-type reservoir and an upper crustal source. Volcanic rocks of both sequences display positive correlations of 207 Pb/ 204 Pb with MgO, which are compatible with fractional crystallization and assimilation of oceanic crust by a parent magma enriched at its source by radiogenic lead of pelagic sediments. The isotopic compositions of the orebodies overlap largely the compositional field of the Main Macuchi rocks, suggesting derivation of the majority of ore lead from leaching of the Main Macuchi sequence, even though small contributions from the Basal Macuchi cannot be ruled out. Lead isotope compositions are internally homogeneous within each of the three orebodies but vary beyond analytical uncertainties among the deposits (206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 835 ± 0. 009, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 613 ± 0. 005, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 535 ± 0. 018 for Macuchi; 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 18. 859 ± 0. 007, 207 PbPb = 15. 638 ± 0. 005, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 643 ± 0. 028 for El Patio; 206 Pb/ 204 Pb = 19. 023 ± 0. 008, 207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 660 ± 0. 003, 208 Pb/ 204 Pb = 38. 786 ± 0. 015 for La Plata). The isotopic difference between Macuchi (207 Pb/ 204 Pb = 15. 613 ± 0. 005) and El Patiño (207 Pb/ 204 Pb= 15. 638 ± 0. 005), separated by a few hundreds of meters, suggests fluid homogenization only at a local scale, a possible result of high-level emplacement of magmatic chambers, and consequent reduced size of the convective cells. Consistent covariations between metal ratios and isotopic compositions of the orebodies suggest also that leaching by hydrothermal fluids of different portions of the Main (and Basal?) Macuchi resulted in a distinct metal geochemistry of the orebodies. The highest 207 Pb/ 204 Pb value measured in the Eocene Main Macuchi volcanic rocks and associated ores is among the most radiogenic recorded in ensimatic island-arc systems and would require assimilation of unrealistic amounts of pelagic sediments (up to 36 wt %). In agreement with whole-rock geochemistry, it is more likely that this signature results from mixing of radiogenic <b>lead</b> <b>equivalent</b> to assimilation of commonly accepted pelagic sediment amounts (i. e., < 10 wt %) with a residual mantle, depleted in incompatible elements such as low radiogenic, MORB-type lead. Melts extracted from a residual source are candidates to be enriched in Au and other chalcophile elements. The strati-graphic association and isotopic affinity of the Au-rich VHMS ore minerals with the rocks of the Main Macuchi sequence suggests, therefore, a possible petrogenetic control on the formation of the VHMS deposits of the Macuchi arc...|$|E
