5|$|On August 8, 2002, NOAA revised {{its season}} {{estimate}} to 7–10 named storms, with 4–6 becoming hurricanes and 1–3 becoming major hurricanes. The reduction {{was attributed to}} <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> environmental conditions and building El Niño conditions.|$|E

The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, Dr. Gray {{announced}} he had maintained his previous prediction; with an active {{start of the}} season, {{the rest of the}} season was forecast to have been only slightly above average, due to an anticipated overall <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> environment across the Atlantic Ocean. A day later, NOAA released an updated prediction as well, with a 60% probability of above normal activity, with 12–15 named storms, 7–9 hurricanes, and 3–4 major hurricanes expected.|$|E

5|$|An {{experimental}} station {{was established to}} grow sugar at Mongalla in the 1950s, and there were plans to establish commercial operations. However, after independence in 1956 the Khartoum government shifted the sugar project to the north, where it is grown under much <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> conditions with heavy irrigation. A sugar, clothing, and a weaving factory was established in Mongalla in the 1970s but operations failed to get beyond their trial phase and diminished as conflict grew in {{the region in the}} early 1980s. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla as one of the Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated.|$|E

5|$|On June19 the UK Met Office (UKMO) {{issued a}} {{forecast}} of 10tropical storms in the July to November period with a 70percent {{chance that the}} number {{would be in the}} range of 7 to 13.

Team members noted that conditions had become slightly <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> for storms than earlier in the year. Sea surface temperature anomalies were cooler, and several Saharan Air Layer events had suppressed development of tropical cyclones. El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions were also noted to have been slightly cooler.|$|E
5|$|Released in the United States on April 28, 2006, Akeelah and the Bee was {{positively}} received by critics and audiences. Reviewers praised its storyline and cast, lauding Palmer's performance, {{although a few}} critics panned the story as familiar and formulaic, and were critical of the portrayal of Asian-American characters. The film grossed almost $18 million, and received a number of awards and nominations, including the Black Reel Awards and the NAACP Image Awards. Film critics highly praised it for avoiding African-American stereotypes common in Hollywood films, while scholars were <b>less</b> <b>favorable,</b> even saying it reinforces some clichés.|$|E
5|$|The native Mesolithic {{populations were}} slow in {{gradually}} assimilating the agricultural way of life, beginning {{with just the}} use of ceramics. It took a thousand years into the Neolithic period before they adopted animal husbandry (which became especially important to them) and plant cultivation to any appreciable degree. When they eventually developed interest in the more fertile areas utilized by the late Danubian cultures, they became the threat that compelled the Danubian farmers to fortify their settlements. The native post-Mesolithic groups expanded beyond the traditional Danubian areas of agricultural development, moving also into ecologically <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> environments, which included utilization of sandy soils.|$|E

50|$|Opinions of Bush {{from outside}} the U.S. are <b>less</b> than <b>favorable.</b> For example, a global {{sampling}} in 2005 of 21 nations found that 58% of those sampled believed that the president's reelection would {{have a negative impact}} on their peace and security; only 26% believed it would have a positive one.|$|R
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{out at sea}} cause large waves, heavy rain, {{flood and}} high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Tropical cyclones stir up water, leaving a cool wake behind them, which causes the region to be <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> for subsequent tropical cyclones. On land, strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The storm surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane was {{the only}} film made under Welles's {{original}} contract with RKO Pictures, which gave him complete creative control. Welles's new business manager and attorney permitted the contract to lapse.

In the new contract Welles was {{an employee of the}} studio and lost the right to final cut, which later allowed RKO to modify and re-cut The Magnificent Ambersons over his objections. In June 1942 Schaefer resigned the presidency of RKO Pictures and Welles's contract was terminated by his successor.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Odile was {{the second}} of three {{tropical}} storms to make landfall in Mexico during the 1984 Pacific hurricane season. The fifteenth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the active season, it developed from a tropical disturbance about 185miles (300km) south of Acapulco on September17. Curving towards the northwest, Odile became a Category1 hurricane on September19. The tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) two days later; however, Hurricane Odile began to weaken as moved erratically it encountered <b>less</b> <b>favorable</b> conditions and was downgraded to a tropical storm shortly before making landfall northwest of Zihuatanejo. Over land, the storm rapidly weakened, and dissipated on September23. The storm caused significant rainfall accumulations of 24.73inches (628.1mm) in Southern Mexico, resulting in severe damage to tourism resorts. Flooding from Odile resulted in the evacuation of 7,000people, 21 deaths, and the damage of about 900homes.|$|E
50|$|Meade’s first book, Bitching, {{published}} in 1973, stemmed from her {{involvement in the}} women’s liberation movement of the 1960s.

The British Interplanetary Society's {{hypothetical}} Project Daedalus interstellar probe design was fueled by helium-3 mines in the atmosphere of Jupiter, for example.
