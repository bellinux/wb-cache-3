The effect of wind gradient can be factored into the selection of twist in the sail design, but this can be difficult to predict since the wind gradient may vary widely in different weather conditions.

[...] About 30 Skylark 4s are still flying today (2010). Slingsby had introduced double curvature fuselage panels made of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) into their previous design, the T.49 Capstan and they remodelled the front of the wooden fuselage of the Skylark 3 in this material for the Skylark 4, introducing a reclining pilot's position and smoother canopy line. [...] Though the previous wing planform, span and area was retained, its ailerons were extended to increase the rate of roll and the outer panels used a different airfoil section, the more cambered NACA 6415, to give a better <b>lift</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E

50|$|The almost uniform <b>lift</b> <b>distribution</b> of a constant-aerofoil section {{elliptical}} wing {{can cause}} the entire span of the wing to stall simultaneously, potentially causing loss of control with little warning. To improve the stalling characteristics and give the pilot some warning, designers use a non-uniform aerofoil. For example, the wing of the Supermarine Spitfire was both thinned towards the tips and twisted to give washout, reducing the load on the tips so that the inner wing would stall first. Such compromises depart from the theoretical elliptical <b>lift</b> <b>distribution,</b> increasing induced drag. Thus, in practice the elliptical planform seldom achieves the theoretical efficiency of an elliptical <b>lift</b> <b>distribution.</b>|$|E
