40|$|The {{evolution}} of the cell phone from a "simple" wireless phone to a port able multimedia station {{is a prime example}} of the paradigm shift in mode rn day electronics. Applications evolve towards more mobility and more multimedia. This requires an increase in power efficiency of the electronic systems as battery power is limited. Battery <b>life-t</b> ime also has become one of the key sales arguments in the mobile market. As such the number of operations per watt must increase. Modern day electronic systems are unthinkable without memory circuits. I n high end single die processor systems already more than 50 % of the di e area is used by memory cache. This value is expected to still in crease as market driving applications, such as games and multimedia, are still growing in market penetration. This thesis contributes in three main domains to achieve the desired res ults. To minimise the leakage currents in the matrix of an SRAM, a second, low er, supply is introduced for the non-accessed parts of the matrix. This is implemented with the finest granularity feasible: a single word. This granularity has the benefit of minimising wake-up delays wh ile keeping the maximum possible amount of cells in a drowsy state. To achieve this the last stage of the decoder was distributed into the matrix to control the supply switches and wordline activation. Th is combines simplicity of control, limited area overhead and maximal red uctions. A further contribution in this thesis is the development and design of a monitor and regulation circuit to guarantee the data retention. L owering the supply voltage on the drowsy cells not only reduces the leak age currents, it also reduces the retention capability of the cells. Traditionally, the increase of inter and intra die variations in rece nt technologies would require margins on the drowsy supply voltage to be taken to compensate for the reduction in retention capability. Th ese margins in turn would deteriorate the possible leakage current savin gs. As such it is important to be able to guarantee the retention of the data without sacrificing the benefit of leakage reduction. By mea suring the actual retention capability of the cells in the live and oper ational environment, a regulation circuit can be designed to maximise le akage reduction on a die-to-die basis while guaranteeing the data retent ion. The solution published in fulfils this requirement. The final contribution of this thesis is in the domain of multi-port mem ories. The prototype, which is the focus of the research in, combi nes the leakage reduction techniques with an asymmetric width dual port SRAM. The asymmetry in the wordlength enables the reduction of act ive energy consumption per bit by allowing a wide, 256 bit, and narrow, 32 bit, access. It is proven that the single wide access consumes less energy than several consecutive narrow accesses. This prototy pe also includes the means to monitor and regulate the secondary drowsy supply. The access time of 2 ns is attained in its nominal settings. In low matrix leakage settings the access time is increased to 2. 5 ns with an e xtra leakage reduction of 33 % compared to the nominal settings. T he system can be put in a pure retention state by turning of periphery c ircuits, this reduced the leakage power consumption with 65...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) {{distribution}} is a positively skewed distribution {{and is a}} popular model for analyzing lifetime data. In this thesis, we first develop an improved method of estimation for the BS distribution and the cor-responding inference. Compared to the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) and the modified moment estimators (MMEs), the proposed method results in estimators with smaller bias, but having the same mean squared errors (MSEs) as these two estimators. Next, the existence and uniqueness of the MLEs of the parameters of BS distribution are discussed based on Type-I, Type-II and hybrid censored samples. In the case of five-parameter bivariate Birnbaum-Saunders (BVBS) distribution, we use the distributional relationship between the bivariate normal and BVBS distributions to propose a simple and efficient method of estimation based on Type-II censored samples. Regression analysis is commonly used {{in the analysis of}} <b>life-test</b> data when some covariates are involved. For this reason, we consider the regression problem based on BS and BVBS distributions and develop the associated inferential methods.

40|$|International audienceThe {{tribological}} {{behavior of}} dry lubricants {{depends on their}} mechanical and physicochemical environment, {{making it difficult to}} predict in practice. Discrete Element Method-based modeling has been one successful approach to provide valuable insight into the tribology of dry lubricated contacts. However, it requires well-defined interactions between discrete elements, in particular between those simulating different materials. Measuring the properties governing those interactions, such as the work of adhesion (W), is therefore critical. The present work describes a method for measuring the W between AISI 440 C steel and MoS 2 -based coatings used in spacecraft. Using Atomic Force Microscopy local asperity and adhesion measurements, the W between steel microbeads and MoS 2 coatings is determined at different stages in its wear life.

30|$|In this work, {{we studied}} the thermal {{behavior}} and addressed {{the challenges of}} life testing of large area OLED devices. In particular, we developed an indirect method to accurately calculate the life time of large-area OLED lighting panels without physically life-testing the panels. Using small area OLEDs with structures identical with the tested panels, we performed the life tests at desired driving current densities at different temperatures and extracted the relationship between junction temperature and the lifetime for the particular device. By measuring the panel junction temperature during operation under the same current density and using the life time measured on small area test devices, we determine the lifetime of the panels based on the thermal dependence. We test this methodology by predicting the life time of white PHOLED panels and then physically testing the panels. The typical result for the lifetime to 80 % of the initial luminance (LT 80) of the panel at a constant dc current density of 10  mA/cm 2 (3800  cd/m 2), was predicted to be 526  hours in good agreement with the actual <b>life-test</b> at 10  mA/cm 2 of 512  hrs.

Coke deposited on the catalyst was characterized by TG, TPO, FTIR and Raman technique. During the 48 h <b>life-test</b> under the conditions of 510 degrees C, 0. 4 MPa, WHSV (CH 2) = 2 h(- 1), pure n-butane reaction performance of the catalyst changes little, but high LPG and low aromatics yields are obtained. Only under the suitable n-butane/methanol ratio, the relatively good aromatics selectivity can be obtained and maintained during the reaction process. Compared with methanol aromatization, the integrated process exhibits a much slower rate of deactivation. Addition of methanol in n-butane inhibits the dry gas production while promotes the LPG production. Water generated from methanol dehydration may occupy the catalytic active sites for olefins aromatization over the catalyst and thus suppress the production of total aromatics. In fact, water mainly suppresses benzene formation and this inhibiting effect increases with n-butane content in the feed, in contrast to its promoting effect on formation of C- 8 and C- 9 aromatics. Increasing methanol content in the feed, a simultaneous increase in coke content of the spent catalyst and preference for coke deposition in micropore is observed. Furthermore, the fraction of aliphatics in coke decreases, while those of less-condensed aromatics and polyaromatics incease, which {{is associated with the}} increased deactivation of catalyst.

40|$|This article compares {{different}} {{procedures to}} compute confidence intervals for parameters and quantiles of the Weibull, lognormal, and similar log-location-scale distributions from Type I censored data that typically arise from <b>life-test</b> experiments. The procedures {{can be classified}} into three groups. The first group contains procedures based on the commonly used normal approximation for the distribution of studentized (possibly after a transformation) maximum likelihood estimators. The second group contains procedures based on the likelihood ratio statistic and its modifications. The procedures in the third group use a parametric bootstrap approach, {{including the use of}} bootstrap-type simulation, to calibrate the procedures in the first two groups. The procedures in all three groups are justified on the basis of large-sample asymptotic theory. We use Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the finite-sample properties of these procedures. Details are reported for the Weibull distribution. Our results show, as predicted by asymptotic theory, that the coverage probabilities of one-sided confidence bounds calculated from procedures in the first and second groups are further away from nominal than those of two-sided confidence intervals. The commonly used normal-approximation procedures are crude unless the expected number of failures is large (more than 50 or 100). The likelihood ratio procedures work much better and provide adequate procedures down to 30 or 20 failures. By using bootstrap procedures with caution, the coverage probability is close to nominal when the expected number of failures is as small as 15 to 10 or less, depending on the particular situation. Exceptional cases, caused by discreteness from Type I censoring, are noted...|$|E

The third problem studies a distribution free approach for forecasting financial volatility, which is essentially the standard deviation of financial returns. Classical models of this approach use the interval between two symmetric extreme quantiles of the return distribution as a proxy of volatility. Two new models are proposed, which use intervals of expected shortfalls and expectiles, instead of interval of quantiles. Different models are compared with empirical stock indices data. Finally, attentions are drawn towards the heteroskedasticity quantile regression. The proposed joint modelling approach, which makes use of the parametric link between the quantile regression and the asymmetric Laplace distribution, can provide estimations of the regression quantile and of the log linear heteroskedastic scale simultaneously. Furthermore, {{the use of the}} expectation of the check function as a measure of quantile deviation is discussed. i Certificate of Originality “I hereby certify that the work presented in this thesis is my original research and has not been presented for a higher degree at any other university or institute”...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{stability}} of metal/polymer interfaces by measuring the diffusion of calcium into a polymer (OC 1 C 10 PPV) layer during and after deposition of the metal using low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). During deposition the calcium diffusion depth in the PPV {{was found to be}} comparable for untreated samples and samples prepared in oxygen ambient (10 - 7 mbar). In both cases diffusion depths up to 7 nm were observed. For PPV layers treated with atomic oxygen, the diffusion depth during deposition was slightly smaller. After deposition, it was observed that calcium diffusion in OC 1 C 10 PPV continues for several hours. When oxygen was present during calcium deposition or during the spin coating of the PPV, the diffusion coefficient for calcium in PPV was decreased considerably. In these cases accumulation of oxygen (adsorbed in the PPV during deposition or spin coating) at the calcium/PPV interface continued for several hours after deposition. Treatment of the PPV with atomic oxygen before calcium deposition resulted in a strong decrease of the calcium diffusion coefficient after deposition. From XPS measurements it was observed that calcium interacts with the chemically bonded oxygen in the PPV and also with the oxygen absorbed in the PPV layer. It can be concluded that oxygen, either chemically bonded to the PPV chain or adsorbed in the film, reduces the calcium diffusion coefficient. The initial performance of PLEDs with atomic oxygen treated PPV layers and PLEDs with calcium deposited in oxygen ambient was worse than the performance of untreated devices, but the stability in the <b>life-test</b> was bette...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} a failure {{analysis of a}} transmission gearbox used in a motor of a food centrifugal dryer tested with a life test procedure developed by Electrolux Professional. The test apparatus consisted in a prototype of the centrifugal dryer where some aluminum cylinders were installed on the drying basket in order to simulate the maximum loads, that in-service are transferred by the food processed in the dryer to the transmission system investigated in this work. This system is employed for {{the motion of the}} basket trough an electric motor. The aim of this test apparatus was to simulate the service conditions of the components in order to evaluate their mechanical resistance and to verify that the life of the appliance is consistent with the project specifications. Moreover, the <b>life-test</b> presented in this paper can be used to test new materials for this specific application. The gear and the shafts analyzed in this work are made of low-alloyed steel heat treated by induction quenching followed by tempering. Premature failures occurred during the life test are considered in this work. In particular, the components interested by failure are the gear's teeth or the keys used to transfer force from the shaft to the gear. The failure of these components was observed after about 3000 of ON-OFF cycles. The microstructure of the gears and shafts, that exhibited premature failure together with that of intact components, was investigated by optical microscopy. The chemical composition of these components was characterized by means of Rf-GDOES (Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectroscopy). The mechanical properties of the components were investigated by Vickers micro-hardness tests. The experimental results obtained in this work indicate that the failure of the components could be related {{to the quality of the}} materials of the components. In particular, the life test used in this work proved to be an important tool to evaluate the risk of a possible reduction of the products life due to non-conformity with materials specifications...|$|E
