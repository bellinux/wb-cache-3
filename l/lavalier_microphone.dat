Originally, they were held in place with a lanyard worn around the neck, but more often they are fastened to clothing with a clip, pin, tape or magnet. The lavalier cord may be hidden by clothes and either run to an RF transmitter in a pocket or clipped to a belt (for mobile use), or run directly to the mixer (for stationary applications).|$|E
50|$|Moleskin is also {{commonly}} used in video and/or audio productions when using a <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone.</b> When further concealment of a <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone</b> is needed in these types of productions, it can be worn underneath a layer or layers of the singer's clothing. This would normally cause the microphone {{to pick up the}} unwanted noises of the singer's clothing rubbing up against the body and top of the lavalier. Attaching a small strip of moleskin around the microphone body will dramatically reduce the amount of noise created by the singer's clothing and, consequently, reduces the amount of unwanted noise picked up by the <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> are {{attached}} differently {{depending on the}} nature of their use. In theater applications where the microphone is used to amplify an actor or a singer's voice, lavs are typically concealed in the performer's hair; this placement eliminates the possibility of scratching against their clothing while they move, which would result in the amplification of the scratching sounds as well. It also adds to the suspension of disbelief, since the characters themselves would not be wearing microphones, especially if the plot is set in a time before <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> existed. Occasionally, specially designed skin-color headsets known as [...] "headworn microphones" [...] are used in stage applications when actors spend a good deal of their performance singing and moving around quickly, such as in stage musicals and in lecture or presentation scenarios. A headworn microphone is essentially a lavalier on a stiff wire mount that loops over the performer's ear.|$|R

5000|$|In a 1984 study {{administered}} by Cornell University's College of Arts and Sciences, {{it was found}} that the use of lavalier microphones in an academic setting was beneficial to the dissemination of information. By allowing a presenter to move freely in a presenting space, the <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone</b> allows the presenter to offer continuous visual stimulation to the audience, enabling the speaker to hold their attention longer or more easily. Even in smaller applications where the audience contained fewer than twenty-five attendees, the lack of restrictions on the hands proved to offer similar visual stimulation in capturing and maintaining attention.|$|E

50|$|At the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas Røde {{announced}} that it had commenced producing microphones for consumer smartphones, tablets and mobile devices. The first of these products was the iXY, a stereo microphone designed for Apple Inc.’s iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices.It features two ½” cardioid condenser capsules, fixed in a 90 degree alignment to allow for XY stereo recording. Using the Røde Rec app the microphone is capable of recording at resolution of up to 24-bit/ 96 kHz, which at its launch is the only microphone for Apple Inc.’s portable devices capable of such a high sampling resolution. The iXY was recognised {{as a product of}} high quality design in 2013 with a Red Dot award.A month after the release of the iXY, Røde announced the smartLav <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone</b> for smartphones and mobile devices. With a TRRS output connection, the smartLav connects to Apple and Android based smartphones and tablets.|$|E
40|$|Many {{algorithms}} {{have been}} developed to localize audio signals based on the differences in the sound as it arrives at spatially disparate microphones in a larger array or arrays of microphones. While many of these systems perform well with one sound source, tracking multiple sound sources in parallel remains to be a real challenge. In the project, which is presented here, the task was to localize talkers, and then reproduce their voices – which were recorded at close distance with <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> – spatially correct using a loudspeaker rendering system. The localization process was based on time delay differences between various channels of a small-aperture pyramidal five-microphone array. In addition to this common practice, the information gained from the presence of the talker-worn microphones was utilized to estimate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between each talker and the concurrent talkers. An algorithm was designed to select time-frequency bins that showed a high SNR for robust localization of the various talkers and to identify the talkers of the localized sources. It was found that correlating the talker-worn microphones with the microphone array allows for a greater accuracy and precision of localization than with only the microphone array...|$|R
5000|$|In {{television}} and documentary applications, the lavalier will typically be clipped {{to an article}} of the subject's clothing, such as a tie, jacket or collar. In narrative motion picture usage, lavs are almost always hidden under clothing to conceal {{the fact that the}} person is mic'ed. The boom microphone typically sounds [...] "better" [...] and more natural than a lavalier mic and is always a soundperson's first choice; however, for exterior location shooting, it often may be more practical to use a lavalier. One such situation would be during a wide shot that forces the boom operator to keep a distance from the speaker that isn't close enough to achieve a good signal-to-noise ratio with the microphone. In that instance, a lav mic hidden on the speaker due to its proximity would achieve good signal-to-noise ratio for recording of speech. When <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> need to be concealed under clothing, the possibility of material scratching against the microphone is a certain risk. To minimize this problem, sound recordists sometimes wrap the head of the microphones in moleskin or place it inside a hollow-centered, column-shaped sponge and place it under a placard, behind a button, or within the knot of a tie.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} {{microphone}} can be effectively used in language documentation scenarios, {{depending on the}} situation (especially, including factors such as number, position and mobility of speakers) and on budget. In general, condenser microphones should be selected rather than dynamic microphones. It is an advantage in most fieldwork situations if a condenser microphone is self-powered (via a battery); however, when power {{is not a major}} factor, phantom-powered models can also be used. A stereo microphone setup is needed whenever more than one speaker is involved in a recording; this can be achieved via an array of two mono microphones, or by a dedicated stereo microphone. Directional microphones should be used in most cases, in order to isolate a speaker's voice from other potential noise sources. However, omnidirectional microphones may be preferred in situations involving larger numbers of speakers arrayed in a relatively large space. Among directional microphones, cardioid microphones are suitable for most applications, however in some cases a hypercardioid ("shotgun") microphone may be preferred. Good quality headset microphones are comparatively expensive, but can produce recordings of unsurpassed quality in controlled situations. <b>Lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> may be used in some situations, however they produce recordings which are inferior to a headset microphone for phonetic analysis, and are subject to the same concerns that headset microphones are in terms of restriction of a recording to a single speaker.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{recordings}} of speech samples obtained with a dedicated recording device to those from more readily available devices. Speech recordings are used by professionals in the field of communication sciences and disorders to identify and transcribe features of an individual’s speech, regardless of his or her age. This process requires high-quality recordings, but devices intended to produce such recordings are often expensive, not easily accessible, and have few uses. This research addressed the following questions: (A) What combination of microphones and recording devices provides the clearest speech sample based on a signal-to- noise ratio? (B) Does peak clipping distort recorded speech samples for certain combinations of microphones and recording devices? (C) Are differences present between the quality of recordings for different devices dependent on the subject’s age (i. e., child or adult) ? Participants included 4 male and 5 female adults, ages 18 - 26, and 4 male and 4 female children, ages 5 - 10. Participants identified English as their first language, had hearing within normal limits, and had no communication disorders. Each participant was recorded performing three speech tasks. Speech was recorded simultaneously on a dedicated recording device, a personal computer, and an iPad, each paired with an omnidirectional, condenser <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphone.</b> Recordings were analyzed for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and instances of peak clipping. Results were compared by device and age group. Analyses revealed that the iPad yielded highest average SNR, but had the most variable values in most comparisons. The dedicated recording device generally had the lowest average SNR, but was the least variable. Peak clipping was not a significant factor for any device. No adult participants produced clipped signals, while three children did. Results suggest that readily available devices such as personal computers and iPads are appropriate for the types of acoustic analysis performed in this study...|$|E

40|$|There are two {{different}} aspects {{in the process of}} sound design, "Arts" and "Science". In my opinion, the sound design should engage both aspects strongly and in interaction with each other. I started the process of designing the sound for GOLDEN BOY by building the city soundscape of New York City in 1937. The scenic design for this piece is designed in the round, putting the audience all around the stage; this gave me a great opportunity to use surround and specialization techniques to transform the space into a different sonic world. My specialization design is composed of two subsystems [...] one is the four (4) speakers center cluster diffusing towards the four (4) sections of audience, and the other is the four (4) speakers on the four (4) corners of the theatre. The outside ring provides rich sound source localization and the inside ring provides more support for control of the specialization details. In my design four (4) <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> are hung under the center iron cage from the four (4) corners of the stage. Each microphone is ten (10) feet above the stage. The signal for each microphone is sent to the two (2) center speakers in the cluster diagonally opposite the microphone. With the appropriate level adjustment of the microphones, the audience will not notice the amplification of the voices; however, through my specialization system, the presence and location of the voices of all actors are preserved for all audiences clearly. With such vocal reinforcements provided by the microphones, I no longer need to worry about overwhelming the dialogue on stage by the underscoring. A successful sound system design should not only provide a functional system, but also take the responsibility of bringing actors' voices to the audience and engaging the audience with the world that we create on stage. By designing a system which reinforces the actors' voices {{while at the same time}} providing control over localization of movement of sound effects, I was able not only to make the text present and clear for the audiences, but also to support the storyline strongly through my composed music, environmental soundscapes, and underscoring...|$|R
40|$|Next to a man’s wife, his {{secretary}} {{is the most}} important person in his career. She has to understand every detail of his job; to have unquestioning loyalty and absolute discretion. On every count Rose measures up. I’m a lucky man. ”—Richard Nixon, 1957 At some point during the evening of June 20 1972 a conversation between two men was secretly taped on a SONY TC- 800 B reel-to-reel voice recorder. An innocuous machine that uses 0. 5 -mm tape and was set to run at the irregular speed of 15 / 16 IPS—or half the rate of a standard tape recorder. In keeping with this low-fidelity recording mode, the tiny <b>lavalier</b> <b>microphones</b> that picked up this particular conversation were cheap and poorly distributed throughout the space. The result was a tape of degraded sound quality produced under deficient recording conditions. Tape 342, as it is officially referred to, is but one of a sprawling archive of approximately 3, 700 hours of audio recordings taped surreptitiously by the late American President Richard Nixon over a period of several years. Known as the “Nixon White House Tapes” these recordings detail conversations between the President, his staff, and visitors to the White House and Camp David. Of the many thousands of audiotapes confiscated from the Oval Office, Tape 342 remains by far the most infamous. Not because of the damaging or volatile nature of the information it contains, but precisely because of its absence: a gap in the tape of 18 - 1 / 2 minutes. A residual silence that is haunted by the spectre of a man who refused to speak on the grounds that such testimony might be self-incriminatory. In pleading executive privilege Nixon refused to fill in the gap that would return the voice to the machinic silence of the tape and enable the playback of history. When news of the tape’s potential tampering was made public, Nixon’s personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods (now deceased) made two rather contradictory public statements. In her court testimony of November 8 1973 she asserted her secretarial competency, flatly denying ever making any stupid transcription errors when handling the tape recorder. “The buttons said on and off, forward and backward. I caught on to that fairly fast. I don’t think I’m so stupid as to erase what’s on a tape. ” However a month later, under cross-examination in a federal courtroom, she told a rather confused story of how she might after all have made “a terrible mistake” and been partially responsible for the glitch. Woods claimed that while she had been transcribing the tape on her UHER 5000, the telephone suddenly rang causing her foot to press the wrong pedal thus producing the erasure. Summoned by the imperative ringing of the phone, summoned to speak in court, to testify, Rose Mary Woods had been called to action, both to explain her actions and ultimately the actions of her boss. When audio experts later examined the tape they concluded that the RECORD/STOP/RECORD button had actually been pressed 5 to 9 times thus refuting the loyal secretary’s testimony and admission of guilt.
