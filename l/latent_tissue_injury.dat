40|$|Abstract- Knee soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are more}} common among rugby players. Thus this study aimed to assess the {{awareness}} on acute soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> management using PRICE principle among rugby players in Kandy zone. A retrospective whole population survey was conducted among under 17 and 19 school level rugby players who had undergone knee soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries</b> in Kandy zone, Sri Lanka. A self-administered questionnaire which was developed according to the PRICE principal on acute soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> management {{was used as the}} data collection tool. A total of 45 rugby players in seven rugby playing schools in Kandy zone were participated the study. According to the results none of the players followed the PRICE principle correctly to manage acute soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injuries.</b> Even the players not following all the five components of PRICE principle accurately, they have followed each component separately, such as protection (75 %), rest (57 %), ice (37 %), compression (60 %) and elevation (8 %). This study identified that 40 % got recurrent injuries and 38 % of players missed at least one match due to inappropriate soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> management. In conclusion, {{the results of this study}} showed, the lack of awareness on use of the PRICE principle for knee soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> management which should be adapted by the Kandy zone school level rugby player...|$|R
40|$|Mercuric {{chloride}} (HgCl 2) induces autoimmunity in susceptible rat strains, with hyper-IgE, {{appearance of}} a number of autoantibodies, and widespread <b>tissue</b> <b>injury,</b> including necrotizing vasculitis in the gut. In the early phase of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> there is granulocyte infiltration; later there is immunoglobulin deposition along basement membranes in vessels. We have analysed the role of complement in this model using cobra venom factor (CVF), which causes decomplementation lasting around 5 days. The characteristic time course when HgCl 2 is given over 10 days is that <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> and autoantibody levels reach a peak at around day 15 (start of HgCl 2 = day 0). We therefore gave CVF either early (day 0), intermediate (day 5) or late (day 10); a fourth group (controls) received HgCl 2 but no CVF. At each time point, CVF caused complete decomplementation which lasted for at least 5 days. Serum IgE and autoantibody levels were similar in all four experimental groups. <b>Tissue</b> <b>injury</b> in the 'early' CVF group and in the 'late' CVF group was not significantly different from controls, but in the intermediate group <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> was significantly more severe than in controls. These data indicate that the complement system does not {{play a major role in}} the induction of autoantibodies by HgCl 2, nor in the effector phase of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> We speculate that the exacerbation of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> by CVF in the group given this agent at an intermediate stage of the model is explained by the presence of products of C 3 activation which have proinflammatory effects during the phase of active granulocyte-mediated <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Results: Mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly in hemorrhagic shock (df: 12; F= 10. 9; p< 0. 001) and severe soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> + hemorrhagic shock (df: 12; F= 11. 7; p< 0. 001) groups 15 minutes and 5 minutes after injury, respectively. A similar trend was observed in CVP in severe soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> + hemorrhagic shock group (df: 12; F= 8. 9; p< 0. 001). After 40 minutes, pH was significantly lower in hemorrhagic shock (df: 12; F= 6. 8; p= 0. 009) and severe soft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> + hemorrhagic shock (df: 12; F= 7. 9; p= 0. 003) groups.

40|$|Activated {{microglia}} {{are considered}} to play important roles in degenerative processes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Here we examined mechanisms of neurotoxicity of thrombin, a protease known to trigger microglial activation, in organotypic midbrain slice cultures. Thrombin induced a progressive {{decline in the number}} of dopaminergic neurons, an increase in nitric oxide (NO) production, and whole <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> indicated by lactate dehydrogenase release and propidium iodide uptake. Microglia expressed inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in response to thrombin, and inhibition of iNOS rescued dopaminergic neurons without affecting whole <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p 38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) attenuated thrombin-induced iNOS induction and dopaminergic cell death. Whole <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> was also attenuated by inhibition of ERK and p 38 MAPK. Moreover, depletion of resident microglia from midbrain slices abrogated thrombin-induced NO production and dopaminergic cell death, but did not inhibit <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Finally, antioxidative drugs prevented thrombin-induced dopaminergic cell death without affecting whole <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Hence, NO production resulting from MAPK-dependent microglial iNOS induction is a crucial event in thrombin-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, whereas damage of other midbrain cells is MAPK-dependent but is NO-independent...|$|R

Until now, its development in gastroenterology has been insignificant. But, as clinical application such as muco-sal ablation on Barrett’s esophagus became possible, various applications have been developed. Therefore, {{it is important to}} make stan-dards of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury’s</b> extent in cryotherapy prior to clinical trial. We evaluated the <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> according to the application of cryoprobe with a pig model.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether the Th 17 and Treg cell infiltration into allograft tissue is associated with the severity of allograft dysfunction and <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> in acute T cell-mediated rejection (ATCMR). Seventy-one allograft tissues with biopsy-proven ATCMR were included. The biopsy specimens were immunostained for FOXP 3 and IL- 17. The allograft function was assessed at biopsy by measuring serum creatinine (Scr) concentration, and by applying the modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula, which provides the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The severity of allograft <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> was assessed by calculating <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> scores using the Banff classification. The average numbers of infiltrating Treg and Th 17 cells were 11. 6 ± 12. 2 cells/mm 2 and 5. 6 ± 8. 0 cells/mm 2, respectively. The average Treg/Th 17 ratio was 5. 6 ± 8. 2. The Treg/Th 17 ratio was significantly associated with allograft function (Scr and MDRD eGFR) and with the severity of interstitial injury and tubular injury (P < 0. 05, all parameters). In separate analyses of the number of infiltrating Treg and Th 17 cells, Th 17 cell infiltration was significantly associated with allograft function and the severity of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> By contrast, Treg cell infiltration was not significantly associated with allograft dysfunction or the severity of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> The results of this study show that higher infiltration of Th 17 cell compared with Treg cell is significantly associated with the severity of allograft dysfunction and <b>tissue</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R

Kinetic studies using 111 In-labeled neutrophils indicated that the enhanced <b>tissue</b> <b>injury</b> was not the result of increased influx of neutrophils. Infusion of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase prior to induction of the Arthus reaction resulted in 40 - 68 % suppression of <b>tissue</b> <b>injury.</b> Concomitant in vitro functional studies (enzyme secretion, O- 2 and H 2 O 2 generation, and chemiluminescence) of rat neutrophils demonstrated that addition of polyelectrolytes to preformed immune complexes (IgG-bovine serum albumin) resulted in marked increases in O- 2, H 2 O 2, and chemiluminescence, but no increases in enzyme secretion, compared with neutrophils stimulated with immune complexes alone. The cationic polyelectrolytes did not alter the capacity of preformed immune complexes to activate complement in vitro. These studies suggest that both cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes can increase the pathogenic potential of immune complexes and that this modulation is, at least in part, mediated by enhanced generation of toxic oxygen-derived metabolites by neutrophils...|$|R

Furthermore, these increase accompanied the multiple signal molecules genes, such as interferon regulatory factors, nuclear factor-kappa B, low-molecular-weight protein 2, and transporter associated with antigen processing 1.
