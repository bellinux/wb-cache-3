5|$|In April 1996 {{a reunion}} {{was held at}} Belfast {{of people who had}} either helped to build or worked on board Magdalena. It was {{organised}} by the <b>Lagan</b> Legacy heritage organisation. Four of the seven people contacted attended the reunion, with one coming from Australia.|$|E
5|$|The Penrhyn Quarry {{is still}} {{producing}} slate, though {{at a much}} reduced capacity from its heyday {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (a subsidiary of <b>Lagan</b> Building Solutions), which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd quarry in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail quarry. In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley quarry because of subsidence at the site.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley of}} the River <b>Lagan</b> is {{dominated}} by Belfast, whose metropolitan area includes {{over a third of}} the population of Northern Ireland, with heavy urbanisation and industrialisation along the <b>Lagan</b> Valley and both shores of Belfast Lough.|$|E
25|$|On {{completion}} of the repairs on 15 March 1945, HMS Archer {{was transferred to the}} Ministry of War Transport and renamed Empire <b>Lagan.</b> She was used to ferry aircraft to the United Kingdom. Converted to a cargo ship, she operated under the management of the Blue Funnel Line and later A Holt & Co. Empire <b>Lagan</b> was homeported in London. Empire <b>Lagan</b> returned to the USA in Convoy UC 69, which departed Liverpool on 24 May 1945 and arrived at New York on 3 June 1945. She then sailed to Norfolk, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} party changes in <b>Lagan</b> Valley, Strangford and East Antrim {{cancelled}} each other out.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Lagan</b> {{riverside}} {{suffered in}} particular from poor environmental {{conditions and the}} decline of the shipbuilding industry in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, A Most Notorious Woman, {{based upon}} Maggie Cronin's one woman show {{by the same}} name, was {{published}} by <b>Lagan</b> Press, Belfast.|$|E
25|$|Queen's University Belfast Boat Club (QUBBC) is {{the boat}} club of Queen's University Belfast in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It {{is based on}} the River <b>Lagan</b> in the Stranmillis area of the city, about 10 minutes' walk from the university.|$|E
25|$|The {{motorway}} {{follows the}} route of the former <b>Lagan</b> Canal between junctions 2 and 6. The first user of the road was a motorcyclist, Robert McFall of Belfast. The section between Junctions 1 and 3 was subsequently widened to three lanes in each direction.|$|E
25|$|Donegall Quay and The Quays – Donegall Quay is a road linking Oxford Street to Corporation Square. The quay {{itself is}} located {{north of the}} <b>Lagan</b> Weir, {{between it and the}} M3 bridge. In February 2005 Laganside {{announced}} the Obel Tower. The tower will be Northern Ireland's tallest building.|$|E
25|$|The Democratic Unionist Party gained seats {{from the}} UUP in Belfast North and North Down, but lost {{one to the}} UUP in Strangford. The DUP also gained seats in the <b>Lagan</b> Valley (from SF) and South Antrim (from SDLP), but lost a seat in West Tyrone (to UUP or SDLP). Net gain +2.|$|E
25|$|The Laganside Corporation was a non-departmental {{public body}} {{formed by the}} Laganside Development (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 {{with the goal of}} {{regenerating}} large sections of land in Belfast, Northern Ireland adjacent to the River <b>Lagan.</b> This development area was expanded in 1996 to include areas closer to the city centre.|$|E
25|$|On 9 January 1946, Empire <b>Lagan</b> was {{returned}} to the US Navy and renamed USS Archer. She was stricken from the US Navy register on 26 February 1946. MV Archer was laid up at Norfolk, Virginia. On 30 September 1947 she was sold to Mr J F Luley, New York for commercial service.|$|E
25|$|Sinn Féin gained {{seats in}} East Antrim (from UUP) and Fermanagh & South Tyrone (from SDLP), but lost {{one in the}} <b>Lagan</b> Valley (to DUP). It also regained a second seat in Fermanagh & South Tyrone that had been held by an {{independent}} originally elected as Sinn Féin. Net gain +2 from the outgoing Assembly and +1 from 2007.|$|E
25|$|Pro-union {{parties and}} independents contest {{elections}} and represent their constituents {{at a number}} of different levels. There is a unionist presence at election time in all parliamentary constituencies. A Unionist win is a virtual certainty in ten constituencies: East Antrim, North Antrim, South Antrim, Belfast North, Belfast East, North Down, <b>Lagan</b> Valley, East Londonderry, Strangford, Upper Bann.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{developments}} {{at the time}} altered the appearance of Belfast's centre: in 1784 plans were drawn up for the White Linen Hall (now the site of Belfast City Hall) along with new modern streets (now Donegall Square and Donegall Place). Construction was completed by 1788. In 1786 the River Farset was covered over to create High Street and the ford across the <b>Lagan</b> was removed.|$|E
25|$|Jetsam are {{goods that}} were thrown off a ship, {{which was in}} danger, to save the ship. Flotsam are goods that floated off the ship while it was in danger or when it sank. Ligan or <b>lagan</b> are goods left in the sea on the wreck or tied to a buoy {{so that they can}} be {{recovered}} later by the owners. Derelict is abandoned vessels or cargo.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010 general election, {{boundary}} changes {{added the}} Dunmurry ward {{and the northern}} part of Derriaghy ward to this seat. Following public consultation, the proposals were passed through Parliament via the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order. In an unprecedented move by a Boundary Commission, an electoral ward was split between constituencies following disquiet in parts of Derriaghy. This ward is now split between Belfast West and <b>Lagan</b> Valley.|$|E
25|$|The city {{in general}} has seen {{significant}} redevelopment and investment since the Good Friday Agreement. The {{formation of the}} Laganside Corporation in 1989 heralded {{the start of the}} regeneration of the River <b>Lagan</b> and its surrounding areas. Other areas that have been transformed include the Cathedral Quarter and the Victoria Square area. However communal segregation has continued since then, with occasional low level street violence in isolated flashpoints and the construction of new Peace Lines.|$|E
25|$|Notable Catholics in the RUC include RUC Chief Constable Sir James Flanagan, {{who survived}} an IRA {{assassination}} attempt; Deputy Chief Constable Michael McAtamney; Assistant Chief Constable Cathal Ramsey; Chief Superintendent Frank <b>Lagan,</b> and Superintendents Kevin Benedict Sheehy and Brendan McGuigan. In December 1997, The Independent (London) published a leaked internal RUC document which {{reported that a}} third of all Catholic RUC officers had reported suffering religious discrimination and/or harassment from Protestant fellow officers.|$|E
25|$|Titanic was {{launched}} at 12:15p.m. on 31 May 1911 {{in the presence}} of Lord Pirrie, J. Pierpoint Morgan, J. Bruce Ismay and 100,000 onlookers. 22 tons of soap and tallow were spread on the slipway to lubricate the ship's passage into the River <b>Lagan.</b> In keeping with the White Star Line's traditional policy, the ship was not formally named or christened with champagne. The ship was towed to a fitting-out berth where, {{over the course of the}} next year, her engines, funnels and superstructure were installed and her interior was fitted out.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom {{under the}} Merchant Shipping Act 1995, jetsam, flotsam, <b>lagan</b> {{and all other}} cargo and {{wreckage}} remain the property of their original owners. Anyone, including recreational divers and beachcombers, removing those goods must inform the Receiver of Wreck to avoid the accusation of theft. As the leisure activity of wreck diving is common, there are laws to protect historic wrecks of archaeological importance and the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 protects ships and aircraft that are the last resting place of the remains {{of members of the}} armed forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{settlement of}} Belfast {{was little more}} than a village, based around the marshy ford where the River <b>Lagan</b> met the River Farset, which today would be where High Street meets Victoria Street. The Ford of Belfast existed as early as 665, when a battle was fought at the site. The current Church of Ireland church at this location (St. George's) is built on the site of an ancient chapel used by pilgrims crossing the water. The earliest mention of the Chapel of the Ford is in the papal taxation rolls of 1306.|$|E
25|$|The {{opponents of}} the theory argue that Raj Darbhanga was never a kingdom but rather a zamindari with {{all the trappings of}} princely state. The rulers of Raj Darbhanga were the largest landowners in India, and thus were called Raja, and later Maharaja and Maharajadhiraja. However they were never given the status of ruling prince. Further, after conquest of Bengal and Bihar, the British Raj {{initiated}} the Permanent Settlement, and the Raja of Darbhanga was recognised only as a Zamindar. Raj Darbhanga also paid yearly <b>lagan</b> (land tax) to old existing Zamindar of Darbhanga, Kachari at Khan Sahib ki deaorhi.|$|E
25|$|The {{seat was}} {{restored}} in 1922 (having been abolished for the 1918 general election) when {{as part of}} the establishment of the devolved Stormont Parliament for Northern Ireland, the number of MPs in the Westminster Parliament was drastically cut. In 1983 the Sandy Row and Donegall Road areas were removed leaving a seat centred on the west section of Belfast, though between 1983 and 1997 it included the area around the Docks on the north east side of the <b>Lagan</b> Estuary. Belfast West also contains part of the city of Lisburn district {{in the shape of the}} Poleglass and Twinbrook estates.|$|E
25|$|City's ship {{landed in}} Rio de Janeiro on 17 July. On 18 July, City beat Rio English 3-0 (Hunter, Holt, Lovett). The game was very one-sided, with City keeper Reg Loram (Pym missed the {{remainder}} of the tour through injury), the only amateur in the team, not being tested until late in the game. On 19 July, it was announced in the news that Paulista players would travel to Rio. Some had had difficulty getting time off work, so APEA's treasurer travelled to Rio to change the dates of the final two games in order for three Brasileiros from São Paulo -Rubens Salles (Paulistano), Xavier (Ipiranga) and Arthur Friedenreich (Ipiranga)- to play in a league match and catch the overnight train. Later that day, City beat Rio de Janeiro 5-3 (Charlie Pratt 2, <b>Lagan,</b> Goodwin, Hunter). Harry Welfare had put the hosts 3-1 ahead, at which point City became more physical, something which was criticised by the Correio da Manhã. On 21 July, City lost 2-0 to Brasileiros (a selection of Brazilian players from Rio and São Paulo). During the game, <b>Lagan</b> and Fort walked off the pitch, but were convinced to return to the field and finish the game. This is considered to be the Brazilian national team's first ever game. All three games were played at Fluminense's Estádio das Laranjeiras. Harry Robinson played {{in the first two games}} and refereed the last one, making sixteen saves in the first game for Rio English.|$|E
25|$|The Plantation of Ulster in 1609 added a {{twist to}} the fate of the parish. Irish-speaking {{families}} who were driven from their fertile lands in the <b>Lagan</b> Valley and the surrounding areas {{made their way to the}} poor boglands of west Donegal. Some of them made it as far as Gweedore and could go no further west. Around the same time, English and Scottish colonists began to arrive when this uncharted territory was converted to baronies. It appears the parish was very sparsely populated up until the 17th century. The first people to arrive lived on the islands or by the shore in clusters, pockets of houses built close together and in each other's shade.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Belfast became Ireland's {{pre-eminent}} {{industrial city}} with linen, heavy engineering, tobacco and shipbuilding dominating the economy. Belfast, {{located at the}} western end of Belfast Lough and {{at the mouth of the}} River <b>Lagan,</b> was an ideal location for the shipbuilding industry, which was dominated by the Harland and Wolff company which alone employed up to 35,000 workers and was one of the largest shipbuilders in the world. The ill-fated RMS Titanic was built there in 1911. Migrants to Belfast came from across Ireland, Scotland and England, but particularly from rural Ulster, where sectarian tensions ran deep. The same period saw the first outbreaks of sectarian riots, which have recurred regularly since.|$|E
25|$|Once in Argentina, City played eight games. The {{first was}} a 3-0 defeat to Norte at Racing Club's stadium in Avellaneda on 14 June 1914. After being allowed to train at Belgrano Athletic Club, City beat Sur 3-0 on 21 June, again at Racing Club's stadium, with goals from William Hunter, Harry Holt and Billy Lovett. On 24 June, City beat Racing Club 2-0, Holt and Fred Marshall with the goals. This game was marred by a bizarre {{incident}} however, as when City took the lead Racing Club's secretary threatened the referee with a revolver, attempting {{to persuade him to}} send off <b>Lagan</b> (who had kicked Ochoa in the stomach, meaning he had to be carried off).|$|E
25|$|Journalist Kevin Myers {{published}} {{an article in the}} Irish Times on 10 March 2000 regarding the allegations of collusion between a Garda mole and the IRA which had led to the deaths of Breen and Buchanan. Myers' article provoked David Trimble MP for Upper Bann, MLA (and future First Minister of Northern Ireland) to write a letter to the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern TD on 25 March 2000, calling for an inquiry into the allegations of collusion. Jeffrey Donaldson, MP for <b>Lagan</b> Valley, used his parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons on 13 April 2000 to suggest that the named Garda detective sergeant passed on information to the IRA about the meeting in Dundalk which facilitated their ambush of the RUC officers. He also requested a Tribunal of Inquiry into the allegations.|$|E
25|$|On September 7 Essex {{rejected}} the meeting place, but the impatient O'Neill found a spot to ride {{into the river}} up to his horse's belly. It was a gesture of humility, and Essex rode with a troop of horse to an overlooking hill before going down alone to the ford, where he conversed with the rebel for half an hour. Both men withdrew to their companies on the hills. A formal meeting followed later, with six witnesses on either side: Essex rode down to the ford with his men and remained on the bank, while the Irish rode into the river - again, up to their horses' bellies. O'Neill spoke bare-headed for a good while, saluting the viceregal party with great respect. After half-an-hour a further conference was arranged at <b>Lagan</b> ford for the following morning.|$|E
25|$|City beat Liga Rosarina 3-1 (Fred Whittaker 2, Marshall) on 28 June at C.A. Argentino's stadium. The party {{then took}} the {{overnight}} train back to Buenos Aires. The fifth game of the tour saw City beat Combinados 5-0 (Whittaker 3, Lovett, Jimmy <b>Lagan),</b> again at Racing Club. On 9 July, City beat Liga Argentina 3-0 (Hunter 2, Goodwin) at Racing Club, before drawing 0-0 against a representative team of Argentinians (Argentinos) on 11 July at Western Railway Athletic Club's ground in Caballito. The final game in Argentina was again against Liga Argentina at Racing Club on 12 July, a 3-1 (Lovett 2, Goodwin) win. This game saw many changes to City's XI, with trainer Charlie Pratt having to play in goal due to an injury to Dick Pym and Reg Loram having influenza. Injuries to Holt and Marshall also meant reserve defender Gus Harding was selected to play.|$|E
25|$|The route {{starts at}} as a {{continuation}} of the M3 {{to the west of the}} River <b>Lagan</b> at Duncairn. It strikes north past the docks and to the east of Fortwilliam before turning west on slip roads at Junction 2. It now runs through the northern suburbs of Belfast past Whitewell and enters the hill section as it climbs at a gradient of up to 1 in 15, one of the steepest in the United Kingdom. It then passes south of Glengormley before leaving the city behind at Ballyvesy. Entering the countryside, it runs parallel to Ballymartin Water before reaching Junction 5 north of Templepatrick, then crosses Six Mile Water before arriving to the north of Burnside at Junction 6. Running around the north of Antrim, shortly after Junction 7 the road meets an incomplete junction where the motorway would have continued to Ballymena. When the road widens, it becomes the M22.|$|E
25|$|The road {{begins at}} the Broadway {{roundabout}} {{to the west of}} Windsor Park and running parallel to the Blackstaff River. Heading south as a dual three–lane motorway, it passes to the east of Casement Park before crossing the Belfast-to-Newry railway line. Running through Dunmurry and Ballyskeagh it arrives to the south of Lisburn. Traffic for Dublin leaves at junctions 7 and 8 as the motorway enters the countryside. Now heading west past Aghnatrisk it runs parallel to and then crosses the Belfast-to-Newry railway line followed by the River <b>Lagan</b> before reaching Moira. Continuing west, it passes between Killaghy and Tullydagan and to the north of Lurgan and Turmoyra, across the Pound River, south of Lough Neagh, before its junction with the M12. Crossing the River Bann it then enters a relatively unpopulated area. It passes south of Derryadd Lough and runs in a loop around the Annagarriff Nature Reserve before crossing the River Blackwater, skirting to the north of Tamnamore and Laghey Corner before ending at Dungannon on the A4.|$|E

500|$|Exceptionally {{strong winds}} {{from the storm}} buffeted parts of Northern Ireland, with gusts of [...] and [...] {{measured}} in Ballykelly and Tiree respectively. The winds downed {{tens of thousands of}} trees and more than 1,000 telephone lines across the region. In the Baronscourt Forest in County Tyrone, 30,000 trees were blown down. Countless roads across Northern Ireland were blocked by debris and major rail lines had to suspend service. There was severe damage in the city of Derry where a newly built school was destroyed. Losses in the city alone amounted to £500,000 (US$1.4 million). In <b>Lagan</b> Valley, a brick community hall was destroyed. An estimated 200 homes and two churches in Strabane were damaged. The town's labour exchange building was severely damaged as well. In a local cemetery, many tombstones were uprooted from concrete foundations and destroyed. A newly built fire station in Clogher collapsed after its roof was blown off. Several people were injured in Belfast after a glass ceiling collapsed in a bus station and a piece of corrugated roofing blew in from a nearby building.|$|E
