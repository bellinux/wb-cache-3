40|$|The {{actuator}} was redesigned {{to accommodate}} the new thermal motor for the Helios flipper. This design retained the basic configuration and dimensions of the original actuator. Changes were made primarily to the cradle and motor assembly. Because of the increased dimensions of the thermal motor, {{it was necessary to}} increase the diameter of the pellet case and associated parts including the back off spring and the piston return spring. The new springs were designed to yield the same spring rate differential as the originals. The design effort resulted in a new top assembly and approximately twenty sub-assembly and detail drawings.

40|$|The SNOX process, {{developed}} by Haldor Topsoe A/S and demonstrated and marketed in North America by ABB Environmental Systems (ABBES), is an innovative process which removes both sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plant flue gases. Sulfur dioxide is recovered as high purity, concentrated sulfuric acid and nitrogen oxides are converted to nitrogen gas and water vapor; no additional waste streams are produced. As {{part of the}} Clean Coal Technology Program, this project was demonstrated under joint sponsorship from the US Department of Energy, Ohio Coal Development Office, ABBES, Snamprogetti, and Ohio Edison. The project objective was to demonstrate the SO{sub 2 }/NO{sub x} reduction efficiencies of the SNOX process on an electric power plant firing high-sulfur Ohio Coal. A 35 -MWe demonstration was conducted on a 108 -MWe unit, Ohio Edison`s Niles Plant Unit 2, in Trumbull County, Ohio. The $ 31 million project began site preparation in November 1990 and commenced treating flue gas in March of 1992. Testing at the site concluded in December of 1994. This report presents {{a description of the}} technology and design criteria for the demonstration plant including modifications and additions to the Ohio Edison Niles Station Unit 2. Pertinent drawings and a complete <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> are provided for information and reference.

40|$|Increasingly, digital {{architectural}} {{data will}} become available through information technology. Yet until now, {{there were no}} satisfying methods to query this data for architectural purposes. This paper introduces an information retrieval system for parcels that not only allows searching for specific attributes, but also includes properties of shape and context of the building plots. An automatically generated index stores the relevant spatial properties as normalized bitmap images on several layers. When a query is started, only this index has to be queried and not the complete database. The search process can be controlled through a graphical interface that incorporates the useris sketches. The retrieved parcels are presented as a sorted <b>list</b> <b>of</b> vector <b>drawings</b> including their contained buildings.

60|$|There is, however, {{one feature}} of this book that deserves unstinted praise. Mr. Anderson's {{bibliography}} will be found of immense use by every student of Rossetti's work and influence.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{operation}} of a quad redundant data terminal and a multiplexer/demultiplexer (MDU) is described. The most unique feature is {{the design of the}} quad redundant data terminal. This {{is one of the few}} designs where the unit is fail/op, fail/op, fail/safe. Laboratory tests confirm that the unit will operate satisfactorily with the failure of three out of four channels. Although the design utilizes state-of-the-art technology, the waveform error checks, the voting techniques, and the parity bit checks are believed to be used in unique configurations. Correct word selection routines are also novel. The MDU design, while not redundant, utilizes, the latest state-of-the-art advantages of light coupler and interested amplifiers. Much of the technology employed was an evolution of prior NASA contracts related to the Addressable Time Division Data System. A good example of the earlier technology development was the development of a low level analog multiplexer, a high level analog multiplexer, and a digital multiplexer.

50|$|In a {{more recent}} {{research}} effort led by Hawass, the mummy was put through CT scan analysis. Researchers concluded that she may be Tutankhamun's biological mother, an unnamed daughter of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye, not Nefertiti. Fragments of shattered bone {{were found in the}} sinus, and blood clots were found. The theory that the damage was inflicted post-mummification was rejected, and a murder scenario was deemed more likely. The broken-off bent forearm found near the mummy, which had been proposed to have belonged to it, was conclusively shown not to actually belong to the Younger Lady. Scholars think that, after Tutankhamun returned Egypt to the traditional religion, he moved his closest relatives - father, grandmother, and biological mother - to the Valley of the Kings to be buried with him (according to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> figurines and <b>drawings</b> in his tomb).|$|R
