6000|$|Let us {{look into}} the magic mirror {{of the past and}} see this harbor of Cape Cod {{on the morning of the}} 11th of November, in the year of our Lord 1620, as {{described}} to us in the simple words of the pilgrims: [...] "A pleasant bay, circled round, except the entrance, which is about four miles over from <b>land</b> to <b>land,</b> <b>compassed</b> about to the very sea with oaks, pines, junipers, sassafras, and other sweet weeds. It is a harbor wherein a thousand sail of ship may safely ride." ...|$|R
5000|$|Provincetown Harbor was {{the initial}} {{anchoring}} {{place of the}} Pilgrims traveling on the Mayflower in 1620, before they proceeded to Plymouth, Massachusetts. Thoreau later observed that Smith's description of the harbor may have been less colored by the hardships of transoceanic troubles than the Pilgrims'. Mourt's Relation describes the harbor as: [...] "a good harbor and pleasant bay, circled round, except in the entrance, which is about four miles (6 km) over from <b>land</b> to <b>land,</b> <b>compassed</b> about to the very sea with oaks, pines, juniper, sassafras, and other sweet wood; it is a harbor wherein 1000 sail of ships may safely ride, there we relieved ourselves with wood and water, and refreshed our people, while our shallop was fitted to coast the bay, to search for an habitation: there was the greatest store of fowl we ever saw." ...|$|R
2500|$|By [...] the British had got {{far enough}} inland {{to deny the}} Ottomans {{observation}} over the area. On the northern flank, Brigadier-General Hare and the others who had outflanked the Ottoman defences to the north, advanced towards X Beach but after [...] were engaged from Hill 114 and Hare was wounded. The second wave of tows had landed with few losses at around [...] and prepared to attack Hill 138 with {{the survivors of the}} first wave. An inaccurate map caused delay as Hill 138 turned out to have another crest [...] to the south-west crowned with another redoubt. During the <b>landing,</b> <b>compasses,</b> binoculars and watches had been soaked which added to the confusion. Two parties attacked the redoubts but were repulsed as troops on the left flank fought up the gully leading from the beach towards Hill 114, which was also attacked from X Beach. Ottoman prisoners taken near W Beach reported that there was only one division south of Krithia.|$|R
50|$|On shipboard, navigators may use a pelorus {{to obtain}} bearings, {{relative}} to the vessel, from charted objects. A hand bearing compass provides magnetic bearings. On <b>land</b> a hand <b>compass</b> provides bearings to landmarks.|$|R
5000|$|Its face {{resembles the}} rear window of a <b>Land</b> Rover. Its <b>compass</b> {{function}} takes into consideration the magnetic declination of a city so that the compass can point to the true North while geolocated in that city.|$|R
50|$|Recruits {{are also}} {{instructed}} in map reading, <b>land</b> navigation, and <b>compass</b> use. These skills are {{put to the}} test at the compass course, where recruits are divided into groups and must navigate their way to a series of points throughout a wooded area.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Dean Nicolle {{began looking}} for <b>land</b> between Mount <b>Compass</b> and Strathalbyn in 1990 to create an arboretum. The {{specific}} soil type {{he was looking for}} had to be well-drained, limestone-free, and with a neutral or slightly acidic pH. CCA was established in 1992. The site has a Mediterranean climate with 450 mm annual rainfall.|$|R
50|$|On 14-15 July 1940, {{two weeks}} after the German {{occupation}} of the Channel Islands, a British commando raid, code name Operation Ambassador visited Sark, rather than the intended Guernsey {{as a result of a}} faulty <b>compass.</b> <b>Landing</b> on Little Sark the team explored La Sablonnerie and not finding any Germans returned safely to the destroyer.|$|R
25|$|One {{party of}} No.11 {{were taken to}} the wrong island (Sark) as a result of another faulty <b>compass,</b> <b>landing</b> on Little Sark the team {{explored}} La Sablonnerie and not finding any Germans returned safely to the destroyer. Another party crashed into a rock and the other two launches broke down after experiencing a series of technical problems.|$|R
50|$|On 8 July 1940, a British Commando raid Operation Ambassador was {{supposed}} to land troops in Guernsey. One party of No.11 Independent Company {{were taken to the}} wrong island (Sark) {{as a result of a}} faulty <b>compass,</b> <b>landing</b> on Little Sark the team explored La Sablonnerie and not finding any Germans returned safely to the destroyer.|$|R

6000|$|Quite recently, on the 11th of November, 1620, old style, {{as is well}} known, the Pilgrims in the Mayflower came {{to anchor}} in Cape Cod harbor. They had loosed from Plymouth, England, the 6th of September, and, {{in the words of}} [...] "Mourts' Relation," [...] "after many {{difficulties}} in boisterous storms, at length, by God's providence, upon the 9th of November, we espied land, which we deemed to be Cape Cod, and so afterward it proved. Upon the 11th of November we came to anchor in the bay, which is a good harbor and pleasant bay, circled round except in the entrance, which is about four miles over from <b>land</b> to <b>land,</b> <b>compassed</b> about to the very sea with oaks, pines, juniper, sassafras, and other sweet wood. It is a harbor wherein a thousand sail of ships may safely ride. There we relieved ourselves with wood and water, and refreshed our people, while our shallop was fitted to coast the bay, to search for an habitation." [...] There we put up at Fuller's Hotel, passing by the Pilgrim House as too high for us (we learned afterward that we need not have been so particular), and we refreshed ourselves with hashed fish and beans, beside taking in a supply of liquids (which were not intoxicating), while our legs were refitted to coast the back-side. Further say the Pilgrims: [...] "We could not come near the shore by three quarters of an English mile, because of shallow water; which was a great prejudice to us; for our people going on shore were forced to wade a bow-shot or two in going aland, which caused many to get colds and coughs; for it was many times freezing cold weather." [...] They afterwards say: [...] "It brought much weakness amongst us"; and no doubt it led to the death of some at Plymouth.|$|R
60|$|Our plight seemed hopeless to me, but I {{dared not}} let Dian and Juag guess how utterly dismayed I was; though, as I soon discovered, {{there was nothing}} to be gained by trying to keep the worst from Juag--he knew it quite as well as I. He had always known, from the legends of his people, the dangers of the open sea beyond the sight of <b>land.</b> The <b>compass,</b> since he had learned its uses from me, had been all that he had to buoy his hope of {{eventual}} salvation from the watery deep. He had seen how it had guided me across the water to the very coast that I desired to reach, and so he had implicit confidence in it. Now that it was gone, his confidence had departed, also.|$|R
5000|$|The Packbow is a lightweight, {{portable}} archery {{device that}} serves as both a bow and a quiver, and features a compartment for carrying emergency equipment. It was designed to carry arrows inside, and to allow an archer to remove one arrow and shoot it without removing the others. It has a <b>land</b> navigation <b>compass</b> on top, and a signal mirror in the inner compartment for use in an emergency situation. It has a center-fire arrow rest, which eliminates or minimizes [...] "archer's paradox" [...] - a problem in traditional archery that requires training and practice to learn to compensate for its effects on the flight of the arrow. An early prototype, shown on [...] "Make Me a Millionaire Inventor," [...] also featured a bowfishing attachment and bowfishing arrow.|$|R
50|$|The land warfare phase {{teaches the}} class basic weapons, demolitions, land navigation, patrolling, rappelling, marksmanship and small-unit tactics. During third phase, {{the class is}} taught to gather and process {{information}} that will complete the overall mission. There is more classroom work that teaches map, <b>compass,</b> <b>land</b> navigation and basic weapon skill sets. These skill sets allow the class to transition from having novice skills to becoming more comfortable out in the field. Most of this training is new to the class, and the learning pace becomes faster and faster.|$|R
50|$|Soon afterwards, Jeff {{returns in}} a {{spacecraft}} {{to make good}} in his offer to help Derek and Ariel escape. He <b>lands</b> near the <b>Compass</b> Tower, but is immediately taken into custody by a Hunter. Mandelbrot, seeing the landing, arrives in time to save Jeff from the Hunter and the two make their getaway. After meeting with Derek and Ariel and being updated on the situation, they decide to board Jeff's ship and search for Dr. Avery from orbit. Despite the Hunters having anticipated this move, {{they are able to}} avoid capture and make it to orbit.|$|R
40|$|For {{people in}} the early Middle Ages, the earth, air, water and ether teemed with other beings. Some of these were sentient creatures that swam, flew, slithered or stalked through the same environments {{inhabited}} by their human contemporaries. Others were objects that a modern beholder {{would be unlikely to}} think of as living things, but could yet be considered to possess a vitality that rendered them potent. Still others were things half glimpsed on a dark night or seen only in the mind's eye; strange beasts that haunted dreams and visions or inhabited exotic <b>lands</b> beyond the <b>compass</b> of everyday knowledge. This book discusses the various ways in which the early English and Scandinavians thought about and represented these other inhabitants of their world, and considers the multi-faceted nature of the relationship between people and beasts. Drawing on the evidence of material culture, art, language, literature, place-names and landscapes, the studies presented here reveal a world where the boundaries between humans, animals, monsters and objects were blurred and often permeable, and where to represent the bestial could be to hold a mirror to the self...|$|R
