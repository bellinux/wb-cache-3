The whole process runs through several stages: analyzing status of sustainable tenant service, identifying <b>leverage</b> <b>factors,</b> analyzing key factors, and constructing an integrated policy development model of quality and environment management system. Results of this research show that tenant service reviewed from ecological, sociable, technological, institutional dimensions has less-sustainable status. However, when seen from its economical dimension, this tenant service matter is quite sustainable. Multi-dimensional scaling analysis provides results on twenty-three <b>leverage</b> <b>factors</b> which are sensitive to sustainability status. From these <b>leverage</b> <b>factors,</b> prospective analysis is conducted to determine key factors. It is discovered that there are four key factors: area regulations, product development innovations, raw water quantity, and shop houses development. These key factors are essential input for policy development. Researcher applies process hierarchy analysis to construct policy development model. From this model, it is discovered that the most influential actor in the development of quality management and environment system integration policy is area management. Actors pay high attention to economical dimension, but only pay low attention to ecological dimension. Development of quality management and environment system integration policy is directed at the fulfillment of area regulations, as these regulations have the heaviest weight and the highest priority...|$|R

In the first part of this work we derive a model to evaluate <b>leverage</b> <b>factors,</b> by linking them with the probability for the client's portfolio value to go below a certain safety threshold, using Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall approaches.

40|$|Within dynamic 21 st century {{knowledge}} economies, future-building knowledge, {{that bears}} capacities to transcend existing boundaries and create something new, {{is of particular}} importance. Within {{the first decade of}} the new century, new concepts such as "learning from the future" or "self-transcending knowledge" developed within knowledge management. So far, they lacked a theoretical grounding in relevant learning theory as well as a sound acknowledgement and consideration of such knowledge structures' emergence and social embeddedness. Thus, key principles and <b>leverage</b> <b>factors</b> for designing respective knowledge processes were difficult to derive. This dissertation investigates theoretical ground that can provide a basis to explain the creation of future-building knowledge in collective structures. It is guided by the following research question: "How can the emergence of self-transcending knowledge in collective organizational settings be rooted in theories of knowledge, learning and cognition?" Starting from the model of knowledge-based management, the model is expanded by exploring cognitive, creative and social systemic aspects of knowledge creation on a transdisciplinary basis. Research draws on constructivist learning theory, complexity-based approaches in knowledge management and organizational learning, recent accounts in cognitive science (enaction/embodiment) and a creative logic of emergence to derive an integrated model for collective self-transcending knowledge. The model contributes to the integration of knowledge management, organizational learning and cognitive science, expanding knowledge-based management towards attention-based management. The model's three dimensions and three domains form an integrated theoretical basis to derive key principles and <b>leverage</b> <b>factors</b> for steering future-building knowledge processes. Simultaneously, they reveal leverage factors' limited - i. e. enabling, not determining - impact on processes of "organizing future". (author's abstract...|$|R

The study also gave rise to methodological contributions given the development of computational scripts employed to support the identification of each regression´s construct´s strength, orientation and path.

The private sector represents vast pools of funding {{that is needed}} for RE capacity to be unlocked on a sustainable and large scale rate. Through using a grounded theory research design methodology, the drivers and restraints identified were the risks and rewards involved in investing into a RE asset, specifically the macro-economic and microeconomic risk and reward factors involved. Renewable energy assets were found to closely be affected by government policies and the stability thereof. Return attributes to renewable energy were a high cash yielding, long term in nature and inflation indexed payments - all attractive attributes to pension funds, the largest private investment group with regards to assets under management. Through the grounded theory methodology process a causal loop diagram (CLD) was built, representative of the insights of RE as an asset class- gained from the literature. One <b>leveraging</b> <b>factor</b> identified in the CLD to increase investment is government policy stability which will substantially decrease perceived risks to investors and facilitate in increased investments into renewable energy assets...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} how, and to what extent, the advanced network technology such as custom-built large-scale network, or internet-based technology contribute to the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. The uniqueness of the research is to use network technology as a <b>leverage</b> <b>factor,</b> instead of merely one of the supply chain drivers, to analyse how it would impact on the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. Through literature review, we identified the key drivers in supply chain and the key performance indicators as independent and dependent variables respectively for data analysis in the research. We consider the utilisation of network technology as a selection variable in the analysis. We also proposed a set of research questions and hypotheses resulting from the literature review. The subsequent data analyses attempted to find answers for these questions and test {{the validity of the}} hypotheses. This was achieved by a field survey for 1035 major Australian firms through a structured questionnaire. The response rate of the survey was 20. 8 %. All these data were analysed with statistical models such as reliability test, multi-collinearity test, MANOVA procedures, factor analysis, and multiple regression modelling to validate whether the survey was robust and how the <b>leverage</b> <b>factor</b> (network technology) would impact on the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. Each research question and hypothesis was reviewed, validated, and concluded based on the results from data analysis. The key findings from the data analysis support the perception that the network technologies with their external customers and suppliers dramatically affect the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. Statistically it actually determines whether the supply chain will success or fail when comparing firms using the technologies with firms not using them. In general, the impact on the correlations is directional and positive. A set of validated theoretical models was also proposed to depict the dynamics between supply chain variables under the influence of network technology. Implications of the findings are also provided in the thesis...|$|E

In doing so, we present a two-dimensional target-centric taxonomy to integrate previous research: The taxonomy distinguishes the target's level (i. e., individual follower, team, organizational, and extra-organizational) as well as the type of leadership processes that affect either the target's development or leverage of resources.

The NETTAB 2011 workshop, held in Pavia, Italy, in October 2011 was aimed at presenting some of the most relevant methods, tools and infrastructures that are nowadays available for Clinical Bioinformatics (CBI), the research field that deals with clinical applications of bioinformatics. Methods In this editorial, the viewpoints and opinions of three world CBI leaders, who have been invited to participate in a panel discussion of the NETTAB workshop on the next challenges and future opportunities of this field, are reported. These include the development of data warehouses and ICT infrastructures for data sharing, the definition of standards for sharing phenotypic data and the implementation of novel tools to implement efficient search computing solutions.
