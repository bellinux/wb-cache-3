40|$|QoS {{multicast}} routing is a non-linear {{combinatorial optimization}} problem that arises in many multimedia applications. Providing QoS support {{is crucial to}} guarantee effective transportation of multimedia service in multicast communication. Computing the band-widthdelay constrained <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> multicast <b>routing</b> tree is an NP-complete problem. In this paper, a novel heuristic QoS multicast routing algorithm with bandwidth and delay constraints is proposed. The algorithm applies the discrete particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimally search the solution space for the optimal multicast tree which satisfies the QoS requirement.

Two driving parameters are utilized in the adjustable hybrid model to optimize the performance of the PSO-GA hybrid by giving preference to either PSO or GA.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a routing algorithm that maximizes {{the lifetime of}} a sensor network in which all data packets are destined to a single collection node. Lifetime is maximized by adjusting the number of packets traversing each node. The adjustment is carried out by transmitting over alternative routes. First part of the paper assumes that the worst case delay resulting from energy efficient routing {{is less than the}} maximum tolerable value. Ignoring the delay constraint of the network, the routes are selected as the solution to a linear programming (LP) problem in which the objective is to maximize the minimum lifetime of each node. The solution is first implemented in a centralized algorithm. The LP solution is then approximated by an iterative algorithm based on <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> path <b>routing,</b> in which each step is implemented efficiently in a distributed manner. Second part of the paper incorporates delay guarantee into energy efficient routing by limiting the length of the routing paths from each sensor node to the collection node. Simulations reveal that the lifetime of the network increases significantly by optimal routing and there is not always a tradeoff between the delay guarantee and the battery lifetime of the sensor network. The delay of the network keeps increasing as the maximum allowed delay value increases although the optimal lifetime and the connectivity of all the nodes to the collection node is achieved so including delay constraint in energy efficient routing improves the network performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As a {{key issue}} in {{multicast}} routing with quality of service (QoS) support, constrained minimum Steiner tree (CMST) problem has been a research focus {{for more than a}} decade, and tens of heuristics have been developed to solve this NP-complete problem. Among all the previously proposed algorithms, the bounded shortest path algorithm (BSMA) [22] have been proved to be capable of producing a multicast tree that has on average the lowest cost. However, such an excellent cost performance is accompanied with an extremely high time complexity. Recently, Feng et al. presented an alternative implementation of BSMA, which makes use of the latest research results on the delay-constrained <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> (DCLC) <b>routing</b> problem. Simulations indicate that, in comparison with the original implementation, the alternative implementation has a much lower time complexity with virtually identical cost performance, and it also runs much faster than many renowned heuristics such as KPP [11] and CAO [21]. In this paper, we propose a brand new heuristic TCF, which is based on an idea called “tightest constraint first. ” TCF runs a DCLC heuristic only once for each destination and therefore has a provably low time complexity. We further propose an iterative heuristic ITCF, which uses TCF to obtain an initial tree and then gradually refines it. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, in the average sense, TCF can achieve a cost performance comparable to or better than that of BSMA, the cost performance of ITCF is even better than that of TCF, TCF runs approximately twice as fast as ITCF, and ITCF runs 2 ∼ 4 times as fast as the best implementation of BSMA.

40|$|Electrified {{transportation}} and power systems are mutually coupled networks. In this paper, a novel framework is developed for interdependent power and transportation networks. Our approach constitutes solving an iterative <b>least</b> <b>cost</b> vehicle <b>routing</b> process, which utilizes the communication of electrified vehicles (EVs) with competing charging stations to exchange data, such as electricity price, energy demand, {{and time of}} arrival. EV routing problem is solved to minimize {{the total cost of}} travel using the Dijkstra algorithm with the input from EVs battery management system, electricity price from charging stations, powertrain component efficiencies, and transportation network traffic conditions. Through the bidirectional communication of EVs with competing charging stations, EVs charging demand estimation is done much more accurately. Then, the optimal power flow problem is solved for the power system, to find the locational marginal price at load buses where charging stations are connected. Finally, the electricity prices are communicated from the charging stations to the EVs, and the loop is closed. Locational electricity price acts as the shared parameter between the two optimization problems, i. e. optimal power flow and optimal routing problem. Electricity price depends on the power demand, which is affected by the charging of EVs. On the other hand, location of EV charging stations and their different pricing strategies might affect the routing decisions of the EVs. Our novel approach that combines the electrified transportation with power system operation, holds tremendous potential for solving electrified transportation issues and reducing energy costs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using Shanghai transportation network and IEEE 9 -bus test system. The results verify the cost-savings for both power system and transportation networks. Comment: Submitted to Applied Energ...|$|R
