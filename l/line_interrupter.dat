50|$|Multiple devices sharing an <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> (of any {{triggering}} style) all act as spurious interrupt sources {{with respect}} to each other. With many devices on one line the workload in servicing interrupts grows {{in proportion to the}} square of the number of devices. It is therefore preferred to spread devices evenly across the available <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines.</b> Shortage of <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines</b> is a problem in older system designs where the <b>interrupt</b> <b>lines</b> are distinct physical conductors. Message-signalled interrupts, where the <b>interrupt</b> <b>line</b> is virtual, are favored in new system architectures (such as PCI Express) and relieve this problem to a considerable extent.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are fuscous with an obscure whitish subbasal patch and slight white marks representing the antemedial line. There is a lunulate medial white patch in {{and below the}} cell, {{as well as two}} discocellular points. There are also traces of a postmedial line, as well as a submarginal waved line and a black marginal <b>line</b> <b>interrupted</b> by a white patch below the middle. The hindwings have a white base, a broad white antemedial band, a patch beyond the cell, four submarginal spots and a black marginal <b>line</b> <b>interrupted</b> by white patches between the middle and anal angle.|$|R
50|$|Larva blackish dorsally, {{with narrow}} lighter lines; subdorsal lines {{composed}} of small reddish yellow and white spots; lateral <b>line</b> <b>interrupted,</b> reddish yellow. The larvae feed on lichen and mosses, but also leaves of low growing plants on occasion.|$|R

50|$|Much like long {{distance}} calling before the late 90s, busy <b>line</b> <b>interrupt</b> is a service provided, for instance, {{to allow people}} to contact a family member {{in the event of an}} emergency if the receiving party's line is busy and the news cannot wait.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings are greyish-ochreous with an attenuated white costal streak {{from the base}} to two-thirds and a fine white marginal <b>line</b> <b>interrupted</b> by black dots around {{the rest of the}} costa and termen. The hindwings are pale greyish.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{character}} relationships, stichomythia can represent interactions as mundane as question-and-answer exchanges, or as tense as heated rapid-fire arguments.
