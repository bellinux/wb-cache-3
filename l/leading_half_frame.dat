40|$|Previous {{works have}} shown that a dense cluster {{environment}} affects satellite galaxy properties and accelerates or truncates their evolutionary processes. In this work, we use the EAGLE simulation to study this effect, dissecting the galaxies in two halves: {{the one that is}} falling directly to the cluster (<b>leading</b> <b>half)</b> and the one behind (trailing half). Considering all galaxies within the virial radius of the most massive groups and clusters of the simulation (M h a l o > 10 13. 8 [M ⊙]), we find that on average the <b>leading</b> <b>half</b> presents an enhancement of the star formation rate with respect to the trailing half. We conclude that galaxies falling into the intra-cluster medium experience a boost in star-formation in their <b>leading</b> <b>half</b> due to ram pressure. Sparse observations of jellyfish galaxies have revealed visually the enhancement of the star formation in the <b>leading</b> <b>half.</b> In order to confirm this effect statistically using observations, different cases must be investigated using the simulation as a test dataset...|$|R

50|$|Frames {{can be made}} to {{hold the}} lenses in several {{different}} ways. There are three common styles: full <b>frame,</b> <b>half</b> <b>frame,</b> and frameless. Full frame glasses have the frame go all around the lenses. <b>Half</b> <b>frames</b> go around only half the lens; typically the frames attach {{to the top of the}} lenses and on the side near the top. Frameless glasses have no frame around the lenses and the ear stems are attached directly to the lenses. There are two styles of frameless glasses: those that have a piece of frame material connecting the two lenses, and those that are a single lens with ear stems on each side.|$|R

50|$|Maitani joined Olympus in 1956 {{and worked}} for them for 40 years. He was {{involved}} with the design {{of many of the}} company's most well-known cameras, including the Pen and the Pen F <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> cameras, the OM System, the XA and later the Stylus.|$|R
50|$|Another {{process called}} Techniscope was {{developed}} by Technicolor Inc. in the early 1960s, using normal 35 mm cameras modified for two perforations per (<b>half)</b> <b>frame</b> instead of the regular four and later converted into an anamorphic print. Techniscope was mostly used in Europe, especially with low-budget films.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{simulations}} were done to acquire data on 3 D and fire behaviour of an ex-tended endplate joint, and {{to evaluate the}} suitability of the FEM software SAFIR on modelling 3 D beam to column joints. Three cases were modelled, two with simplified joints in ambient temperature, and one with <b>half</b> of a <b>frame</b> modelled in fire condition. The simple joints were loaded with moment to strong (vertical) direction, and moment to the weak (horizontal) direction. The <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> was loaded with a constant load and subjected to a standard fire. The results of these simulations were compared with the component method calculations according standard EN 1993 - 1 - 8 (2005) for simplified model, and with the test data from the test done at the University of Manchester (Wang et al 2008) for the <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> model. Notes on modelling and sources of error are discussed in conclusions. /Kir 1...|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s cameras {{came out}} that were {{intended}} to make stereo pairs, specifically designed to use print film, producing a <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> format that could be viewed using freevision or the included print viewer, directly as {{it came from a}} standard processing lab. The original Loreo was the pioneer, but it was followed by several other cameras, including some designed to take macro shots.|$|R
50|$|In a {{composite}} video signal (CVS) {{there are two types}} of blanking: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal blanking is between lines and vertical blanking is between fields (<b>half</b> <b>frames).</b> In a poorly tuned TV receiver the horizontal blanking can be seen at the right or left of the image and the vertical blanking can be seen at the top or bottom of the image. VIT signals are inserted in the vertical blanking.|$|R
50|$|<b>Half</b> <b>frame</b> {{meant that}} the camera used an 18&times;24 mm {{vertical}} (portrait) format, producing twice the pictures on a roll of 135 film as the regular 36&times;24 mm format. The smaller image format also allowed for a smaller camera and lenses, making the Pen F system {{one of the smallest}} SLR systems ever made; the Pentax Auto 110 was smaller, but with a much more limited range of lenses and accessories, and smaller 110 film.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989: Yashica Samurai Z-L (Japan): first SLR {{intentionally}} {{designed for}} left-handed operation. Took up to 72 exposures of horizontal 18×24 mm single <b>frames</b> (also called <b>half</b> <b>frames)</b> on 135 film. Had flat-topped non-pentaprism mirror reflex and optical relay viewfinder. Also had unique-to-Samurai-series vertical body design with fixed autofocus 25-75mm f/4-5.6 zoom lens, interlens leaf shutter, programmed autoexposure, built-in motor drive and electronic flash. Was mirror copy of auto-everything, point-and-shoot Samurai Z camera.|$|R
5000|$|Cassini Regio is {{the enigmatic}} dark area {{that covers the}} <b>leading</b> <b>half</b> of Saturn's moon Iapetus.

An original storage method of two images on the two <b>half</b> <b>frames</b> of a video camera permits now to decrease the interval between exposures (10 mus).

50|$|A Phase Alternating Line (PAL)-based {{television}} set display, for example, scans 50 fields every second (25 odd and 25 even). The {{two sets of}} 25 fields work {{together to create a}} full frame every 1/25 of a second (or 25 frames per second), but with interlacing create a new <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> every 1/50 of a second (or 50 fields per second). To display interlaced video on progressive scan displays, playback applies deinterlacing to the video signal (which adds input lag).|$|R
5000|$|Another {{supporting}} structure at Corotoman {{was known as}} the [...] "Spinster's House." [...] The house was constructed in either the late 17th century or the early 18th century. The [...] "Spinster's House" [...] was a one-story and a <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> house adorned with a gabled roof with large end chimneys. It lay in ruins for years before finally disappearing around 1930. Before its disappearance, the [...] "Spinster's House" [...] was the last remaining {{supporting structure}} of the original Corotoman plantation.|$|R
40|$|The use of hexapod {{circular}} external fixators has simplified {{the ability}} to correct complex limb deformities without cumbersome frame reconfigurations. These frames are applied primarily using half pin mountings and {{may be difficult to}} utilize given the constraints of traditional half pin constructs. We compared the biomechanical performance of simplified divergent <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> to mountings currently being utilized for application of hexapod frames. Three 6 -mm half pins per limb segment were placed into sawbones at 60 ° divergent angles in both the sagittal and coronal planes in a 2 -cm diaphyseal fracture gap model. Pin mountings were attached to a standardized four-ring construct. This was compared to similar four-ring frames with two differing pin/wire configurations: (1) two tensioned wires per ring placed at 90 ° angles, a total eight wires; and (2) two 5 -mm half pins per ring placed at 90 ° angles, a total eight half pins. The divergent 6 -mm <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> demonstrated similar performance compared the standardized tensioned wire and 5 -mm <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> in terms of axial micromotion and angular deflection. Based on the mechanical performance of these divergent <b>half</b> pin <b>frames</b> we believe they can be used clinically without detrimental consequences...|$|R

50|$|Michigan was won by Democrat nominee John Kerry by a 3.4% {{margin of}} victory. Although no Republican carried this {{state in a}} presidential {{election}} since 1988, early polling showed the race was a toss-up, thus was considered as a possible target for the Republicans.

5000|$|In a {{somewhat}} [...] "retro" [...] development, many stereo photography buffs used the Nimslo to take stereo slides which were mounted in [...] "4P" [...] (<b>half</b> <b>frame)</b> slide mounts. This {{was done by}} using either slip in cardboard mounts, some specially labeled with the Nimslo name or aluminum masks such as the Realist [...] "closeup" [...] mask. These masks were sometimes put in metal frames and placed between glass, much like Realist format slides. The resulting stereo slides could then be viewed using conventional Realist format viewers or even projected with stereo projectors.|$|R
40|$|Lift, drag, {{internal}} flow, {{and pressure}} distribution measurements {{were made on}} a low-drag airfoil incorporating various air inlet designs. Two leading-edge air inlets are developed which feature higher lift coefficients and critical Mach than the basic airfoil.

50|$|Semicircular rotary {{shutters}} {{also have}} the advantage of unlimited X-sync speed, but all rotary FP shutters have the disadvantage of the bulk required for the plate spin. The Univex Mercury (1938, USA) <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> 35 mm camera had a very large dome protruding out the top of the main body to accommodate its 1/1000 s rotary shutter. They also produce very unusual distortion at very high speed because of the angular sweep of the exposure wipe. Bulk can be reduced by substituting blade sheaves for the plate, but then the rotary FP shutter essentially becomes a regular bladed FP shutter.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the camera is {{reminiscent}} of the Olympus Pen <b>half</b> <b>frame</b> film cameras and is marketed as the Olympus digital PEN. The model presented on 16 June 2009 was very similar in looks to the Olympus Pen F. Initially, two micro 4/3 lenses were available from Olympus, one 14-42 mm f/3.5-5.6 zoom and a 17 mm f/2.8 [...] pancake prime lens. Remarkably, {{with the exception of the}} optical viewfinder, the E-P1 seemed to fit most of the features found on the Olympus E-620, a larger Four Thirds system DSLR, into the small, compact MFT form factor.|$|R
