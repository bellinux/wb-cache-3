50|$|This is the discography of Tom Morello, an American Grammy-award winning rock guitarist most {{known for}} his work with the bands Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club and as his folk alter-ego The Nightwatchman. Morello started playing guitar in the mid 80's in the band Electric Sheep {{together}} with future Tool guitarist Adam Jones on bass. After graduating cum laude from Harvard University in 1986 with a BA in political science, he moved to Los Angeles, where he briefly worked as an aide to Senator Alan Cranston. Later Adam Jones moved to L.A. as well; Morello introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey, who would come to form the band Tool. In the late 80's Morello was recruited to replace original guitar player Mike Livingston in the rock band Lock Up, in 1986 the band released its only album Something Bitchin' This Way Comes. In 1991 Morello left <b>Lock</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> start a new band, after being impressed by Zack de la Rocha freestyle rapping he invited him to join his band, he also drafted Brad Wilk who had previously auditioned as a drummer for Lock Up. After Zack convinced his childhood friend Tim Commerford to join as the band's bass player the line up was complete.|$|E

50|$|Galling is {{adhesive}} {{wear that}} {{is caused by}} microscopic transfer of material between metallic surfaces, during transverse motion (sliding). It occurs frequently whenever metal surfaces are in contact, sliding against each other, especially with poor lubrication. It often occurs in high load, low speed applications, but also in high-speed applications with very little load. Galling is a common problem in sheet metal forming, bearings and pistons in engines, hydraulic cylinders, air motors, and many other industrial operations. Galling is distinct from gouging or scratching in that it involves the visible transfer of material as it is adhesively pulled (mechanically spalled) from one surface, leaving it stuck to {{the other in the}} form of a raised lump (gall). Unlike other forms of wear, galling is usually not a gradual process, but occurs quickly and spreads rapidly as the raised lumps induce more galling.It can often occur in screws and bolts, causing the threads to seize and tear free from either the fastener or the hole. In extreme cases, the bolt may <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the point where all turning force is used by the friction, which can lead to breakage of the fastener or the tool turning it. Threaded inserts of hardened steel are often used in metals like aluminium or stainless steel that can gall easily.|$|E
5000|$|The Haihe Port Area (...) {{operates}} all river docks {{from the}} Xingang Shipping <b>Lock</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Haihe Second Tidal Barrier, {{a distance of}} 39.5 km. Once {{the core of the}} Tanggu port, the lower Haihe river area has seen diminishing number of wharves as riverfront real estate has been reassigned for development. In 2003, the Haihe Port Area had 7,100 m of quayside, 83 berths, 56 production berths dealing with all sorts of cargo including containers. The start of the work on the new Tanggu CBD, however, meant the demolition of most facilities in the Xiangguowan, Yujiapu and Lanjingdao peninsulas, including the large Third Stevedoring Company terminal in Yujiapu, which closed in 2009.This wind-down of activity is still continuing, and on January 1, 2012, the Haihe will be downgraded from a category I waterway into a category IV, limited to vessels under 1,000 DWT and 10 m of air draft (which will permit the extensive bridge construction planned for the lower Haihe). This change will effectively close the river to seagoing vessels, and limit Haihe traffic to barges. Nevertheless, industrial expansion further up the river will lead to a recovery in the number of available berths. Current plans call for six different production areas, with an area of 9.7 km2 and a quayside length of 21 km.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} very low {{complexity}} timing error detector for nT = 2 orthogonal space-time block coded M-PSK systems with an arbitrary number of receive antennas. The algorithm uses maximum-likelihood detection variables to estimate the timing error by examining the difference in threshold crossings, similarly to the Mueller and Muller Detector. We show that the timing error estimation is independent of the channel state, thus making it very robust in poor channel conditions. The decision directed version of the detector is {{used to evaluate the}} tracking performance for BPSK and QPSK signaling in 1 -, 2 - and 4 -receive antenna systems. Symbol error rate as well as mean square estimation error results are presented. We examine the performance {{as a function of the}} timing drift and show that the receiver is able to maintain <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a normalized timing bandwidth of BτT = 0. 001. Complete channel state estimation is assumed throughout the paper. I...|$|E
40|$|Integrated mode-locked {{laser diodes}} are {{effective}} sources of periodic sequences of optical pulses, which {{have always been}} of great interest {{for a range of}} spectroscopy, imaging and optical communications applications. However, some disadvantages prevent their widespread use, such as the restricted tuning of their repetition rate and their output power levels never exceeding a few mW. This thesis reports on the work done to address those limitations. Two main findings are presented, the first being the generation of ultra-high repetition rate optical signals through external injection of two continuous wave signals. This mechanism is much simpler than other techniques previously proposed to increase the repetition rate of monolithic modelocked laser, and has proved successful in generating optical signals up to quasi-THz. It is based on injection of two continuous wave signals whose spacing is an integer multiple of the pulsed cavity free spectral range and whose injection wavelengths coincide with two of the monolithic laser modes. This technique allows discrete tunability of the repetition rate with a step equal to the injected cavity free spectral range, and the injected laser has been shown to <b>lock</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a repetition rate of 936 GHz, corresponding to 26 times that of the free-running semiconductor laser (36 GHz). The presented scheme is suitable for integration, opening the way for a successful on-chip generation of ultra-high repetition rate optical signals exploiting coupled cavity phenomena. The second main finding of this thesis regards the changes induced on the pulsed operation of monolithic passively mode-locked lasers by a blue bandgap detuning applied to their saturable absorber. The quantum well intermixing technique has been used for attaining an area-selective bandgap shift on the fabricated chip, being fully postgrowth. The lasers with a detuned absorber were found to have an extended range of gain section currents and absorber voltages in which stable mode-locking operation took place. Furthermore, a comparison of mode-locked devices fabricated on the same chip, respectively with and without a bandgap detuned absorber, showed that the emitted pulses had greater peak power and were less affected by optical chirp when the bandgap of the absorbing section was shifted. A new intermixing technique has also been developed as part of this work to address some inconsistencies of the pre-existing one; the newly introduced approach has been found to provide better spatial resolution and a more precise control of the attained bandgap shift...|$|E
