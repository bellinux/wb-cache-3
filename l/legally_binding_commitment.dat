50|$|In {{addition}} to reducing emissions directly this system may also alleviate competitiveness concerns in twofold ways: firstly, {{domestic and foreign}} producers {{are exposed to the}} same carbon tax; and secondly, if multiple countries are competing for the same export market they can promote environmental performance as a marketing tool. A loss of competitiveness resulting from the absence of <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>commitments</b> for non-Annex B countries was the principal reason the USA and Australia, two heavily emitting countries, did not originally ratify the Kyoto protocol (Australia later ratified in 2007). By alleviating such concerns more countries may participate in future climate policies resulting in a greater percentage of global emissions being covered by <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> reduction policies. Furthermore, as developed countries are currently expected to reduce their emissions more than developing countries, the more emissions are (fairly) attributed to developed countries the more they become covered by legally bound reduction policies. Peters argues that this last prediction means that consumption-based accounting would advantageously result in greater emissions reductions irrespective of increased participation.|$|R
40|$|This article {{argues that}} a <b>legally</b> <b>binding,</b> {{multilateral}} agreement is {{a necessary condition for}} achieving the highest levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions consistent with limiting warming to below either 2 °C or below 1. 5 °C. Clear <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>commitments</b> within a multilaterally agreed process with strong legal and institutional characteristics are needed to give countries the confidence that their economic interests are being fairly and equally treated. Common accounting rules are needed for comparability of effort, and in order to protect environmental integrity, to demonstrate transparency, for effective monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of emissions and actions, and to facilitate and support a strong international carbon market. Securing full implementation will depend, in part, on the strength of an agreement's compliance mechanism. The Copenhagen Accord, by itself, represents a quintessential ‘bottom-up’/‘pledge and review’ approach. It is open to interpretation whether the Accord can become a stepping stone on the way to strengthening the <b>legally</b> <b>binding,</b> multilateral framework to fight climate change, building on both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, or whether it will lead to the unravelling and fragmentation of all that has been built up to date.

40|$|Global {{environmental}} problems are often complex and interconnected, with effects at different scales, local to global. An {{increasing number of}} environmental issues exhibit such linkages, both in effect and in driving force, including loss of biodiversity, land degradation, and climate change. It is typically recognized that management of all commons, including the global atmosphere and forests, requires robust institutions to coordinate and cooperate at different scales (Ostrom and Ahn 2003). This involves interactions among institutions both horizontally (spatially) and vertically (across levels of organization), from the global to the local.

There have been some two hundred global environmental agreements and protocols, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) and its Kyoto Protocol.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{increasingly}} prevalent and urgent topic of debate {{and there is}} little dispute that reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required (Stern Review, 2006). Given the scope of importance, there is international pressure for governments to act on climate change (Green, 2014).

These instruments established a framework for cooperation in climate change mitigation and in facilitating climate change adaptation, in particular in developing countries. They were based upon the principle of shared but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities of States. The Kyoto Protocol mainly focuses on <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>commitments</b> of industrialised countries which are historically responsible for enhanced levels of greenhouse gas emissions.

50|$|Under the Kyoto Protocol, {{countries}} with targets could elect to reach these targets in co-operation with other countries. The European Union {{has decided to}} work as a unit to meet its emissions targets. The European climate change program attempts to do this by utilising an emissions trading scheme known as the European Union Greenhouse Gas Emission Trading Scheme. The principle of this scheme is quite simple: to make their <b>legally</b> <b>binding</b> <b>commitments</b> under Kyoto, countries can either make these savings within their own country, or they can buy these emissions reductions from other countries. These other countries would still need to meet their Kyoto targets, but the use of a free market system ensures the reductions are made for the least possible costs. Most reductions are made where these reductions are cheapest, and the excess reductions can be sold on to other countries where such cuts would be less economically viable. The EU ETS is arguably the global template for emissions trading schemes that are being implemented globally (China, South Korea, Tokyo and others).|$|R
