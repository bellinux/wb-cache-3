40|$|Mechanisms of CNS repair have vital medical implications. We {{show that}} {{traumatic}} {{injury to the}} ventral midline of the embryonic Drosophila CNS activates cell divisions to replace <b>lost</b> <b>cells.</b> A pilot screen analyzing transcriptomes of single cells during repair pointed to downregulation of the microtubule-stabilizing GTPase mitochondrial Rho (Miro) and upregulation of the Jun transcription factor Jun-related antigen (Jra). Ectopic Miro expression can prevent midline divisions after damage, whereas Miro depletion destabilizes cortical β-tubulin and increases divisions. Disruption of cortical microtubules, either by chemical depolymerization or by overexpression of monomeric tubulin, triggers ectopic mitosis in the midline and induces Jra expression. Conversely, loss of Jra renders midline cells unable to replace damaged siblings. Our data indicate that upon injury, {{the integrity of the}} microtubule cytoskeleton controls cell division in the CNS midline, triggering extra mitosis to replace <b>lost</b> <b>cells.</b> The conservation of the identified molecules suggests that similar mechanisms may operate in vertebrates...|$|R

One of the critical proteinases involved in {{cell migration}} is membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT 1 -MMP/MMP- 14). MT 1 -MMP degrades extracellular matrix to make a path for cells to migrate, sheds cell surface molecules to give migratory signals, and activates ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase) enhancing cell migration. For MT 1 -MMP to promote cell migration, it needs to act in co-ordination with other cell migration machinery.

40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{supported}} the existence of neural stem cells in the adult mammalian CNS. Important features of such cells are self-renewal and multipotency, i. e., they can give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and thus in principle replace <b>lost</b> <b>cells</b> in the CNS. Observations in several animal models of CNS diseases have shown that by unknown mechanisms endogenous as well as exogenous precursor cells preferentially migrate to damaged areas. Microglia are immunoreactive cells of nonneural lineage resident in the CNS. After injury to the CNS, microglia are rapidly activated and found concentrated at the sites of injury. In the present article we show, in two different assays, that soluble factors released from mouse microglial cells direct the migration of neural CNS precursor cells. We also provide evidence that microglia {{have the capacity to}} influence the differentiation of both adult and embryonic neural precursor cells toward a neuronal phenotype. Given that an invariant feature of pathological processes in CNS is the activation of microglia, these results indicate an important and unique role for microglia in directing the replacement of damaged or <b>lost</b> <b>cells</b> in the CNS...|$|R

40|$|Tooth {{morphogenesis}} {{results from}} reciprocal interactions between oral epithelium and ectomesenchyme {{culminating in the}} formation of mineralized tissues, enamel, and dentin. During this process, epithelial cells differentiate into enamel-secreting ameloblasts. Ameloblastin, an enamel matrix protein, is expressed by differentiating ameloblasts. Here, we report the creation of ameloblastin-null mice, which developed severe enamel hypoplasia. In mutant tooth, the dental epithelium differentiated into enamel-secreting ameloblasts, but the cells were detached from the matrix and subsequently <b>lost</b> <b>cell</b> polarity, resumed proliferation, and formed multicell layers. Expression of Msx 2, p 27, and p 75 were deregulated in mutant ameloblasts, the phenotypes of which were reversed to undifferentiated epithelium. We found that recombinant ameloblastin adhered specifically to ameloblasts and inhibited cell proliferation. The mutant mice developed an odontogenic tumor of dental epithelium origin. Thus, ameloblastin is a cell adhesion molecule essential for amelogenesis, and it plays a role in maintaining the differentiation state of secretory stage ameloblasts by binding to ameloblasts and inhibiting proliferation...|$|E

40|$|The {{establishment}} and heritable maintenance of specific epigenetic states {{that lead to}} differential gene expression are crucial for cell differentiation and development. Over the past few years, it has become apparent that epigenetic control of transcription is mediated through specific states of the chromatin structure.

Here, we discuss recent findings on plant proteins involved in modifying, remodeling, or maintenance of chromatin structures. Many of the proteins affect normal development when their function is <b>lost.</b> <b>Cell</b> differentiation and development are controlled through temporal and spatial activation and silencing of specific genes.

The {{results showed that}} the <b>lost</b> <b>cell</b> viability induced by H(2) O(2) was markedly restored after 24 h pre-incubation with COS (0. 1 - 0. 4 mg/ml).

In addition, COS could prevent cell apoptosis induced by H(2) O(2), as shown by the inhibition of the cleavage of poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase and increased expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. Furthermore, we have utilized confocal laser microscopy to observe cellular uptake of COS, an important step for COS to exert its effects on target cells.
