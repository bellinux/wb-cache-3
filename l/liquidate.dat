5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party.

Alexander was forced to <b>liquidate</b> his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{football}} club {{was formed in}} 1875, it was not incorporated until 1903. The club remained a private company until 1988, when it was publicly listed on the London Stock Exchange. This public listing, combined with poor financial performance, made Hibs vulnerable to an attempted takeover in 1990 by Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer. This attempt was averted when Mercer was unable to acquire the 75% shareholding needed to <b>liquidate</b> the company.|$|E

Arne Wam responded by stating that NSB wanted to <b>liquidate</b> the company. NSB therefore offered to purchase all shares in the company at par value, despite the company not having any net assets.|$|E
5|$|Tinker {{made up to}} $250,000 in {{his real}} estate business.

5|$|A {{deal for}} the sale of Constitution Center was agreed to in December 2012. MetLife and an {{unidentified}} investor (represented by Clarion Partners LLC) each purchased a 50 percent interest in the building. The sale price was $734 million, or $524 per square foot (0.093 square meters). The sale price was the most expensive in D.C. history for a single building. (It was not the most paid per square foot, however. That record went to two-building Market Square at 701 and 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, which sold in 2011 to Wells Real Estate Investment Trust for $905 per square foot.) When the deal closed in February 2013, David Nassif Associates announces it would wind down its operations and <b>liquidate</b> its remaining obligations.|$|E

A minor recession in 1921–22 caused {{a large number of}} customers to default on their payments, resulting in the repossession of their typewriters. The company opted not to borrow money and, in 1926, the board of directors voted to <b>liquidate</b> the company. Only one employee, Chester Nelson, was retained to oversee the company's liquidation.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{there was}} no major hostility {{as a result of}} the {{division}} of loyalty between the royalty and the nobility. In the same year, an English merchant, W.H. Read, controlled Sultan Ali's royal seal in exchange for a promise to <b>liquidate</b> his debts. Read had been an active supporter of Sultan Ali's claims for recognition as the legitimate ruler of Johor and the state's revenue, with the Temenggong as his vassal. As a result of economic and political pressure from these traders, the Governor did consider granting a formal recognition to Sultan Ali as the legitimate ruler of Johor, but in the process, he received a strong protest from the Temenggong and his young son, Abu Bakar.|$|E
5|$|One reason {{given to}} explain {{the failure of the}} bulk of the {{garrison}} to support the rebels was that a local VNQDĐ leader inside the garrison, Quang Can, had fallen ill in the lead-up and was sent to a hospital in Hanoi. When he heard of the failed uprising, he committed suicide. In addition, the insurrectionists had failed to <b>liquidate</b> the Garde indigène (native gendarmerie) post of Yen Bay town and were unable to convince the frightened civilian population to join them in a general revolt. At 07:30, a counterattack by tirailleurs of the 8th company of the battalion led by their French commander, backed by a single aircraft, scattered the mutineers; two hours later, order was re-established in Yen Bay.|$|E

5000|$|Parties may {{contract}} for <b>liquidated</b> damages {{to be paid}} upon a breach of the contract {{by one of the}} parties. Under common law, a <b>liquidated</b> damages clause will not be enforced if the purpose of the term is solely to punish a breach (in this case it is termed penal damages). The clause will be enforceable if it involves a genuine attempt to quantify a loss in advance and is a good faith estimate of economic loss. Courts have ruled as excessive and invalidated damages which the parties contracted as <b>liquidated,</b> but which the court nonetheless found to be penal.

5|$|As a run {{began on}} the Trust Company of America, Morgan worked with Stillman and Baker to <b>liquidate</b> the company's assets to allow the bank to pay depositors. The bank survived to the close of business, but Morgan knew that {{additional}} money {{would be needed to}} keep it solvent through the following day. That night he assembled the presidents of the other trust companies and held them in a meeting until midnight when they agreed to provide loans of $8.25 million to allow the Trust Company of America to stay open the next day. On Thursday morning Cortelyou deposited around $25 million into a number of New York banks. John D. Rockefeller, the wealthiest man in the United States, deposited a further $10 million in Stillman's National City Bank. Rockefeller's massive deposit left the National City Bank with the deepest reserves of any bank in the city. To instill public confidence, Rockefeller phoned Melville Stone, the manager of the Associated Press, and told him that he would pledge half of his wealth to maintain U.S. credit.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to <b>liquidate</b> it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite the government having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the ground facilities of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 1967, President Lyndon Johnson {{nominated}} Combs to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, {{replacing the}} deceased Shackelford Miller, Jr., and the Senate confirmed the nomination on April 5, 1967. Because {{of the rules}} of the federal judiciary, Combs had to <b>liquidate</b> his business and banking assets and severely restrict contact with many of his political acquaintances to avoid potential conflicts of interest with cases he might adjudicate on the Court of Appeals. He expressed frustration that the cases that came before the court were frequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which often gave little weight to the opinions rendered by the Court of Appeals. Consequently, he resigned from the court on June 5, 1970, and joined the Louisville law firm of Tarrant, Combs, and Bullitt (later Wyatt, Tarrant & Combs).|$|E
