It was swift, it was violent, it was slick. I would not have minded seeing a little more of Damon’s “playtime” with Wes. Katherine going to hell was an obvious choice, but I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> did it. <b>The</b> comedy of her {{slapping}} Bonnie’s shoulders, trying to get it to work, then just getting swallowed up by darkness." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Heavy Competition" [...] {{was written}} by Ryan Koh and {{directed}} by Ken Whittingham. It was the fifth of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire. Elba {{said he did not}} watch the episode after it aired because [...] "I'm hypercritical about my work, so I try not to torture myself." [...] Rainn Wilson said he liked the episode because it demonstrated growth for his character and the relationship between Michael and Dwight; he said [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> let characters grow and change on the show," [...] and said of his character, [...] "It's not the same acolyte ass kissing as season 2". Wilson said the moment Dwight spun around the HarperCollins secretary saying [...] "Spin move", which was included in the script, {{was one of the most}} popular moments of the episode among the writers. Wilson said of filming the move, [...] "We did like five spin moves and once I did a somersault. I thought I was being all nimble and quick, but no. I watch it and it looks like a manatee doing ballet at SeaWorld." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchens {{opposed the}} Kosovo and 2003 Iraq War, {{on the grounds}} that neither was in the {{interests}} of either Britain or the United States, and opposes the British military presence in Afghanistan, arguing that it has no achievable aim. He believes in upholding the principle of Westphalian sovereignty, which he described as that [...] "you didn’t interfere in foreign countries because you didn’t <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> were governed". He urges better relations between the West and Russia, viewing conflict as unnecessary, and, while condemning the old Soviet Union as an [...] "evil empire" [...] and Vladimir Putin as corrupt, he states his [...] "strong affection for post-communist Russia."

2500|$|Similar to Warhammer Fantasy Battle players, Lord of the Rings players {{commonly}} {{collect and}} paint one army (or more) {{of their choice}} and find opponents (with similarly collected armies) to play against. Armies can be built up from through the purchase of boxed sets (usually having 10 or 12 plastic miniatures in each) or [...] "blister packs" [...] (usually containing {{no more than four}} finely detailed metal or resin miniatures) to build up a reasonable-sized fighting force. Others simply collect the miniatures because they <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> look. One popular way of collecting was through Battle Games in Middle-earth — a De Agostini magazine that came with one or more free miniatures (some of which were initially exclusive to the publication) and contained detailed hobby guides.|$|E

'Rock and Roll All Nite' is a direct bastard child of Slade's 'Mama Weer All Crazee Now'".

5000|$|October 2007 saw The Innocents {{travel to}} Germany where they {{recorded}} {{a version of}} a song co-written by Tony Sheridan and Paul McCartney in 1960, [...] "Tell Me If You Can" [...] with Sheridan himself.

Sheridan claimed meeting The Innocents was 'fate'. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> group. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> play reminded me of {{what we used to}} do back then.

Hearing them sing and <b>liking</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> sounded, he had an unfinished song {{that he had an}} idea to do more with. He sat down with the group and they worked out the chorus and wording. According to group member Nick Marinelli, they actually contributed some of the wording and chorus, but weren't credited for that. He cites their youth and inexperience for not knowing what their crediting should have been. The song was recorded in the late fall of 1965. They took the record to Harry Balk at Impact Records. He signed them into a contract. The record was released in March 1966 and in no time went straight to no. 1 in the locals. Nationally it got to no. 12 in the pop charts and no. 7 in the R&B charts.|$|R

He suggested they both dye their hair blonde, wear gold and black outfits and just basically change their image. He also told them that {{he would be willing to}} become their manager which was a big deal since it gave the women's division one of the leading male managers in professional wrestling (at the time it was more usual for women to be valets for male wrestlers and rare for a leading male manager to be involved in the women's division).

They told me that before I left the convent, so that I might be a little prepared, but is that any reason why every man, old and young, should say foolish things to me, and pretend that they have fallen in love, when I know all the time that it is my fortune they are thinking of. And my stepmother speaks of marrying me as though I were a piece of merchandise, to be disposed of to the highest bidder. I do not like her friends. I do not <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> live. I have never liked Major Forrest. Last night your lodger and another man came to the Hall. They asked questions about Lord Ronald. They asked questions and they were told lies. I am sure of it. It got on my nerves. I thought I should shriek.

40|$|The United States current incarcerates more {{citizens}} {{than any}} other country in history, by disproportionately targeting men and boys of color through mechanisms such as the school to prison pipeline. In better understanding the processes that fuel the school to prison pipeline such as criminalizing practices and <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> boys of color resist them, we can begin to identify teaching practices and perspectives which work to disrupt those processes. Examining criminalization and acts of resistance in STEM education is particularly salient because of the high social and economic status STEM knowledge bears in dominant U.

Through a longitudinal study in a multi-site elementary after-school STEM program, I examined what criminalization and acts of resistance look <b>like,</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> interact, and how staff in the program work to disrupt those cycles. I found that criminalization and acts of resistance are normal and ordinary occurrences, frequently interacting in response to each other in escalating patterns.
