5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle <b>line</b> <b>services</b> run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, works to complete the electrification of the LNER lines were slowed or halted. The line from Finchley Central to Edgware closed for reconstruction on 11 September 1939. Northern <b>line</b> <b>services</b> were extended from East Finchley to High Barnet on 14 April 1940, and started serving the deep level platforms at Highgate on 19 January 1941, though not all of the new station buildings had been completed. The surface platforms at Highgate continued to be served by LNER steam trains.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, Circle <b>line</b> <b>services</b> began {{serving the}} station. Originally {{operating}} as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the loop, back to Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|The London Underground is {{a public}} rapid transit system in the United Kingdom that serves {{a large part of}} Greater London and the home {{counties}} of Essex, Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It has many former stations, while others were planned but not opened. Some stations were closed because of low passenger usage rendering them uneconomical; some became redundant after lines were re-routed or replacements were constructed; and others are no longer served by the Underground but remain open to National Rail main <b>line</b> <b>services.</b> Many stations were planned as parts of new lines or extensions to existing ones but were later abandoned.|$|E

50|$|Trains {{originally}} serviced {{this station}} as Yellow Line trains until Green <b>Line</b> <b>service</b> was formally introduced later that year.

5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface {{platforms}} opened in 1868 by the District Railway (DR) {{as part of}} the company's first section of the Inner Circle route and deep level platforms opened in 1999 {{as part of the}} Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford. A variety of underground and main <b>line</b> <b>services</b> have operated over the sub-surface tracks, but the original station was completely rebuilt in conjunction with the construction of the deep level platforms and Portcullis House, which sits above the station.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 by the Metropolitan Railway {{as part of}} the company's {{extension}} of the Inner Circle route from Paddington to South Kensington and to Westminster; and deep-level platforms opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. A variety of underground and main <b>line</b> <b>services</b> have operated over the sub-surface tracks. The deep-level platforms have remained largely unaltered with no lift access. A disused sub-surface platform features periodic art installations as part of Transport for London's Art on the Underground scheme.|$|E
5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, {{an arm of}} National Express, in 2001. The line through Filton closed for two weeks in June 2004 to enable {{the construction of a}} new platform and third running line on the west side of the station, separating trains towards Bristol Parkway from trains towards Wales before the station, and so allowing through-trains to pass stopping trains. The project cost £16,000,000, and caused the complete suspension of Severn Beach <b>Line</b> <b>services</b> to allow longer-distance services to use it as a diversion.|$|E
