50|$|In {{the early}} days of engine building, the poppet valve was a major problem. Metallurgy was lacking, and the rapid opening and closing of valves against {{cylinder}} heads led to rapid wear. They would need to be re-ground in a process known as a 'valve job'. Adding tetraethyllead to the petrol reduced this problem somewhat, the <b>lead</b> <b>coating</b> the valve seats would, in effect, lubricate the metal. In more modern vehicles and properly machined older engines, valve seats may be made of improved alloys such as stellite and the valves themselves of stainless steel. These improvements have generally eradicated this problem, and helped make unleaded fuel the norm.|$|E
5000|$|The active {{participation}} and appropriation, which took {{a wide variety}} of forms, eventually led to the disappearance of the visible object over the years. It was covered with some 70,000 names, entries and graffiti (x loves y or “Foreigners Out!”) and their strikeouts. Swastikas and even traces of gunshots were found in the <b>lead</b> <b>coating.</b> The artist commented: “People, not monuments, are the places of memory.” Elsewhere, Jochen Gerz noted: “As a reflection of society, this monument is doubly challenging, in that it not only reminds society of things past, but also - and this is the most unsettling - of its own reaction to this past.” ...|$|E
50|$|Rifled {{guns were}} also {{developed}} elsewhere - by Major Giovanni Cavalli and Baron Martin von Wahrendorff in Sweden, Krupp in Germany and the Wiard {{gun in the}} United States. However, rifled barrels required some means of engaging the shell with the rifling. <b>Lead</b> <b>coated</b> shells were used with the Armstrong gun, but were not satisfactory so studded projectiles were adopted. However, these did not seal the gap between shell and barrel. Wads at the shell base were also tried without success.|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl {{lead was}} first added to {{gasoline}} in the 1920s as an “anti-knock” agent, {{which is a}} cheap method of boosting the octane rating. It {{is not possible to}} use catalytic converters with leaded fuel as the <b>lead</b> <b>coats</b> the platinum and renders the catalyst ineffective. Lead free gasoline was therefore introduced into Japan in the late sixties, and into the US in the mid seventies in order to enable the use of catalytic converters and thus mitigate photochemical pollution.|$|R

5000|$|The gun {{incorporated}} some advanced {{features for}} its day. It {{was one of}} the first breech-loaders: shell and gunpowder propellant were loaded through the gunner's end of the barrel, rather than through the muzzle as in previous guns, allowing a higher rate of fire. The shells were coated with lead, which engaged spiral grooves cut inside the barrel ("rifling") and caused the shell to spin rapidly in flight and hence imparted far greater accuracy and range than previous guns. The <b>lead</b> <b>coating</b> effectively sealed the gap between shell and barrel and eliminated the wastage of propellant gases, previously known as [...] "windage", and hence only half the amount of gunpowder propellant as previous was required.|$|E
5000|$|The gun {{was also}} a breech-loader. Although {{attempts}} at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering {{problem was that the}} mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same time}} slightly swaged down its <b>lead</b> <b>coating,</b> reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the piece}} was rifled, which allowed for a much more {{accurate}} and powerful action. Although rifling had been tried on small arms since the 15th century, the necessary machinery to accurately rifle artillery was only available by the mid-19th century. Martin von Wahrendorff, and Joseph Whitworth independently produced rifled cannon in the 1840s, but it was Armstrong's gun that was first to see widespread use during the Crimean War. The cast iron shell of the Armstrong gun was similar in shape to a Minié ball and had a thin <b>lead</b> <b>coating</b> which made it fractionally larger than the gun's bore and which engaged with the gun's rifling grooves to impart spin to the shell.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in the electrowinning of copper has lead to several modifications including anodic reactions proposed to reduce the high energy requirement. The addition of sulphurous acid to a copper sulphate electrolyte has been studied to avoid oxygen evolution at the anode which requires a potential in excess of 2 [*]V. In particular, the effect of different anode materials, concentration of sulphurous acid, current density, copper and sulphuric acid concentrations in the electrolyte have been investigated. Measurements of anode potential, cell voltage, current efficiency and energy consumption during the electrowinning of copper have been made using a diaphragm cell.

50|$|Batteries are {{typically}} made of six galvanic cells {{in a series}} circuit. Each cell provides 2.1 volts {{for a total of}} 12.6 volts at full charge. Each cell of a lead storage battery consists of alternate plates of lead (cathode) and <b>lead</b> <b>coated</b> with <b>lead</b> dioxide (anode) immersed in an electrolyte of sulfuric acid solution. The actual standard cell potential is obtained from the standard reduction potentials. This causes a chemical reaction that releases electrons, allowing them to flow through conductors to produce electricity. As the battery discharges, the acid of the electrolyte reacts with the materials of the plates, changing their surface to lead sulfate. When the battery is recharged, the chemical reaction is reversed: the lead sulfate reforms into lead dioxide. With the plates restored to their original condition, the process may be repeated.|$|R
