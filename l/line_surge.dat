40|$|Lightning {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} source of overvoltages in overhead transmission lines. The lightning overvoltages could lead to failure of the devices connected to the transmission line. A fundamental constraint on the reliability of an electrical power transmission system is the effectiveness of its protective system. The role of the protective system is to safeguard system components from the effects of electrical overstress. Surge arresters are an important means of lightning protection in distribution systems. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze influence of such overvoltages in order to applying the <b>line</b> <b>surge</b> arrester for improving the reliability of transmission line system.

This paper develops the preceding work in three different areas. At first, considers the induced voltages on the tower due to MSL strikes on all three phase conductors on the left-circuit of the tower during shielding failure.

Transformer magnetising losses, the non-linear resistance of the neutral surge arrestor and the transformer magnetising reactance of the closed-circuit phases were all included. The investigation revealed that the failure of the arrestor was due to the combined volt drops across the open circuited phase of the transformer magnetising reactance and the neutral surge arrestor. A resonance condition lowered the magnetising reactance of the open circuited phase of the transformer and forced the transformer into saturation.

Several case studies are analyzed by installing Surge arresters on different intervals, in relation to the region's tower footing resistance and the ground flash density. The obtained results are compared with real records of outage rate showing the effectiveness of the surge arresters in the reduction of the recorded failure rate. The presented methodology can be proved valuable to the studies of electric power systems designers intending in a more effective lightning protection, reducing the operational costs and providing continuity of service.

The presented system allows ensuring the failure-free protection of electromotor, considerably reducing costs of its unplanned repair, and reduced economical loss from idle time of the electric motor.

The electrical subsystem comprises a FLUKE company recording multi-meter a signal from which passes through the block of intervals and coding and comes to PC. The mechanical subsystem uses technical tools of phase-chronometric method. This method developed {{at the department of}} Metrology and Interchangeability allows an increasing efficiency of developed informative-measuring system. Mathematical modeling is used to link information from subsystems (electrical and mechanical) to electromotor construction.

40|$|Surge {{arrester}} {{is widely}} used as a protective device to reduce possibility of flashover during transient overvoltage. It {{is important to understand}} the characteristics of surge arrester as over-specification of its rating will result in a reduction of the protective characteristics. Researches on reliability and stability of surge arrester normally involve detailed experimental works, which are usually not feasible due to high cost in conducting test using actual prototype. The usage of computer tools in carrying out virtual testing is important to verify the performance of the arresters in early stages before proceeding with actual prototype built-up. In this work, transmission <b>line</b> <b>surge</b> arresters with different dimensions and ratings were modeled to investigate their discharge energy during lightning discharge using the finite element analysis (FEA) method. The main advantage of FEA models in this work is real dimensions of the actual surge arrester can be modeled, which may increase the accuracy of the results obtained. To validate the accuracy of the method, the arrester models were also simulated by the use of PSCAD/EMTDC and EMTP-RV software and compared with the specifications provided by the manufacturer. In spite of distinctive representations of the arrester models in COMSOL Multiphysics, EMTP-RV and PSCAD/EMTDC, the comparison made between the results indicates a satisfactory agreement. Parametric analyses were also conducted using finite element method to study the effects of varying the design geometry of the arresters, which cannot be evaluated using PSCAD and EMTP-RV software. The surge arrester models that have been developed were then used in designing protection scheme for a 275 / 132 kV quadruple circuit transmission line in Malaysia. The best arrester configuration was selected by considering the effects of tower footing resistance, lightning current and power frequency angle on the line lightning performance. Improvement on the lightning performance could be achieved by installing surge arresters on all phases of a 132 kV circuit, where the double circuit outages were successfully eliminated. The results are useful for the utility company in determining the most effective installation position with the minimum number of installed surge arresters...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} a rigorous procedure for overhead line uprating with guidance for calculating {{the increase in}} voltage rating that may be achieved for given configurations. It initially investigates different technical issues and conventional methods of voltage uprating of overhead transmission lines. Various issues such as clearance, insulation, pollution, transient overvoltages, surge arresters and its combinations were studied for optimised insulation coordination of voltage uprated transmission systems with reference to international standard IEC 60071 and British standard BSEN 50341. It then considers a case of existing 275 kV line in 'L 3 ' structures to analyse these issues and propose appropriate process for its possible uprating to 400 kV system. In this investigation, overhead line uprating techniques used by different utilities around the world, as published in the literature were analysed. It was found that, the decision to uprate overhead lines is influenced by technical, institutional and financial issues. In this thesis, issues such as conductor air clearance, insulation electrical strength and overvoltages are investigated and taken into account to develop an appropriate methodology. For uprating overhead lines, an exemplar case study of uprating an L 3, 275 kV line to 400 kV was used, introducing minimum structural changes to the tower. The selection of the L 3 tower is {{made on the basis}} that it is not readily upratable to 400 kV due to restricted air clearances it offers. This work has demonstrated that the voltage uprating of overhead transmission lines is possible with minimal modification to the existing line. In this case, the phase-to-earth clearance was found to be the critical factor which determines the level to which the voltage level of the line can be increased. Computations of overvoltages due to switching and lightning phenomena were conducted to estimate overvoltage levels and optimise the protection scheme required to minimise the required minimum electrical clearances. Employing gapless metal-oxide <b>line</b> <b>surge</b> arresters were proposed to be the most effective solution to control the overvoltages, thereby reducing the minimum phase-to-earth clearance requirements. This solution is preferred to modifying the tower structure in order to achieve the required clearance for 400 kV system. The study of lightning and switching surge performances along the line under different arrester configurations was carried out so that the appropriate surge arrester configuration could be selected to maintain overvoltage levels within the targeted withstand level for the line. The extensive transient simulations performed in this work identified that, for a double circuit overhead transmission line as used on the UK system, the top-most phase conductors are prone to shielding failure lightning strikes whilst the bottom-most phase conductors are likely to be subjected to backflashover surges for the case of high tower footing resistance. The assessment of electric and magnetic field profiles of a 275 kV line uprated to 400 kV was computed. It showed that, the field intensities of voltage uprated lines are within the limits adopted by national and international standards and requires no additional wayleave for uprating.
