40|$|Magnesium-based {{thermoelectric}} materials (Mg 2 X, X[*]=[*]Si, Ge, Sn) {{have received}} considerable attention {{due to their}} availability, low toxicity, and reasonably good thermoelectric performance. The synthesis of these materials with high purity is challenging, however, due to the reactive nature and high vapour pressure of magnesium. In the current study, high purity single phase n-type Mg 2 Ge has been fabricated through a one-step reaction of MgH 2 and elemental Ge, using spark plasma sintering (SPS) to reduce the formation of magnesium oxides due to the liberation of hydrogen. We have found that Bi has a very <b>limited</b> solubility <b>in</b> <b>Mg</b> 2 Ge and results in the precipitation of Mg 2 Bi 3. Bismuth doping increases the electrical conductivity of Mg 2 Ge up to its solubility limit, beyond which the variation is minimal. The main improvement in the thermoelectric performance is originated from the significant phonon scattering achieved by the Mg 2 Bi 3 precipitates located mainly at grain boundaries.

40|$|Clonorchiasis is {{prevalent}} in the Far East, and a major health problem in endemic areas. Infected persons may experience, if not treated, serious complications such as bile stone formation, pyogenic cholangitis, and even cholangiocarcinoma. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent serious complications and, therefore, the simple and reliable diagnostic method is necessary to control clonorchiasis in endemic areas, where resources for the diagnosis are limited. The loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay has been applied {{for the detection of}} Clonorchis sinensis DNA. Six primers targeting eight locations on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene of C. sinensis were designed for species-specific amplification using the LAMP assay. The LAMP assay was sensitive enough to detect as little as 100 fg of C. sinensis genomic DNA and the detection <b>limit</b> <b>in</b> 100 <b>mg</b> of stool was as low as one egg. The assay was highly specific because no cross-reactivity was observed with the DNA of other helminths, protozoa or Escherichia coli. Then, LAMP assay was applied to human fecal samples collected from an endemic area of clonorchiasis in Korea. Using samples showing consistent results by both Kato-Katz method and real-time PCR as reference standards, the LAMP assay showed 97. 1 % (95 % CI, 90. 1 - 99. 2) of sensitivity and 100 % (95 % CI, 92. 9 - 100) of specificity. In stool samples with more than 100 eggs per gram of feces, the sensitivity achieved 100 %.

40|$|Manganese (Mn) and {{zirconium}} (Zr) are {{two common}} alloying additions <b>in</b> magnesium (<b>Mg)</b> alloys. Both of these elements, while having low solubilities <b>in</b> <b>Mg,</b> each serve a specific purpose when added to Mg. Mn is often added {{to improve the}} extrudability and formability of <b>Mg</b> alloys and <b>in</b> aluminium (Al) containing Mg alloys to produce the Al 8 (Mn,Fe) 5 phase which is able to remove iron (Fe) impurities to dramatically improve the corrosion resistance. Zr is incorporated <b>in</b> <b>Mg</b> mainly due to its unique ability {{to act as a}} grain refiner to greatly reduce the grain size and hence improve the mechanical properties of Mg. The effect of Mn alone on the corrosion of Mg and subsequent Fe impurity levels {{in the absence of any}} Al alloying addition is not well documented. Furthermore, the independent role that Zr has on the corrosion of Mg and Mg alloys has also not been reported thoroughly. <b>In</b> this study, <b>Mg</b> alloys containing various levels of Mn, Zr and Fe alloying additions in binary, ternary and quaternary combinations were produced and examined via SEM, EDX and EBSD techniques. The corrosion rates and morphologies of Mg alloy samples were examined via electrochemical polarisation and immersion testing. It was discovered that Zr additions, while beneficial in being able to remove Fe impurities, has a negative impact on the corrosion rates of Mg. Zr is able to increase both the anodic and cathodic reaction kinetics of Mg, thereby increasing the corrosion rate. Zr dissolved <b>in</b> the <b>Mg</b> solid solution was shown to act as an ‘anodic activator’, increasing the anodic reaction kinetics and the rate of Mg dissolution. Zr not dissolved in solid solution was present as Zr particles embedded <b>in</b> the <b>Mg</b> matrix. These Zr particles were efficient local cathodes, enhancing the cathodic reaction. The difference in electrochemical potential between these, essentially pure Zr, particles and the surrounding Mg matrix lead to the formation of micro-galvanic couples at open circuit, which increased corrosion rate. Mn was observed to slightly decrease the cathodic reaction kinetics of Mg when included as an alloying addition. This is rationalised on the basis that Mn will interact with Fe, and not on the basis that Mn can support reduction reactions at lower rates than Mg. This notion also appreciates that there is no Mg metal that has 0 % Fe. However, beyond Mn additions of ~ 2 wt. %, Mn particles which formed <b>in</b> the <b>Mg</b> matrix increased the corrosion rate through the formation of micro-galvanic couples with the Mg matrix. While Mn additions in this study were ineffective at removing Fe from the alloy system, Mn was found to be capable of rendering Fe impurities less detrimental to Mg. Mn additions were found to increase the tolerance <b>limit</b> of Fe <b>in</b> <b>Mg.</b> As such, higher levels of Fe were necessary to increase the cathodic reaction kinetics required for increased corrosion rates. It was observed that the Mn additions form an intermetallic phase with the Fe impurities. At low Fe levels these phases appeared to be Mn particles with Fe dissolved in solid solution within these particles. At higher Fe levels, there were large Fe particles encapsulated by a layer of Mn. It is proposed that this interaction between Mn and Fe decreases the electrochemical potential difference between the Fe impurities and the <b>Mg</b> matrix <b>in</b> a similar manner to the Al 8 (Mn,Fe) 5 phase observed <b>in</b> Al-containing <b>Mg</b> alloys, thereby, decreasing the driving force to increase the cathodic reaction kinetics through micro-galvanic coupling. This work has elucidated the interactions and effects of Mn and Zr additions on Mg and has shown that Zr is inherently detrimental to the corrosion resistance of Mg and that Mn can interact with Fe <b>in</b> <b>Mg</b> to reduce the impact that Fe impurities have on <b>Mg</b> alloys <b>in</b> the absence of Al...|$|R

Previous results regarding Tregs <b>in</b> <b>MG</b> patients have been conflicting. The discrepancy was partly ascribed to selecting different Treg-associated molecules in defining Tregs. Therefore, we considered it necessary to find a reliable index for assessing the immunologic state <b>in</b> <b>MG</b> patients and explore the effect of IS on them. Methods: We adopted flow cytometric techniques to measure the numbers and frequencies of Tregs in peripheral blood taken from 57 patients and 91 age-matched healthy donors, and we also analyzed FOXP 3 mean fluorescence intensity on Tregs. Results: The number and frequency of Tregs in peripheral blood of MG patients significantly decreased, together with down-regulation of FOXP 3 expression. There was dynamic change of Treg cell level and the inverse relationship with clinical symptom, suggesting that the immunologic disorder <b>in</b> <b>MG</b> patients was related to peripheral Tregs population. Meanwhile, CD 4 ⁺CD 25 ⁺FOXP 3 ⁺Helios⁺T cells might be activated Tregs, rather than nTregs.
