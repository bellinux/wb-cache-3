5|$|Soluble {{fluorides}} are moderately toxic: 5–10g sodium fluoride, or 32–64mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, {{represents a}} <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> for adults. One-fifth of the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption {{may lead to}} skeletal fluorosis, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary excretion. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} for Botrytis populations exposed to UV radiation to develop tolerance to the Trichodermametabolite 6 -pentyl-alpha-pyrone (6 -PAP) and the 6 -PAP analog massoialactone was determined using 14 different Botrytis isolates. There was significant isolate variation in germination of Botrytis conidia after UV exposure. Plating conidia onto sublethal doses of 6 -PAP yielded no 6 -PAP tolerant mutants. After UV irradiation, two Botrytis mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP, while 59 mutants grew on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone. 6 -PAP mutants were cross resistant to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of massoialactone, whereas massoialactone mutants {{were not able}} to grow on normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP. After one generation of growth on kiwifruit slices, 6 -PAP mutants lost tolerance to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of 6 -PAP. However after three generations of growth on kiwifruit slices, 6 -PAP plus massoialactone mutants retained tolerance to normally <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> to massoialactone...|$|R

5|$|Elemental {{scandium}} {{is considered}} non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds {{has not been}} done. The median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) levels for scandium(III) chloride for rats have been determined as 4mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 755mg/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity.|$|E
5|$|However, chronic cobalt {{ingestion}} {{has caused}} {{serious health problems}} at doses {{far less than the}} <b>lethal</b> <b>dose.</b> In 1966, the addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize beer foam in Canada led to a peculiar form of toxin-induced cardiomyopathy, which {{came to be known as}} beer drinker's cardiomyopathy.|$|E

The LD50, or <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> {{which is expected to}} prove fatal in 50% of the population, has been found to be: 59mg/kg (mouse; administered intravenously); 95mg/kg (mouse; administered intraperitoneally); 163mg/kg (rat; administered intraperitoneally); 79mg/kg (dog; administered intravenously).|$|E
5|$|The median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The {{committed effective dose}} equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because {{radiation exposure}} that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E

5|$|Diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) {{is shown}} {{as an example}} of an {{irreversible}} protease inhibitor in the figure above right. The enzyme hydrolyses the phosphorus–fluorine bond, but the phosphate residue remains bound to the serine in the active site, deactivating it. Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, and consequently is a potent neurotoxin, with a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of less than 100mg.|$|E
5|$|Niobium-containing {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, {{but some are}} toxic and should be treated with care. The short- and long-term exposure to niobates and niobium chloride, two chemicals that are water-soluble, have been tested in rats. Rats treated with a single injection of niobium pentachloride or niobates show a median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) between 10 and 100mg/kg. For oral administration the toxicity is lower; a study with rats yielded a LD50 after seven days of 940mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|The {{high rate}} of test animal {{survival}} was {{due in part to}} the nature of single-pulse radiation. As with the two Los Alamos criticality accidents involving the earlier demon core, victims who were close enough to receive a <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> died, while those farther away recovered and survived. Also, all the mice were placed outside the expected lethal zone in order to study possible mutations in future generations.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sublethal, midlethal, and <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> of total-body X {{irradiation}} on the fecal microbial {{population of the}} rat was studied. No changes were observed in animals receiving sublethal doses of X ray. Midlethal and <b>lethal</b> <b>doses</b> produced {{an increase in the}} numbers of fecal coliforms, staphylococci, streptococci, and fungi; these changes were transient in rats that survived, but were more marked and persisted during life in those that died. The possible role of these alterations in intestinal microflora in post-irradiation infection and in death is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Acute {{toxicity}} has {{not been}} seen in humans, and the toxicity depends strongly on the chemical state. Studies on rats show a median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) as low as 180mg/kg for some Mo compounds. Although human toxicity data is unavailable, animal studies have shown that chronic ingestion of more than 10mg/day of molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight, and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys, and liver. Sodium tungstate is a competitive inhibitor of molybdenum. Dietary tungsten reduces the concentration of molybdenum in tissues.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> for {{an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if experiments on rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental pollutant. The median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E

5|$|In poor conditions, {{the weight}} of the adrenal gland may {{increase}} up to 200%, and rice rats are unable to conserve water well when dehydrated, and in water contaminated with oil, they swim less and their mortality increases. The median amount of radiation needed to kill a marsh rice rat is 5.25Gy and the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> of potassium cyanide is 7.20mg/kg; both values are relatively low for cricetid rodents. In one study, wild rice rats in radioactively contaminated areas did not show signs of disease. Exposure to more daylight and higher food availability cause increased development of the gonads in both adult and juvenile rice rats. When the pineal gland is removed or melatonin is administered in male rice rats, the testes are reduced and tend to regress into the body.|$|E
5|$|In vertebrates, alpha-latrotoxin {{produces}} {{its effect}} through destabilisation of cell membranes and degranulation of nerve terminals, resulting in excessive release of neurotransmitters, namely acetylcholine, norepinephrine and GABA. Excess neurotransmitter activity leads to clinical manifestations of envenomation, although the precise mechanisms {{are not well}} understood. Acetylcholine release accounts for neuromuscular manifestations, and norepinephrine release accounts for the cardiovascular manifestations. Female redbacks have an average of around 0.08–0.10mg of venom, and experiments indicate that the median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for mice at room temperature is 10–20% of this quantity (0.27–0.91mg/kg based on {{the mass of the}} mice used), but that it is considerably more deadly for mice kept at lower or higher temperatures. Pure alpha-latrotoxin has an LD50 in mice of 20–40µg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, when {{entering}} the body through air, food or blood (e.g. a wound), mostly settles in the lungs, liver and bones with only about 10% going to other organs, and remains there for decades. The long residence time of plutonium {{in the body}} is partly explained by its poor solubility in water. Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α-radiation, which damages the surrounding cells. The median <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> (LD50) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0.32 milligram per kg of body mass, and thus the <b>lethal</b> <b>dose</b> for humans is approximately 22mg for a person weighing 70kg; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater. Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium, and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5µg or 0.3 µCi. Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope. After trials on animals, this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0.65µg or 0.04 µCi. Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation, after which 5–25% of inhaled substances is retained in the body. Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds, plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system, or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones. Contamination via food is the least likely way. In this case, only about 0.05% of soluble 0.01% insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood, {{and the rest is}} excreted. Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100% of it.|$|E
