25|$|A severe drought {{beginning}} in 1932 in western Oklahoma combined with <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> and mechanization in eastern Oklahoma drove farmers {{out of the}} state and left others in economic distress. Legislatures of the 1930s battled with governors William H. Murray and Ernest W. Marland, targeting Murray's efforts to generate relief for farmers and Marland's proposals to create a state public works program, reform the tax code and create unemployment insurance. Lawmakers did enact an old age pension system funded by a dedicated sales tax. The rejection of providing state matching funds for New Deal projects resulted in fewer projects. A conservative reaction developed in Oklahoma in the late 1930s and rejected further New Deal programs.|$|E
25|$|As remarked above, {{the great}} grey shrike has {{apparently}} become extinct as a breeding bird in Switzerland and the Czech Republic. Overall, its stocks seem to be declining in the European part of its range since the 1970s. In North America, the populations {{seem to have been}} stable by contrast, except in the east. The increase and decline seem to be reactions to changing land use, with an increase as the number of agricultural workers declined after World War II and land fell fallow, declining again when <b>land</b> <b>consolidation</b> (see e.g. Flurbereinigung) had seriously depleted the number of hedgerows and similar elevated growth formerly common amidst the agricultural landscape. For such a predatory bird, the indiscriminate use of pesticides (which will accumulate in adult carnivores and inhibit breeding success) around the 1960s probably had a detrimental influence on stocks too.|$|E

The local population are not confident about the land-managing subjects (60 % respondents {{do not believe that the}} subjects managing agricultural land e. g. protect arable land against erosion). Seventy % of respondents agree with restoration of balks, with reducing the acreages of agriculturally managed land tracts. More than 90 % respondents perceive the landscape as a space for recreation, sports, and rest. Only 20 % of inhabitants are employed in agriculture (over 60 % respondents work in services or other specializations).
