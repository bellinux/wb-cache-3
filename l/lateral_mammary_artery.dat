40|$|AbstractInternal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts are {{currently}} considered the conduits {{of choice for}} myocardial revascularization. Comparisons of long-term morphologic changes in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts and saphenous vein grafts and correlation with premorlem angiography have not been reported. Eighteen internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> and 15 saphenous vein grafts {{that had been in}} place for 12 to 118 months (mean 56) in 18 patients were removed either surgically or at necropsy and examined hislologkally. Premortem angiograms were performed within 1 month of histologic study in 15 of these patients. Fibrointimai proliferation was more frequent in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> than in saphenous vein grafts 8 ([44 %] of 18 versus 4 [27 %] of 15; p = NS). In contrast, atherosclerosis was common in saphenous vein grafts but was extremely rare in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (10 of 15 versus 1 of 18; p = 0. 01). A good correlation was noted between the degree of narrowing estimated by angiographic and histologic measurements in both internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts (d = 0. 99) and saphenous vein grafts (d = 0. 71). Acceierated atherosclerosis did not occur in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, but was common in saphenous vein grafts. Fibrointimal proliferation was commonly associated with graft narrowing in internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts and may be an important factor in late graft closure.

40|$|Abstract Background Standard {{coronary}} artery bypass graft surgery uses a single internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> and supplemental vein or radial artery grafts. Several observational studies have suggested a survival benefit with two internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts compared to a single internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> graft, but this has not been tested in a randomised trial. The Arterial Revascularisation Trial is a Medical Research Council and British Heart Foundation funded, multi-centre international trial comparing single internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting versus bilateral internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. Methods/Design Twenty centres in the UK, Australia, Poland and Brazil are planning to randomise 3000 {{coronary artery}} bypass graft surgery patients to single or bilateral internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting. Supplemental grafts may be either saphenous vein or radial artery. Coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed as an on-pump or off-pump procedure. The primary outcome is survival at 10 years and secondary end-points include clinical events, quality of life and cost effectiveness. The effect of age, left ventricular function, diabetes, number of grafts, vein grafts and off-pump surgery are pre-specified subgroups. Discussion The Arterial Revascularisation Trial {{is one of the first}} randomised trials to evaluate the effects on survival and other clinical outcomes of single internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting versus bilateral internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafting, and will help to establish the best approach for patients requiring {{coronary artery bypass}} graft surgery. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background. Internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts have {{a greater}} {{long-term}} patency rate than do saphenous vein grafts. This has in part been attributed to the difference in endothelial function of arterial and venous vessels. The use of the gastroepiploic artery in coronary artery bypass grafting has become popular recently because of its similarity to internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery.</b> In this study, we compared the endothelial responses of gastroepiploic and left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries</b> to vasoactive substances. Methods and Results. Gastroepiploic and left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries</b> were obtained during surgery from patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery. Vascular rings of both graft types were studied in organ bath experiments. Relaxation responses to metacholine and sodium nitrite were similar in rings of both arteries. In contrast, bradykinin induced potent relaxations in rings of the gastroepiploic artery but not in rings of the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery.</b> Furthermore, there was a inverse correlation of maximal metacholine-induced relaxations with increasing age. Conclusions. The resemblance of relaxations induced by metacholine and sodium nitrite in both gastroepiploic and left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries</b> suggests a similar activation and behavior of the L-arginine pathway in both arteries. The difference in bradykinin-induced relaxations may reflect a prostaglandin metabolism in the gastroepiploic artery different from that in the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery.</b> Furthermore, maximal metacholine-induced relaxation in rings of the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> shows an age dependency that was not observed in rings of the gastroepiploic artery...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> is {{a dynamic}} conduit used for myocardial revascularization in which potential exists for spasm {{as well as for}} vasodilation. This study investigated vasodilator drug effects on the <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> using nitroprusside and nitroglycerin in vitro to measure the inhibition of contraction of human internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> and in vivo to examine blood flow through a canine <b>mammary</b> <b>artery.</b> In the in vitro study, ring segments of human internal <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries</b> were suspended on strain gauges in muscle baths containing 37 °C Krebs solution for measurement of isometric tension in vitro. Arterial contraction was stimulated with 70 mMpotassium and 10 μM norepinephrine, and inhibition of contraction by vasodilators was measured. Nitroprusside was more potent and effective than was nitroglycerin in inhibiting potassium and norepinephrine contraction. The in vivo study utilized a canine (n = 8) right heart bypass preparation that allowed precise control of cardiac output, blood pressure and heart rate, which were maintained constant. The internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> graft and the saphenous vein graft perfused the same coronary artery bed. Electromagnetic flow probes measured graft flow (with the other graft occluded) before and after 15 min of drug infusion (1 μg/kg per min). Nitroglycerin significantly increased <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> flow 36 ± 13 %, whereas nitroprusside significantly decreased it 12 ± 2 %. Saphenous vein grafts responded differently; graft blood flow decreased with nitroglycerin and increased with nitroprusside. Thus, although nitroprusside was more effective than nitroglycerin in inhibiting <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> contraction in vitro, it decreased internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> graft flow measured in vivo. Nitroglycerin had the opposite effect, increasing mammary graft flow. In addition, saphenous vein grafts responded differently from the <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> to vasodilator administration. These divergent findings in the in vivo canine and in vitro human studies may have resulted from the effects of the vasodilators on the regional vasculature. However, the in vivo response in canine vessels may not necessarily predict the in vivo response of human vessels to vasodilators...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) is a {{recently}} introduced method {{for the treatment}} of poststernotomy mediastinitis. The aim was {{to examine the effects of}} VAC negative pressure on peristernal soft tissue, blood flow after internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting. Methods: Microvascular blood flow was measured using laser Doppler velocimetry in a porcine sternotomy wound model. The effect of VAC negative pressure on blood flow to the wound edge was investigated on the right side, where the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> was intact, and on the left side, where the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> had been removed. Results: Before removal of the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery,</b> the blood flow was similar in the right and left peristernal wound edges, 2. 5 cm from the edge (27 +/- 4 perfusion units (PU) on the right side and 32 +/- 3 PU on the left side, in muscle tissue). When the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> was surgically removed, the blood flow on the left side decreased (19 3 PU, in muscle tissue), while the skin blood flow was not affected. VAC negative pressure induced an immediate increase in wound edge blood flow both on the right side (43 +/- 9 PU, in muscle tissue at - 75 mmHg), where the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> was intact, and on the left side, where the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> had been removed (49 11 PU, in muscle tissue at - 75 mmHg). The increase in blood flow was similar on both sides at - 75 mmHg and at - 125 mmHg. Conclusions: The peristernal wound edge microvascular blood flow is decreased when the left internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> is removed. VAC therapy stimulates blood flow in the peristernal thoracic wall after internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> harvesting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{internal}} <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> {{has greater}} long-term patency than the saphenous vein when used for coronary bypass grafting. Therefore, bilateral {{use of the}} internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> for grafting with the right internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> used as a “free” graft may result in improved graft survival. The study objectives were to compare the endothelial-dependent and -independent vasodilatory response in free and pedicled internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts in patients who had previously undergone coronary surgery. Free (group 1, n = 8) and pedicled (group 2, n = 7) internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts were studied by comparing the response to selective infusion of the endothelial-dependent vasodilator substance P (1. 4 up to 22. 4 pmol/min in doubling dose increments) followed by isosorbide dinitrate (2 mg over 2 minutes), in patients undergoing coronary angiography, 1 month to 6 years after coronary surgery. Maximal dilatory response to substance P was 8. 7 % ± 1. 8 % in pedicled grafts compared with 8. 8 % ± 2. 3 % in free grafts (p = not significant), with the dose response for both groups being similar. Infusion of isosorbide dinitrate produced only minimal further dilatation in both groups. No {{significant difference was found}} in endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilatory response between free and pedicled internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> grafts, suggesting that the use of the free right internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> and other arterial grafts may enhance graft survival.

Platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH), the enzyme that inactivates PAF bioactivity, possesses both acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities. In the present study, we measured acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities in human atherogenic aorta and nonatherogenic <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Immunohistochemistry analysis showed PAF-AH expression in the intima and the media of the aorta and in the media of <b>mammary</b> <b>arteries.</b> Acetylhydrolase and transacetylase activities were (mean ± SE, n = 38) : acetylhydrolase of aorta, 2. 8 ± 0. 5 pmol/min/mg of tissue; transacetylase of aorta, 3. 3 ± 0. 7 pmol/min/mg of tissue; acetylhydrolase of <b>mammary</b> <b>artery,</b> 1. 4 ± 0. 3 pmol/min/mg of tissue (P < 0. 004 as compared with acetylhydrolase of aorta); transacetylase of <b>mammary</b> <b>artery,</b> 0. 8 ± 0. 2 pmol/min/mg of tissue (P < 0. 03 as compared with acetylhydrolase of <b>mammary</b> <b>artery).</b> Lyso-PAF accumulation {{and an increase in}} PAF bioactivity were observed in the aorta of some patients.

40|$|Background—The {{superior}} long-term patency {{of internal}} <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> coronary bypass grafts compared with venous grafts has been attributed {{in part to}} increased endothelium-derived nitric oxide (zNO) production.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the zNO-mediated vasomotor properties of the radial artery to those of the internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> and saphenous vein. Methods and Results—Matched segments of radial <b>artery,</b> internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery,</b> and saphenous vein (n 524 patients) were examined by use of organ-chamber methodology. Endothelium-dependent and-independent vasomotor responses were assessed by dose-response curves to acetylcholine, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), 8 -bromo-cyclic 39, 59 -guanosine monophosphate (8 -bromo-cGMP), and nitroglycerin. Maximum zNO-mediated radial artery relaxation in response to acetylcholine (86610 %) was significantly greater than internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> (5669 %) or saphenous vein (1165 %, both P, 0. 0001). Similarly, acetylcholine-stimulated cGMP accumulation in radial artery (9. 161. 7 pmol/mg protein) was also greater than internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> (6. 260. 3 pmol/mg protein) or saphenous vein (1. 460. 2 pmol/mg protein, both P, 0. 05).

Results. One animal died during the procedure as result of acute thrombosis of the porcine internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> graft. In the other 4 animals all grafts became occluded. In the histologic sections of the grafts we noted multiple calcifications and a host-graft immunologic reaction (severe chronic rejection). Conclusions. The present study demonstrates a very poor experience with the porcine internal <b>mammary</b> <b>artery</b> (No-React II) conduit. We do not recommend this prosthesis for clinical use in humans.
