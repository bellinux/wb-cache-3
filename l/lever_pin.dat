50|$|The {{cantilever}} snap-fit is {{the most}} commonly used snap-fit of the three. A cantilever design can be multiple use or permanent. A multiple use snap-fit usually has a <b>lever</b> or <b>pin</b> to be pushed, in order to undo the snap-fit. However, on a permanent snap-fit there is no <b>lever</b> or <b>pin.</b> Attempting to undo a permanent snap-fit can result in the piece breaking.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{original}} verge escapement, which required a fusee, was gradually replaced in better French watches with the cylinder escapement, and in British watches with the duplex escapement. Then in the 19th century both were superseded by the lever escapement {{which has been}} used almost exclusively ever since. A cheaper version of the <b>lever,</b> the <b>pin</b> <b>lever</b> escapement, patented in 1867 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in inexpensive watches until the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|The Walther Volkssturmgewehr VG 1 is a {{manually}} operated bolt-action rifle. It uses a simple rotating bolt, with locking {{provided by the}} two frontal lugs; the crude bolt handle engages {{a cut in the}} cast steel receiver to provide additional safety. The feed is from detachable 10-round box magazines, originally developed for the Gewehr 43 rifle. The manual safety is also very crude, and consist of a stamped steel <b>lever</b> <b>pinned</b> to the trigger guard just behind the trigger. When engaged, the safety lever blocks trigger movement. To disengage the safety the user must turn it sideways with a finger. The stock is crudely made from wood, and non-adjustable iron sights are provided for close-range shooting only. It was meant to be produced by Zbrojovka Brno in the current-day Czech Republic.|$|R

50|$|The CZ 75 {{is a short}} recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It {{uses the}} Browning linkless cam locking system {{similar to that used}} in the Browning Hi-Power pistol, where the barrel and slide are locked {{together}} on firing, using locking lugs milled into the barrel mating with recesses in the roof of the slide. An enclosed cam track integral with the barrel is actuated by the slide release <b>lever's</b> transverse <b>pin.</b> After the first few millimetres of the recoil stroke, the barrel is cammed downwards at the rear, enabling the slide to continue the recoil stroke and eject the spent cartridge.|$|R
5000|$|A Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet {{escapement}} is an inexpensive, less accurate {{version of}} the lever escapement, used in mechanical alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the 1970s, cheap watches now known as <b>pin</b> <b>lever</b> watches. It was patented by German watchmaker Georges Frederic Roskopf in 1867, suggested to Roskopf by Jules Grossmann.|$|R

50|$|The A-100 is a recoil-operated, locked breech {{design with}} {{improved}} Browning-style linkless locking. The lock up {{is similar to}} the Browning High Power or CZ-75 with locking lugs {{on the top of the}} barrel which mate with lugs in the slide (not with a single lug in the ejection port like a SIG P22X.) The pistol's safety features include a manual decocking <b>lever,</b> firing <b>pin</b> block, and hammer safety. The A-100 lacks a manual safety, but depends entirely on a deliberate pull of its trigger to fire it; in this way it {{is similar to the}} SIG P22X series of pistols. The double-action trigger pull is relatively long and heavy, thereby precluding the need for a safety as the probability of an inadvertent discharge is low.|$|R
50|$|Achieving such precise ratios with gears is possible, but awkward; similarly, gears degrade {{over time}} in {{accuracy}} and efficiency due to the deleterious effects of friction. Instead, the clock uses binary digital logic, implemented mechanically in a sequence of stacked binary adders (or as their inventor, Hillis, calls them, serial bit-adders). In effect, the conversion logic is a simple digital computer (more specifically, a digital differential analyser), implemented with mechanical wheels and levers instead of typical electronics. The computer has 32 bits of accuracy, with each bit represented by a mechanical <b>lever</b> or <b>pin</b> that can be {{in one of two}} positions. This binary logic can only keep track of elapsed time, like a stopwatch; to convert from elapsed to local solar time (that is, time of day), a cam subtracts from (or adds to) the cam slider, which the adders move.|$|R
5000|$|Roskopf was an idealist who {{dreamed of}} making a good quality, cheap watch for working men. To {{accomplish}} this he used an old idea and reworked it, that of having the hands driven directly by the mainspring. In 1860 he began to design such a watch, which could be sold for 20 francs, and would still be of excellent quality, simple and solid. The watch had a large barrel in the center. a [...] "Perron" [...] pin-pallet escapement, and a monometallic balance. After discussions with Moritz J. Grossman he adopted the simple detached <b>pin</b> <b>lever</b> escapement.|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionClosed {{reduction}} of secondary displacements of distal metaphyseal radius fractures {{is an easy}} procedure only when performed within the first ten to fifteen days post-trauma, prior to the occurrence of malunion. When a hard bony callus prevents proper reduction, an open osteotomy is generally advocated. HypothesisWe suggest {{the use of a}} less invasive technique which aims at correcting early malunion when closed reduction is made impossible: the percutaneous callus osteoclasis. Materials and methodsCallus osteoclasis consists in a series of multiple bone-drilling in a postage stamp pattern performed under image intensifier using a large diameter pin, at a distance from the growth plate. Once the bone has been weakened, reduction is obtained by using the pin as an intrafocal <b>lever.</b> The <b>pin</b> is then pushed through the opposite cortex to ensure postero-lateral stabilization. ResultsTwenty-one patients were managed using this technique and reported good results with no complications. DiscussionThis technique offers a low aggressive management of malunions and may be performed within two to six weeks after trauma. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Multicenter retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|The design {{requirements}} and initial design concept for the AXAF-I Science Instrument Module (SIM) were reviewed at Ball on September 29, 1993. The concept design SIM focus mechanism utilizes a planetary gearset, with redundant motors, {{to drive a}} large ring (called 'main housing bearing') via a spur gearset. This large drive ring actuates three tangent bar links (called 'push rods'), which in turn actuate three levers (called 'pin levers'). Each of the three <b>pin</b> <b>levers</b> rotates an 'eccentric pin,' which in turn moves {{the base of a}} bipod flexure in both the radial (normal to optical axis) and axial (focus along optical axis) directions. Three bipod flexures are employed, equally spaced at 120 degrees apart, the base of each being translated in the two directions as described above. A focus adjustment is made by rotating the drive ring, which drives the push rods and therefore the <b>pin</b> <b>levers,</b> which in turn rotate the eccentric pins, finally imparting the two motions to the base of each of the bipod flexures. The axial translation (focus adjustment) of the focused structure is the sum of the direct axial motion plus axial motion which comes from uniformly squeezing the three bipod bases radially inward. SAO documented the following concerns regarding the focus mechanism in memo WAP-FY 94 - 001, dated October 7, 1993 : (1) The focus adjustment depends, in large part, on the structural properties (stiffnesses and end fixities) of the bipod flexures, push rods, <b>pin</b> <b>levers</b> and eccentric <b>pins.</b> If these properties are not matched very well, then lateral translations as well as unwanted rotations of the focussed structure will accompany focus motion. In addition, the stackup of linkage tolerances and any nonuniform wear in the linkages will result in the same unwanted motions. Thermal gradients will also affect these motions. At the review Ball did not present supporting analyses to support their choice of this design concept. (2) The proposed 'primary' method of measuring focus is by counting motor steps. The 'backup' method is by a pot mounted on the drive ring. Neither method provides for a direct measurement of the quantity desired (focus position). This is of concern because of the long and indirect relationship between focus and the sensed quantity (drive ring rotation). There are three sinusoidal relationships and structural stiffness in the path, and the resulting calibration is likely to be highly nonlinear. These methods would require an accurate ground calibration. (3) Ground calibration (and verification) of focus vs. drive position must be done in 1 -g on the ground. This calibration will be complicated by both the structural characteristics of the bipods {{and the fact that the}} CG of the translating portion of the SIM is not on the optical axis (thereby causing unwated rotations and changing the focus position vs. motor step and pot readout relationships). The SIM translating weight could be offloaded, but the calibration then becomes sensitive to any errors in offloading (both magnitude and direction). There are concerns as to whether a calibration to the required accuracy can be accomplished on the ground. (4) The choice of a potentiometer as the focus position sensor is questionable in terms of reliability for a five year mission. The results of SAO's study of items 1, 2 and 3 described above are presented in this report...|$|R
50|$|The AE-1 has a Canon FD breech-lock {{lens mount}} and accepts any FD or New FD (FDn) lens. It is not {{compatible}} with Canon's later Canon EF lens mount, though adapters made by independent manufacturers can be found. Original FD lenses, introduced in 1971, did not rotate in the mounting process; instead, a locking ring {{at the base}} was turned to attach the lens. This was often criticized as being slower than the bayonet mounts of competing cameras. The counter argument, though, was that as the lens/body mating surfaces did not rotate, there was no wear that could affect the critical distance from lens to film plane. In 1979, Canon introduced the New FD series of lenses that rotate the whole outer lens barrel to lock. The inner lens barrel remained stationary, and thus the signal <b>levers</b> and <b>pins</b> still did not rotate. During the late 1970s, there were over 50 Canon FD lenses available for purchase. They ranged from a Fisheye FD 15 mm f/2.8 SSC to a FD 800 mm f/5.6 SSC, plus special purpose lenses such as a 7.5mm circular fisheye and a 35 mm tilt and shift lens.|$|R
50|$|A cheaper, less {{accurate}} {{version of}} the lever escapement is used in alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the late 1970s, cheap watches, called the Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet escapement after Georges Frederic Roskopf, who invented it in 1867. It functions similarly to the lever, except that the lever pallet jewels are replaced by vertical metal <b>pins.</b> In a <b>lever</b> escapement, the pallets have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which must be carefully adjusted to the correct angles. In the pin pallet escapement, these two faces are designed {{into the shape of}} the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating complicated adjustments. The pins are located symmetrically on the lever, making beat adjustment simpler. Watches that used these escapements were called <b>pin</b> <b>lever</b> watches, and have been superseded by cheap quartz watches.|$|R
50|$|The USP is a {{semi-automatic}} pistol with a {{mechanically locked}} breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system {{has a large}} rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug {{on the underside of}} the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop <b>lever’s</b> axis <b>pin</b> and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an {{automatic}} weapon that fires {{from the open}} bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing though burst size can be controlled by the shooter. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, {{both of which are}} absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger’s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the selector <b>lever’s</b> axis <b>pin.</b> The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter’s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.|$|R
