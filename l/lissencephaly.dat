5|$|Some brain {{disorders}} such as Tay–Sachs {{disease are}} congenital, and linked to genetic and chromosomal mutations. A rare group of congenital cephalic disorders known as <b>lissencephaly</b> is characterised by the lack of, or inadequacy of, cortical folding. Normal development of the brain can be affected during pregnancy by nutritional deficiencies, teratogens, infectious diseases, and {{by the use of}} recreational drugs and alcohol.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the best}} known and most common types of {{neuronal}} migration disorders is <b>lissencephaly,</b> a diffuse cortical malformation relating directly to agyria and pachygyria. Incomplete neuronal migration during the early fetal brain development is the precursor to <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Classical <b>lissencephaly,</b> {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical <b>lissencephaly</b> can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the circumferential bands of heterotopic neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from <b>lissencephaly</b> that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|The ‘other’ {{types are}} {{associated}} with corpus callosum agenesis or cerebellar hypoplasia while the cobblestone <b>lissencephalies</b> {{are associated with}} eye and muscle disorders.|$|R
40|$|Neuronal {{migration}} disorders of {{the cerebral}} cortex form a heterogeneous group of abnormalities, characterised by mental retardation, epilepsy and hypotonia. They are prevalent in 1 % {{of the population}} and in 20 - 40 % of the untreatable forms of epilepsy. Disorders {{at the start of the}} migration result in nodular heterotopias. Bilateral periventricular nodular heterotopias are X-linked disorders, in which cortical neurons are unable to leave their position at the ventricular surface due to the absence of filamin 1. The large group of <b>lissencephalies</b> can be divided into a number of syndromes, each of which is characterised by a gene mutation (LIS 1, DCX, RELN). These mutations result in agyria and pachygyria, which are characteristic for this group. A number of these abnormalities, especially the smaller nodular heterotopias and focal cortical dysplasia, may be treated by neurosurgical excision...|$|R
40|$|Targeted {{deletion}} of {{two members}} of the FE 65 family of adaptor proteins, FE 65 and FE 65 L 1, results in cortical dysplasia. Heterotopias resembling those found in cobblestone <b>lissencephalies</b> in which neuroepithelial cells migrate into superficial layers of the developing cortex, aberrant cortical projections and loss of infrapyramidal mossy fibers arise in FE 65 /FE 65 L 1 compound null animals, but not in single gene knockouts. The disruption of pial basal membranes underlying the heterotopias and poor organization of fibrillar laminin by isolated meningeal fibroblasts from double knockouts suggests that FE 65 proteins are involved in basement membrane assembly. A similar phenotype is observed in triple mutant mice lacking the APP family members APP, APLP 1 and APLP 2, all of which interact with FE 65 proteins, suggesting that this phenotype may be caused by decreased transmission of an APP-dependent signal through the FE 65 proteins. The defects observed in the double knockout may also involve the family of Ena/Vasp proteins, which participate in actin cytoskeleton remodeling and interact with the WW domains of FE 65 proteins...|$|R
25|$|The {{established}} {{classification scheme}} for <b>lissencephaly</b> {{is based on}} the severity (grades 1-6) and the gradient.|$|E
25|$|Focal {{cortical}} dysplasia. Miller-Dieker syndrome, , Fukuyama congenital {{muscular dystrophy}} and Walker Warburg syndrome are genetic disorders associated with <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most <b>lissencephaly</b> {{cases are}} {{associated}} with deletions of mutations of the LIS1 gene {{and the results are}} usually more severe in the posterior brain regions.|$|E
25|$|Should neurons {{follow an}} {{abnormal}} migration during development possible cortical malformations include classical <b>lissencephaly</b> (as stated above) and subcortical band heterotopia with an agyria-pachygyria band spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Diffuse pachygyria (a mild form of <b>lissencephaly)</b> {{can be seen}} on an MRI as {{thickened}} cerebral cortices {{with few}} and large gyri and incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures.|$|E
25|$|As {{these cells}} are {{involved}} in the correct organization of the developing brain, there are several studies implicating CR cells in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, <b>lissencephaly</b> and temporal lobe epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Cerebellar {{hypoplasia}} is {{an incomplete}} {{development of the}} cerebellum. The most common cause in dogs is an in utero infection with canine herpesvirus. It is also seen associated with <b>lissencephaly</b> in Wire-haired Fox Terriers and Irish Setters, and as a separate condition in Chow Chows.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as spina bifida, meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, <b>lissencephaly,</b> polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Pachygyria, <b>lissencephaly</b> (smooth brain), and polymicrogyria (multiple small gyri) are all {{the results}} of {{abnormal}} cell migration. The abnormal migration is typically associated with a disorganized cellular architecture, failure to form six layers of cortical neurons (a four-layer cortex is common), and functional problems. The abnormal formation of the brain {{may be associated with}} seizures, developmental delay, and mental dysfunctions.|$|E
25|$|Microcephalic osteodysplastic {{primordial}} dwarfism (MOPD) type II is an autosomal multisystem disorder including severe pre- and post-natal growth retardation, microcephaly with Seckel syndrome-like facial appearance, {{and distinctive}} skeletal alterations. Usually those affected have {{mild to moderate}} mental retardation. This female child is the first born of nonconsanguineous parents at 35 weeks gestation through a cesarean section due to intrauterine growth retardation. She had a retarded psychomotor development and was repeatedly hospitalized during her {{first six months of}} life due to recurring respiratory infections. Her electroencephalography, auditory brainstem response evaluation, and chromosomal analysis were relatively normal. A brain MRI revealed thickened cerebral cortices with few and large gyri prominently in the frontal and posterior temporal regions, incomplete development of the Sylvian fissures, and dilatation of the posterior horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly). Usually only mild brain malformations are associated with MOPD type II. The imaging findings of this child’s brain most likely represent diffuse pachygyria, a mild form of <b>lissencephaly.</b> This child’s neurodevelopmental findings were mild when compared to previous reports of a well-defined chromosome 17-linked and X-linked <b>lissencephaly</b> in a bedridden patient with severe developmental delays.|$|E
500|$|FE65 is an {{intracellular}} {{protein that}} binds to the NPXY motif of ApoER2 and {{plays a role}} in linking other proteins, such as amyloid precursor protein, to ApoER2. [...] This protein aids in a cell's migrational functions. [...] Knockout studies of FE65 have shown a link to <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lissencephaly</b> (to which pachygyria is {{most closely}} linked) is {{associated}} with severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and motor disability. Two characteristics of <b>lissencephaly</b> include its absence of convolutions (agyria) and decreased presence of convolutions (pachygyria). [...] The types of seizures associated with <b>lissencephaly</b> include: ...|$|E
2500|$|LIS1 is {{responsible}} for the autosomal form of <b>lissencephaly.</b> [...] Mutations of the LIS1 gene are associated with about 80% of those affected with <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Other {{possible}} {{symptoms of}} <b>lissencephaly</b> include telecanthus, estropia, hypertelorism, {{varying levels of}} mental retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum aplasia, and decreased muscle tone and tendon reflexes. [...] Over 90% of children affected with <b>lissencephaly</b> have seizures.|$|E
2500|$|Grade 1 and Grade 4 {{are very}} rare. [...] Grade 2 is {{observed}} {{in children with}} Miller-Dieker syndrome (a combination of <b>lissencephaly</b> with dysmorphic facial features, visceral abnormalities, and polydactyly). [...] The most common <b>lissencephaly</b> observed, consisting of frontotemporal pachygyria and posterior agyria, is Grade 3.|$|E
2500|$|One {{study showed}} that of an {{isolated}} group of patients with <b>lissencephaly,</b> 40% resulted from an LIS1 deletion and another 25% resulted from an intragenic mutation of the gene. [...] Patients with missense mutations tend to have less severe symptoms, pachygyria, and rare cases of subcortical band heterotopia. [...] Truncated (shortened) mutations of LIS1 tend to cause severe <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term 'pachygyria' {{does not}} {{directly}} relate to a specific malformation but rather is used to generally describe physical characteristics of the brain in association with several neuronal migration disorders; most commonly disorders relating to varied degrees of <b>lissencephaly.</b> [...] <b>Lissencephaly</b> is present in 1 of 85,470 births and {{the life span of}} those affected is short as only a few survive past the age of 20.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Lissencephaly</b> {{results from}} {{defective}} neuronal migration {{between the first}} and second trimester of gestation which causes lack of gyral and sulcal development, as well as improper lamination, giving the brain a smooth appearance. As of 2003, there were five genes related to <b>lissencephaly,</b> including LIS1, the first to be discovered, and RELN. Apparently Cajal–Retzius cells are not affected in [...] mutations in the LIS1 gene, even though the product of this gene interferes with reelin interaction with their receptors. Mutations in the RELN gene appear in the autosomal form of <b>lissencephaly</b> with cerebral hypoplasia, where patients show developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia and seizures, symptoms which can be related to the reeler mutant.|$|E
2500|$|DCX was {{the first}} known gene causing X-linked <b>lissencephaly</b> and {{subcortical}} band heterotopia. [...] It is found on chromosome Xq22.3-q23 and has nine exons that code for 360 proteins. [...] DCX is expressed exclusively in the fetal brain.|$|E
2500|$|Several genetic {{mutations}} have been isolated and linked to specific malformations of the cerebral cortex. [...] Genes shown to cause <b>lissencephaly</b> include both autosomal and X-linked genes. [...] Below, the mutations of LIS1 or DCX genes are discussed {{as they are}} most commonly linked to neuronal migration disorders including lissencephaly-pachygyria and subcortical band heterotopia.|$|E
2500|$|Doublecortin (DCX or XLIS) {{mutations}} {{are responsible}} for X-linked disorders. While LIS1 mutations tend to cause severe malformations in the posterior brain, DCX mutations focus much of their destruction on anterior malformations and are linked to <b>lissencephaly</b> in males and subcortical band heterotopias in females. [...] Women with DCX mutations tend to have an anteriorly-predominant subcortical band heterotopia and pachygyria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lissencephaly</b> ("smooth brain") is {{the extreme}} form of pachygyria. In <b>lissencephaly,</b> {{few or no}} sulci are seen on the {{cortical}} surface, resulting in a broad, smooth appearance to the entire brain. <b>Lissencephaly</b> can be radiologically confused with polymicrogyria, particularly with low-resolution imaging, but the smoothness and lack of irregularity in the gray-white junction, along with markedly increased cortical thickness, distinguishes <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lissencephaly</b> (to which pachygyria is {{most closely}} linked) is {{associated}} with severe mental retardation, epilepsy, and motor disability.

[...] The types of seizures associated with <b>lissencephaly</b> include: ...|$|E
50|$|Mutations to the TUBA1A gene {{manifest}} clinically as Type 3 <b>Lissencephaly.</b> In general, <b>lissencephaly</b> {{is characterized}} by agyria (lacking of gyri and sulci to the brain - a smooth brain), seizure activity, failure to thrive, as well as intellectual disability and psychomotor retardation, often to a profound degree.The symptoms of Lis3 <b>Lissencephaly</b> are not especially different from generalized <b>lissencephaly</b> (Lis1, related to PAFAH1B1). Diagnosis of <b>lissencephaly</b> generally is made from the symptom profile, while attribution to a specific type is obtained by microarray. Treatment is symptomatic; anti-convulsive drugs for seizure activity, g-button gastrostomy to feed the child, physical therapy for muscle disorders.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lissencephaly,</b> or 'smooth brain', is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} brain does not properly form the gyri and sulci as a result from neuronal migration and cortical folding. This disorder can also result in epilepsy and cognitive impariment. Type 1 <b>lissencephaly</b> is due to an error in migration. LISI, also known as PAFAH1B, is expressed in both dividing and migrating cells found in the brain. When LIS1 is deleted, <b>lissencephaly</b> occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{possible}} {{symptoms of}} <b>lissencephaly</b> include telecanthus, estropia, hypertelorism, {{varying levels of}} mental retardation, cerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum aplasia, and decreased muscle tone and tendon reflexes. [...] Over 90% of children affected with <b>lissencephaly</b> have seizures.|$|E
50|$|Causes of <b>lissencephaly</b> {{can include}} viral infections {{of the uterus}} or the fetus during the first trimester, or {{insufficient}} blood supply to the fetal brain early in pregnancy. There are also a number of genetic causes of <b>lissencephaly,</b> including mutation of the reelin gene (on chromosome 7), {{as well as other}} genes on the X chromosome and on chromosome 17. Genetic counseling is usually offered if there is a risk of <b>lissencephaly,</b> coupled with genetic testing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lissencephaly</b> 2, more {{commonly}} called Norman-Roberts syndrome, {{is a rare}} form of <b>lissencephaly</b> caused by a mutation in the reelin gene. A small number of cases have been described. The syndrome was first reported by M. Norman and M. Roberts et al. in 1976.|$|E
50|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>lissencephaly</b> is usually made at birth or soon after by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). However, these results {{should be interpreted cautiously}} since even experienced radiologists can misdiagnose polymicrogyria, a different developmental malformation of the brain, as <b>lissencephaly.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{spectrum}} of <b>lissencephaly</b> {{is only now}} becoming more defined as neuroimaging and genetics have provided more insights into migration disorders. There are around 20 types of <b>lissencephaly</b> which make up the spectrum. Other causes which {{have not yet been}} identified are likely as well.|$|E
