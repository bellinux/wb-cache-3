5000|$|Stethoscopic {{auscultation}} {{of a clear}} <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> {{during this}} articulation will detect a sound matching that received through normal hearing; that is, the sound articulated by the patient will be clearly transmitted through the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> and heard unchanged by the clinician. When the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> is consolidated (filled with liquid or other solid mass such as tumor or fungus ball), the patient's spoken English long E will sound like a [...] "pure-voweled" [...] long E or a modern English long A without the latter's usual offglide. This effect occurs because the solid mass in the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> will disproportionately dampen the articulated sound's acoustic overtones higher in the harmonic series, transmuting the English long E, in which higher overtones predominate strongly, to a sound (the English long A) in which higher overtones predominate only slightly, i.e., to a markedly lesser degree than in the former sound. This finding is referred to in clinical contexts as the [...] "E to A transition." [...] If associated with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, this E to A transition indicates pneumonia.|$|E

5000|$|The whispered pectoriloquy test {{is similar}} to bronchophony, {{but not so much}} egophony.

The only difference between whispered pectoriloquy and bronchophony is the volume at which the patient is asked by the clinician to repeat [...] "ninety-nine" [...] or [...] "baseball." [...] That is, in whispered pectoriloquy, the repeated words are whispered at low volume, and in bronchophony, they are spoken at normal volume. The clinical observation being determined is whether or not an increase in volume is heard at the clinician's stethoscope over the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> being auscultated which would indicate lung consolidation.|$|E

5000|$|Usually spoken {{sounds of}} a whispered volume by the patient would not be heard by the {{clinician}} auscultating a <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> with a stethoscope. However, {{in areas of the}} lung where there is lung consolidation, these whispered spoken sounds by the patient (such as saying 'ninety-nine') will be clearly heard through the stethoscope. This increase in sound exists because sound travels faster and thus with lower loss of intensity through liquid or solid ("fluid mass" [...] or [...] "solid mass," [...] respectively, in the lung) versus gaseous (air in the lung) media. Whispered pectoriloquy is a clinical test typically performed during a medical physical examination to evaluate for the presence of lung consolidation, which could be caused by cancer (solid mass) or pneumonia (fluid mass).|$|E
40|$|General radiographs are {{an initial}} {{diagnostic}} tool {{for a variety}} of clinical conditions such as lung disease detection. The size, shape and texture of a <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> are key parameters for X-ray radiographs based lung disease diagnosis in which the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> segmentation is a significant step. Although many new methods have been proposed in medical image applications, the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> segmentation remains a challenge. In this paper, we have proposed an improved segmentation method based on statistical shape and appearance models. For the shape model, multi-scale and multi-step-size with different limitation parameters were used to increase the searching ability. For the appearance model, multiple features with different weights were used to describe different parts of the <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> border. A set of 247 chest radiographs was used to test the method. The average overlap of the proposed method was 93. 1 % for the publicly available JSRT database.

40|$|Abstract. We {{previously}} {{developed a}} deformable model for segmenting <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> in serial chest radiographs by using both population-based and patientspecific shape statistics, and obtained higher accuracy {{compared to other}} methods. However, this method uses an ad hoc way to evenly partition the boundary of <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> into some short segments, in order to capture the patient-specific shape statistics from {{a small number of}} samples by principal component analysis (PCA). This ad hoc partition can lead to a segment including points with different amounts of longitudinal deformations, thus rendering it difficult to capture principal variations from a small number of samples using PCA. In this paper, we propose a learning technique to adaptively partition the boundary of <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> into short segments according to the longitudinal deformations learned for each boundary point. Therefore, all points in the same short segment own similar longitudinal deformations and thus small variations within all longitudinal samples of a patient, which enables effective capture of patientspecific shape statistics by PCA. Experimental results show the improved performance of the proposed method in segmenting the <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> from serial chest radiographs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Portable chest radiographs are {{performed}} on the most critically-ill patients, who need highly skilled patient care and the best diagnostic tools. However, such radiographs are usually of low quality, mainly due to misaligned body positioning during their acquisition, and subject to a higher misinterpretation rate than the ones obtained with a non-portable x-ray device. This paper presents a pioneering computational approach that copes with the segmentation of the <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> in portable chest radiographs. The proposed methodology involves detection of salient points on the anatomic structures around the <b>lung</b> <b>fields</b> by subsequent application of simple intensity and edge feature extraction techniques. The salient points detected are interpolated using Bézier curves intuitively approximating {{the boundaries of the}} <b>lung</b> <b>fields.</b> Unlike current methodologies, the proposed one does not exclude the overlapping region of the heart from the <b>lung</b> <b>fields,</b> where abnormalities can also be present. The results illustrate the robustness of the proposed methodology on a set of real portable radiographs of patients with bacterial pulmonary infections. A qualitative comparison with a state of the art approach based on graph cuts validates its effectiveness.

40|$|Typically, {{inspiration}} {{is preferred}} when xraying the lungs. The x-ray technologist will ask {{a patient to}} be still and {{to take a deep}} breath and to hold it. This not only reduces the possibility of a blurred image but also enhances the quality of the image since air-filled lungs are easier to see on x-ray film. However, inspiration causes low density in the inner part of <b>lung</b> <b>field.</b> That means that ribs in the inner part of <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> have lower density than the other parts nearer to the border of the <b>lung</b> <b>field.</b> That is why edge detection algorithms often fail to detect ribs. Therefore to make rib edges clear we try to produce an expiration <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> using a 'hemi-elliptical cavity. ' Based on the expiration <b>lung</b> <b>field,</b> we extract the rib edges using canny edge detector and a new connectivity method, called ' 4 way with 10 -neighbors connectivity' to detect clavicle and rib edge candidates. Once the edge candidates are formed, our system selects the best candidates using knowledge-based constraints such as a gradient, length and location. The edges can be paired and labeled as superior rib edge and inferior rib edge. Then the system uses the clavicle, which is obtained in a same method for the rib edge detection, as a landmark to label all detected ribs...|$|E

This report {{presents a}} computerised tool to analyse {{the appearance of}} the lung fields in paediatric chest X-rays to detect the presence of tuberculosis. The computer aided diagnosis (CAD) tool consists of 4 phases: 1) <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> segmentation; 2) <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> subdivision; 3) feature extraction and 4) classification. <b>Lung</b> <b>field</b> segmentation is performed using a semi-automatic implementation of the active shape model algorithm. Two approaches to subdividing the lung fields into regions of interest are compared. The first divides each <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> into 21 overlapping regions of varying sizes, resulting in a total of 42 regions per image; this approach is called the big region approach. The second approach divides the lung fields into a large number of overlapping circular regions of interest. The circular regions have a radius of 32 pixels and are placed on an 8 x 8 pixel grid. This approach is called the circular region approach. Textural features are extracted from each of the regions using the moments of responses to a multiscale bank of Gaussian filters. Additional positional features are added to the circular regions...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis {{infection}} {{is the most}} common co-infection among Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) sero-positives in high tuberculosis prevalence countries. Radiological presentation of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is variable in both HIV negative and positive patients. But this variability is more in HIV positive patients. Objective: To study radiological manifestations in patients of pulmonary tuberculosis with HIV. Materials and Methods: In this prospective observational study we studied radiological findings of pulmonary tuberculosis cases having HIV infection in Shree M. P. Shah Medical College & Guru Gobind Sing Hospital, Jamnagar, Gujarat from November 2003 to July 2006. Results: There was a higher involvement of lower <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> (41. 86 %) as compare to upper <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> (23. 26 %) while 34. 88 % had extensive disease. Cavitary lesions were more frequently observed in extensive diseases (60 %). Incidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pleural effusion was equal in upper <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> while in lower lung field; incidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy was higher as compare to pleural effusion. Conclusion: In HIV positive patients, pulmonary tuberculosis is more likely to present with atypical radiological images. So, in HIV positive patients, we must consider PTB in all atypical radiological presentation for prompt diagnosis and management. Key message: HIV positive patients presenting with lower <b>lung</b> <b>field</b> lesions even without cavitary lesion, possibility of TB should always be considered.
