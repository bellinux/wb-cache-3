Two cultivars of mustard (red and green) were grown in the experimental farm of Chungnam National University and allowed them to grow until flowering stage. In this study, the variability of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and mRNA transcript levels of genes involved in GABA biosynthesis were investigated in 2 cultivars (green and red mustard) of Brassica juncea. We observed that the transcript levels of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 1, 2, and 4 a in roots were the highest, whereas those in seeds were the lowest compared with other organs harvested at flowering stage in green mustard. The transcript levels in green and red mustards displayed similar transcription patterns among a variety of organs, except for those of BjGAD 2 and 4 a in roots. In red mustard, the GABA content in flower buds was the highest (179. 8 mg 100 g- 1 FW), whereas roots contained the lowest amount (1. 77 mg 100 g- 1 FW).

40|$|KEYWORDS: gene {{expression}} green <b>leaf</b> volatiles <b>mustard</b> parasitoids Spodoptera sulphides] Upon herbivore feeding, plants emit complex bouquets of induced volatiles that may repel insect herbivores {{as well as}} attract parasitoids or predators. Due to differences in the temporal dynamics of individual components, {{the composition of the}} herbivore-induced plant volatile (HIPV) blend changes with time. Consequently, the response of insects associated with plants is not constant either. Using Brassica juncea as the model plant and generalist Spodoptera spp. larvae as the inducing herbivore, we investigated herbivore and parasitoid preference as well as the molecular mechanisms behind the temporal dynamics in HIPV emissions at 24, 48 and 72 h after damage. In choice tests, Spodoptera litura moth preferred undamaged plants, whereas its parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris favoured plants induced for 48 h. In contrast, the specialist Plutella xylostella and its parasitoid C. vestalis preferred plants induced for 72 h. These preferences matched the dynamic changes in HIPV blends over time. Gene expression analysis suggested that the induced response after Spodoptera feeding is mainly controlled by the jasmonic acid pathway in both damaged and systemic leaves. Several genes involved in sulphide and green leaf volatile synthesis were clearly up-regulated. This study thus shows that HIPV blends vary considerably over a short period of time, and these changes are actively regulated at the {{gene expression}} level. Moreover, temporal changes in HIPVs elicit differential preferences of herbivores and their natural enemies. We argue that the temporal dynamics of HIPVs may {{play a key role in}} shaping the response of insects associated with plants. ...|$|R

If different hosts are used {{from one generation to}} the next, adaptation may be highly plastic, while if a single host is used over several generations there may be a longer-term response due to natural selection. Using an experimental evolutionary approach, we investigated effects of long-term experience versus short-term responses to different host plants in the oligophagous <b>mustard</b> <b>leaf</b> beetle Phaedon cochleariae. After 26 generations of continuous feeding on either Brassica rapa, Nasturtium officinale or Sinapis alba, freshly hatched larvae were kept on these plants or moved to one of the other host plants for ten days. Global transcriptional patterns as shown by microarrays revealed that between 1 % and 16. 1 % of all 25, 227 putative genes were differentially expressed in these treatments in comparison to the control line constantly feeding on B. rapa. A shift back from S. alba to B. rapa caused the largest changes in gene transcription and may thus represent the harshest conditions. Infection rates with a gregarine parasite were intermediate in all lines that were constantly kept on one host, but much lower or higher when short-term shifts to other host plants occurred. In conclusion, transcriptional plasticity in genes related to metabolism, digestion and general cellular processes plays a key role in long- and short-term responses of the beetle to changing host plant conditions, whereby the specific conditions also affect the interactions between the beetle host and its gregarine parasite...|$|R

Irrespective of sowing dates and crop season LAI, CGR, PGR, total biomass and seed yield were higher in Pusa Jaikisan than in Varuna.

The value of LAI, total biomass production, CGR and PGR were higher in first crop season than the second crop season in all sowing dates in both the cultivars.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Phytophagous insects {{have emerged}} {{successfully}} {{on the planet}} {{also because of the}} development of diverse and often astonishing defensive strategies against their enemies. The larvae of the <b>mustard</b> <b>leaf</b> beetle Phaedon cochleariae, for example, secrete deterrents from specialized defensive glands on their back. The secretion process involves ATP-binding cassette transporters. Therefore, sugar as one of the major energy sources to fuel the ATP synthesis for the cellular metabolism and transport processes, has to be present in the defensive glands. However, the role of sugar transporters for the production of defensive secretions was not addressed until now. RESULTS: To identify sugar transporters in P. cochleariae, a transcript catalogue was created by Illumina sequencing of cDNA libraries. A total of 68, 667 transcripts were identified and 68 proteins were annotated as either members of the solute carrier 2 (SLC 2) family or trehalose transporters. Phylogenetic analyses revealed an extension of the mammalian GLUT 6 / 8 class in insects as well as one group of transporters exhibiting distinctive conserved motifs only present in the insect order Coleoptera. RNA-seq data of samples derived from the defensive glands revealed six transcripts encoding sugar transporters with more than 3, 000 counts. Two of them are exclusively expressed in the glandular tissue. Reduction in secretions production was accomplished by silencing two of four selected transporters. RNA-seq experiments of transporter-silenced larvae showed the down-regulation of the silenced transporter but concurrently the up-regulation of other SLC 2 transporters suggesting an adaptive system to maintain sugar homeostasis in the defensive glands. CONCLUSION: We provide the first comprehensive phylogenetic study of the SLC 2 family in a phytophagous beetle species. RNAi and RNA-seq experiments underline the importance of SLC 2 transporters in defensive glands to achieve a chemical defense for successful competitive interaction in natural ecosystems...|$|R
