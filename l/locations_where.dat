5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests. It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on woodchips used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce. Other <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> the false chanterelle has been recorded include Africa, Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca sensu lato.|$|E

5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms because they believe that condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

5|$|In <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> both {{snake and}} {{salamander}} co-exist, the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they {{feed on the}} amphibians with impunity. Coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities {{at the same rate}} as the snake further develops its immunity. Some frogs and toads are toxic, the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back. These regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul-tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms. Altogether, over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated.|$|E
5|$|In the Tosco-Emilian Apennines, P.fluviatile is {{only found}} {{south of the}} watershed, in {{contrast}} with the crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes, which occurs on both sides on the mountains. Although their ranges overlap, the two species do not inhabit the same water courses, apparently because the crab outcompetes the crayfish, which is therefore forced to live in less favourable <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> the crab cannot survive. Non-indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining of wetlands.|$|E
5|$|Locusts {{have formed}} plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved {{them on their}} tombs and the insects are {{mentioned}} in the Iliad, the Bible and the Quran.

The traditional means of control {{are based on the}} use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective.|$|E

5|$|Maheshinte Prathikaaram {{development}} {{began in}} 2013, when Pothan {{was working as}} an associate director for Abu (who was directing Idukki Gold, co-written by Pushkaran). Pushkaran suggested a story idea to Pothan {{which was based on}} an incident in his native village. At Pothan's insistence, Pushkaran wrote the screenplay that year and Abu later became interested in producing the film. Production was scheduled to commence from December 2014 after completing the casting process but, due to scheduling conflicts, it was postponed to August 2015. Principal photography began in early August in Idukki and nearby <b>locations,</b> <b>where</b> it was predominantly filmed. Shooting was completed in late October.|$|E
5|$|Some social wasps are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} fallen fruit, nectar, and carrion such as dead insects. Adult male wasps {{sometimes}} visit flowers to obtain nectar. Some wasps, such as Polistes fuscatus, commonly return to <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> they previously found prey to forage. In many social species, the larvae exude copious amounts of salivary secretions that are avidly {{consumed by the}} adults. These include both sugars and amino acids, and may provide essential protein-building nutrients that are otherwise unavailable to the adults (who cannot digest proteins).|$|E
5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E

5|$|Cranmer was not {{immediately}} accepted by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a canonical visitation, he had to avoid <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, John Stokesley, John Longland, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the Act of Supremacy did not define his role. This prompted Thomas Cromwell, the king's chief minister, to activate and to take {{the office of the}} vicegerent, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy. Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau {{created a}} tourist route {{that is a}} {{predecessor}} of the modern Great Lakes Circle Tours (GLCT). The Great Lakes Automobile Route {{was a series of}} roads on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. It included US31 between Manistee and the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area. The concept did not last a year; the American entry into World War I and a lack of focus on a single route consigned the idea into obscurity. The idea of a tourist route around the Great Lakes was revived in 1986 as a pet project of Michigan First Lady Paula Blanchard. MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario created the GLCT scheme which includes the LMCT that follows US31 from Lake Michigan Beach northward to Manistee and from Traverse City north to the terminus near Mackinaw City excluding <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> business loops run closer to the lake at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Timothy Searchinger, {{a lawyer}} from Environmental Defense Fund, {{concluded}} that ILUC affects {{the life cycle}} assessment and that instead of saving, both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Ethanol from Brazilian sugarcane performed better, recovering initial carbon emissions in 4 years, while U.S. corn ethanol required 167 years and cellulosic ethanol required a 52 years payback period. The study limited the analysis a 30-year period, assuming that land conversion emits 25 percent of the carbon stored in soils and all carbon in plants cleared for cultivation. Brazil, China, and India were considered among the overseas <b>locations</b> <b>where</b> land use change would occur {{as a result of}} diverting U.S. corn cropland, and it was assumed that new cropland in each of these regions correspond to different types of forest, savanna or grassland based on the historical proportion of each converted to cultivation in these countries during the 1990s.|$|E
