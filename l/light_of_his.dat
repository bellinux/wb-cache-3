5|$|Abu Bakar promuglated the Johor State Establishment Constitution (Malay: Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor), {{drafted by}} Abdul Rahman Andak, on 14 April 1895. The state's {{constitution}} {{was seen as}} a turning point by many as a step in laying the groundwork for the administration of Johor. It was suggested that Abu Bakar, who was fearful of his possible imminet death in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> failing health, promogulated the state constitution with the intent of preserving the state's independence in the light of growing British political influence in the Malay states.|$|E
5|$|Another {{constant}} theme {{which runs}} throughout the Latin American dictator novel, which gained in importance and frequency during the Latin American Boom, is {{the interdependence of}} the Latin American tyrant and United States imperialism. In Mario Vargas Llosa's The Feast of the Goat, for example, Trujillo faces serious opposition shortly after losing his material backing from the CIA, previously held for over 32 years in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anti-communist leanings.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln had changed his mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E
5|$|In <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{business}} closure, McAloney {{was forced}} to seek alternate employment and he consequently enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force on 1 July 1936. Ranked aircraftman, he completed a fitters course and qualified as an aero fitter and turner before being attached to No.1 Squadron at RAAF Base Laverton, Victoria, in September. He was employed in a maintenance role within the unit, working on the Jupiter Gipsy and Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines of Bristol Bulldog and Hawker Demon aircraft respectively. During 1937, McAloney completed a part-time air gunner course. His first child, a son named William, was born later that year.|$|E

Pat O'Brien joined as Slayer's temporary second guitarist when Holt left the tour to play with Exodus. In 2012, bandmate Tom Araya announced a recovery from the disease. However, later in February 2013, Kerry King revealed continuing health problems that kept Hanneman from working.|$|E
5|$|My World is {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber. It {{was released on}} 17 November 2009, by Island Records. The album is considered {{the first half of}} a two-piece project, later being supplemented by his debut studio album My World 2.0 (2010). After signing a recording contract in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> growing popularity on YouTube, Bieber worked with collaborators including his mentor Usher, in addition to producers Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, and Midi Mafia. Its music incorporates pop and R styles, and lyrically discusses teen romance and coming of age situations.|$|E

One of the two lead anchors on the show, Casey, is called up for having an unprofessional attitude on and off screen in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recent divorce from his wife, and is even thinking of leaving the show. Producer Natalie is stuck in a dilemma when she becomes attracted to her colleague Jeremy, who is the new sports statistician at the network.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the details}} would be {{modified}} in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of Mysterium Cosmographicum. His subsequent main astronomical works {{were in some}} sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of Mysterium, half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.|$|E
5|$|Whitney teacher Matthew Yamamoto {{was arrested}} in September 2012 on {{suspicion}} of molesting an underage student.

In 2013, Yamamoto pleaded no contest to oral copulation with a minor, attempted sexual intercourse with a minor and sexual penetration with a foreign object on a minor, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. He received the maximum sentence of five years in prison, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> violation of a restraining order during the investigation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most of the running mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E

5|$|Bradman {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more {{recruits}} than it could equip and train and Bradman spent {{four months in}} Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, {{to act as a}} divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.|$|E
5|$|When Friedrich Wilhelm IV {{came to the}} Prussian throne in 1840 with ambitions {{to develop}} Berlin as a {{cultural}} centre (including {{the establishment of a}} music school, and reform of music for the church), the obvious choice to head these reforms was Mendelssohn. He was reluctant to undertake the task, especially in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> existing strong position in Leipzig. Mendelssohn nonetheless spent some time in Berlin, writing some church music, and, at the King's request, music for productions of Sophocles's Antigone (1841) and Oedipus at Colonus (1845), Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1843) and Racine's Athalie (1845). But the funds for the school never materialised, and various of the court's promises to Mendelssohn regarding finances, title, and concert programming were broken. He was therefore not displeased to have the excuse to return to Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt left Northern Ireland {{ahead of}} the rest of the {{battalion}} and was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Surrey, then under the command of Major (later General Sir) Rupert Smith, and expected this to be his last posting in the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stroke. He applied for a variety of jobs outside the Army but, after Smith's encouragement, sat the entrance exams for Staff College, Camberley, also in Surrey. He passed the entrance exams and turned down two civilian job offers to accept his place. Before Camberley, in late 1980, Dannatt was posted to Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, as a company commander. In early 1981, his company took over the running of HM Prison Frankland during a month-long strike by prison officers. Shortly after the end of the strike, he was posted to Cyprus with the United Nations peacekeeping force before returning to Surrey for the start of the one-year Command and Staff Course at Camberley. After completing the course, he was promoted to major on 30 September 1982, and appointed chief of staff to 20th Armoured Brigade, based in West Germany.|$|E
