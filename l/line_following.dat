5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Clemson in {{possession}} of the ball and starting a drive at its 20-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> a touchback. On the first play of the drive, Simmons threw an interception to Virginia Tech defender Willie Pile at the 50-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Following</b> the turnover, the Hokies continued running out the clock with rushing plays up {{the middle of the}} field. A short gain by Suggs was followed by a five-yard offsides penalty against Clemson, which advanced the Hokies to the Clemson 45-yard line. Ferguson then gained a first down on a run to the 32-yard line. On first down, Vick was slightly injured after attempting to pitch the ball forward. He left the game and was replaced by backup quarterback Dave Meyer. Tech advanced the ball on short runs, setting up fourth down and seven. Tech coach Frank Beamer called a time out, allowing Vick to re-enter the game. The fourth-down play was an incomplete pass, and Tech turned the ball over on downs with 11:49 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|The post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 34-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. Two rushing plays resulted in a first down for the Hokies at their 49-yard line. The Hokies were unable to enter Florida State's half of the field, however, as two incomplete passes and a running play resulted {{in a loss of}} yardage. Florida State's offense returned to the game at their 30-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the kick with 4:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|California {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 35-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush {{that resulted in a}} touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.|$|E

The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence in Central and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Following the turnover, the Eagles' offense {{began work}} at their 46-yard line. Davis {{completed}} a five-yard pass to Robinson, advancing into Tech territory. An incomplete pass followed, but Davis {{was able to}} gain the first down with a pass to Rich Gunnell at the 39-yard line. On the first pass after the first down, Davis and Gunnell connected on a deep pass, but Gunnell fumbled and the ball was recovered {{in the end zone}} by a Virginia Tech defender. The play resulted in a touchback, and Virginia Tech took over on offense at its 20-yard <b>line.</b> <b>Following</b> the turnover, Tech went three and out, punting back to Boston College with 2:11 remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense began {{play from}} the Hoosiers' 34-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the kick. Paci {{scrambled}} for several yards, then completed a {{pass for a}} first down at the 50-yard line. On the next play, however, Paci fumbled the ball, which bounced {{into the hands of}} Tech defensive end Lawrence Lewis, who returned it 20yards for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Tech a 2113 lead with 23 seconds remaining before halftime. Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was returned to the Tech 42-yard line, potentially setting up an Indiana field goal try before halftime. Paci completed a pass to the 36-yard line, and the few seconds remaining in the first half apparently ran off the clock before Indiana could use its final timeout to stop the clock.|$|E

5|$|Receiving {{the ball}} at their own 8-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> a penalty on the kickoff return, Buffalo began to move down the field, with Drew Willy {{completing}} a 38-yard pass to wideout Brett Hamlin and a 29-yard pass to Naaman Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-4 from the Connecticut 19-yard line, Willy completed a ten-yard pass to James Starks, giving the Bulls a 1st-and-goal. Starks rushed for fouryards on firstdown; on seconddown, Willy threw an incomplete pass intended for Roosevelt. On 3rd-and-goal from the Husky 5-yard line, Willy attempted a pass that was deflected and intercepted by UConn safety Dahna Deleston, who returned the ball 100yards for the game-sealing touchdown. UConn won the game 38–20.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{took over}} at its 13-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the 63-yard punt but went three {{and out and}} was itself forced to punt. Air Force's offense {{returned}} to the field at its 47-yard line after the kick. The Falcons picked up one first down, but the Tech defense stiffened and forced a fourth down. Needing just inches to gain a first down, Air Force elected to attempt to gain the needed yardage rather than punt the ball away. But before the Falcons could start the play, time ran out in the third quarter. With one quarter remaining, the Falcons still held a 107 lead.|$|E
5|$|The kick {{was fair}} caught at the 34-yard line of Boston College. On {{the first play}} after the kick, Davis {{connected}} with Harris on a pass play {{that resulted in a}} 51-yard gain for the Eagles. At the Tech 15-yard <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the big gain, the Eagles lost one yard on a rushing play before Davis passed to Gunnell for a 16-yard gain and a touchdown. The extra point was good, and with 1:29 remaining in the first half, Virginia Tech's lead was cut to 14–7.|$|E

5|$|The mammals {{represent}} the only living Synapsida, which {{together with the}} Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were sphenacodont pelycosaurs, a group that produced the non-mammalian Dimetrodon. At {{the end of the}} Carboniferous period, this group diverged from the sauropsid line that led to today's reptiles and birds. The <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the stem group Sphenacodontia split-off several diverse groups of non-mammalian synapsids—sometimes referred to as mammal-like reptiles—before giving rise to the proto-mammals (Therapsida) in the early Mesozoic era. The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era, after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, and have been among the dominant terrestrial animal groups from 66 million years ago to the present.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{received}} criticism {{after an}} incremental upgrade to the Mac Pro <b>line</b> <b>following</b> the 2012 WWDC. The line received more default memory and increased processor speed but still used Intel's older Westmere-EP processors {{instead of the}} newer E5 series. The line also lacked then-current technologies like SATA III, USB 3, and Thunderbolt, the last {{of which had been}} added to every other Macintosh at that point. An email from Apple CEO Tim Cook promised a more significant update to the line in 2013. Apple stopped shipping the first-generation Mac Pro in Europe on March 1, 2013 after an amendment to a safety regulation left the professional Mac non-compliant. The last day to order was February 18, 2013. The first generation Mac Pro was removed from Apple's online store following unveiling of the redesigned second generation Mac Pro at a media event on October 22, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the number}} of camps that {{surrounded}} it, its secure rearward location, and multiple telegraph connections with Washington, Alexandria, and other forts defending Washington, Fort Corcoran became the headquarters for Washington's defenses south of the Potomac River. On September 6, 1862, General Fitz John Porter assumed command of those defenses and made his headquarters at Fort Corcoran. He was only at Fort Corcoran for a short time before he {{and the rest of his}} command were withdrawn from the defenses of Washington in order to counter Lee's advance into Maryland. A bare handful of artillerymen were left to man the guns of the forts along the Arlington <b>Line.</b> <b>Following</b> the climactic Battle of Antietam, Porter and his men returned to Fort Corcoran.
