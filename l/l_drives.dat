40|$|Recent {{work has}} {{identified}} {{a subset of}} cells resident in tumors that exhibit properties {{similar to those found}} in normal stem cells. Such cells are highly tumorigenic and may be involved in resistance to treatment. However, the genes that regulate the tumor initiating cell (TIC) state are unknown. Here, we show that overexpression of either of the nucleolar GTP-binding proteins nucleostemin (NS) or GNL 3 <b>L</b> <b>drives</b> the fraction of genetically defined tumor cells that exhibit markers and tumorigenic properties of TICs. Specifically, cells that constitutively express elevated levels of NS or GNL 3 L exhibit increased TWIST expression, phosphorylation of STAT 3, expression of genes that induce pluripotent stem cells, and enhanced radioresistance; in addition, they form tumors even when small numbers of cells are implanted and exhibit an increased propensity to metastasize. GNL 3 L/NS forms a complex with the telomerase catalytic subunit [human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) ] and the SWItch-Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI-SNF) complex protein brahma-related gene 1 (BRG 1), and the expression of each of these components is necessary to facilitate the cancer stem cell state. Together, these observations define a complex composed of TERT, BRG 1, and NS/GNL 3 L that maintains the function of TICs...|$|E

40|$|Langmuir wave packets {{with low}} {{frequency}} modulations (or beats) {{observed in the}} Jovian foreshock are argued to be direct evidence for the Langmuir wave decay L yields L-prime + S. In this decay, 'pump' Langmuir waves <b>L,</b> <b>driven</b> by an electron beam, produce backscattered product Langmuir waves L-prime and ion sound waves S. The L and L-prime waves beat at the frequency and wavevector of the S waves, thereby modulating the wave packets. Beam speeds calculated using the modulated Jovian wave packets (1) are reasonable, at 4 - 10 times the electron thermal speed, (2) are consistent with theoretical limits on the decay process, and (3) decrease with increasing foreshock depth, as expected theoretically. These results strongly support the theory. The modulation depth of some wave packets suggests saturation by the decay L yields L-prime + S.

40|$|Transgenic mouse {{models that}} {{independently}} express mutations in {{amyloid precursor protein}} (APP) and tau have proven useful {{for the study of}} the neurological consequences of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Studies using these mice have yielded essential discoveries with regard to specific aspects of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that characterize the brain during Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-dependent tauopathies. Most recent transgenic studies have focused on the creation of regulatable models that allow the temporal control of transgene expression. To study a more complete model of AD pathology, we designed a new regulatable transgenic mouse that harbors both APP and tau transgenes. Here, we present a novel transgenic mouse model, rTg 3696 AB, which expresses human APPNLI and tauP 301 <b>L</b> <b>driven</b> by the CaMKII promoter system. Subsequent generation of Aβ and 4 R 0 N tau in the brain resulted in the development of three neuropathological features of AD: Aβ plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neurodegeneration.

40|$|The ALT {{model of}} {{teaching}} suggests a potential {{shift in the}} design of a curriculum. While {{this is not a new}} idea (see literature on assessment for learning), it expands the discussion around the value of teachers learning from students and modelling their behaviour. Literature indicates that many of the students’ study behaviours are driven by assessment. If that is the case, should many of the teachers’ curriculum design behaviours be driven by assessment as well? The proposal is relatively simple. The focus in curriculum design would shift from teaching activities to meet learning objectives, student learning to achieve learning objectives and assessment for measuring the achievement to assessment (A) that meets learning objectives, learning activities (<b>L)</b> <b>driven</b> by assessment and teaching (T) activities driven by learning activities. In other words, the same way we want students to prepare outstanding pieces of assessment, maybe we could focus more attention on creating outstanding assessments in the first place, and let the learning and teaching flow out of those assignments. With great quality assignments, student engagement for learning may become just a bit easier. Some examples and suggestions for future practice based on the ALT model will be discussed using a critical reflection model...|$|R

40|$|Dye-sensitized {{nanoporous}} TiO 2 {{solar cells}} (DSSCs) {{can be classified}} into two types, namely, Type-I and Type-II. Type-I DSSCs are the DSSCs in which electrons are injected from the adsorbed dyes by photoexcitation of the dyes followed by electron injection from the excited dyes to TiO 2 (pathway A). Type-II DSSCs are the DSSCs in which electrons are injected not only by pathway A but also by direct one-step electron injection from the dyes to TiO 2 by photoexcitation of the dye-to-TiO 2 charge-transfer (DTCT) bands (pathway B). The DSSCs employing catechol (Cat) or its derivatives as the sensitizers have been the typical examples of Type-II DSSCs. However, their solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiencies (Ł) have never exceeded 0. 7 %, and the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) at the absorption maximums of the DTCT bands have never exceeded 10 %. We found that the attachment of electron-donating compounds such as (pyridin- 4 -yl) vinyl and (quinolin- 4 -yl) vinyl, respectively, to Cat (designated as Cat-v-P and Cat-v-Q, respectively) leads to 2 -and 2. 7 -fold increases, respectively, in <b>Ł,</b> <b>driven</b> by large increases in short circuit current (Jsc). The EQE increased from 8. 5 to 30 % at 400 nm upon changing from Cat to Cat-v-P, at which only the DTCT band absorbs.

40|$|Currently {{there is}} a trend for the {{expansion}} of the area cropped with sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum <b>L.),</b> <b>driven</b> by an increase in the world demand for biofuels, due to economical, environmental, and geopolitical issues. Although sugarcane is traditionally harvested by burning dried leaves and tops, the unburned, mechanized harvest has been progressively adopted. The use of process based models is useful in understanding the effects of plant litter in soil C dynamics. The objective of this work was to use the CENTURY model in evaluating the effect of sugarcane residue management in the temporal dynamics of soil C. The approach taken in this work was to parameterize the CENTURY model for the sugarcane crop, to simulate the temporal dynamics of soil C, validating the model through field experiment data, and finally to make predictions in the long term regarding soil C. The main focus of this work was the comparison of soil C stocks between the burned and unburned litter management systems, but the effect of mineral fertilizer and organic residue applications were also evaluated. The simulations were performed with data from experiments with different durations, from 1 to 60 yr, in Goiana and Timbauba, Pernambuco, and Pradopolis, Sao Paulo, all in Brazil; and Mount Edgecombe, Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. It was possible to simulate the temporal dynamics of soil C (R(2) = 0. 89). The predictions made with the model revealed that there is, in the long term, a trend for higher soil C stocks with the unburned management. This increase is conditioned by factors such as climate, soil texture, time of adoption of the unburned system, and N fertilizer management. FAPESPCAPE...|$|R
