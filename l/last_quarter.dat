5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views were {{out of step with the}} majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Federal Reconstruction in Mobile {{began after}} the Civil War and {{effectively}} ended in 1874 {{when the local}} Democrats gained control of the city government. The <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century {{was a time of}} economic depression and municipal insolvency for Mobile. One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|Mannerism is {{the name}} {{sometimes}} given to the period in art history during which the late Renaissance coexisted with the early Baroque, in Poland the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 16th century and {{the first quarter of}} the 17th century. Polish art remained influenced by the Italian centers, increasingly Rome, and increasingly by the art of the Netherlands. As a fusion of imported and local elements, it evolved into an original Polish form of the Baroque.|$|E

During the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of 2011 he concluded a tour schedule that had lasted for almost 3 years. He used the same format for a later concert at Carthage during the city's 2013 musical festival.|$|E
5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who had missed his train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored twice in the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of an hour to take the game 4–3.|$|E
5|$|The oldest writers, Dominicus Lampsonius and Karel van Mander, {{attached}} {{themselves to}} his most evident side, to the subject; their conception of Bosch, inventor of fantastic pieces of devilry and of infernal scenes, which prevails today (1937) {{in the public}} at large, and prevailed with historians until the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the longest}} stages of the 2003 race at 204.5 km, this was another mostly flat stage where the sprinters {{would be likely to}} excel. A few Category 4 climbs or smaller {{occurred}} in the first and <b>last</b> <b>quarters</b> of the race.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier than had been generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|Belief in the {{existence}} of water bulls persisted in Scotland until at least the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century. As with many mythological creatures, descriptions are imprecise. The water bull is able to shapeshift into human form, and live on land or in water. It can be a monstrous, malevolent black beast, especially when described as a tarbh uisge, but not as nasty as the each uisge or water horse. It can also be amiable and sometimes helpful. It differs from the Manx tarroo ushtey, which {{is more likely to be}} a resident of marshland.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 20th {{century the}} gardens and grounds were {{restored}} and replanted. The house and village have often featured as locations for films. Several {{scenes of the}} 1995 film version of Jane Austen's novel Sense and Sensibility were filmed at Montacute, as were scenes from the 2004 film The Libertine. The house was used as Baskerville Hall for a version of The Hound of the Baskervilles filmed in 2000 for Canadian television. In May–June 2014 the house was used {{as one of the}} locations for the BBC's adaption of Hilary Mantel novel Wolf Hall.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 20th century heavy {{industry}} {{was replaced by}} service-based activities including data processing, call centres, hi-tech electronics and IT companies. The town retains some traditional industries employing people in paper-manufacturing, packaging, textiles, transportation, steel foundries and building materials. Missiles were produced at the British Aerospace (BAe) factory in Lostock, now closed. The Reebok brand's European headquarters are located at the Reebok Stadium. Bolton is also {{the home of the}} family bakery, Warburtons, established in 1876 on Blackburn Road. On 13 February 2003, Bolton was granted Fairtrade Town status.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twelfth}} century {{education}} in the Faroe Islands {{was provided by the}} Catholic Church. The Church of Denmark took over education after the Protestant Reformation. Modern educational institutions started operating in the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the nineteenth century and developed throughout the twentieth century. The status of the Faroese language in education was a significant issue for decades, until it was accepted as a language of instruction in 1938. Initially education was administered and regulated by Denmark. In 1979 responsibilities on educational issues started transferring to the Faroese authorities, a procedure which was completed in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Maibaum kept {{on making}} rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant {{was added to}} the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey—a change that brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during {{shooting}} involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead). For the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.|$|E
50|$|The aim is {{to achieve}} full fiscal {{sovereignty}} for Catalonia. This movement wants that the taxes of the Catalan citizens remain in Catalonia.

In the <b>last</b> three <b>quarters</b> fifty councils have added to this initiative.|$|R

5|$|Many {{indigenous}} communities did not evenly {{share in the}} benefits of the economic boom Taiwan experienced during the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 20th century. They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers. The cultural impact of poverty and economic marginalization has led to an increase in alcoholism and prostitution among aborigines.|$|E
5|$|Martin Nyrop {{was one of}} {{the main}} proponents of the National Romantic style. The main aim was to use {{distinctive}} Nordic motifs from the distant past, as is clearly demonstrated in Copenhagen City Hall which was completed in 1905. The City Hall is certainly Copenhagen's most monumental and most original building from the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century with its impressive facade, the golden statue of Absalon just above the balcony and its tall, slim clock tower. It was inspired by the Siena City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Novello printed an Octavo {{edition of}} the D major Magnificat in 1874, using a {{translation}} to English which John Troutbeck based on the text in The Book of Common Prayer. In 1880, when Bach's autographs of the composition were already kept in the Royal Library (later State Library) of Berlin, Philipp Spitta devoted many pages to the Magnificat in his Bach-biography, considering it {{recognized as one of}} the greatest achievements of the composer's genius. Bach's Magnificat was performed several times in the <b>last</b> <b>quarter</b> of the 19th century, for instance in Germany and the Netherlands.|$|E

A separate arrangement was made to allow a replay of the entire Grand Final match.|$|R
