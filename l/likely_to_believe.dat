For my own part I believe that when St. Paul talks of man's flesh, he means by it man's body, man's heart and brain, and all his bodily appetites and powers--what we call a man's constitution; in a word, the ANIMAL part of man, just what a man has in common with the beasts who perish.|$|R

25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was {{to see if a}} participant answered yes to the first question, implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E

In other words, Asians were more <b>likely</b> than Euro-Canadians <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that their luck would change {{during the next}} round. Asians’ greater tendency to predict a win after a streak of losses indicates {{that they were more}} susceptible to the gambler’s fallacy than were Euro-Canadians. In Study 2, likewise, Euro-Canadians were more <b>likely</b> than Chinese <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that a streak of success or failures would continue in the same vein. This indicates that Canadians were more susceptible to the hot hand fallacy (and its “Cold Hand” Fallacy counterpart for losing scenarios) than were Chinese. Thus we have obtained consistent results in terms of cultural differences in gambling fallacies in both random tasks (coin-toss) and nonrandom tasks involving skills (basketball).|$|R

500|$|Social science {{research}} gives {{weight to the}} perceptions of those directly affected. In particular, studies {{support the view that}} sports mascots and images are not trivial. Stereotyping directly affects academic performance and self-esteem, which contribute to all of the other issues faced by Native Americans, including suicide, unemployment, and poverty. European Americans exposed to mascots are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> not only that stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Two studies examining the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot found a tendency to endorse stereotypes of a different minority group (Asian Americans), which is indicative of a [...] "spreading effect". Exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking; demonstrating the harm done to society by stereotyping of any kind. A connection between stereotyping and racism of any group increasing the likelihood of stereotyping others was made by Native Americans opposing the [...] "Indians" [...] mascot in Skowhegan, Maine when fliers promoting the KKK were distributed in that town.|$|E
500|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media in terms of offensiveness or political correctness, which reduces it to feelings and opinions, and prevents full understanding of the historical, psychological and sociological context provided by academic research on {{the negative effects of}} the use of Native American names and images by sports teams. The effect of stereotyping on high or low expectations, confidence, and academic performance has been well-established. This effect is enhanced due to the invisibility of Native Americans in mainstream society and media, leaving stereotypes as the primary basis for thinking about the abilities and traits associated with Natives, including the roles and opportunities Natives Americans envision for themselves. Furthermore, even when stereotypes are positive (e.g. [...] "Natives Americans are spiritual"), they may have a limiting, detrimental effect on individuals. Stereotyping may directly affect the academic performance and self-esteem of Native American youth, whose people face high rates of suicide, unemployment, and poverty. Euro-Americans exposed to mascots may be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> not only that such stereotypes are true, but that Native Americans have no identity beyond these stereotypes. Research indicates that exposure to any stereotypes increased the likelihood of stereotypical thinking with regard to other minority groups in addition to the target of the stereotype, a [...] "spreading effect".|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} documents how stereotypes discourage {{young women}} from choosing and attaining technology jobs. We build off this research and ask whether (and how) stereotypes continue to affect {{men and women}} once they enter the technology workforce. Using a novel survey of technical employees from seven Silicon Valley firms and new measures {{of what we call}} “cultural” and “skill” alignment, we show that men are more <b>likely</b> than women <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they possess the stereotypical traits and skills of a successful tech employee. We find that cultural alignment is especially important: because women are less <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> they match the cultural image of successful tech workers, they are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> identify with the tech profession, less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report positive supervisor treatment, and more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consider switching career fields. This paper is the first to use unique and independent measures of cultural and skill alignment comparing employees’ perceptions of themselves to their perceptions of an ideal successful worker. By allowing cultural and skill alignment to operate separately, we are able to determine which work outcomes are most strongly related to each form of alignment. Our results imply that if we can broaden the cultural image of a successful tech worker, women may be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> feel like they belong in technology environments, ultimately increasing their retention in tech jobs...|$|R

500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as we read the story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll conducted in late June 2017 found that 54% of respondents believed that Trump either did [...] "something illegal" [...] or [...] "something unethical, but not illegal" [...] in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion).

The pope's encyclical on behalf of the Catholic Church officially acknowledges a man-made climate change caused by burning fossil fuels. The Pope says the warming of the planet is rooted in a throwaway culture and the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet in pursuit of short-term economic gains. According to The New York Times, Laudato si put pressure on the Catholic candidates in the 2016 election: Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, and Rick Santorum. [...] With leading Democrats praising the encyclical, James Bretzke, a professor of moral theology at Boston College, has said that both sides were being disingenuous: [...] "I think it shows that both the Republicans and the Democrats... like to use religious authority and, in this case, the Pope to support positions they have arrived at independently...
