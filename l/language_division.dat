The early Walloon Movement developed {{in reaction to the}} perceived discrimination against French language as Dutch was progressively accorded equality. At the same time, the movement called on a [...] "Walloon identity" [...] rather than a Belgian one. In his famous Lettre au roi sur la séparation de la Wallonie et de la Flandre ("Letter to the King on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders") published in 1912, the Walloon socialist Jules Destrée argued that the <b>language</b> <b>division</b> in Belgium was irreconcilable, famously stating that [...] "In Belgium, there are the Walloons and the Flemish.

2500|$|The Book of Daniel {{is divided}} between the court tales of {{chapters}} 1–6 and the apocalyptic visions of 7–12, and between the Hebrew of chapters 1 and 8–12, and the Aramaic of chapters 2–7.
