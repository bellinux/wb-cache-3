5000|$|A {{safe working}} load (SWL) should, {{according}} to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on {{the configuration of the}} equipment, accessories for <b>lifting</b> such as <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>lifting</b> magnets and lifting beams should also be marked. [...] The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely. Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.|$|R
50|$|Machinery <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are fully}} {{threaded}} {{and may have}} a collar, making them suitable for use with angular loads up to 45°. <b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> without a shoulder {{should not be used}} for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|Wire eye lags (also called {{screw thread}} <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>eye</b> screws, or turned/bent eye lags) have a wood screw thread {{for use in}} wood or lag anchors. Like wire <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> wire <b>eye</b> lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|R
50|$|A turnbuckle, {{stretching}} screw or bottlescrew is {{a device}} for adjusting the tension or length of ropes, cables, tie rods, and other tensioning systems. It normally {{consists of two}} threaded <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> one screwed into each end of a small metal frame, one with a left-hand thread {{and the other with}} a right-hand thread. The tension can be adjusted by rotating the frame, which causes both <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to be screwed in or out simultaneously, without twisting the <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> or attached cables.|$|R
5000|$|A cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{typically}} {{used as a}} structural tie down [...] in building construction where the <b>eye</b> of the <b>bolt</b> must be fastened {{to a point that}} cannot be directly below where the shaft would otherwise be fastened. This often occurs where a bearer must be tied down to a post or column but the bearer cannot be directly fastened to the post of column.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> made by bending a rod or wire into a loop {{are only}} {{suitable}} for light duty applications, as heavy loads {{can cause the}} eye to open. For high loads, <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with forged or welded loops should be chosen, as they can withstand loads up to the tensile strength of the material {{of which they are}} made.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are made}} with {{different}} degrees of crank and lengths of shaft for flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} of several trigger {{mechanisms}} is two <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> and a peg through both <b>bolts.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are usually {{placed at the}} bottom of the frame, locking above the arm to prevent accidental release. In larger designs, the trigger system is applied at the top of the drop channel. Large scale designs require special trigger mechanisms that can hold the weight of the throwing arm.|$|R
50|$|Today, cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are now {{typically}} made by welding a cranked and {{threaded rod}} to a {{heavy gauge steel}} washer.|$|R
50|$|Heavy forged <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> with a {{continuous}} eye may be forged with an integral shoulder, allowing their use for heavy off-axis loads.|$|R
5000|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{used to be}} made by bending an [...] "eye" [...] {{into the}} end of a rod that was {{threaded}} at the other end.|$|R
50|$|Cranked <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{can also}} be used to tie the top plate of a house frame {{directly}} to house supports, using rod couplers and steel extension rods.|$|R
5000|$|She {{designed}} {{a necklace of}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, meant to represent [...] "strength without a fist"; she gave {{the first of these}} to Arlene Raven and Judy Chicago when they started the Feminist Studio Workshop in 1972. Since then she has given them to other women with whom she shares a vision of the creation of women's culture. Members of the Feminist Studio Workshop of 1978-79 also made 500 of these necklaces to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. The feminist art group Sisters of Jam (Mikaela & Moa Krestesen) turned the necklace into a mobile monument; they see the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> [...] "as a symbol for the work already done but also as an encouragement for the work that is not yet completed." [...] Sisters of Jam also did the installation [...] "Hello Sheila", which features an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> on a chain, at the Survival Kit Festival in Umeå in 2014.|$|R
50|$|A special type of Stevenson {{screen with}} an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> {{on the roof}} is used on a ship. The unit is hung from above and remains {{vertical}} despite {{the movement of the}} vessel.|$|R
50|$|An <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> is a bolt with a loop at one end. They {{are used}} to firmly attach a {{securing}} eye to a structure, so that ropes or cables may then be tied to it.|$|R
5000|$|Reikai Beast: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 43. Its powers include using souls {{as a human}} disguise with extending arms, energy draining <b>eye</b> <b>bolts,</b> telekinesis, teleportation, a pitch fork, high jumping, reviving dead makai beasts, and a sword.|$|R
5000|$|... 1875 : Half Dome in Yosemite National Park was climbed by George Anderson. He used <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> in {{drilled holes}} as hand and toe holds. He used a fixed rope {{to return to}} his high point each day.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Pigtail' <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> are {{a form of}} bent loop {{where the}} ends are not closed, but {{multiple}} turns are used to prevent a rope slipping out. They allow a rope to be threaded into the loop, even if its ends are already attached elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the first}} actions of Superintendent Sumner Increase Kimball, the only {{superintendent}} of the U.S. Life-Saving Service, {{was to find a}} better line-throwing device. Kimball realized he needed the best artillery expertise available, so he engaged the help of the Army Board of Ordnance and in 1877 they assigned David A. Lyle, First Lieutenant, U.S.A (1845-1937), a West Point and MIT graduate who began research and testing that resulted in reliable efficient designs. Lyle developed 3 bronze, smooth-bore guns of different sizes and the 2+1/2 in gun became the USLSS standard line-throwing gun. Projectiles for the gun were made of cast iron with a wrought iron <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> screwed into the base as an attachment point for the shot line. The projectile for the 2+1/2 in gun was 15+3/4 in long and weighed [...] It was placed into the 24 in gun barrel so the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with the line attached was sticking out. After firing, the projectile rotated so that the <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> and line were trailing. The gun had a large recoil from firing. A standard charge of 1.5 oz of gunpowder would knock the gun back 6 ft. The maximum rescue charge of 8 oz would send the gun flying back even further.|$|R

50|$|Surgical (invasive) facial {{rejuvenation}} procedures {{can include}} a brow <b>lift</b> (forehead <b>lift),</b> <b>eye</b> <b>lift</b> (blepharoplasty), facelift (rhytidectomy), chin lift and neck lift. Non-surgical (non-invasive) facial rejuvenation treatments can include chemical peels, neuromodulator (such as botox), dermal fillers, laser resurfacing, photorejuvenation, radiofrequency and Ultrasound.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>bolts</b> {{are often}} {{installed}} into masonry and so versions that {{form their own}} anchor bolt are commonly available. Most of these screw into some form of shield anchor. Some lightweight forms are not screwed, but rely on just the pull on the ring itself to expand the anchor.|$|R
5000|$|A ring <b>bolt</b> is an <b>eye</b> <b>bolt</b> with {{a captive}} ring passing through it. The loose ring is articulated, {{such that it}} can rotate {{in at least one}} axis, and can thus reduce bending forces on the bolt when loaded and will present the minimum {{obstruction}} when [...] "flat".|$|R

5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|R
50|$|The Coin Shooting Pistol that fired American five cent pieces was {{designed}} for the Carnival trade and Amusement Parks. They were sold in sets of four with chains and <b>eye</b> <b>bolts</b> to attach to stall counters. When first introduced the operator was expected to set up prizes on boards/stands. Contestants were expected to knock the prize off to win. Tarpaulins behind the prizes would catch the booth operators earnings.|$|R
