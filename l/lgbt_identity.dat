In addition, various endeavors to increase African-American representation in LGBT media have been undertaken in the 21st century, such as the short-lived television series Noah's Arc. Despite this, homophobia {{is considered to be}} quite prevalent within the African American community. Numerous reasons are given for this, including: the image young black males are supposed to convey in the public sphere; the fact that homosexuality is often seen as [...] to being black in the African American community; and the association of the African American community with the church in the United States. Barack Obama has acknowledged homophobia within the African American community, and made a statement to the community saying that: [...] "If we are honest with ourselves, we'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to [...] King's vision of a beloved community ... We have scorned our gay brothers and sisters instead of embracing them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} sexual identity, {{adolescence}} is when most gay/lesbian and transgender adolescents begin {{to recognize and}} make sense of their feelings. Many adolescents may choose to come out during this period of their life once an identity has been formed; many others may go through a period of questioning or denial, which can include experimentation with both homosexual and heterosexual experiences. A study of 194 lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths under the age of 21 found that having an awareness of one's sexual orientation occurred, on average, around age 10, but the process of coming out to peers and adults occurred around age 16 and 17, respectively. [...] Coming to terms with and creating a positive <b>LGBT</b> <b>identity</b> can be difficult for some youth for a variety of reasons. Peer pressure is a large factor when youth who are questioning their sexuality or gender identity are surrounded by heteronormative peers and can cause great distress due to a feeling of being different from everyone else. While coming out can also foster better psychological adjustment, the risks associated are real. Indeed, coming out {{in the midst of a}} heteronormative peer environment often comes with the risk of ostracism, hurtful jokes, and even violence. [...] Because of this, statistically the suicide rate amongst LGBT adolescents is up to four times higher than that of their heterosexual peers due to bullying and rejection from peers or family members.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} legislative {{variations in}} <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities,</b> addressing the question: {{why and how}} do two largely Catholic states—Italy and Spain—endow different legal treatment to <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities?</b> Italy and Spain present important similarities in their legal, social and historical backgrounds. The legal cultures of both of these states have legal frameworks decriminalizing homosexuality. Nevertheless, they have approached same-sex unions in quite different ways. Spain has introduced same-sex marriage. Italy has hindered, consequently legal recognition remains fiercely contested and unrealized. Overall, {{it is argued that}} it is in the area of same-sex unions that some of the most significant changes have taken place in family law over the past decade in a number of jurisdictions. The paper argues that legal reforms in family law must be understood in terms of relation between society and law and must draw upon the concept of “culture”. The two jurisdictions appear to support the theoretical perspective that reforms and lack of reforms in family law are inspired by a number of contexts such as religious values, ideas of political morality and State interests...|$|R

50|$|The Internet {{has also}} been a great proponent of lesbian, gay, {{bisexual}} and transsexual (<b>LGBT)</b> <b>identity</b> in China. Since the late 1990s, members of the LGBT community have used the Internet to access and share information, form relationships, and cultivate queer identities and communities. However, despite the seemingly unconstrained development of the LGBT community in the global cyberspace, there are constraints. Some constraints are informed by socio-economic factors. There are some gay, lesbian and queer people who cannot afford a computer and access to the Internet at home and therefore are obliged to use Internet cafes, where they may be compelled to avoid certain websites for fear of being monitored by other people. Some constraints are politically informed. Gay and lesbian-oriented websites tend to be short-lived due to Internet regulations and controls of the government. Furthermore, despite an online proliferation of the <b>LGBT</b> <b>identity,</b> the community remains subordinate to China's hegemonic discourse on sexuality. Rarely do traditional Chinese media outlets recognise <b>LGBT</b> <b>identity</b> let alone embrace and validate the community.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies ethnographically how ordinary heterosexual people habitually {{and with}} the best intentions make homosexuals or LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-gendered/trans-sexual) people invisible in their daily and ordinary communication processes in Japanese communities in both Oisawa, Japan and Western Massachusetts, U. S. A. This study raises a general question: what are the scenes and communication practices in and through which homosexuality becomes invisible or irrelevant to identification of the self? The main conceptual frames used are those of stigma theory by Ervin Goffman (1963), ethnography of communication by Dell Hymes 1972, 1974), cultural communication by Donal Carbaugh (1989, 1990, 1996, 2001, 2002, cf. 2003, 2005), and coordinated management of meaning by Vernon Cronen 1994). The methodology involves a variety of data including field observations, various forms of textual data, as well as interviews in each Japanese community in Japan and the U. S. A. In five chapters, different aspects of communicative practices and processes as well as associated cultural premises are explicated, delineated, and analyzed. In each case, both intended and unintended functions of the communication are explored. First, a communicative style of “being ordinary” (futuu) is explored, in and through which ordinary heterosexuals habitually enact a complete lack of awareness of homosexuals. This practice involves actions of “not seeing, not hearing, and not saying” (mizaru, kikazaru, iwazaru) that are enacted individually. When multiple interlocutors enact the actions in collaboration, the communicative practices constitute an event of “pretending nothing happened” (nakatta koto ni suru), making <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities</b> communicationally invisible. Second, while addressing the Japanese cultural emphases on silence and indirect and ambiguous communication practices, a direct and open mode of Japanese communication practice is examined. This communication practice is called “speaking straightforwardly” (massugu yuu/hakkiri iu), in and through which the speaker expresses candid and sincere thoughts and feelings in accordance with common sense. The recipient of such communication often enacts “being open and receptive” (sunao), that involves listening silently without being defensive or becoming upset. These communicative practices actively and explicitly discourage and at times prohibit discourse about <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities</b> and orientation. Third, cultural premises regarding social and emotional selves associated with the communicative practices of being ordinary and speaking straightforwardly are explicated and analyzed. The dialectic interplay between the two selves becomes salient as the two communication practices are enacted, and it creates tension and human drama. Although ideally speaking an interlocutor has to be always in dialogue with the two selves, one self becomes more salient, as expressed in the communication process, than the other, depending on the situation. These two conflicting selves {{play a key role}} in legitimating the heterosexual understanding of what constitutes ordinary personhood, which often marginalizes <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities</b> and orientations as unimportant. Fourth, speaking straightforwardly as a silencing form of communication renders <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities</b> as frightening and cultivates gut-level discomfort against “homosexuals,” without knowing any of them personally. This silencing communication involves cultural conceptualization of human nature, human sexuality, and homosexuality. The family and intimate communication practices function as the gatekeeper, in which the interlocutors express openly and candidly their perceptions and gut-level discomfort about <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities</b> and their implications in society in terms of achieving mundane happiness. This ensures invisibility of <b>LGBT</b> <b>identities,</b> since parents wish for their children nothing but to be able to pursue mundane happiness. Fifth, an analysis of the Japanese heterosexual male-centered lovemaking scenes in ero-manga provides some possible sources of misunderstandings between males, females, and male homosexuals. In particular the analyses seek to identify and examine the intersection between the ero-manga representations and communicative practices of talking about sexuality. Many males often project their own male sense of sexuality on their female counterparts, while trying to please their female counterparts. In the males 2 ̆ 7 communication practices of talking about male “homosexuals,” they project their sense of male sexuality on them. Thus, they express the gut-level discomfort that gay people may aggressively and sexually attack them. These analyses suggest a deeper examination of a gut-level discomfort with “homosexuals” as a communicationally cultivated feeling as opposed to an innate one. This study concludes with a summary of findings about communication generally and Japanese cultural communication practices specifically. It will also expand Goffman 2 ̆ 7 s framework of stigma, further develop the framework by discussing three additional categories, discuss the indiscernible power of heterosexual people, point out our communicative (in) actions that stigmatize, marginalize, and dehumanize homosexuals, and make suggestions for minimizing such negative effects. ...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examines}} the emergence {{and expansion of}} Legato, the Turkish collegiate lgbt network, {{from the perspective of}} the globalization of digital technologies and <b>lgbt</b> <b>identities.</b> The triple perspectives of globalization studies, research on lgbt youths 2 ̆ 7 use of digital technologies, and the critique of technology research in humanities calls attention to the need for international research on the use of digital technologies and the contextualization of such use through qualitative methods. Responding to this scholarly exigency, this project looks at Legato members 2 ̆ 7 and groups 2 ̆ 7 use of digital technologies, such as websites, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), and chat rooms, through the qualitative method of interview-based case studies. The overarching goal of this project is to explore and describe the effects of the use of digital technologies and the Internet in Turkey as it relates to this specific lgbt group. In illustrating the effects of Legato 2 ̆ 7 s use of digital technologies, this study analyzes the computer access and access to Legato of eleven participants living in Istanbul. The analysis shows that a variety of factors (economic class; family, relatives, and friends; instruction in computing; knowledge of English; multiple locations of access; and various motivations for computer use) affect the participants 2 ̆ 7 computer access. It also reveals that the traditional media 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of <b>lgbt</b> <b>identities</b> as part of local and foreign television programming led the participants to use the Internet to find community. In addition to the connection between traditional and new media, the participants 2 ̆ 7 use of the Internet has also been influenced by the leading Turkish lgbt organizations in various ways during Legato 2 ̆ 7 s two phases: its pre-Internet beginnings between 1996 - 1999; and its transition and expansion through the Internet between 1999 - 2002. In exploring and accounting for these influences, this study specifically refers to three lesbigay Internet-mediated student groups: Daughters of Sappho, Gay Ankara, and the Legato Technical List. The recurring challenge of Internet-mediated organizing across these groups demonstrates that with each new group of Legato members, the process of the 2 ̆ 2 localization 2 ̆ 2 of <b>lgbt</b> <b>identities</b> and communities involves an ongoing experimentation with the uses of digital technologies to effect social change in 2 ̆ 2 real life. 2 ̆ 2...|$|R
