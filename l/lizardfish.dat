5|$|A {{sedentary}} ambush predator, the Pacific angelshark feeds {{mainly on}} bony fishes, including kelp bass, croakers, flatfishes, damselfishes, mackerels, and sardines. During {{the winter and}} early spring, spawning squid are abundant and become {{the primary source of}} food. In the southern Gulf of California, the most important prey species are, in descending order, the mackerel Decapterus macrosoma, the toadfish Porichthys analis, the <b>lizardfish</b> Synodus evermann, the soldierfish Myripristis leiognathus, and the shrimp Sicyonia penicillata. At Catalina Island, this species feeds mainly on the blacksmith (Chromis punctipinnis) and the queenfish (Seriphus politus). Adults and juveniles have similar diets.|$|E

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black <b>lizardfish</b> (Bathysauropsis gracilis).

5|$|Spinner sharks feed {{primarily}} on small bony fish, including tenpounders, sardines, herring, anchovies, sea catfish, <b>lizardfish,</b> mullets, bluefish, tunas, bonito, croakers, jacks, mojarras, and tongue-soles. They {{have also been}} known to eat stingrays, cuttlefish, squid, and octopus. Groups of spinner sharks are often found pursuing schools of prey at high speed. Individual prey are seized and swallowed whole, as this shark lacks cutting dentition. This species employs an unusual tactic when feeding on schools of small fish; the shark charges vertically through the school, spinning on its axis with its mouth open and snapping all around it. The shark's momentum {{at the end of}} these spiraling runs often carries it into the air, giving it its common name. The blacktip shark also performs this behavior, though not as often. Off Madagascar, spinner sharks follow migrating schools of mackerel, tunas, and jacks. Like blacktip sharks, they congregate around shrimp trawlers to feed on the discarded bycatch, and may be incited into feeding frenzies.|$|E

25|$|Many {{fish that}} exhibit biofluorescence, such as sharks, <b>lizardfish,</b> scorpionfish, wrasses, and flatfishes, also possess yellow intraocular filters. Yellow intraocular filters in the lenses and cornea of certain fishes {{function}} as long-pass filters, thus enabling {{the species that}} possess them to visualize and potentially exploit fluorescence to enhance visual contrast and patterns that are unseen to other fishes and predators that lack this visual specialization. Fishes that possess the necessary yellow intraocular filters for visualizing biofluorescence potentially exploit a light signal from members of it or a similar functional role. Biofluorescent patterning was especially prominent in cryptically patterned fishes possessing complex camouflage, and {{that many of these}} lineages also possess yellow long-pass intraocular filters that could enable visualization of such patterns.|$|E
2500|$|Sand divers have an {{elongated}} body and can grow to {{a length of}} up to [...] The dorsal (upper) surface is dappled brownish-gray {{and there is a}} black patch on the shoulder girdle at {{the upper end of the}} gill slits. There are about eight pairs of reddish-brown bars on the top and sides of the body, broadest at the lateral line and narrowing towards the belly. There are also slender yellowish-gold longitudinal lines running along the body. The ventral (under) surface of the fish is pale. The tip of the lower jaw is rounded, without a fleshy knob, and the soft rays of the dorsal fin are relatively short, the tip of the front one lying on top of the origin of the hind one when depressed. These characteristics helps to distinguish this species from the offshore <b>lizardfish</b> (Synodus poeyi). The anal fin of the sand diver has ten to twelve soft rays which distinguishes it from the otherwise similar diamond <b>lizardfish</b> (Synodus synodus) which has eight to ten. Another fish with which it might be confused is the Atlantic <b>lizardfish</b> (Synodus saurus), but that species is uncommon in the Caribbean and has slender blue or turquoise longitudinal lines.|$|E

The population dynamics of the four <b>lizardfishes</b> was also discussed by the comparison with the previous studies. All being composed of 7 a classes; the dominant group of T. myops and S. tumbil was 1 - 2 a, while S. undosquamis and S. elongate were 2 - 3 a. The total mortality coefficient Z and the fishing mortality F were at high {{as indicated by the}} exploitation ratio E(> 0. 5), and a large number of by-caught juvenile and young fishes showing that the stock of <b>lizardfishes</b> in this area was overexploited and the fishing gear was irrational. Compared with the previous studies, the maximum and mean fork length, body mass and age of the four <b>lizardfishes</b> declined gradually, the <b>lizardfishes</b> populations were younger in age and smaller in size. The asymptotic fork length L-infinity decreased while increasing growth coefficient k, and age at the inflexion point of mass t(r) was younger compared with the previous studies. The declining of older ones has moderated the feeding competition and the younger ones grew faster. The larger mortality parameters Z, M and F have revealed higher fishing pressure. The smaller change of the first mature fork length of female T. myops and the change from K selection pattern to r selection pattern of S. tumbil have indicated a more vulnerable fishery ecosystem in this area. The changes of ecological characteristics and population dynamics may be caused by over-exploitation of demersal fishes such as the <b>lizardfishes,</b> especially a large number of juvenile and young fishes by-catch by the current fishing gears and methods. Therefore, in addition to the traditional fishery management approach such as the minimum length-limit, ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAF) should be taken to improve the practical marine ecosystem management, including increased fishing intensity of the non-economic species especially the feeding competitors of the <b>lizardfishes</b> and the conservation of the pelagic fishery population in the fisheries ecosystem, in order to restore the fishery population and achieve the sustainable use of the fishery stocks...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the results of {{selective}} fishing on demersal fishes in the East China and Yellow Seas, the effectiveness of effort was calculated from the catch and effort statistics by species and boat sizes.

In 1977, the material for subsidiary articles of diet (flatfishes, korai prawn, cuttlefishes and yellow sea bream) had a high value in the effectiveness of effort.
