40|$|The {{heterogeneity}} of precipitation rates in high mountain regions is not sufficiently captured by {{state of the}} art climate reanalysis products due to their limited spatial resolution. Thus there exists a large gap between the available data sets and the demands of climate impact studies. The presented approach aims to generate spatially high resolution precipitation fields for a target area in Central Asia, covering the Tibetan Plateau, the adjacent mountain ranges and lowlands. Based on the assumption, that observed <b>local</b> scale <b>precipitation</b> amounts are triggered by varying large scale atmospheric situations and modified by local scale topographic characteristics, the statistical downscaling approach estimates <b>local</b> scale <b>precipitation</b> rates as a function of large scale atmospheric conditions, derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and high resolution terrain parameters. Since the relationships of the predictor variables with local scale observations are rather unknown and highly non-linear, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was utilized for the development of adequate transfer functions. Different ANN-architectures were evaluated with regard to their predictive performance. The final downscaling model was used for the cellwise estimation of monthly precipitation sums, the number of rainy days and the maximum daily precipitation amount with a spatial resolution of 1 km 2. The model was found to sufficiently capture the temporal and spatial variations of precipitation rates in the highly structured target area and allows a detailed analysis of the precipitation distribution.

40|$|The Ischia {{hydrothermal}} {{system was}} analyzed through hydrogeological and microbial community investigations. Mesophilic communities were detected in two cold springs, suggesting a negligible influence of thermal circuits in freshwater sub-systems which are mainly or only fed by <b>local</b> <b>precipitations.</b> Thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria were detected in two wells, according to higher water temperatures (61 °C and 85 °C), {{even if the}} two communities show significant differences. In one well, thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria are associated with strains belonging to ε-Proteobacteria isolated in different sulphur-rich carbonate environments. This association suggests a greater influence of ascending hot fluids that interact with the carbonate basement of volcanic rocks. In the other well, thermophilic and extremely thermophilic bacteria are in association with strains isolated in cold hypersaline environments or in aquatic habitats where terrestrial and marine components are coupled. This association supports that seawater intrusion can affect this part of Ischia, according to results of hydrogeological and geochemical surveys. Differences in groundwater temperature and bacterial communities are probably mainly {{due to differences in}} permeability between volcanic rocks and differences in hydrogeologic behaviour between faults in the upper carbonate basement, above the deep magma chamber, that influence relationships between ascending hot fluids and local recharge. This study contributes to discussion of the reliability of the actual behaviour models of the Ischia system, {{based on the results of}} geochemical and isotopic investigations, and, in a wider context, it shows that microbial community investigations may be a valuable supplementary tool for analyzing hydrothermal system behaviour...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study reports an {{assessment}} of the water budget of the Crau aquifer (Southern France), which is poorly referenced in the literature. Anthropogenically controlled by a traditional irrigation practice, this alluvial type aquifer requires a robust quantification of the groundwater mass balance in order to establish sustainable water management in the region. In view of the high isotopic contrast between exogenous irrigation waters and <b>local</b> <b>precipitations,</b> stable isotopes of water can be used as conservative tracers to deduce their contributions to the surface recharge. Extensive groundwater sampling was performed to obtain delta 18 O and delta 2 H over the whole aquifer. Based on a new piezometric contour map, combined with an updated aquifer geometry, the isotopic data were implemented in a geostatistical approach to produce a conceptual equivalent homogeneous reservoir. This makes it possible to implement a parsimonious water and isotope mass-balance mixing model. The isotopic compositions of the two end-members were assessed, and the quantification of groundwater flows was then used to calculate the two recharge fluxes (natural and irrigation). Nearly at steady-state, the set of isotopic data treated by geostatistics gave a recharge by irrigation of 4. 92 +/- 0. 89 m(3) s(- 1), i. e. 1109 +/- 202 mm yr(- 1), and a natural recharge of 2. 19 +/- 0. 85 m(3) s(- 1), i. e. 128 +/- 50 mm yr(- 1). Thus, 69 +/- 9 % of the surface recharge is caused by irrigation return flow. This study constitutes a straightforward and independent approach to assess groundwater surface recharges including uncertainties and will help to constrain future transient groundwater models of the Crau aquifer...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of aggregation of various sources of fundamental information {{into a single}} price is a central question in asset pricing. In this paper I investigate how information about local supply shocks in the globally distributed production of commodities is incorporated into the prices of future contracts traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. I take advantage of three facts: first, the global production of soybeans is heavily concentrated in the US and Latin America. Second, the market shares of these dominant regions have varied over {{the last fifteen years}} as Latin America’s output has surpassed that from the US. Third, <b>local</b> daily rain <b>precipitation</b> is a source of exogenous local supply shocks because it tends to increase output. I exploit these facts and estimate the sensitivity of CME soybean futures prices to <b>local</b> rain <b>precipitation,</b> in the US Midwest and Argentina, for the periods 1996 / 7 - 2002 / 3 and 2003 / 4 - 2010. I find economically significant negative rain impact on prices. I also find that, across periods and regions, the magnitude of local rain impact on the CME price has a strong linear relationship with the share of global output produced locally, with correlation in excess of 93 %. This suggests that the CME price reflects a globally integrated market for soybeans, in which distributed supply shocks are aggregated linearly. ...|$|R

Meanwhile, the weak correlation between <b>local</b> temperature and <b>precipitation</b> suggests that the temperature-induced enhancement of the local water cycle cannot fully explain the wetting trend either. This may indicate the presence of nonlinear processes between <b>local</b> temperature and <b>precipitation.</b> We hypothesize that the current warming may enhance the emissions of the biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) that can increase the secondary organic aerosols (SOA), contributing to the precipitation increase. The wetting trend can increase the vegetation cover and cause a positive feedback on the BVOC emissions. Our simulations indicate a significant contribution of increased BVOC emissions to the regional organic aerosol mass and the simulated increase in BVOC emissions is significantly correlated with the wetting trend in TP...|$|R

40|$|A set {{of glass}} {{samples from the}} sunken Roman ship Julia Felix, off the town of Grado (Gorizia, Italy) around {{the second half of}} the 2 nd century AD has been studied along with other glass samples from almost coeval levels of archaeological {{excavations}} in the cities of Vicenza (northern Italy) and Pozzuoli (Naples, southern Italy) and in the town of Grado (7 th– 9 th century AD). The glass samples are fairly homogeneous in their chemical composition with typical silicic–sodic–calcic compositions. Superficial lamellar layers of various thickness (from about 200 μm to less than thousand μm) were formed by the glass–water alteration process. The oxygen isotopic composition of the alteration patinae was measured along with that of the apparently unaltered internal section of glass. The oxygen isotopic composition of the Northern Adriatic seawater is known from previous studies along with the mean oxygen isotopic composition of <b>local</b> <b>precipitations</b> at Vicenza, Pozzuoli and Grado. The mean annual temperatures at the sea bottom are also known from previous studies. The knowledge of the age of the ship and of these variables allows the calculation of the diffusion rate of water molecules through the glass and the glass/water fractionation factor at low temperature. The calculated α-values for the ship glasses are very close to one another and consistent among different samples. One of the glass samples from archaeological excavations (Grado) shows an α-value smaller than those calculated for the ship samples. This suggests partial isotope exchange probably related to the reduced exchange time with water (~ 50 %) and, perhaps, to the small amount of water available to this sample. From the results obtained, it is possible to conclude that glass– water oxygen isotope exchange occurs even at relatively low temperatures, isotopic equilibrium being reached in less than 1. 8 ka when large amounts of water are available...|$|R

This study examines the plausibility of a Madison Aquifer origin for groundwater in northeastern Nebraska. Dakota Aquifer water samples were collected for major ion chemistry and isotopic analysis (18 O, 2 H, 3 H, 14 C, 13 C, 34 S, 18 O-SO 4, 87 Sr, 37 Cl). Results show that groundwater beneath the eastern, un¬confined portion {{of the study area}} is distinctly different from groundwater sampled beneath the western, con¬fined portion. In the east, groundwater is calcium-bicarbonate type, with δ 18 O values (− 9. 6 ‰ to − 12. 4 ‰) simi¬lar to <b>local,</b> modern <b>precipitation</b> (− 7. 4 ‰ to − 10 ‰), and tritium values reflecting modern recharge. In the west, groundwater is calcium-sulfate type, having depleted δ 18 O values (− 16 ‰ to − 18 ‰) relative to <b>local,</b> modern <b>precipitation,</b> and 14 C ages 32, 000 to more than 47, 000 years before present. Sulfate, δ 18 O, δ 2 H, δ 34 S, and δ 18 O-SO 4 concentrations are similar to those found in Madison Aquifer groundwater in South Dakota. Thus, it is pro¬posed that Madison Aquifer source water is also present within the Dakota Aquifer beneath northeastern Ne¬braska. A simple Darcy equation estimate of groundwater velocities and travel times using reported physical parameters from the Madison and Dakota Aquifers suggests such a migration is plausible. However, discrep¬ancies between 14 C and Darcy age estimates indicate that 14 C ages may not accurately reflect aquifer residence time, due to mixtures of varying aged water...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{examines}} the failure mechanisms of TBC-coated systems during cyclic temperature exposure without additional mechanical load in the temperature range between 900 °C and 1050 °C. If failure appeared until an testing duration of 5000 h in the temperature range between 900 °C and 950 °C, it {{was driven by}} {{the formation of a}} brittle chromium-carbide layer in the interdiffusion zone between the substrate and the MCrAlY bond coating. It can be distinguished between two cases. At a low activity of chrome in the MCrAlY, the carbon from the substrate can diffuse into the bond coating and leads there to <b>local</b> <b>precipitations</b> of chromium-carbide, that doesn't exert, however, any effect on the bonding of the MCrAlY. If the activity of chrome in the bond coating is however high, the formation of a closed chromium-carbide layer caused cracks and subsequent spallation during temperature changes. It could be shown that specifically the elements rhenium and aluminum contribute to a significant increase of the chrome activity. If spallation of the TBC occurred in the temperature range between 1000 °C to 1050 °C, it was correlated with the oxidation of the bond coating. A flawless a-Al 2 O 3 oxide layer doesn't necessarily need to contribute to increased lifetimes. Since cracks have their origin generally at defects, the crack propagation takes place along the border between the bond coating and the oxide layer for components with a pure oxide layer and a smooth MCrAlY-surface. Considering a rough bond coating surface, a crack will be initiated along the border between oxide and TBC. In a defect containing oxide layer, however, cracks that develop within the oxide can be stopped at flaws. Consequently, an optimal bond coating seems to be one that develops an existing optimal surface roughness and trains a defect containing oxide layer with a slow growth rate...|$|R
