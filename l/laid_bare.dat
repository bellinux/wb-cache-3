By the start of 1970, however, the Israeli Air Force had established complete aerial superiority over the front lines along the Suez Canal, and the launching of Operation Priha in January <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> Egypt's inability to counter Israeli supremacy not only along the canal but in the Egyptian heartland as well.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding electoral defeat, Callaghan {{stayed on}} as Labour leader until 15 October 1980, {{shortly after the}} party conference had voted for {{a new system of}} {{election}} by electoral college involving the individual members and trade unions.

After a campaign that <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> the deep internal divisions of the parliamentary Labour Party, Michael Foot narrowly defeated Denis Healey on 10 November {{in the second round of}} the election to succeed Callaghan as party leader. Foot had been a relatively late entrant to the contest and his decision to stand ended the chances of Peter Shore.|$|E
25|$|Public {{opinion in}} favour of a strong and united India {{received}} a boost following {{the disintegration of the}} Soviet Union. The rapidity with which economic and political structures became dysfunctional in breakaway Republics of the Soviet Union alerted Indians to the hazards of secession. The shaping of Indian development along traditional societal values was prompted by the persistence of economic turmoil in Western countries which <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> intellectual fault-lines of uncontrolled capitalism and the destructive nature of unrestricted consumerism. The credibility of Western nations as guardians of democracy and human rights nose-dived following revelations of torture and prisoner abuse in Iraq, Afghanistan and black sites.|$|E

25|$|The charcoal—which {{gave the}} forest its name and {{into which the}} once seeming inexhaustible woods were slowly converted—was {{required}} to fuel the scattered smelting furnaces that forged the plentiful iron found in outcroppings <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> by riverside erosion.

In the High Middle Ages further woodlands were cleared. Today the most significant remnant of the Silva Carbonaria is the Sonian Forest, preserved {{because it had been}} set aside as a noble hunt. At the start of the nineteenth century the area of this remnant of the primeval forest still covered about 100 square kilometres, but due to timber cutting its area has diminished to its current protected area of 44.21 km².|$|E
25|$|There was a {{sustained}} {{increase of the}} U.S. unemployment rate during {{the early part of}} the administration, as multi-year economic stimulus efforts continued. The unemployment rate reached a peak in October 2009 at 10.1%. However, the economy added non-farm jobs for a record 75 straight months between October 2010 and December 2016, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.7% in December 2016. The recovery from the Great Recession was marked by a lower labor force participation rate, with economists attributing the lower participation rate partially to an aging population and people staying in school longer. The recovery also <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> the growing income inequality in the United States, which the Obama administration highlighted as a major problem. The federal minimum wage increased during Obama's presidency to $7.25 per hour; in his second term, Obama advocated for another increase to $12 per hour.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{concerns}} over the club's money issues lingered and led Dave King to suggest fans withhold season ticket money until they receive assurances from the board. This caused a war of words between King and the board with Wallace criticising the boycott call suggesting it could be damaging to the club however, a coalition of Rangers fans groups known as the Union of Fans, supported King's stance on withholding season ticket money. King and the supporters groups were planning to meet in order to formalise legal structures for trusts into which fans could put future season ticket money. This caused the Rangers board to demand that King attend a board meeting where he would explain his recent comments and the following day the club revealed it was considering an alternative loan offer on better terms than Laxey Partners from businessman George Letham. King agreed to this meeting and during a spell in Scotland in mid March, he met with several institutional investors including Laxey Partners, {{as well as the}} Union of Fans and the Plc board. The outcome from the Union of Fans meeting was an agreement for the pooling of season ticket renewal money in a trust fund which would only released to the club when the group was granted security over Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park, however, upon meeting with the board King was informed the club had no intention of using Ibrox or Murray Park for securities on any borrowing. Upon the conclusion of the board meeting, there was an act of good faith on King's part, in which he agreed to a four-week grace period to allow the club to complete and publish a business review of the company, after which King would decide upon continuing with any further action. Whilst agreeing to the grace period, the Union of Fans did decided to press ahead with plans to create a season ticket trust fund. Towards the end of March, the club accepted the loan offer from Letham on the same day as King pledged to invest up £50m of own money in the club. However, the reality of Rangers financial predicament was <b>laid</b> <b>bare</b> just two days later by the publishing of the interim accounts, which reported losses of £3.5m in the six months to 31 December and showed cash reserves had fallen from £21.2m to £3.5m.|$|E
25|$|Tatami are {{the basis}} of {{traditional}} Japanese architecture, regulating a building's size and dimensions. They originated in ancient Japan when straw was <b>laid</b> on <b>bare</b> earth as a softener and warmer. In the Heian Period (794–1185), this idea developed into moveable mats that could be laid anywhere {{in the house to}} sit or sleep on before becoming a permanent floor covering in the fifteenth century. Tatami are suitable for the Japanese climate because they let air circulate around the floor.|$|R

Davis returned to the line-up for only his third league start since October, and made a noticeable difference, [...] "restor Arsenal's confidence" [...] and gave their attack [...] "imagination."

50|$|Northern {{cassowary}} (Casuarius unappendiculatus), {{known locally}} as a muruk, lives in this village.

Eggs are <b>laid</b> on <b>bare</b> ground. Cassowaries are valued by villagers for their meat and feathers. Though wild individuals are wary and avoid man, captive birds are pugnacious and should be avoided for their sometimes lethal kick. This specimen is allowed to range in the forest and scrub near the village, and is fed mainly by the village people.|$|R
