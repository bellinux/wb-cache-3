Who shows up in Chinatown? None other than the Evil Queen, who claims “Regina never should have let me out to play.” And {{this is a war}} now. You thought the Big Bad for season 6 was Hyde? Try Dark Regina instead. And yes, I’m into it. Lana Parrilla {{is one of the best}} things about this show, and I’ll take {{anything}} that gives her a chance to flex her acting chops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Disliked by Bengalis for his {{criticism}} of the Bengali revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose during the 1938 Tripuri Congress session, Rajagopalachari's appointment was unsuccessfully opposed by Bose's brother Sarat Chandra Bose. During his tenure as governor, Rajagopalachari's priorities were to deal with refugees and to bring {{peace and stability in}} the aftermath of the Calcutta riots. He declared his commitment to neutrality and justice at a meeting of Muslim businessmen: [...] "Whatever may be my defects or lapses, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>assure</b> you that I shall never disfigure my life with any deliberate acts of injustice to any community whatsoever." [...] Rajagopalachari was also strongly opposed to proposals to include areas from Bihar and Odisha as part of the province of West Bengal. One such proposal by the editor of an important newspaper led to the reply: ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Let</b> <b>me</b> first <b>assure</b> my {{audience}} that I have no arrière pensée {{in the title}} chosen for this lecture. I might, indeed, have meant, {{and it would have}} been only too like me to mean, any number of things by such a title;--but, to-night, I mean simply what I have said, and propose to bring to your notice a series of cloud phenomena, which, so far as I can weigh existing evidence, are peculiar to our own times; yet which have not hitherto received any special notice or description from meteorologists.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said his}} wife, with great concern, [...] "that {{is just what}} I have been {{dreading}} the whole time. When she consulted Dr. ----, how strongly he forbade her to use any kind of exertion. Why would you not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> come?

But there is just one {{difficulty}} about this searching business: How can you identify your notes? If I, for instance, were to insist that I had brought with me two thousand pounds in banknotes in my pocket--which, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> hasten to <b>assure</b> you, I didn't--how could you deny it?" ...|$|R

Without entering into particulars which may be mercifully dismissed from notice, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> only <b>assure</b> you that I answer for Sydney Westerfield as being worthy of the fatherly interest which you feel in her.

I don't doubt that I am free already to do this; but it will encourage the poor girl, if I can speak with your authority." ...|$|R
6000|$|I have delayed {{writing to}} you until now, hoping I {{might have been able}} to tell you of our {{dramatic}} plans, and of the day on which we purpose playing. But as these matters are still in abeyance, I will give you that precious information when I come into the receipt of it myself. And <b>let</b> <b>me</b> heartily <b>assure</b> you, that I had at least as much pleasure in seeing you the other day as you can possibly have had in seeing me; and that I shall consider all opportunities of becoming better known to you among the most fortunate and desirable occasions of my life.

"I've been thinking," [...] said I, as she {{sat down}} on a stool beside me, [...] "that before {{beginning}} my story, it would be well that you should unburden your dear little heart of that family secret of yours which you thought at first was a sufficient bar to our union. But before you begin, <b>let</b> <b>me</b> solemnly <b>assure</b> you that your revelations, whatever they are, will utterly fail to move me. Though you should declare yourself to be the daughter of a thief, a costermonger, or a chimpanzee monkey-- though you should profess yourself to have been a charwoman, a foundling, a Billingsgate fish-woman, or a female mountebank--my feelings and resolves will remain the same.

"Hearing that Mr. Armadale still {{remained}} in the sitting-room, I went into the steward's office (which, as you may remember, is {{on the same side}} of the house), and left the door ajar, and set the window open, waiting and listening for anything that might happen. Dear madam, there was a time when I might have thought such a position in the house of my employer not a very becoming one. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> hasten to <b>assure</b> you that this is far from being my feeling now.

40|$|I {{must begin}} by expressing {{appreciation}} for the spirit in which Ted accepted my comments as intended to be intellectually and not personally provocative. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> also <b>assure</b> him that I {{was not at all}} offended by the paper – it would be more accurate to say that I was stimulated by it to voice some strong disagreements. Beyond the particular aspects on which we have different perspectives, I applaud his decision to raise ethical issues, too often ignored in writing about mathematics education. I have little to add to my original response. In relation to the accreditation of mathematical discoveries, there are two points. One is that, even if the historical record is unclear, it is still possible to acknowledge what is partially known, or even speculation. For example, Hacking (1975, p. 8) commented that "it is reasonable to guess … that a good deal of Indian probability lore is at present unknown to us". The second is to ask the question – to what extent is the information unavailable, or not widely known, because it has been suppressed? I referred, in my initial response, to a paper by Almeida and Joseph on the development of calculus in Kerala. In this paper they argue that: This inclination for ignoring advances in and priority of discovery by non-Europea...|$|R
