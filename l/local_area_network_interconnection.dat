There is a team of collaborative software agents that are deployed to capture a hostile intruder (e. g., a virus).

We propose different strategies for {{the solution of the}} problem in some widely used topologies for the <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> and <b>interconnection</b> network: hypercube <b>network,</b> butterfly network and chordal ring network. In each topology, different models are studied depending on the capabilities of agents; i. e., agents' synchronicity, cloning power and visibility.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{architecture}} {{design for a}} tool suitable for emulating DA-TDMA (demand-assignment-time division multiple access) satellite access schemes. The tool presented, named FRACAS 1, is particularly suitable for comparing the performance of different satellite channel allocation policies. Using FRACAS, a service provider can choose from different policies for sharing a satellite channel {{among a number of}} users. Some allocation policies, selected from those available in the literature, are built-in, while others can be designed from scratch and added without much effort. The parameters of the built-in allocation policies can easily be changed in order to exploit the full potential of the allocation schemes. FRACAS’s features permit the optimisation of satellite resource usage in accordance with the traffic pattern supported. FRACAS enables research teams and students to explore and compare different multiple access schemes, and to develop simulation runs for various kinds of service-induced traffic, including aggregate traffic, which is typical in a <b>local</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (LAN) <b>interconnection</b> environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> {{are widely}} {{accepted}} and establish on the market. In order to search additional capabilities {{it is desirable}} the interconnection of the existing LANs, which {{can be done by}} a backbone network that spans distances of a broad site, like a university campus or an industrial site with multiple buildings. High Speed <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (i. e. FDDI) are suitable for backbone applications. The high cost of HSLAN connections and the existing equipment, will mean that most users will be connected to dominant LANs, Ethernet and Token Ring. However, some users will need to be directly connected to the backbone because they will require high bandwidth and low packets delay for their graphics or imaged-based applications. It will be presented a high performance data communications switch able to act as a HSLAN, in the way that it can offer high bandwidth and low packets delay for high demanding applications. The data communication switch is a modular system, developed with conventional technology, that {{takes the form of a}} card cage supporting a number of modules. The modules communicate by means of a wide band parallel back plane bus. Each module deals with the distributed management of the parallel bus, namely the assignment of the access rights, and with the dialog with the outside world, by means of specific interfaces (Access Processors). An Access Processor for IEEE 802. 3 or Ethernet technology will be described. This Access Processor is able to connect workstations by 10 M bit / s data channels, in a point-to-point star topology. The IEEE 802. 3 Access Processor was designed with filtering and addressing functions in order to perform IEEE 802. 3 or Ethernet <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>interconnection,</b> without additional communication relays. The interconnection of others LANs or HSLAN s will also be discussed. Particularly, an Access Processor for the FDDI technology will be referred. It will be presented a management architecture, based on the Simple Network Management Protocol, suitable for the referred applications. Finally, it will be presented an evaluation study, by simulation techniques, of the data communication switch. This evaluation study demonstrates that the system presents low packets delay and it is suitable for high demanding applications such as coded video switchingAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) {{can provide}} {{deterministic}} channels as required for real time signals, {{as well as}} statistical multiplexing. For this reason, ATM has been chosen as the underlying technology for providing a Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). Two main classes of services {{are expected to be}} supported over a B-ISDN. These classes are real-time services and data services. Data services include computer communications (<b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (LAN) <b>interconnections)</b> and general non-real time traffic, such as file transfer and small transactions. The provision of data services over ATM are better served with statistical multiplexing, provided that the service is loss-free. For multiplexing to be loss-free and still statistical, while the maximum service rate is fixed, the multiplexer tributaries must be controlled in flow, to assure no overflow of the multiplexing buffer. Provision of a service over ATM is accomplished by an ATM layer. Transfer Capability (ATC). This thesis investigates and reports on the operating characteristics of an ATM layer Transfer Capability proposed to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and called Controlled Cell Transfer (CCT). CCT uses credit window based flow control on links and a quota based control in switches, and will give loss free statistical multiplexing for data. Other ITU defined ATCs are examined in regard to data service provision and compared with CCT. It is found that only CCT can provide a fast {{and at the same time}} efficient data service. The thesis also examines the impact that support of the CCT capability would have on an ATM switch, through determination of required functionality, and mapping of the required functions into a switch design. Finally, an architecture and implementation of an ATM switch is described that would support the CCT as well as the Deterministic Bit Rate (DBR) ++transfer capability, and would provide efficient data and real-time services...|$|R

The Wireless <b>Local</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Networks</b> (WLANs) {{are often}} used as a {{wireless}} extension to the typical office network infrastructure providing mobility to the users.
