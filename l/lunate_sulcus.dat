50|$|The <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> lies {{further back}} of human brains {{but has a}} more frontal {{location}} in chimpanzees. The evolutionary expansion of the frontal areas of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> would have caused {{a shift in the}} particular location of the fissure. It has been hypothesized that evolutionary pressures resulted in the human brain undergoing internal reorganization to develop the capability of human language. Furthermore, this reorganization must have been implemented during early maturity and is likely responsible for eidetic imagery in some adolescents.|$|E

5000|$|... (Original description) The large, solid {{shell is}} chalky, with a rather thick olivaceous periostracum, and about seven whorls. The apex is eroded. The spire is {{much longer than}} the aperture. It has a subfusiform shape, with whorls appressed at and {{constricted}} {{in front of the}} suture. The constriction corresponds to the anal fasciole behind which the margin of the whorl has the aspect of a thickened band. The axial sculpture, beside incremental lines, consists of twelve low, rounded, strong, slightly protractive ribs with subequal interspaces, strongest {{just in front of the}} fasciole, and, on the body whorl becoming obsolete on the base. The spiral sculpture consists of numerous obsolete rather close spiral threads, irregularly disposed, stronger and much more distant on the base, but always obscure. The aperture is narrowly <b>lunate,</b> the anal <b>sulcus</b> conspicuous but shallow. The outer lip is simple. The body shows a moderately thick, smooth callus extended onto the short, straight columella, which is obliquely attenuated in front, with a wide, short, shallow siphonal canal.|$|R
50|$|Holloway's {{work on the}} Taung Child was one of {{the first}} to suggest brain {{reorganization}} occurring before the increase of brain size in hominids. His claim that the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> a sulcus which marks the boundary of the occipital lobe, was in a posterior position to that of apes suggests that the reduction of the occipital lobe was accompanied by enlargements of parts of the brain associated with higher cognitive function.|$|E
50|$|In the {{occipital}} lobe, {{the lateral}} occipital sulcus, where present, divides the lateral, or middle occipital gyrus into a superior and an inferior part, {{which are then}} continuous in front with the parietal and temporal lobes.

50|$|Paleoneurobiologists Ralph L. Holloway and Dean Falk {{disagree}} about {{the interpretation of}} a depression on the Australopithecus afarensis AL 162-28 endocast. Holloway argues that the depression {{is a result of}} lipping at the lambdoid suture and that the sulcal patterns indicate cerebral organization moving toward a more human pattern, while Falk insists that the depression is the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> in a position that is indicative of an ape-like sulcal pattern. The debate between these two scientists is not hinged solely on the AL 162-28 endocast, but rather extends to all australopithecine fossils, with Holloway insisting on the presence of hominid sulcal features, and Falk maintaining that the features are pongid in nature. The debate between Holloway and Falk is so intense that between 1983 and 1985, they published four papers on the identification of the medial end of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> of the Taung endocast (Australopithecus africanus), which only further strengthened the division between each scientist's respective opinion. Although there have been no definitive conclusions about the fossils in question, many techniques were created or critically analyzed and refined {{as a result of the}} conflict. These new techniques in endocast analysis included the use of stereoplotting to transfer sulci between differently shaped endocasts, measurement of indexes from photographs rather than directly from specimens, and confounding of measurements taken directly from specimens and those taken from photographs.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the use of}} in vivo Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and tissue sampling, different cortical samples from members of each hominoid species were analyzed. In each species, specific areas were either relatively enlarged or shrunken, which can detail neural organizations. Different sizes in the corticol areas can show specific adaptations, functional specializations and evolutionary events that were changes in how the hominoid brain is organized. In early prediction {{it was thought that}} the frontal lobe, {{a large part of the}} brain that is generally devoted to behavior and social interaction, predicted the differences in behavior between hominoid and humans. Discrediting this theory was evidence supporting that damage to the frontal lobe in both humans and hominoids show atypical social and emotional behavior; thus, this similarity means that the frontal lobe was not very likely to be selected for reorganization. Instead, it is now believed that evolution occurred in other parts of the brain that are strictly associated with certain behaviors. The reorganization that took place is thought to have been more organizational than volumetric; whereas the brain volumes were relatively the same but specific landmark position of surface anatomical features, for example, the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> suggest that the brains had been through a neurological reorganization. There is also evidence that the early hominin lineage also underwent a quiescent period, which supports the idea of neural reorganization. Dental fossil records for early humans and hominins show that immature hominins, including australopithecines and members of Homo, reveal that these species have a quiescent period (Bown et al. 1987). A quiescent period is a period in which there are no dental eruptions of adult teeth; at this time the child becomes more accustomed to social structure, and development of culture. During this time the child is given an extra advantage over other hominoids, devoting several years into developing speech and learning to cooperate within a community. [...] This period is also discussed in relation to encephalization. It was discovered that chimpanzees do not have this neutral dental period and suggest that a quiescent period occurred in very early hominin evolution. Using the models for neurological reorganization it can be suggested the cause for this period, dubbed middle childhood, is most likely for enhanced foraging abilities in varying seasonal environments.

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the lateral surface of the {{occipital}} lobe, presents a big variability in the descriptions of the classical texts of neuroanatomy, {{so much that the}} current International Anatomical Terminology does not include nominations about the morphologic structures of this region, except for the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> the pre-occipital notch and the transverse occipital sulcus. The macroscopic morphology of this region was examined in this study, in 19 right brain hemispheres and 8 left brain hemispheres post-mortem, fixed in formalin fixed, where it is described the presence, shape and orientation of the gyri and sulci, and the interhemispheric differences in on the lateral surface of the occipital lobe, identifying the most characteristic and constant patterns. Occipital sulci: We found a significant constancy of four occipital sulci: 1 -Lunate Sulcus: Frequency: 81, 48 %, located behind the occipital lobe convexity, with a vertical or oblique orientation and arcuate form, usually presenting a concavity directed towards the occipital pole. 2 -Lateral Occipital Sulcus: Frequency: 96, 29 %, located immediately forward to the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> and coincides with its middle part, with a horizontal orientation; this sulcus is presented as a continuation from the temporal lobe, and it is the most constant of all of them. 3 -Transverse Occipital Sulcus: Frequency: 92, 6 %, located at the top superior part of the lateral surface of the occipital lobe, with a horizontal orientation toward the occipital pole, forming a continuation of the intra-parietal sulcus; 4 -Prepolar sulcus: Frequency: 62, 96 %; located behind the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> with a vertical or oblique orientation and arcuate form, is the shortest and less constant of all of them. Occipital Gyri: We have found the presence of four gyri: 1 -Upper Occipital Gyrus: Frequency: 92, 6 %, located above the transverse occipital sulcus, reaching the upper edge of the lateral occipital surface; 2 – Middle Occipital Gyrus: Frequency: 85, 18 %, located between the transverse and lateral occipital sulci, and forward of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> 3 -Inferior Occipital Gyrus: Frequency: 96, 29 %, located below the lateral occipital sulcus, reaching the lower edge of the lateral occipital surface; 4 -Polar Occipital Gyrus: Frequency: 59, 25 %, located behind the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> and surrounding all the Prepolar occipital sulcus.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that changes in the {{relative}} sizes of visual system structures predated an increase in brain size and provide evidence of brain reorganization in hominins. However, data about the volume and anatomical limits of visual brain structures in the extant taxa phylogenetically closest to humans-the apes-remain scarce, thus complicating tests of hypotheses about evolutionary changes. Here, we analyze new volumetric data for the primary visual cortex and the lateral geniculate nucleus {{to determine whether or not}} the human brain departs from allometrically-expected patterns of brain organization. Primary visual cortex volumes were compared to <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> position in apes to investigate whether or not inferences about brain reorganization made from fossil hominin endocasts are reliable in this context. In contrast to previous studies, in which all species were relatively poorly sampled, the current study attempted to evaluate the degree of intraspecific variability by including numerous hominoid individuals (particularly Pan troglodytes and Homo sapiens). In addition, we present and compare volumetric data from three new hominoid species-Pan paniscus, Pongo pygmaeus, and Symphalangus syndactylus. These new data demonstrate that hominoid visual brain structure volumes vary more than previously appreciated. In addition, humans have relatively reduced primary visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus volumes as compared to allometric predictions from other hominoids. These results suggest that inferences about the position of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> on fossil endocasts may provide information about brain organization...|$|E

40|$|Since Dart’s {{analysis}} of the Taung skull in 1925 in Nature, there has been controversy surrounding {{the presence of a}} clearly defined <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> (LS) in the australopithecines, marking the anterior extent of primary visual cortex (PVC). An anterior position signifies that the LS is in an ape-like position, such as found in Pan troglodytes. A posterior position is a more human-like characteristic (autapomorphy). If the latter occurred in Australopithecus, then the cerebral cortex underwent some neurological reorganization prior to brain enlargement, thus occurring earlier than the emergence of the genus Homo. The endocast of the Stw 505 specimen from Sterkfontein, South Africa, shows an unmistakably posterior placement of the LS. The early hominid brain was reorganized at least by the time of Australopithecus africanus, thus vindicating Dart’s early assessment...|$|E
30|$|The {{hypotheses}} (i)–(iv) are, to our mind, justified {{because some}} smaller deformations within the gross {{shape of the}} calcarine sulcus are probably not systematic, and we assume that, on average, their influence is small compared to the curvature effects we investigate in this study. The course of calcarine sulcus varies widely among individuals and the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> which is roughly oriented vertically to it, appears to mark the anterior boundary of V 1 in non-human primates, but it is often missing in humans [60]. Autopsy data suggest that V 1 proceeds farther anteriorly in the lingual gyrus [8, 10], while fMRI data show that the dorsal and ventral compartments of V 1 are at least similar in absolute extent [18]. If V 1 proceeds farther anteriorly in the lingual gyrus, this can be balanced by higher curvature of this gyrus.|$|E
40|$|Over 40 years ago, Hubel and Wiesel gave a {{preliminary}} report of the first account of cells in monkey cerebral cortex selective for binocu-lar disparity.

Disparity-tuned cells resided not only in V- 2, the area now synonymous with area 18, but also in V- 3 and prob-ably within V- 3 A.

40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the receptive-field (RF) center/surround organization of V 1 and V 2 neurons in macaques is immature during the first postnatal 8 weeks (Zhang et al, 2005). To gain insight into such functional immaturity, we examined the development of intrinsic and corticocortical connections {{in some of these}} infant monkeys. In 2 -, 4 - and 16 -week-old infants and adults, we placed pressure injections of the tracers CTB and WGA-HRP along the posterior bank of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus.</b> Following two to four days of transport, each animal was perfused. The brain was artificially flattened, cut, and stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO) or either tracer. CO sections were used to identify the V 1 /V 2 border, stripe types, and blobs within V 1. In some respects connection patterns were relatively mature even after two weeks of postnatal development. At two weeks, thin stripe injections showed strong connections with V 1 blobs, thin stripes and other stripes in V 2. Thick stripe injections did not preferentially label cells associated with blob or interblob regions. The label found within stripes was patchy at two weeks of age, as in older monkeys. V 1 injections in two week old monkeys resulted in patches of labeled cells near the injection site. These connectional features were also observed in older monkeys. Thus, the presence of aspects of ‘adult-like’ connections at two weeks of age suggests that the basic pattern of intrinsic connections is present in V 1 and V 2 near birth. However, the RF surround mechanisms of V 1 and V 2 neurons are very immature at this age and adult-like responses emerge much later (Zhang et al, PNAS, 2005). The RF surround mechanisms of V 2 (and V 1) neurons likely depend more on the developmental elaboration of long-range horizontal connections, and/or the maturation of feedback connections from higher-order visual areas...|$|E
40|$|The macaque {{cortical}} {{visual system}} is hierarchically organized into two streams, the ventral stream for recognizing objects and the dorsal stream for analyzing spatial relationships. The ventral stream extends from striate cortex or area V 1 to inferior temporal cortex (IT) through extra-striate areas V 2 and V 4. Between V 1 and V 2, the ventral stream consists of two roughly parallel sub-streams, one extending from the cytochrome oxidase (CO) rich blobs in V 1 to the CO rich thin stripes in V 2, the other extending from the interblobs in V 1 to interstripes, in V 2. The blob-dominated sub-stream is thought to analyze the surface features such as color, whereas the interblob-dominated one is thought to analyze the contour features such as shape. ^ In the current study, the organization of cortical pathways linking V 2 thin stripe and interstripe compartments with area V 4 was investigated {{using a combination of}} physiological and anatomical techniques. Different compartments of V 2 were first characterized, in vivo, using optical recording of intrinsic cortical signals. These functionally derived maps of V 2 stripe compartments were then used to guide iontophoretic injections of multiple, distinguishable, anterograde tracers into specific V 2 compartments. The distribution of labeled axons was analyzed either in horizontal sections through the prelunate gyrus, or in tangentially sectioned portions of physically unfolded cortex containing the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus,</b> prelunate gyrus and superior temporal sulcus. When a V 2 thin stripe and adjacent interstripe were injected with distinguishable tracers, a large primary and several secondary foci were observed in V 4. The primary focus from the thin stripe injection was spatially segregated from the primary focus from the V 2 interstripe injection, suggesting a retention of the pattern of compartmentation. ^ We examined the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in V 1 following the injections of tracers into V 2 different compartments, in order to quantitate just how parallel the two sub-streams are from V 1 to V 2. Our results suggest that both blobs and interblobs project to thin stripes in V 2, whereas only interblobs project to interstripes. This asymmetrical segregation argues against the original proposal of strict parallelism. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} our {{understanding}} of the functional properties of mammalian sensory cortex has advanced considerably, and it has been possible to correlate some of the physiological findings with certain anatomical features. At present, however, there is little anatomical evidence available concerning the columnar arrangement of cortical cells and the apparently high degree of specificity of connections between them. In an attempt to elucidate certain of these problems, material has been studied from the visual cortex (area 17) of rhesus monkeys. In addition, observations have been made on the commissural connections to the cortex at the boundary of areas 17 and 18 in the cat and monkey and on the association fibre projection from area 18 to area 17 in the cat. Intrinsic connections within area 17 of the monkey Small lesions were placed in the cortex of area 17, either with a needle or fine scalpel (slit lesions) or with a tungsten microelectrode, and the animals were allowed to survive for periods of 1 - 6 days. For light microscopy the occipital lobes were sectioned, in either the coronal or sagittal plane, at 25 Î¼m. Sections were stained by the Nauta-Gygax, Fink-Heimer or Wiitanen method. For electron microscopy, small blocks of tissue of 1 - 2 cu. mm volume were taken and embedded in Epon- Araldite. One Î¼m 'thick' sections, perpendicular to the pial surface, wore cut from the whole blocf face. Areas for thin sections were chosen so that, when maps of several areas were fitted together, they would form an almost complete representation of the whole depth of the cortex extending out from the lesion for 3 mm. With the light microscope, axonal degeneration after lesions through the depth of the cortex is seen to extend for only a few millimetres from the site of the lesion, and in almost all cases this extent is asymmetrical, being 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm further {{on one side of the}} lesion than the other. Except for approximately 200 Î¼m on each side, where there is dense, fine terminal degeneration throughout ail layers, there are distinct differences both in the appearance and the extent of the degeneration in different laminae. In layer I there is a little fine granularity and a few degenerating fibres distributed over a few millimetres from the lesion. Layers II and III resemble each other in showing an even distribution of fine, granular degeneration which is dense for only up to 200 Î¼m on either side, after which it remains more or less uniform for a distance of about 1. 5 mm, when it stops rather suddenly. On its deep aspect this degeneration is continuous with marked horizontal fibre and terminal degeneration in the stria of Gennari in layer IIIc, and the extent of this axonal degeneration is the greatest of all, reaching up to 4 mm away and apparently terminating in layer IIIc and the adjacent parts of layers IIIb and IV. Layer IV shows no degeneration except for a zone of some 200 Î¼m immediately adjacent to the lesion, where there is dense granularity. Layer V shows an appearance similar to that of the stria, except that the fibre and terminal degeneration is coarser in V and extends in any quantity for only 1 mm or so from the lesion, being very sparse thereafter. Layer VI is again similar but shows many more obliquely arranged fibres so that there is no appearance of a horizontal fibre band comparable to those in IIIc and V (bands of Baillarger). The pattern of degeneration after lesions which extend into the underlying white matter differs from the above description only in that there is more fibre degeneration in the deep layers and the terminal degeneration in layer IV is more widespread on the side of the lesion away from the direction from which the thalamocortical fibres approach. The laminar origin of intrinsic axons was determined by lesions which involved only some of the layers of the cortex or which were in the form of discrete microelectrode lesions in individual laminae. Lesions restricted to layers I and II produced only local degeneration which was mainly granular and reached no deeper than the bottom of layer IIIa. Extension of the lesion down to the bottom of layer IIIb produced only a modest increase in the horizontal extent of the degeneration, which now reached to about 1. 5 mm from the lesion. Deep to the lesion, degeneration was seen in layers IIIc, IV and V; however, that in IIIc, in the stria, was only of the same extent and density as in the rest of layer III, while that in layer IV took the form of vertically oriented fibres going down to a patch of granularity in layer V. A few degenerating fibres were seen to leave the cortex. Thus it seems that cells in the supragranular layers give off intrinsic projections only to the immediately adjoining region for a distance of about 1. 5 mm, and there is no evidence that the projection of supragranular cells into the stria of Gennari is anything more than small in amount and rather restricted in extent. Some cells in layer III project to layer V, though this projection does not appear to be particularly dense. Only a few degenerating axons descend into the white matter. When the lesion reached the stria of Gennari there was a sudden increase in both the density and extent of degeneration in that layer, and this degeneration was very similar to that seen after a lesion through the whole depth of the cortex. Involvement of layer IV gave rise to a pattern which was essentially the same as that resulting from lesions of the stria, and even a small focal lesion of layer IV produced fairly dense, extensive degeneration in layer IIIc. These results suggest that much of the stria is made up of the horizontal ramifications of ascending axons, and that many of these fibres arise from granule cells in layer IV; some may arise from cells of layer IIIc itself or may be axon collaterals of cells in layers V and VI. When the lesion reached down to layer V there was an increase in the amount of terminal degeneration in layer IV and in the density and extent oi degeneration in the inner band of Baillarger in layer V. In addition, more degenerating fibres could be seen entering the white matter. Thus the cells of layer V appear to send axonal branches into the inner bane: of Baillarger for about 1 mm; since the apical dendrites of these cells may receive a thalamic input, this projection may be related to the further processing of information by infragranular complex and hypercomplex cells. The cells of layers V and VI also project to the white matter and give rise to ascending collaterals to more superficial layers. The observations with the electron microscope were in good agreement with the light microscope findings; in particular, the rather restricted extent of the degeneration and the variations in density and extent of degeneration between the different laminae were shown. Some clustering of degenerating terminals was apparent, though it was not very marked. It is worthy of note that the terminals which degenerate after an intrinsic lesion of the cortex form only a small proportion of the total number of terminals present. This may seem surprising, but several important considerations apply: the cells projecting horizontally to a given point will be distributed throughout a very restricted region around it, so that a lesion would have to be very close to that point in order to destroy more than a small fraction of all of its horizontal connections. When it is also considered that many connections to a point may travel vertically and that degenerating terminals could be identified with the electron microscope only ii certain criteria were satisfied, the apparently low yield of terminals in our material becomes readily understandable. The majority (some 90 %) of all terminals seen with the electron microscope ended with asymmetrical membrane thickenings (type 1 of Gray); this proportion was even higher in layers I and II (94. 4 % and 97. 3 % respectively), possibly correlated with the relatively high concentration of spine-rich apical dendrites in these layers. The majority (75 %) of the asymmetrical intrinsic terminals ended on dendritic spines, which tended to be small, with an indistinct spine apparatus. Almost all of the remainder ended on dendrites, which were of stellate origin in some cases, though a number could not be identified. No asymmetrical terminals ended on identifiable pyramidal cell dendrites. A few examples were observed of asymmetrical terminals contacting the cell somata of large stellate cells, but no such terminals were seen on the somata of small stellate or pyramidal cells. Intrinsic terminals ending with symmetrical membrane thickenings (Type 2 of Gray) form only about 10 % of the total. Their distribution with respect to the constituent parts of neurones is complementary to that of asymmetrical terminals, as 78 % end on dendrites and only 13 % on spines. Both pyramidal and non-pyramidal type dendrites are contacted. Symmetrical terminals also terminate upon the somata of cells, both pyramidal and large and small stellate; in addition, one example has been seen of a degenerating symmetrical terminal ending on the initial axon segment of a small pyramidal cell in layer II. It is interesting to note that the asymmetrical terminals, though greatly in the majority, were numerous only within the first millimetre from the lesion, falling off in density thereafter, while the symmetrical terminals Were much more evenly spread throughout the distance which they occupied (some 3 mm from the lesion). The results are consistent with the view that information reaching area 17 from the lateral geniculate nucleus and terminating predominantly upon cells in layer IV (and also layer IIIb) is passed out via the stria to cells of layers IIIb, IIIc and the superficial part of layer IV, further processing being performed by the cells of these layers. This concept is consistent with the fact that layer IV contains a high proportion of what have been defined functionally as 'simple' cells, which are monocularly driven, while layers III and V contain a high proportion of 'complex' and 'hypercomplex' cells, which are binocularly activated. It is possible that the longer horizontal connections, whose existence may be inferred from our material, might subserve other integrative functions, such as linking up distant columns with the same preference-for stimulus orientation, for stimulus type or for movement response pattern. So far as the observations with the electron microscope are concerned, our findings would seem to suggest that excitation plays a more important role in the functioning of horizontal intrinsic connections than does inhibition, as judged by the relative numbers of asymmetrical and symmetrical terminals. Commissural connections at the area 17 / 18 boundary in the cat and monkey In the cat, small lesions (a single lesion in area 18) or large lesions (removal of the cortex of areas 17, 18 and 19 on one side) were made. In the monkey, lesions were made by the removal of the cortex of both walls of the <b>lunate</b> <b>sulcus</b> and of the crown of the prelunate gyrus, over most of the extent of the sulcus. For light microscopy, blocks oriented in the coronal plane (cats) or the sagittal plane (monkeys) were taken from the opposite hemisphere and frozen sections of these blocks were stained by reduced silver methods. Small blocks for electron microscopy were taken from immediately alongside the light microscopic material. With the light microscope it was seen that commissural degeneration at the 17 / 18 boundary occupies a very limited zone only some 2 mm in width. In the monkey, area 18 showed degeneration in all layers, but as one approaches area 17 the degeneration in layer IV ceases abruptly at the boundary. A similar situation obtained in the cat: a dense band of degeneration in the deep part of layer III and layer IV was present in area 18 but ceased abruptly at the 17 / 18 boundary. Thus it seems as if layer IV of area 17, especially in the monkey, is really a pure processing mechanism for primary afferent information with negligible input from other laminae or from the opposite side. With the electron microscope, all degenerating terminals were seen to end with asymmetrical thickenings. Approximately 75 % of terminals ended on spines, while the remainder ended on dendrites, some of which were of the stellate type. Connections from area 18 to area 17 in the cat Material for this study was taken from those cat brains which had been subjected to needle lesions in area 18 on the lateral gyrus without involvement of adjoining areas. Blocks of tissue were taken in the coronal plane and processed for light microscopy by the techniques described above. Small blocks for electron microscopy were also taken. With the light microscope, degeneration was found only in the extreme lateral part of area 17; this degeneration took the form of fine granules disposed throughout the deeper layers and reaching up to layer III. Fibre degeneration in layer I did, however, extend to the level of the suprasplenial sulcus. With the electron microscope, all degenerating terminals were seen to be of the asymmetrical type; 62 % ended on dendritic spines, while the remainder ended on dendrites, some of which belonged to stellate cells. Thus the greater part of area 17 of the cat appears to be unaffected by information coming directly from adjacent cortical areas or from the opposite hemisphere, being left 'pure' for the processing of information from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. </p...|$|E
