25|$|In {{contrary}} to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen {{of both countries}} get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, {{it is always a}} wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through <b>land</b> <b>boundary</b> of India and Pakistan (Wagha border) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to present some current issues based on {{experiences}} of Ljubljana SMA branch office in the field of judicial definitions of borders in a cadastral register of cadastral municipalities in the geographic scope of branch office. To acheive detail understanding of the timeline and the content of each particular proceeding we present the legislation concerning non-contentious procedure of managing <b>land</b> <b>boundaries</b> in Slovenia. In the practical part of the thesis we analyze the court expert's reports of judicial definition of <b>land</b> <b>boundaries</b> which were based on the final order of the Surveying and mapping authority, concluded and recorded after the adoption of the Real-Estate Recording Act in 2006. Most analysed proceedings, regarding the judicial definition of boundaries, were recorded in 2011, changes specified in final judicial acts of these procedures were in a cadastral register mostly recorded within five years or less. In the thesis we focus on the most common issues and technical mistakes in the surveyors reports of judicial definition of <b>land</b> <b>boundaries</b> and the cause for their reasons for the request to complete the report, encountered by surveyors at Ljubljana SMA branch office. The main cause for sending an appeal for completion of the reports is incosistency of the contents in the surveyors report and the content of judicial conclusion of the court. We have discussed two reports of judicial definiton of <b>land</b> <b>boundaries</b> which have not met the rules and was subsequently required for an update of reports. ...|$|R
