25|$|A mobile phone, or cell phone, is a long-range, {{electronic}} device used for mobile voice or data communication over {{a network of}} specialized base stations known as cell sites. Early mobile FM radio telephones were in use for many years, but since the number of radio frequencies were very limited in any area, the number of phone calls were also very limited. To solve this problem, there could be many small areas called cells which share the same frequencies. When users moved from one area to another while calling, the call {{would have to be}} switched over automatically without losing the call. In this system, a small number of radio frequencies could accommodate a huge number of calls. The first mobile call was made from a car phone in St. Louis, Missouri on June 17, 1946, but the system was impractical from what is considered a portable handset today. The equipment weighed 80lbs, and the AT service, basically a massive party line, cost $30 per month plus 30 to 40 cents per <b>local</b> <b>call.</b> The basic network and supporting infrastructure of hexagonal cells used to support a mobile telephony system while remaining on the same channel were devised by Douglas H. Ring and W. Rae Young at AT Bell Labs in 1947. Finally in 1973, Martin Cooper invented the first handheld cellular/mobile phone. His first mobile phone call was made to Joel S. Engel in April 1973.|$|E

2500|$|When {{a calling}} party lifted the receiver, the local loop current lit a signal lamp near the jack.

[...] For a <b>local</b> <b>call,</b> the operator inserted the front cord {{of the pair}} (ringing cord) into the called party's local jack and started the ringing cycle. For a long distance call, she plugged into a trunk circuit to connect to another operator in another bank of boards or at a remote central office. In 1918, the average time to complete the connection for a long-distance call was 15 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Hutchison {{formerly}} operated an Australian CDMA network {{under the}} Orange brand name, as Orange One.

Customers also received a [...] "Local Zone [...] " [...] number allowing them to be called on a Landline number whilst at home. Should the phone be out of the Local zone, Calls made to the landline number either diverted to the Mobile number at a small fee, or was directed to Voicemail on the mobile handset. These plans started at a very competitive price of $10.00 per month, and local calls from the local Zone to a local landline was charged at 20c per <b>local</b> <b>call,</b> making their service cheaper than those of Telstra or Optus. The Orange One network was not as vast as others, and so Orange made arrangements with Telstra to allow the services of Orange one devices to roam to the Telstra network On 1 February 2006, it was rebranded as 3 CDMA, and this network was closed as of 9 August 2006. 3 CDMA customers were offered special tariffs and incentives to continue as customers on the 3G network, all customers either moved over to 3's 3G network or to other network providers.|$|E

Calls between users in the same <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> area are <b>local,</b> and we allow the extension of this area to be treated as a strategic variable. We show that the extension of the calling areas which maximises the carrier's profit is the same that a welfare maximising regulator would choose. Under a price cap regime in which prices are required to meet an average price constraint, the firm is shown to manipulate strategically the extension of the <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas. We end the paper by considering the case of a competitive market. In this case, again, the owner of the local loop manipulates the extension of the <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas to increase profits. telecommunications; <b>local</b> <b>calling</b> areas; community of interest; regulation; price cap; access; interconnection. ...|$|R
