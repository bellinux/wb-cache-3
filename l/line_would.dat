5|$|The {{provision}} at Van Wyck Boulevard for {{a future}} <b>line</b> <b>would</b> be completed, and a new two-track <b>line</b> <b>would</b> be built to Rockaway Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running from}} Hunters Point in Queens heading {{southeast}} to Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn. The <b>line</b> <b>would</b> consist of {{between two and}} four tracks, and at Lafayette Avenue, the <b>line</b> <b>would</b> split. Two of them would continue as a Lafayette Avenue, but would then become four tracks. The remaining two tracks would run to Franklin and Flatbush Avenues.|$|E
5|$|A new 4-track {{trunk line}} along Lafayette Avenue in Brooklyn from Borough Hall to Bedford Avenue. The <b>line</b> <b>would</b> narrow to three tracks to Broadway. Then the <b>line</b> <b>would</b> have {{continued}} underneath the BMT Jamaica Line to 168th Street. By running underneath the Jamaica Line, the <b>line</b> <b>would</b> directly {{compete with the}} BMT. A two-track connection would also be provided to a First Avenue line.|$|E

5000|$|BRT {{connections}} with the commuter rail <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be improved by expanding the following existing stations: ...|$|R
5|$|A new IND <b>line</b> <b>would</b> {{run from}} the Lower East Side to Avenue U in Brooklyn. The new <b>line</b> <b>would</b> run via Houston Street and Essex Street in Manhattan, and via Utica Avenue and Flatbush Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{connection}} between the BMT Franklin Avenue Line and the IND Crosstown <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> be built {{through the construction of}} a line under Lafayette Avenue.|$|E
5|$|A crosstown line via Worth Street {{would serve}} as a branch of the IND Eighth Avenue Line's local tracks. The <b>line</b> <b>would</b> have {{branched}} off at Church Street, from where it would run via Worth Street and East Broadway to Lewis Street. This two-tracks segment would have cost $15,200,000. The <b>line</b> <b>would</b> then tunnel under the East River between Lewis Street to Driggs Avenue. This section would have cost $18,500,000. The South Fourth Street junction would be completed.|$|E
50|$|The new BRT <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> make {{additional}} connections {{at other}} commuter rail stops, rapid transit stops, and bus hubs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Lines</b> <b>would</b> be {{made more}} direct with fewer {{transfers}} being made necessary and fewer deviations off the main routes ...|$|R
50|$|Often in pocket calculators the {{multiplexed}} digit drive <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> {{be used to}} {{scan the}} keyboard as well, providing further savings.|$|R
5|$|A {{new line}} running under Utica Avenue to Flatlands Avenue. The <b>line</b> <b>would</b> be {{a branch of}} the IRT Eastern Parkway Line.|$|E
5|$|A six-track Second Avenue Subway between 149th Street, the Bronx, to Grand Street, Manhattan. This <b>line</b> <b>would</b> handle 68 trains {{per hour}} (tph) (34 tph on the express tracks and 34 tph {{on the local}} tracks).|$|E
5|$|A two-track Madison Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> {{have run}} from the {{proposed}} 59th tunnel via Madison Avenue and would have tied into the then-under utilized BMT Broadway Line {{in the vicinity of}} Madison Square.|$|E
50|$|The Original {{proposal}} of three <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> require {{the construction of}} 64 stations, with park and ride facilities at Knocknacarra and Dangan.|$|R
5000|$|Duplication {{of service}} by {{multiple}} bus <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be reduced {{in order to}} use the savings generated to provide additional service on other lines ...|$|R
50|$|Under the Transport 21 Plan, the DART network {{would have}} gone through a {{fundamental}} change from the coastally-focused north/south line which currently exists, to a two-line system which crossed the city. One of these lines (DART <b>Line</b> 1) <b>would</b> run from Maynooth/Pace-M3 to Greystones via Connolly station, while the other (DART <b>Line</b> 2) <b>would</b> run from Balbriggan to Hazelhatch, south of Celbridge, via the DART Underground. Both <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> intersect at Pearse Street Station. A decision will be made between 2016 and 2035.|$|R
5|$|An {{improved}} {{connection between}} the IRT Lexington Avenue Line and the IRT White Plains Road <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> be built using the tunnel under the Harlem River used by the IRT Pelham Line, and would allow for the full use of the capacity on the White Plains Road Line and the Jerome Avenue Line. Eight additional trains per hour would {{be added to the}} White Plains Road Line and fourteen additional trains per hour would be added to the Jerome Avenue Line. The additional service on the Jerome Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> make use of the third track for express service.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015–2019 Capital Program plan, the {{connection}} to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> probably be removed with the elimination of Track 4.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians {{wanted to use the}} rapid transit. Since the Ring <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail <b>line</b> <b>would</b> be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E
50|$|Howitt {{himself was}} in {{no doubt that the}} use of {{classical}} <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> mean that it would not look dated in a few years’ time.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} Phase 2 announcement, Metrolinx {{stated that}} the Kitchener and Lakeshore <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be electrified, {{as well as the}} Union Pearson Express.|$|R

5|$|Connections {{would be}} made to the BMT Nassau Street Line, the Williamsburg Bridge, and the Manhattan Bridge. The Sixth Avenue <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> also be {{connected}} to the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges.|$|E
5|$|Even before {{planning}} of the Hell–Sunnan Line was completed, there arose disagreement {{as to the}} route onwards. In a plan from the 1870s, there was consensus that the towns of Stjørdal, Levanger, Steinkjer and Namsos should receive a line, {{but there was a}} disagreement as to the route. The Beitstad <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> run from Steinkjer via Beitstad and Namdalseid to Namsos and from there to Grong, while the Snåsa <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> run from Sunnan via Snåsa to Grong, with a branch from Grong to Namsos. The Beitstad <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> run through the most densely populated areas, while the Snåsa Line was shorter. Parliament decided on the Snåsa Line in 1900. The railway was extended from Sunnan to Snåsa Station on 30 October 1926, with the section from Hell to Sunnan becoming classified as part of the Nordland Line. The railway was completed to Bodø on 7 June 1962.|$|E
5|$|The BMT Canarsie <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> be {{extended}} past 121st Street in Queens to the BMT Jamaica Line.|$|E
50|$|In December 2012 it was {{announced}} that the wet-lease contract with Swiss International Air <b>Lines</b> <b>would</b> not be renewed and was scheduled to conclude in March 2013.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> {{later be}} repeated, {{with a slight}} alteration, by Feste in the final scene of the play as he mocks Malvolio, who {{afterward}} storms off.|$|R
5000|$|The Jarawas have {{no system}} of writing. In {{observed}} designs, wavy <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> represent {{the sea and}} therefore only drawings or pictures would be drawn to communicate.|$|R
5|$|The Bayside {{extension}} was tentatively {{approved in}} June 1913, {{but only after}} {{the construction of the}} initial extension to Flushing. Under the revised subway expansion plan put forth in December 1913, the Flushing <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> be extended past Main Street, along and/or parallel to the right-of-way of the nearby Port Washington Branch of the LIRR towards Bell Boulevard in Bayside. A spur <b>line</b> <b>would</b> branch off north along 149th Street towards College Point.|$|E
5|$|The Brook Avenue station {{just east}} of Third Avenue–138th Street on the IRT Pelham <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> be reconstructed to allow a {{cross-platform}} interchange. Further north, {{there would be a}} connection with the IRT Pelham Line near Westchester Avenue at the Whitlock Avenue station, and station platforms north to Pelham Bay Park would be narrowed and lengthened to accommodate the longer and wider B Division trains from the Second Avenue Subway. IRT local service on the Pelham <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> terminate at Hunts Point Avenue one stop south.|$|E
5|$|The IND Concourse <b>Line</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} {{extended}} eastward to Gun Hill Road from 205th Steet.|$|E
5000|$|When {{it became}} clear to city {{authorities}} that the construction {{of a large number of}} additional high platforms was not financially feasible, other options were investigated. It was deemed most economical to create a second low-floor network and equip the remaining lines with high platforms. Between the stations [...] "Ebertplatz" [...] and [...] "Barbarossaplatz", there are two possible routes. It was decided that the future low-floor <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be concentrated in the tunnel underneath the Cologne Ring road, while high-floor <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> use the tunnel under the Central station.|$|R
50|$|The Pembroke and Tenby company contributed £20,000 to {{the cost}} of the GWR conversion; they protested that they had assumed that both <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be {{converted}} to mixed gauge.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965 - Government {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with Newfoundland Light and Power to give it ownership of the rural lines connected to its system. Any future <b>lines</b> <b>would</b> be jointly constructed.|$|R
