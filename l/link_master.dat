With OTG, a device {{can be either}} a host when acting as a <b>link</b> <b>master,</b> or a [...] "{{peripheral}}" [...] when acting as a link slave. The choice between host and peripheral roles is handled entirely by which end of the cable the device is connected to.

40|$|A {{critical}} {{capability of}} the new RHIC low level rf (LLRF) system {{is the ability to}} synchronize signals across multiple locations. The 'Update Link' provides this functionality. The 'Update Link' is a deterministic serial data link based on the Xilinx RocketIO protocol that is broadcast over fiber optic cable at 1 gigabit per second (Gbps). The link provides timing events and data packets as well as time stamp information for synchronizing diagnostic data from multiple sources. The new RHIC LLRF was designed to be a flexible, modular system. The system is constructed of numerous independent RF Controller chassis. To provide synchronization among all of these chassis, the Update Link system was designed. The Update Link system provides a low latency, deterministic data path to broadcast information to all receivers in the system. The Update Link system is based on a central hub, the Update <b>Link</b> <b>Master</b> (ULM), which generates the data stream that is distributed via fiber optic links. Downstream chassis have non-deterministic connections back to the ULM that allow any chassis to provide data that is broadcast globally...|$|E
40|$|Teleoperated robotic {{systems are}} widely {{spreading}} in multiple different fields, from hazardous environments exploration to surgery. In teleoperation, users directly manipulate a master device to achieve task execution at the slave robot side; this interaction {{is fundamental to}} guarantee both system stability and task execution performance. In this work, we propose a non-disruptive method to study the arm endpoint stiffness. We evaluate how users exploit the kinetic redundancy of the arm to achieve stability and precision during the execution of different tasks with different master devices. Four users were asked to perform two planar trajectories following virtual tasks using both a serial and a parallel <b>link</b> <b>master</b> device. Users' arm kinematics and muscular activation were acquired and combined with a user-specific musculoskeletal model to estimate the joint stiffness. Using the arm kinematic Jacobian, the arm end-point stiffness was derived. The proposed non-disruptive method is capable of estimating the arm endpoint stiffness during the execution of virtual teleoperated tasks. The obtained results are {{in accordance with the}} existing literature in human motor control and show, throughout the tested trajectory, a modulation of the arm endpoint stiffness that is affected by task characteristics and hand speed and acceleration...|$|E

One possible reason is {{the manner in which}} the pages are displayed: a linear list of textual links. This thesis investigates the redesign of the history tool by introducing visualization to display the visited Web pages. Three distinct visual prototypes were designed ranging from a traditional scientific visualization method to a concrete visualization that incorporates a metaphor and knowledge transfer from the real-world. The low-fidelity prototypes were evaluated by participants and the best performing design was implemented as a high-fidelity prototype.

50|$|A <b>master</b> <b>link</b> or {{quick-release}} link is {{a roller}} chain accessory that allows convenient connection and disconnection of a chain {{without the need for}} a chain tool.

A chain tool is nonetheless needed to adjust a chain's length, for example to shorten a new chain before connecting its ends. They are used on bicycles and motorcycles.|$|R

50|$|Some links have {{side plates}} that are raised on top (figure 3), while some are straight, (figure 2), {{and some have}} more {{prominent}} pin projections than others. Since a chain on a derailleur-fitted bicycle is reversed for part of its excursion through the drive-train, and because some cogsets have close ramp tolerances, such a link might cause a malfunction if the wrong selection were made. Bushingless chains, with smaller projections, are used on bicycles with large cogsets, since their clearances are more critical than those with only seven speeds. In these former cases a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> of comparable quality is needed. As a result, some manufacturers of derailleurs (e.g. SRAM) recommend only their own products, and these days package a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> with each new chain that is purchased. Chains for small cogsets (e.g. seven-speeds) and other than derailleur-fitted bicycles are more tolerant of these <b>master</b> <b>link</b> dimensions.|$|R

50|$|The oldest type of <b>master</b> <b>link,</b> {{available}} for decades, has two pins {{connected to the}} same plate. (Refer to Figure 1). It has been in use mainly in single-speed, hub-geared, or other bicycle drivetrain systems with straight chainlines or widely spaced sprockets. In this assembly, the outside plate with the two pins protruding from it are spaced at the same pitch as the chain, one half-inch, and the free ends of the pins are grooved. The other plate fits over {{the ends of the}} pins and is secured with a spring clip to make the connection, and this type of <b>master</b> <b>link</b> comes closest to being re-usable.|$|R

50|$|The link plates fit together, {{and connect}} the chain by feeding their pins through the {{bushings}} {{of the inner}} plates, from opposite sides. In this way the pair form a loosely interconnected, closed set, with each <b>master</b> <b>link's</b> pin located in the slot of the other, and the two bushings held captive. The connection is then made secure by pulling the chain outwards {{on both sides of}} the link. This latter action forces the pin ends into the narrow ends of the slots where they become locked. The overall security of such a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> depends upon the chain being under tension in normal use, though it can fail in extreme conditions where this condition does not hold.|$|R
5000|$|Roller {{chain is}} ordinarily hooked up using a <b>master</b> <b>link</b> (also {{known as a}} {{connecting}} link), which typically has one pin held by a horseshoe clip rather than friction fit, allowing it to be inserted or removed with simple tools. Chain with a removable link or pin {{is also known as}} cottered chain, which allows the length of the chain to be adjusted. Half links (also known as offsets) are available and are used to increase the length of the chain by a single roller.
