5|$|Strongly built, {{and compact}} yet elegant, Andalusians have long, thick manes and tails. Their most common coat color is gray, {{although}} {{they can be}} found in many other colors. They are known for their intelligence, sensitivity and docility. A sub-strain within the breed known as the Carthusian, is considered by breeders to be the purest strain of Andalusian, though there is no genetic evidence for this claim. The strain is still considered separate from the main breed however, and is preferred by breeders because buyers pay more for horses of Carthusian bloodlines. There are several competing registries keeping records of horses designated as Andalusian or PRE, but they differ on their definition of the Andalusian and PRE, the purity of various strains of the breed, and the legalities of stud book ownership. At least one <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> in progress , to determine the ownership of the Spanish PRE stud book.|$|E
25|$|In July 2015, actor Kim Jho Gwangsoo and his partner, Kim Seung-Hwan, filed {{a lawsuit}} seeking legal status for their marriage.

25|$|On April 28, 2014, the UCC filed {{a lawsuit}} against the state of North Carolina for not {{permitting}} same-sex marriage; this <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> America's first faith-based challenge to same-sex marriage bans. In the lawsuit, the church argues that prohibiting same sex-marriages violates the freedom of religion, as the ban which would prohibit these unions would force ministers in favor of same-sex marriages to not act on their beliefs.|$|E

25|$|On August 1, 2014 Abuelazam filed a case {{in federal}} court against the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the United States Attorney General asking to be {{deported}} to Israel to face charges of an attempted murder that happened on October 1, 2009. Michigan authorities think the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> frivolous and {{expect it to be}} dismissed, noting that it is legally impossible because of Abuelazam's life without parole status, since convicts can not be deported until their full sentence is served.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} days of his President mandate, he awarded the National Order Steaua României (rank of {{ceremonial}} knighthood) to the ultra-nationalist controversial politician Corneliu Vadim Tudor, a gesture which drew criticism in the press and prompted Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, fifteen Radio Free Europe journalists, Timișoara mayor Gheorghe Ciuhandu, songwriter Alexandru Andrieș, and historian Randolph Braham to return their Romanian honours in protest. The leader of Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, Béla Markó, did not show up to claim the award he received on the same occasion. The then current president, Traian Băsescu, revoked the award granted to Tudor on 24 May 2007, but a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> ongoing even after Băsescu's decree was declared constitutional.|$|E
25|$|The C$245 million {{expressway}} {{was built}} through the Red Hill Valley by the City of Hamilton after a decades-long battle with opponents. The expressway was first {{proposed in the}} 1950s and was cancelled and resurrected several times. Last-ditch efforts by opponents, including occupying the valley, lawsuits and blocking construction access, failed and the expressway was finally constructed in the 2000s, opening to traffic in 2007. The cost to the city included $100 million in construction costs, plus legal costs fighting to get the expressway constructed. The city fought the provincial government once {{and the federal government}} twice to build the project. As of November 2009, a $75 million <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> still pending with the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2. The entrances, planned to service 3,600 people an hour, were alleged in the <b>lawsuit</b> to <b>be</b> destroying {{the quality of life}} for building tenants, if the entrances were to be built in the location. The <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that <b>lawsuit</b> <b>was</b> also dismissed.|$|R
25|$|AMC Networks {{responded to}} Dish's {{announcement}} of its pending {{removal of the}} channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by former company parent Rainbow Media's Voom HD Networks, {{in which it is}} seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom's high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005 until May 12, 2008 when Dish removed ten of Voom's fifteen channels from its lineup (the five remaining Voom HD channels were removed from Dish the day after). However, Dish states that the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.|$|E
25|$|There {{have also}} been issues {{with the use of}} false DMCA {{takedown}} notices. Once a DMCA takedown notice is served, reversing it requires an individual to expose his personal information to the filer (filing a notice does not require this); for the penalty of perjury to be enacted, a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> required (anything less, the false DMCA claimer can just claim it from a different account every week causing legitimate business unlimited losses). In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on Second Life is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the Swedish media {{reported}} that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available the moment a <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate {{on the condition that}} the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, Matt and Melanie Capobianco filed {{a lawsuit}} in Nowata County, Oklahoma, {{demanding}} more than $1 million in court costs, accrued during their custody battle. The <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> against Veronica's biological father, Dusten Brown, and the Cherokee Nation. [...] The Cherokee Nation issued a forceful response, saying [...] "it is not responsible for paying the fees and costs for the Capobiancos because of its Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity from suits without its express consent." [...] The Cherokees also [...] "made clear the tribe's displeasure with the Capobianco's very public media appearances, interviews and various fundraising schemes {{during the same time}} in which all the parties were under statutory gag order in South Carolina".|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. co-wrote {{the song}} [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] with Madonna and Nicki Minaj for the album MDNA and {{performed}} {{it at the}} Super Bowl XLVI Halftime Show. Controversially, instead of singing the lyric [...] "shit" [...] in the song, M.I.A. extended the middle finger to the camera. The N.F.L. responded by filing a lawsuit suing M.I.A. for [...] millions in damages and demanding a public apology from M.I.A. Maya and her legal team also responded {{by saying that the}} league's claim of [...] "wholesomeness" [...] in the <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> hypocritical since the N.F.L. itself has had multiple situations of their own players and coaches behaving badly as well as health problems within the league, particularly concussions. In September 2013 Maya released a video statement regarding the lawsuit. In her statement Arulpragasam said, [...] "They're basically [...] it's OK for me to promote being sexually exploited as a female, than to display empowerment, female empowerment, through being punk rock. That's what it boils down to, and I'm being sued for it." [...] The lawsuit was settled in August 2014; the terms of the settlement remain private.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, Morley {{was awarded}} the same {{printing}} monopoly that Byrd had held. Morley's pick of Barley as an assignee (rather than experienced printers such as East or Peter Short, both of whom had previously worked with Morley) is surprising. Morley may {{have been looking for}} help in challenging the metrical psalter patent of Richard Day and his assignees. At that time, East and Short were stationers, and the Stationers' Company was actively enforcing the Day monopoly. Barley, however, was not a stationer, and in 1599 he and Morley published The Whole Booke of Psalmes and Richard Allison's Psalmes of David in Metre. The former was a small pocket edition that was largely based on East's 1592 publication of the same name. This work, although pirated and filled with small errors, provides some evidence of Barley's editorial skill; musicologist Robert Illing notes that if Barley [...] "is to be discredited for roguery, he must also be applauded for his strokes of musical imagination" [...] for successfully compressing such a large work into a pocket-sized production. In Allison's work, the two claimed that they had exclusive rights on the metrical psalter. Duly provoked, Day sued. The outcome of his <b>lawsuit</b> <b>is</b> not known, but neither Barley nor Morley ever published another metrical psalter.|$|E
