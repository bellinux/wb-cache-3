5|$|According to Maple's account, in the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> {{weeks of}} Pickingill's life, {{when he had}} become very ill, the local people moved him to the {{infirmary}} against his will, where he declared that at his funeral there would be one more demonstration of his magical powers.

Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E

5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled specifically to take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their <b>last</b> <b>few</b> months with considerable precision.|$|E

5|$|Despite the canonic {{status of}} Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin is often {{characterized}} as an under-recognized {{or even as}} a forgotten author; while his work has received increasing critical attention (mostly in German) over the <b>last</b> <b>few</b> decades, he is much less well known by the reading public than other representatives of German modernism such as Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, or Franz Kafka.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{fascination with the}} novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), and a new edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The <b>last</b> <b>few</b> decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in the novel.|$|E
