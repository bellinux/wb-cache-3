30|$|Total genomic DNA was {{extracted}} from a 5 – 7  day old mycelial mat using the ZR Fungal/Bacterial DNA kit™ (Zymo Research, USA) following the manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 100  mg wet weight of mushroom mycelium suspended in 200  µl phosphate buffer solution buffer {{was added to}} a ZR BashingBead ™ <b>lysis</b> <b>tube</b> and vortexed at 10, 000  rpm for 5  min. Thereafter, the ZR BashingBead ™ <b>lysis</b> <b>tube</b> was centrifuged at 1000  rpm for 1  min, 400  µl of the supernatant transferred into a Zymo-Spin™ IV spin filter in a collection tube and centrifuged at 7000  rpm for 1  min. Exactly 1200  µl of Fungal/Bacterial DNA binding buffer {{was added to the}} filtrate and 800  µl of the mixture was centrifuged twice at 10, 000  rpm for 1  min. In a new Zymo-Spin™ IIC column, 200  µl of DNA pre-wash buffer and 500  µl Fungal/Bacterial DNA wash buffer was added and centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 1  min respectively. The column was then transferred into a clean 1.5  ml microcentrifuge tube, after which 100  µl DNA elution buffer was added directly into the column matrix and centrifuged at 10, 000  rpm for 30  s to elute the DNA. Ultra-pure DNA was stored at −[*] 80  °C for further use.|$|E
40|$|Fusarium was {{recovered}} from {{only one of}} fourteen Pacific Northwest coniferous forest soils but from all seven nursery soils tested. Assays using high concentrations of macroconidia added to soil determined that forest soils stimulate macroconidial germination (R= 12 %) often followed by germ <b>tube</b> <b>lysis</b> or the formation of stunted chlamydospores while nursery soils support little macroconidial germination (R= 1. 5 %). Treatment of forest soils with aerated steam (minimum of 45 ° C for 30 min), radiation or propylene oxide reduced the amount of germination in forest soils, suggesting that the forest soil microbiota {{is involved in the}} stimulation of macroconidial germination. Bacteria isolated from Fusarium hyphae placed in forest, field or nursery soils on nylon screens did not significantly influence germ <b>tube</b> <b>lysis</b> when combined with macroconidia in a nutrient broth. Chemical, physical, and nutritional properties of forest soils likely affect the capacity of the forest soil microbiota to influence Fusarium macroconidial germination and germ <b>tube</b> <b>lysis...</b>|$|R
30|$|DNA was {{extracted}} from colon samples using a repeated bead beating plus column (RBB + C) method (Yu and Morrison 2004). Briefly, 0.3  g of sample was centrifuged for 5  min at 16, 000 ×g to pellet solids including bacterial cells, and then resuspended in 0.2  mL TE (Tris–EDTA, pH 8.0) buffer. Cell lysis {{was achieved by}} bead beating 0.15  g of the resuspended sample in ZR BashingBead <b>Lysis</b> <b>Tubes</b> (Zymo Research Corp, Santa Ana, CA, USA) using the TissueLyser II system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 3  min at 21  Hz, {{in the presence of}} 4 % (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 500  mM NaCl, and 50  mM EDTA. After mechanical and chemical cell lysis, 10  M ammonium acetate (260 µL) was used to precipitate and remove the impurities and SDS, followed by equal volume isopropanol precipitation for the recovery of the nucleic acids. Supernatants were treated with 2  µL RNase (10  mg/mL) and proteinase K (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit), followed by the use of QIAamp columns from the Qiagen DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Genomic DNA concentration was determined using a Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Wilmington, DE, USA).|$|R
40|$|Six {{methods of}} extracting Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} DNA from sputum for testing by quantitative PCR were compared: Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, PrepMan Ultra, 2 % {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) - 10 % Triton X with and without sonication, Infectio Diagnostics, Inc. (IDI) lysing tubes, and QIAGEN QIAamp DNA mini kit; all included a 15 -min boiling step. Pooled digested and decontaminated sputum was spiked with M. tuberculosis ATCC 27294. Each extraction method was repeated eight times. Quantitative PCR {{was performed on the}} Smart Cycler and Rotor-Gene 3000 using primers targeting an 83 -bp fragment of IS 6110. An minor grove binding Eclipse probe with a fluorescent label was used for detection. An internal control was included to detect amplification inhibition. The limit of detection of M. tuberculosis DNA was 0. 5 fg with both instruments. Calculated DNA concentrations (picograms) extracted using IDI, PrepMan, QIAGEN, and TE were 42. 8, 30. 4, 28. 2, and 7. 4, respectively, when run on the Smart Cycler, and 51. 7, 20. 1, 14. 9, and 8. 6, respectively, when run on Rotor-Gene. All extractions using SDS/Triton X with or without sonication were inhibited. Of the extraction methods evaluated, IDI <b>lysis</b> <b>tubes</b> provided the greatest yield of mycobacterial DNA, and the procedure can be completed in less than 1 h versus 2. 5 − 3 h for the QIAGEN extraction...|$|R
40|$|A mouse {{myeloma cell}} line growing in {{suspension}} was subjected intermittently to flow through a sudden contraction and turbulent flow in a capillary tube. The probability of lysis per {{pass through the}} capillary tube increased with average wall shear stress level and with residence time per pass in the <b>tube.</b> <b>Lysis</b> was first observed at a threshold average wall shear stress level of 1800 dyn/cm^ 2. Although the flow caused lysis, it {{had no effect on}} cell viability...|$|R
30|$|RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Austin, Texas, USA). Cryogenic vials {{containing}} approximately 200  µL of caseous {{content or}} culture pellets previously stored at −[*] 80  °C {{were allowed to}} thaw spontaneously at room temperature. Immediately after, thelysis buffer included in the kit {{was added to the}} pellets and, after homogenization, the entire liquid content was transferred to new cryogenic vials containing eight beads of stainless steel. Around 40 – 50  µg of caseous content were placed in identical cryogenic vials (containing the same amount of beads), followed by the addition of an identical quantity of <b>lysis</b> buffer. The <b>tubes</b> were vertically agitated for 5  min in a Speedmill homogenizer (Analytic Jena AG) to rupture the bacterial cells. The tubes were then centrifuged at 16, 000 g for 3  min and the supernatants were transferred to silica columns for RNA recovery. All samples containing abscess material, as well as the respective pellets derived from liquid cultures, were extracted in the same experiment in accordance with the kit manufacturer’s instructions. Upon termination of the extraction process, 40  µL of eluate from each sample were preserved at −[*] 80  °C until the time of reverse transcription. The DNA extraction of samples containing macrophages infected with C. pseudotuberculosis was performed at the Professor Edgar Santos University Hospital (HUPES) in Salvador-Bahia. These samples were transported in dry ice and immediately transferred to a freezer and kept at −[*] 80  °C until the time of complementary DNA production.|$|R
40|$|Bead beating’’ is {{commonly}} used to release DNA from cells for genomic studies but it was used here to prepare suspensions of plant nuclei for measurement of DNA amounts by flow cytometry. Plant material was placed in 2 -ml screw-capped tubes containing beads of zirconia/silica (2. 5 mm diameter) or glass (2. 5 or 1. 0 mm diameter) and 1 ml of <b>lysis</b> buffer. The <b>tubes</b> were mechanically shaken with an FP 120 FastPrep Cell Disrupter to release intact nuclei from plant tissue by {{the impact of the}} beads. The nuclei were then stained with propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The method was tested using fresh leaves, fresh petals and herbarium leaves of Rosa canina, leaves and pollen of R. rugosa, and fresh leaves of Petroselinum crispum, Nicotiana tabacum, and Allium cepa. Batches of 12 samples of fresh leaves were prepared, simultaneously, in 45 s by bead beating in the Cell Disrupter. In flow cytometry histograms, nuclei of fresh leaves gave G 1 /G 0 peaks with CVs of less than 3. 0 % and nuclei from fresh petals and herbarium leaves of R. canina, and pollen of the generative nuclei of R. rugosa gave peaks with coefficients of variation (CVs) of less than 4. 0 %. DNA amounts estimated from 24 -month-old herbarium leaves, using P. crispum as an internal standard, were less than those of fresh leaves by a small but significant amount. Suspensions of nuclei can be prepared rapidly and conveniently from a diversity of tissues by bead beating. Exposure of laboratory workers to harmful substances in the lysis buffer is minimized...|$|R
