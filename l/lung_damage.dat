The singer suffered four broken ribs, <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> and a fractured pelvis that necessitated emergency surgery in Réunion, three weeks of hospitalization, and prolonged physical therapy to enable Jaojoby to regain the ability to walk. Fans of the singer used mail and the Internet to successfully raise the funds required to cover medical expenses related to the accident. After several weeks of bed rest following the surgery, Joajoby went on to make a full recovery.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few deep breaths of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E

40|$|Background: The use of mosquito-coil {{are quite}} high. Mosquito-coil {{contains}} a chemical substance allethrin and its combustion produces Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon, carbonmonoxide, carbondioxide, nitrogen oxides, and aldehydes. Mosquito-coil smoke trigger infiltration of inflammatory cell {{and destruction of}} alveoli, causes <b>lungs</b> <b>damage.</b> White pitaya peels underutilized in use though have high polyphenol content that can act as <b>lungs</b> <b>damage</b> prevention. Aim: To analyze the effect of white pitaya peels (Hylocereus undatus) extract on microscopic <b>lungs</b> <b>damage</b> of the Balb/c mice exposed by mosquito-coil smoke. Methods: This research was used True experimental post-test only control group design. The samples were 25 Balb/c mice with certain criteria, divided into 5 groups. K 1 was untreated group, K 2 was given mosquito-coil smoke exposure 8 hours per day, P 1, P 2, P 3 were given mosquito-coil smoke exposure 8 hours per day and were given white pitaya peels extract with respectively doses 7. 5 mg/mL, 15 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL. This research was lasted 21 days. On the 22 nd day, the mice were terminated and put its lungs to be examined microscopically. Result: Mann-Whitney test showed {{there were significant differences}} groups of K 1 -K 2, K 2 -P 1 and K 2 -P 3 (p < 0. 05). K 2 had more severe degree damage than the K 1 and P 1, P 3 showed more lighter degree damage than K 2. There was no significant difference groups of P 1 - P 2 - P 3 and K 2 -P 2. Conclusion: The white pitaya peels extracts decrease the <b>damage</b> of <b>lungs</b> microscopic of Balb/c mice exposed by mosquito-coil smoke.

5|$|Viruses {{may reach}} the lung {{by a number}} of {{different}} routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose. Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose. Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or lung parenchyma. Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood. The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death. When the immune system responds to the infection, even more <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> may occur. Primarily white blood cells, mainly mononuclear cells, generate the inflammation. As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other organs and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can arise as a co-morbid condition.|$|E
5|$|When Voight began {{research}} at Mount Merapi in Java, Indonesia, in 1988, {{it was largely}} unknown to volcanologists. It had been omitted in the Smithsonian Institution's 1981 publication Volcanoes of the World, despite being densely populated, having close to a million people on its slopes as of 1996. Voight set up meters to record movement within the volcano, and educated local scientists on volcanic monitoring. In July 1989, he obtained a $250,000 grant from the National Science Foundation's Division of Natural and Manmade Hazard Mitigation for his proposal to predict eruptions at Merapi. After his funding ran out, he temporarily abandoned his research. An eruption from the volcano in 1994 produced pyroclastic flows that killed 63 people, including guests at a wedding ceremony. Returning to Merapi the following year, Voight compared data from the dead and survivors, including {{the extent of their}} burn areas, clothing worn, and <b>lung</b> <b>damage.</b> He concluded that protective, long-sleeved clothing and masks enhance chances of survival when exposed to eruptive activity.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} that {{endogenous}} sulfur dioxide {{plays a role}} in diminishing an experimental <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> caused by oleic acid. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation during an experimental <b>lung</b> <b>damage.</b> Conversely, a successful <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces endogenous SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding acetylcysteine or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO2 produced and decreased the <b>lung</b> <b>damage,</b> the free radical formation, oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.|$|E

Metabolomic analysis correctly predicted the pathogen diagnosis in 86  % of cases.|$|R

In parallel with these <b>lung</b> <b>damages,</b> BBB permeability to sodium fluorescein and Evans blue albumin was markedly increased.

25|$|High {{concentrations}} of oxygen can cause oxygen toxicity such as <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> or result in respiratory failure {{in those who}} are predisposed. It can also dry out the nose and {{increase the risk of}} fires in those who smoke. The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated. In most conditions a saturation of 94-98% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88-92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest they should be as high as possible. Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume. Oxygen is required by people for proper cell metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Typically, a virus {{enters the}} lungs through the {{inhalation}} of water droplets and invades the cells lining the airways and the alveoli. This leads to cell death; the cells {{are killed by}} the virus or they self-destruct. Further <b>lung</b> <b>damage</b> occurs when the immune system responds to the infection. White blood cells, particularly lymphocytes, activate chemicals known as cytokines which cause fluid to leak into the alveoli. The combination of cell destruction and fluid-filled alveoli interrupts the transportation of oxygen into the bloodstream. In addition to their effects on the lungs, many viruses affect other organs. Viral infections weaken the immune system, making the body more susceptible to bacterial infection (including bacterial pneumonia).|$|E
