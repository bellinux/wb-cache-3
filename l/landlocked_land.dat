5000|$|The {{power of}} governments to take private real or {{personal}} property {{has always existed}} in the United States, as an inherent attribute of sovereignty. This power reposes in the legislative branch {{of the government and}} may not be exercised unless the legislature has authorized its use by statutes that specify who may use it and for what purposes. The legislature may take private property by passing an Act transferring title to the government. The property owner may then seek compensation by suing in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. The legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads, and even to individuals for the purpose of acquiring access to their <b>landlocked</b> <b>land.</b> Its use was limited by the Takings Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1791, which reads, [...] "... nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation." [...] The Fifth Amendment did not create the national government's right to use the eminent domain power, it simply limited it to public use.|$|E
40|$|Implied {{easements}} {{were initially}} created and then developed in eras when a Torrens or title-by-registration system did not operate. Like all traditional easements, implied easements were legal proprietary interests {{in favour of}} the dominant land which bound the successors in title of the servient land. Implied easements worked particularly well to accommodate the presumed intentions of parties, fill contractual gaps and provide a means of access to <b>landlocked</b> <b>land.</b> However, they operated and still operate outside title-by-registration...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{maturing}} of the in personam claim, and its relationship with the concepts of supervening fraud and <b>landlocked</b> <b>land.</b> The paper concentrates solely on the enforcement of the claim against the class of registered owners and uses two decisions concerning a sub‐set of that class — the access‐blocking owner — to tease out the principles. The claim will supersede supervening fraud, a principle that may be neither 'necessary [nor] consistent with the statute'. The circumstances in which claims in personam are, and will be, recognised are wide. This paper highlights well‐established known legal or equitable causes of action to which the unconscionability of a registered owner may attach. The claim's relationship with ss 326 ‐ 331 of the Property Law Act 2007 adds a further dimension to the debate. So how do the parties fare under the three concepts? Both the Suttons and the McGraths clear the hurdles of supervening fraud and the in personam claim. Had they resided in New Zealand, the McGraths would probably have successfully defended a <b>landlocked</b> <b>land</b> application from the Campbells. However, Mr O'Kane would have dealt his winning card and, pursuant to ss 326 ‐ 330 of the Property Law Act 2007, his access would have been reinstated. A tricky trio indeed...|$|E

5|$|Since Roman times, silting {{and land}} {{reclamation}} in the Pevensey Levels {{have pushed the}} coastline out by about , leaving the castle <b>landlocked.</b> The <b>land</b> between the castle and the sea is now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly {{to the east of}} the castle, {{at the end of the}} ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|R
50|$|Lake Arresø, {{the largest}} lake in Denmark, has its western {{part in the}} municipality. Originally a fjord {{connected}} to Kattegat, it was <b>landlocked</b> when the <b>land</b> northwest of the lake rose by 5 meters in the last ice age. In 1717, by royal order a canal was built (finished in 1719) to connect the lake with Roskilde fjord. The construction of the canal was necessary because the natural stream (Danish:å) from the lake to the fjord was filling up with sand. The water in the newly built canal was harnessed by a watermill, {{and the town of}} Frederiksværk basically was created through industrialization.|$|R
5000|$|Southampton Central {{station was}} opened as Southampton West in 1895, {{to replace the}} smaller nearby West End station (originally named Blechynden {{when it opened in}} 1847). The station was on the seafront, {{specifically}} the stretch of water known as West Bay, with the water reaching right up to the southern edge of the platforms at high tide. A series of land reclamation projects to expand the docks, largely funded by the London and South Western Railway, culminated in the building of the vast [...] "New Docks" [...] (now Western Docks) between 1927 and 1934, which led to all of West Bay being reclaimed and the station becoming <b>landlocked.</b> The new <b>land</b> and the demand for new lines allowed the station to be enlarged and redeveloped in 1934-1935 (from two platforms to four), and it became Southampton Central. The new station buildings were largely constructed from concrete.|$|R
