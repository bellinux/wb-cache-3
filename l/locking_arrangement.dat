40|$|Most of the bow-door systems {{constructed}} {{today have}} their bow-doors {{attached to the}} hull via arms and open horizontally outwards from the ship’s sides. The arms carry the doors during opening and closing {{and when they are}} in open position. Bow door systems are designed according to the class rules, of which the IACS UR S 8 rules serve as a base. Even though bow-door arms are subjected to some dynamic loads, they are dimensioned according to static loads. One ferry designed in this way obtained a large crack in the port-side arm. If the arm had cracked off completely, the bow-door would probably have been lost at sea, as the arm {{was a part of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>arrangement.</b> In order to investigate if arms, dimensioned according to a static load, can be a part of the supporting and <b>locking</b> <b>arrangement</b> of bow-doors, an analysis of a bow-door arm has been carried out. The analysis was carried out with field measurements, in the form of strain- and acceleration measurements, on an arm during the different load cases it is subjected to. The measured results were applied on a FE-Model of the arm in order to find the stress and stress ranges everywhere in the arm during the different load cases. With this information, areas subjected to large stress amplitudes were identified for which fatigue calculations were carried out. None of the load cases proved to give rise to fatigue of concern, except for the bow propellers, which, in certain situations, excite the arms into resonance cycling. The resonance gives rise to a high number of stress cycles with amplitudes large enough to cause fatigue failure...|$|E

40|$|Repoint is a {{new concept}} for track {{switching}} developed at Loughborough University. Through a novel <b>locking</b> <b>arrangement</b> it allows parallel, multi-channel actuation and passive locking functions, providing {{a high degree of}} fault tolerance. The concept, based around a stub switch, offers several features that current designs are unable to achieve. The aim of the work presented in this paper is to evaluate the dynamic interaction forces due to the passage of rolling stock over the switch and, particularly, the area of the stub rail ends, in comparison to a conventional switch. Specific behaviour and load transfer conditions from one rail to the other at the joint are analysed, as well as long term wear conditions of the rails. These evaluations are undertaken by means of dynamic simulations, leading to design refinement of the stub rail ends...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentially}} costly {{consequences of}} a lost ship {{in the form of}} fatalities, property, cargo and related industries, as well as pollution of the environment in the form of oil spill, etc., and the public view are the driving forces for developing safer ships. Especially RoRo-ferries, i. e. RoPax, have been in focus during the last few years after a series of accidents claiming a large amount of fatalities. This thesis is on the subject of safety of RoPax-vessels with an emphasis on structural integrity. It comprises three studies: the “event-chain” study, which concerns the safety of RoPax vessels in general, the “bow-door study” and the “collision strength study”. Accidents are seen {{as a result of a}} series of events where each one may be trivial, but, when combined, will ultimately end in a disaster. When such a series of events is studied, it is possible to define “chain-breakers”, i. e. points in time and space where a different action or design feature could halt the development. The objective of the event-chain analysis was to identify and analyse chain-breakers from previous accidents. The results were graphics of event-chains with chain-breakers which were used in workshops with experts in two stages. Concepts and ideas regarding fire protection and evacuation, damage stability, surveillance and support systems and management were put forward. Accidents with many casualties due to failure of bow-door systems and several additional incidents are the cause for concern of the safety of bow-door systems. In the current work, the rules of IACS UR S 8 were assessed regarding the structural integrity for bow-doors of the “clam door” type. The emphasis was on bow-door supports, transferring load on the doors into the hull, and bow-door arms, carrying the doors during opening and closing. Calculation of the required strength of the supports of an existing RoPax was made according to the IACS S 8 rules and compared to a finite element (FE) calculation based on real pressure values and pressure distributions recorded onboard. The results show that the required and the proposed methods of the IACS S 8 appear to be approaches that lead to inadequate results. A bow-door arm was also studied in order to analyse whether arms, dimensioned according to a static load, should be permitted to be a part of the locking arrangements of bow-doors. The analysis was carried out with FE-calculations based on field measurements in which it was shown that the analysed bow-door arm could suffer fatigue damage. Hence, bow-door arms should not be permitted to be included in the <b>locking</b> <b>arrangement</b> of bow-doors, unless the structural integrity of the arms regarding dynamic loads has been assessed very carefully. RoRo-vessels, with their large open RoRo-decks and resulting poor damage stability, are sensitive to collision damage. An innovative conceptual deformable inner barrier design is presented with the aim of improving the collision safety in a collision into the side of a ship by facilitation of a deep intrusion before penetration. The design fulfils the design rules by having equivalent strength for operational as well as extreme loads. It also fulfils the stakeholders’ interests regarding the acceptable extra weight and cost. Validation of the conceptual design was made using FE-simulations, based on indata and criteria established in an experimentally verified FE sensitivity analysis, in a comparative study of the original “reference” structure, a costal RoRo-vessel. The FE-simulations show that the amount of absorbed energy can be more than tripled, at the same time as the rules and the stakeholders’ interests are fulfilled...|$|E

40|$|Technologies do {{not follow}} some {{predetermined}} and inevitable course from their context of production to their context of use, and technologies used in schools are no exception.

Through the discussion of a particular technology (the Logo programming language) as a case study in educational innovation, this article demonstrates how the use of technologies in schools is socially shaped. The paper looks into the place that Logo occupied within the institutional and organisational cultures of US and UK mainstream schools after its introduction in the early 1980 s. It discusses the ways in which Logo was received in the educational arena and was implicated in the politics of educational innovation at a time of conservative restoration...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the determination of}} employment and pay on capi-talist and kinship vessels in the New England fishing industry. Capitalist vessels resemble standard competitive firms {{in the way that}} employment and pay respond to changing market conditions; kinship vessels operate under work guarantees and income-sharing rules. These differences in institutional rules lead to different patterns of income, employment, growth, and labor adjustment. The study shows how an understanding of the institutional structure of labor markets can contribute to the design of public policies to facilitate adjustment to change and to promote indus-trial growth. Institutional arrangements are often assigned a passive role in economic analysis. In perfectly competitive markets, economic institutions are ex-pected to transmit competitive forces and articulate competitive decisions. In the face of market imperfections, such as transaction costs, uncertainty, and idiosyncratic exchange, institutions are thought to help organize eco-nomic relationships efficiently (Williamson, 1975; Lazear and Rosen, 1 9 8 1; Azariadis, 1975). Labor economists, however, have often argued that economic institu-tions have more complex effects upon labor markets. Institutions may <b>lock</b> in economic <b>arrangements</b> that were once efficient but have outlived their original economic rationale; they may intervene in labor markets to change economic outcomes; and they may articulate distributional as well as effi-ciency objectives (Freeman and Medoff, 1984). Efficiency-based explanations of economic institutions lead to the expectation that competition will quickly cause more efficient institutional Note: Reprinted from Industrial and Labor Relations Review, 1 9 8 6, 4 0 (1), by permis-sion of publisher and authors. © Cornell University...|$|R
40|$|An often {{unforeseen}} {{feature of}} long term, collaborative business relationships {{characterized by the}} investment of highly specific assets is the partners become <b>locked</b> into the <b>arrangement.</b> Exit may become too costly and difficult due {{to the loss of}} irretrievable investments and the adverse effect on business continuity (Hirschman, 1970). But, as long as goodwill and benefits flows are maintained, all is well. However, if problems are encountered that undermine trust, commitment will suffer and the inadequacy of contract law to adequately resolve complex relationship problems will be realized. An unhappy marriage results without the option of divorce. The partners can either co-exist in a mutually disadvantageous arrangement or, realizing the lack of an escape choice, learn to adapt and to re-invigorate the partnership. This paper describes a research project that examined the pure monopolistic business relationships within UK Defence Procurement. From the researchers point of view this environment is particularly interesting because the variability resulting from competition is removed and the links between the partner organisations, including the effect of key behavioural variables, are more visible. It aims to show how a suite of techniques was used to measure and describe an environment that has received scant attention from management researchers. These relationships are characterized by high technology, long durations (up to 40 years), strategically important products and services and the regular expenditure of large sums of public money. They have a tradition of adversarial relationships, late, over- budget projects and low economic returns (Parker & Hartley, 1997). The study aimed to understand the dynamics within these relationships and to determine if it was possible to identify those factors that maintain goodwill and benefit flows and those that might re-invigorate failure situations...|$|R
40|$|In the {{rehabilitation}} of the upper-extremity amputee, structural replacement by prosthetic arm and hand is an obvious requirement, and it poses a comparatively easy task; functional replacement by remote control and by sub-stitute mechanical apparatus is more elusive and hence infinitely harder. For the purposes of functional utility, remaining movements of upper arm, shoulder, and torso must be harnessed, and use must be made {{of a variety of}} mechanical devices which amplify remaining resources by alternators, springs, <b>locks,</b> and switching <b>arrangements.</b> The facility of con-trol attained through this apparatus is the key to its ultimate value. The future of upper-extremity prosthetics depends upon an ever-increasing understanding of the mechanics of the human body by all who minister to the amputee—prosthetist, surgeon, and therapist alike. It must always be stressed that the final goal is an amputee who can function. Too often {{there is a tendency to}} put undue faith in the marvels of mechanism alone, when in fact it is the man-machine combination that determines performance. It is in this broad frame of reference that the biomechanical basis of upper-extremity con-trol must be approached. PROSTHETICS ANTHROPOMETRY SURFACE LANDMARKS If successful control is to be obtained, the various components of the prosthesis must be positioned with a good degree of accuracy. To do so requires reference points on the body, of which the most satisfactory are certain bony landmarks. Most of these skeletal prominences protrude to such an extent that location is easily possible by eye. Others require palpation, and this method should be used to verify observation in every case. The bones most concerned in upper-extremity anthropometry are the clavicle, the scapula, the humerus, the ulna, and the seventh cervical vertebra. Surface indications of protuberances, angles, or other features of these bones constitute the landmarks, the locations and definitions being given in Fig...|$|R
