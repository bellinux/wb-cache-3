5|$|Cebu {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{impacted}} cities. At the local airport, an anemometer recorded sustained winds of 160km/h (100mph) early on December10, which remains a record for the city. Rainfall peaked at 195.3mm (7.69in); at the time this made the typhoon the wettest tropical cyclone in Cebu history. All buildings made of <b>light</b> <b>construction</b> materials were at least partially damaged, with many large structures sustaining roof or other damage. At least 29people were killed in the city, including the drownings of three due to the resultant flooding. The typhoon's effects caused the cessation of the city's power supply. Damage in Cebu totaled 560million Philippine pesos. At least a hundred other people in Cebu City were displaced. Offshore, 28ships capsized due to winds caused by Amy, including 7 inter-island vessels. This set a new record for vessels sunk by a typhoon in Cebu, and held until Typhoon Mike sunk 88ships in 1990.|$|E
5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and had serious concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their <b>light</b> <b>construction.</b> Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E

25|$|N. lamarckia {{is grown}} as an ornamental, and for low-grade timber and paper. The timber {{is used for}} plywood, <b>light</b> <b>construction,</b> pulp and paper, boxes and crates, dug-out canoes, and {{furniture}} components. Kadamba yields a pulp of satisfactory brightness and performance as a hand sheet. The wood can be easily impregnated with synthetic resins to increase its density and compressive strength. The wood has a density of 290–560kg/cu m at 15% moisture content, a fine to medium texture; straight grain; low luster and has no characteristic odor or taste. It is easy to work, with hand and machine tools, cuts cleanly, gives a very good surface and is easy to nail. The timber air dries rapidly {{with little or no}} degrade. Kadamba wood is very easy to preserve using either open tank or pressure-vacuum systems.|$|E
25|$|The <b>light</b> <b>construction</b> {{and hollow}} {{nature of the}} {{structures}} allowed the jet fuel to penetrate far inside the towers, igniting many large fires simultaneously over a wide area of the impacted floors. The fuel from the planes burned at most for a few minutes, but {{the contents of the}} buildings burned over the next hour or hour and a half. It has been suggested that the fires might not have been as centrally positioned, nor as intense, had traditionally heavy high-rise construction been {{standing in the way of}} the aircraft. Debris and fuel would likely have remained mostly outside the buildings or concentrated in more peripheral areas away from the building cores, which would then not have become unique failure points. In this scenario, the towers might have stood far longer, perhaps indefinitely. The fires were hot enough to weaken the columns and cause floors to sag, pulling perimeter columns inward and reducing their ability to support the mass of the building above.|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} issue of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> and its usage in German journalistic texts. The {{objective of the}} theoretical part is to explain {{on the basis of}} scholarly literature basic terms such as <b>light</b> verb <b>construction</b> (LVC), function verb and full verb. After that <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> are also distinguished by syntactic and semantic criteria, which specify the rules for usage of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> in practice. The individual rules are shown on example sentences. The objective of practical part is to analyze and compare usage of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> in German journalistic texts (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Bild) using tables as well as graph sands identify from semantic view point which types of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> were in texts most often. On the basis of this observation it was found out that serious newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung contained more of these constructions than tabloid Bild. This fact derives from usage of nominal style, which is preferred in official and journalistic texts nowadays.

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, German {{engineers}} had proposed a new large caliber anti-tank gun which used less propellant than a rocket or recoilless weapon, yet fired similar compact hollow charge shells. German forces subsequently fielded the 8 cm PAW 600, which was an extremely lightweight, low pressure weapon still able to fire the same ammunition types as higher velocity anti-tank guns. In the 1950s, this idea was revived by a Belgian firm, Mecar, which subsequently improved on the concept and developed a low pressure, smoothbore 90mm anti-tank gun. Because of its low recoil forces and <b>light</b> <b>construction,</b> the gun was particularly useful for being mounted on armored cars or small gun carriages. Its design inspired the lightly rifled French DEFA D921 anti-tank gun, which fired fin-stabilized shells and was available on a towed carriage or as a vehicle mount. It was later mated to the AML-90 and EBR series of French armored cars. The Soviet Union also adopted a similar design at around the same time, the 100mm T-12 anti-tank gun, which was smoothbore and fired fin-stabilized shells. Switzerland developed a postwar 90mm anti-tank gun of its own, the Pak 50/57, firing shells with an even lower velocity than the Mecar or DEFA guns. All these weapons could only use HEAT shells for armor-piercing purposes, save for the T-12, which utilized APDS rounds. France did introduce an APFSDS shell for the DEFA D921 {{at some point in the}} 1980s. The last country known to have produced a dedicated anti-tank gun was the People's Republic of China, in 1988. The Chinese gun was known as the Norinco Type 86 and was probably manufactured as a replacement for the ageing Soviet-sourced T-12.|$|E

40|$|<b>Light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> are verb-object pairs whose verb is semantically {{light and}} whose object can be verbalized into another verb {{with the same}} meaning as the verb-object pair. In this thesis, I propose {{automatic}} corpus-based methods for identifying <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions.</b> This is done in two stages, first by extending existing corpus-based measures as measures for identifying <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> among verb-object pairs, and secondly, a machine-learning approach to classify whether verb-object pairs are <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions.</b> My main contribution in this thesis is the introduction of machinelearning approach for classification, using the extended measures as features as well as introducing additional features which are extracted from a corpus, as training features for the classifiers. To {{the best of my}} knowledge, nobody has ever proposed a machine learning approach for the abovementioned task. Also, my contributions have significantly improved the ability for computers to identify <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions,</b> and the machine learning framework can do better than people who are untrained in linguistics. Automatic identification of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> sees many applications in related natural language processing and information retrieval areas, and I explore the removal of <b>light</b> verb <b>constructions</b> from verb-object pairs to improve word similarity measures for verbs.

One of the first ships to be able to fire a full cannon broadside was the English carrack the Mary Rose, built in Portsmouth from 15101512, and equipped with 78 guns (91 after an upgrade in the 1530s). It was one of the earliest purpose-built warships to serve in the English Navy (thought never to have served as a merchant ship), and her crew consisted of 200 sailors, 185 soldiers, and 30 gunners.|$|E

2500|$|Amphibious {{assaults on}} Japanese-held {{islands in the}} South and Southwest Pacific Theater had {{involved}} virtually hundreds of landing craft of all types and sizes, ranging from small craft to infantry landing craft (LCIs) and tank landing craft (LCTs). Since these specialized assault craft, of comparatively <b>light</b> <b>construction,</b> could not be repaired with the few facilities and men available to them alone, orders went out that several tank landing ships (LSTs) would be converted to special landing craft repair ships (later classified as ARL). However, modifying existing LSTs in stateside yards required time, a critical commodity in the fairly steady pace of the amphibious island-hopping campaigns, that the forces fighting at the front did not have. At this point, LST-455, then in Australian waters, came under the gaze of these amphibious planners. In one month, lathes, welding machines, as well as cutting outfits and repair tools for the necessary types of craft, were installed on board. Departmental shops of many kinds: ranging from machine shops to motor repair work, to shipfitting, to metalsmith, to electric, and radio repair, took shape in {{what had once been}} the cavernous tank deck.

60|$|But {{perhaps the}} {{greatest}} charm of the place to me was {{the beauty of the}} scenery. The Green River at this spot is as picturesque a stream as I ever remember to have seen in such a country. It lies low down between high banks, and curves hither and thither, never keeping a straight line. Its banks are wooded; but not, as is so common in America, by continuous, stunted, uninteresting forest, but by large single trees standing on small patches of meadow by the water side, with the high banks rising over them, with glades through them open for the horseman. The rides here in summer must be very lovely. Even in winter they were so, and made me in love with the place in spite of that brown, dull, barren aspect which the presence of an army always creates. I have said that the railway bridge which crossed the Green River at this spot had been destroyed by the secessionists. This had been done effectually as regarded the passage of trains, but only in part as regarded the absolute fabric of the bridge. It had been, and still was when I saw it, a beautifully <b>light</b> <b>construction,</b> made of iron and supported over a valley, rather than over a river, on tall stone piers. One of these piers had been blown up; but when we were there, the bridge had been repaired with beams and wooden shafts. This had just been completed, and an engine had passed over it. I must confess that it looked to me most perilously insecure; but the eye uneducated in such mysteries is a bad judge of engineering work. I passed with a horse backward and forward on it, and it did not tumble down then; but I confess that on the first attempt I was glad enough to lead the horse by the bridle.|$|E
