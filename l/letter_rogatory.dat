25|$|During the CBI probe Sivasankaran {{said that}} the Maran {{brothers}} had forced him to sell his 74% share in Aircel to Maxis by threatening his life, giving the CBI a list of over 10 witnesses. In September 2012, the CBI said it finished its Indian investigation and was awaiting the response to a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> sent to Malaysia and a questionnaire from T. Ananda Krishnan before filing a chargesheet. On 29 August 2014, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Dayanidhi Maran, his brother Kalanithi Maran, Malaysian businessman T Ananda Krishnan, Malaysian national Augustus Ralph Marshall, six others and four firms— Sun Direct TV Pvt Ltd, Maxis Communication Berhad, Astro All Asia Network PLC and South Asia Entertainment Holding Ltd as accused in the case. On 29 October 2014, special CBI judge OP Saini said that he found enough evidence {{to proceed with the}} prosecution and hence summoned former telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran and others as accused. Based on the CBI chargesheet, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on 1 April 2015, attached Maran brothers' properties worth Rs 742 crore.|$|E
500|$|With this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> to the British {{police to}} ask for {{assistance}} {{in their search for}} Madeleine's body. In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter. His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel's ideas as [...] "highly unlikely". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, {{with the exception of a}} search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat's property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven's apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.|$|E
50|$|A person {{seeking to}} take an action against a person located in another country may need to seek {{assistance}} from the judicial authorities in the other country. As a hypothetical example, Alice in the United States wishes to sue Roberto in Argentina. Alice issues her summons in a U.S. court, and may then petition a court in Argentina {{by means of a}} <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> to serve the process on Roberto.|$|E
50|$|<b>Letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> or <b>letters</b> of request are {{a formal}} request from {{a court to}} a foreign court for some type of {{judicial}} assistance. The most common remedies sought by <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> are service of process and taking of evidence.|$|R
50|$|For {{countries}} {{not signed}} up to any convention, <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> are still used. So for example, a plaintiff in the Netherlands which is {{signed up to}} the Hague Service Convention would still need to issue <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> to Brazil, as the latter has not signed the Convention.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parties to}} the Convention agree to offer each other [...] "the widest measure of mutual assistance" [...] in {{investigating}} crimes, procuring evidence, and in prosecuting criminal suspects. The Convention specifies the requirements that requests for legal assistance and <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> from the [...] "requesting state" [...] to the [...] "requested state" [...] have to meet. The Convention also sets out rules for the enforcement of such <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> by the authorities of the requested state.|$|R
50|$|Courts {{usually only}} have power to {{subpoena}} witnesses {{from within the}} jurisdiction of their own legislature, unless aided by foreign legislative authority. So for example Alice in the U.S. could not summon Jean from France to the U.S. courthouse. Instead the U.S. court would issue a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> to a French court, who would then examine Jean in France, and send a deposition back to the requesting court.|$|E
50|$|Service on a {{defendant}} who resides {{in a country}} outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court must comply with special procedures prescribed under the Hague Service Convention, if the recipient's country is a signatory. Service on defendants in many South American countries and some other countries is effected through the <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> process. Where {{a defendant}}'s whereabouts are unknown, the Court may permit service by publication, usually in a newspaper.|$|E
5000|$|To obtain non-public {{information}} in foreign jurisdictions requires the submission of either a [...] "Mutual Legal Assistance" [...] (MLA) request, obtain a disclosure action through a tort claim, or submit a traditional <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> through diplomatic channels. These requests {{are more likely}} to be successful when all countries involved have treaties in place, either bilateral or multilateral, to allow for legal cooperation. Notably, the UNCAC purports to provide a legal basis for international cooperation for asset recovery.|$|E
50|$|The Convention also {{specifies}} {{the requirements}} that requests for mutual assistance and <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> {{have to meet}} (transmitting authorities, languages, refusal of mutual assistance).|$|R
50|$|The CBI and the ED {{have sent}} <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> {{to as many}} as eight {{countries}} including Italy, Tunisia, Mauritius, the UAE, the UK, Switzerland, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands.|$|R
50|$|Insofar as {{requests}} to United States courts are concerned, {{the use of}} <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> for requesting the taking of evidence has been replaced {{in large part by}} applications under 28 U.S.C. section 1782, or Section 1782 Discovery.|$|R
50|$|In November 1994, when he {{appeared}} to give a press conference at the University of Aix-en-Provence on the Vasarely affair, the police arrived and attempted to challenge Debbasch's attempt to avail himself of a <b>Letter</b> <b>rogatory.</b> Alleging {{that the police had}} attempted to enter his vehicle by force without a permit, he ensconced himself in his faculty office under the guard of a group of students devoted to his cause. The judge La Gallo granted a summons on 27 November 1994. He was arrested on 28 November 1994 and detained at Baumettes Prison, where he continued to be imprisoned in provisional detention until 15 February.|$|E
50|$|International {{service of}} foreign {{judicial}} and extrajudicial documents is governed in general by the 1965 Hague Service Convention. Prior to {{the enactment of}} the Hague Service Convention, service of process in civil cases was generally effected by a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory,</b> a formal request from the court in the country where proceedings were initiated or underway to a court in another country where the defendant resided. This procedure generally required the use of consular and diplomatic channels as the request had to be made to the foreign minister (Secretary of State in the United States) of the defendant's country by the foreign minister of the originating court.|$|E
50|$|In August 2001, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba sent a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> to the US State Department, in {{accordance}} with the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), requesting a deposition by Kissinger to aid the judge's investigation of Operation Condor. On 10 September 2001, a civil suit was filed in a Washington, D.C., federal court by the family of Gen. René Schneider, murdered former Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army, asserting that Kissinger ordered Schneider's murder because he refused to endorse plans for a military coup. Schneider was killed by coup-plotters loyal to General Roberto Viaux in a botched kidnapping attempt. As part of the suit, Schneider's two sons filed for civil damages against Kissinger and then-CIA director Richard Helms for $3 million.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{was passed}} in order to {{implement}} the Hague Evidence Convention of 18 March 1970 into British law. The Hague convention applies only to civil proceedings, but the Act also contains provisions for the courts to deal with <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> in criminal matters, as well as international proceeding such as proceedings in the International Court of Justice.|$|R
5000|$|To intervene, {{through the}} Attorney General of the Republic, in the {{extradition}} {{in accordance with}} the law or treaties, and in the international <b>letters</b> or <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> to get them to their destination, after examining that they fulfill the formal requirements for their diligence and Its origin or unlawfulness, to make it known to the competent judicial authorities ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{countries}} {{are able to}} provide {{a broad range of}} mutual legal assistance to other countries through their justice ministries {{even in the absence of}} a treaty, through joint investigations between law enforcement in both nations, emergency disclosure requests, <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory,</b> etc. In some developing countries, however, domestic laws can actually create obstacles to effective law enforcement cooperation and mutual legal assistance.|$|R
50|$|Managing {{the stages}} of an asset {{recovery}} investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires {{a great deal of}} resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually {{come in the form of}} a Mutual Legal Assistance request or a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory,</b> though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.|$|E
50|$|Taking of {{evidence}} in civil cases prior to the regulation was done by either under the Hague Evidence Convention or {{by means of a}} <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> (also called a letter of request), a formal request from a court in one country to take evidence to another in which the witness is domiciled. This formal document usually required transmission from the originating court to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) in the state of origin, who then forwarded it, possibly through various embassies, to the MFA in the destination state. The foreign MFA would then pass the documents to the judicial authorities in that state, who would then go about obtaining the required evidence. The evidence would then be returned via the same long winded channels.|$|E
5000|$|On 27 February 2013, UPA-II Government {{introduced}} a motion in Rajya Sabha (the upper {{house of the}} Parliament of India) for an investigation led by a 30-member Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC). The motion was passed after a walkout {{by most of the}} opposition parties like BJP, JD(U), Trinamool Congress, CPI, TDP and AGP. During the debate, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley said the JPC was an [...] "exercise in futility" [...] and a [...] "diversionary tactic." [...] He argued that the case involved various legal aspects such as extradition of accused foreigners and custodial interrogation and the JPC can have [...] "none of these powers," [...] leaving it ineffective. Many opposition members demanded Supreme Court-monitored investigation (on the similar lines of 2G spectrum scam). Demands were also made to establish money trail and issue <b>Letter</b> <b>Rogatory</b> (LR).|$|E
50|$|The Convention {{sets out}} {{rules for the}} {{enforcement}} of <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> by the authorities of a party ("requested party") which aim to procure evidence (audition of witnesses, experts and prosecuted persons, service of writs and records of judicial verdicts) or to communicate the evidence (records or documents) in criminal proceedings undertaken by the judicial authorities of another party ("requesting party").|$|R
50|$|The main {{benefits}} of the Hague Service Convention over <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> {{is that it is}} faster (requests generally take two to four months rather than six months to one year), it uses standardized forms which should be recognized by authorities in other states, and it is cheaper (in most cases) because service can be effected by a local attorney without hiring a foreign attorney to advise on foreign service procedures.|$|R
50|$|Sant Singh Chatwal was {{a suspect}} in CBI records for 14 years. The agency had filed two charge sheets, sent <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> abroad and sent a team to the United States to imprison Chatwal and his wife from 2-5 February 1997. On 30 May 2007 and 10 August 2008 former CBI {{directors}} Vijay Shankar and Ashwani Kumar, respectively, signed no-challenge orders on the imprisonment. Later, it was decided not to appeal their release.|$|R
5000|$|This {{regulation}} {{enables a}} somewhat simplified route by establishing transmitting and receiving agencies {{in each of}} the member states. Some member states have a de-centralised system with many transmitting and receiving agencies, whereas others have a single centralised agency. The transmitting agency in one member state sends the judicial documents to the receiving agency who is then responsible for service. A <b>Letter</b> <b>Rogatory</b> is not necessary, as a standardised request form included in the annex to the regulation must be used. This aids the process by being widely recognised by the relevant authorities. In addition to service through the recipient member state's receiving agency or agencies, Article 14 of the regulation permits service on defendants directly by mail. Article 15 of the regulation allows for [...] "direct service" [...] through competent judicial officials in the member state, although some member states have opted out of that article.|$|E
50|$|For {{states which}} are not party to the Hague Service Convention, {{diplomatic}} channels are generally used for the service of legal documents. It is generally effected by a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory,</b> which is a formal request to issue a judicial order from a court in the state where proceedings are underway to a court in another state. This procedure generally requires transmission of the document to be served from the originating court to the foreign ministry {{in the state of}} origin. The foreign ministry in the state of origin forwards the request to the foreign ministry in the destination state. The foreign ministry then forwards the documents to the local court. The local court then makes an order to allow for the service. Once service is made, a certificate of service would then pass through the same channels in reverse. Under a somewhat more streamlined procedure, courts can sometimes forward service requests to the foreign ministry or the foreign court directly, cutting out one or more steps in the process.|$|E

40|$|U. S. law {{provides}} litigants with {{a variety}} of means to obtain evidence from foreign jurisdictions. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (the Federal Rules) and rules of state courts may be used if a U. S. court has jurisdiction over the person who is in control of the evidence in question. Section 1783 of tide 28 of the United States Code provides a means for serving a subpoena on U. S. nationals or residents abroad. Litigants may also obtain foreign discovery through <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> as permitted by 28 U. S. C. § 1781 and treaties such as the Hague Convention on Taking Evidence (the Hague Convention). U. S. law also provides litigants, who are before foreign or international tribunals, access to evidence in the United States through <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory,</b> the Hague Convention, and the extraordinarily generous procedure prescribed by 28 U. S. C. § 1782. Varying discovery procedures sounding in international conventions or domestic statutes coexist in the American court system; federal courts are given discretion in crafting the solution which best fits the case at bar.

5000|$|With this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a <b>letter</b> <b>rogatory</b> to the British {{police to}} ask for {{assistance}} {{in their search for}} Madeleine's body. In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter. His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel's ideas as [...] "highly unlikely". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, {{with the exception of a}} search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat's property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven's apartments, and any hired vehicles.

The foreign MFA would then pass the documents to the judicial authorities in that state, who would then go about the service procedures. Proof of service would then be returned via the same long winded channels. Member states of the European Union did conclude a convention amongst themselves regarding the subject (the Convention, drawn up on the basis of Article K.3 of the Treaty on European Union, on the service in the Member States of the European Union of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters), which was signed on 26 May 1997, but never entered into force as it was ratified only by Spain.|$|E
50|$|In the past, <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> {{could not}} usually be {{transmitted}} directly between the applicable courts, {{and had to}} be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence. One of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of <b>Letters</b> <b>Rogatory</b> was the 1905 Civil Procedure Convention, signed at The Hague. Drafted only in French, it was only ratified by 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, drafted in both English and French commanded more support. The Hague Service Convention, ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states including the United Kingdom and the United States, neither of whom had ratified the 1905 convention. The Hague Evidence Convention, ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. This convention has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among Member States of the European Union, two regulations, 1348/2000 and 1206/2001 superseded the two Hague Conventions. These two regulations apply to each of the Member States of the European Union with the exception of Denmark, which opted out.|$|R
25|$|Possible undue {{hardship}} for the defendant. The defendant must explain what the hardship {{is and how}} material the costs are. If there are costs involved, {{they need to be}} spelled out. If there is a difficulty in getting witnesses out of a foreign court and into the original court, this needs to be revealed to the court. The defendant must explain why the use of <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> or other judicial reciprocity tools are not sufficient and cannot replace actual transfer of the case. The standard that the defendant must meet is “overwhelming hardship” if they are required to litigate in the forum’s State.|$|R
50|$|As Eurojust is {{tasked with}} facilitating the {{execution}} of <b>letters</b> <b>rogatory</b> and extradition requests, it also may act on European Arrest Warrants (EAW).

It is also the body to which member states may report delays in execution of EAWs {{of the reason for}} such delay. In 2010, a total of 280 cases concerning {{the execution of}} EAWs were registered at Eurojust, amounting to almost 20 per cent of all cases.|$|R
