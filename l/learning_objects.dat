In this paper we introduce a architecture for adaptability and adaptivity of learning object‟s interface. A <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> adapts itself to the user; it is not the user who must adapt her/himself to the <b>learning</b> <b>object.</b> This adaptation implies the design of the <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> interface, which includes the processes and structures for adaptivity and adaptability. The paper includes a discussion of the architecture, its components, and {{a detailed description of the}} sequence of actions for adaptive interaction...|$|R

40|$|Challenged {{by some of}} the {{inherent}} difficulties in teaching qualitative data analysis, three instructors created an interactive digital <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> entitled “Sleuthing the Layered Text: Investigating Coding. ” In this paper we assess the effectiveness of that <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> as a tool for teaching qualitative coding. On the face of it, learning objects—a form of instructional technology that has been criticized for tending to be objectivist and content-driven—would appear to be ill-suited for teaching qualitative analysis, an open-ended, interpretive and subjective process. However, based on student evaluations from two very different undergraduate courses, we found that the <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> did prove to be an effective medium for teaching coding. We attribute this success to its design, which incorporates best practices of classroom instructors, and also to the integration of the <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> into our courses. Nevertheless, student feedback cautions us that the <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> is not a technological fix. The degree to which students valued the <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> over other methods of instruction was moderate, and some were leery about this form of digital technology substituting for classroom teaching, even though this was not our intention. Qualitative data analysis is notoriously difficult to teach and made even more difficult when taught in th...|$|R

It proposes a specific approach to support the indexing and retrieval of training courses {{with regard to the}} professions’ target competences. This approach is grounded on <b>Learning</b> <b>Object</b> metadata, and semantic web (SW) technologies enabling advanced search and reasoning on <b>Learning</b> <b>Object</b> description. We intend to implement it using the KINOA prototype platform that contains an annotation editor and a semantic search server. The approach requires that a semantic <b>Learning</b> <b>Object</b> repository is built on several existing data sources. Standards from IEEE LOM and AICC are used {{as a starting point for}} the building of the semantic <b>learning</b> <b>object</b> repository and extended to fit with our needs and context...|$|R

To support discoverability, <b>learning</b> <b>objects</b> are described by Learning Object Metadata, formalized as IEEE 1484.12 Learning object metadata. To support reusability, the IMS Consortium proposed a series of specifications such as the IMS Content package. And to support interoperability, the U.S. military's Advanced Distributed Learning organization created the Sharable Content Object Reference Model. <b>Learning</b> <b>objects</b> were designed {{in order to reduce the}} cost of learning, standardize learning content, and to enable the use and reuse of learning content by learning management systems.|$|E
