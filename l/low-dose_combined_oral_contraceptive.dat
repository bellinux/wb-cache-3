40|$|Background: Functional ovarian cysts include follicular, corpus luteum, and theca lutein cysts are {{the most}} common adnexal masses (about 50 %) in women of {{reproductive}} age. Treatment with the combined monophasic oral contraceptives reduces functional ovarian cysts. Yaz (drospirenone/ethinyl estradiol) is a <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> pill containing 20 μg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg drospirenone. In addition to contraceptive effects, Yaz has anti-mineralocorticoid and anti-adrenergic effects. Ovocept- low-dose LD is also a <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> drug containing 30 μg ethinyl estradiol and 3 mg norgestrol. Ovocept-LD has some side-effects such as weight gain, spotting, breast tenderness, nausea, and headache. Materials and Methods: Being a clinical study, the present research was carried out on 42 patients with the simple ovarian cysts from 2010 to 2012. 84 Patients were assigned to A and B groups. Group A received Yaz once a day for a period of 28 days and group B received Ovocept-LD once a day for a period of 21 days. After treating by Yaz and Ovocept-LD, Cysts were evaluated by ultrasound. Results were analyzed by the SPSS software. A P < 0. 05 was considered the significance threshold. Results : Obtained results indicated that both Yaz and Ovocept-LD had an effect on the simple ovarian cysts. Statistical tests, however, has shown that the effect of Yaz has been significantly more than that of Ovocept-LD. Conclusion: Given the faster and better recovery effect, and the lesser side effects of Yaz as compared to Ovocept-LD, it is recommended to use Yaz for the simple ovarian cysts...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} an artificial menstrual cycle on brain structure and activity in young women using metabolic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

40|$|Heavy menstrual {{bleeding}} or menorrhagia is {{a common}} menstrual disorder. Currently, both medical and surgical treatment options are available {{for the management of}} heavy menstrual bleeding. Hysterectomy, one of the surgical treatment options is associated with risks and is a costly procedure. Medical treatment may be preferred for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding. Oral medical treatments have various limitations for their use. For instance, cost is a limiting factor for tranexamic acid. Limited data is available to support the effectiveness of oral contraceptives. Poor patient compliance and intolerable adverse events are some other limitations especially in long term use. Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is one of the common medical modalities in the management of heavy menstrual bleeding. LNG-IUS has been compared with other medical options like tranexamic acid, mefenamic acid, combined estrogen-progestogen, or progesterone alone, cyclic oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) oral norethisterone and <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive.</b> LNG-IUS is more effective than usual medical treatment and also reduces the effect of heavy menstrual bleeding on quality of life.

40|$|The Pill has {{undergone}} many changes since its first appearance some 50 years ago. Key developments included {{the reduction of}} ethinylestradiol doses and the synthesis of new progestins {{in order to increase}} safety, compliance and efficiency. <b>Low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) are currently the preferred option for millions of women.

Yet in spite of major improvements, there is still an associated risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The next step in COCs' evolution should take total estrogenicity and hepatic estro-androgenic balance into account. The focus on the estrogen component - which has not changed in 50 years - has yielded a new class of natural estrogen pills.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlthough most <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) include 7 -day hormone-free {{intervals}} (HFIs), these COCs could incompletely suppress ovarian activity. ObjectivesTo {{review the}} impact of HFIs on ovarian suppression and tolerability, and evaluate the utility of COCs without traditional 7 -day HFIs. Search strategyPubMed was searched for clinical studies published in English between January 1980 and April 2015 on {{the impact of}} HFIs and HFI modifications in COCs. Selection criteriaArticles assessing contraceptive efficacy or tolerability as the primary focus were included. Data collection and analysisAbstracts of 319 articles were screened. ResultsAnalysis of the 161 articles selected revealed that suppression of ovarian activity with low-dose COCs with 7 -day HFIs is suboptimal. Loss of ovarian suppression during 7 -day HFIs is commonly associated with follicular development, and most dominant follicles appear during this period. By contrast, increased ovarian suppression was noted in regimens that shortened or eliminated the HFI, or that substituted low-dose ethinyl estradiol for the HFI. ConclusionsExtended regimens with modified HFIs may provide greater ovarian suppression with the potential for increased contraceptive effectiveness. Additional research is needed to evaluate whether COC regimens that include 10 μg ethinyl estradiol instead of an HFI may improve tolerability...|$|R

To evaluate new epidemiological data and to propose clinical consequences. A literature survey. Studies assessing the risk of specific types of hormonal contraception were evaluated, compared and set into a clinical perspective. The majority of newer studies have demonstrated a threefold increased risk of VTE in current users of medium- and <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) with norethisterone, levonorgestrel (LNG) or norgestimate compared with non-users. The same studies have demonstrated a sixfold increased risk of VTE in users of combined pills with desogestrel, gestodene, drospirenone or cyproteroneacetate, and in users of the contraceptive vaginal ring, compared with non-users. The rate ratio of VTE between users of COCs with newer progestogens compared with users of COCs with LNG was 1. 5 - 2. 8 in seven studies and 1. 0 in two studies. Progestogen-only contraception did not confer an increased risk of VTE in any study. The incidence rate of VTE in non-pregnant women aged 15 - 49 years using non-hormonal contraception is three per 10 000 years. For women starting on hormonal contraception, we recommend medium- or <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> pills with norethisterone, LNG or norgestimate as first-choice preparations. For the many women who are users of COCs with newer progestogens, although the absolute risk of VTE is low, a change to combined pills with norethisterone, LNG or norgestimate may halve their risk of VTE. Finally, we recommend COCs with 20 μg estrogen combined with the older progestogens to be launched in the Scandinavian countries. Women at an increased risk of VTE should consider progestogen-only contraception or non-hormonal contraception...|$|R
40|$|PIP: At the University Hospital in Lund, Sweden, {{researchers}} grouped healthy nulliparous {{women aged}} 19 - 25 into current, former, and never users of <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (OCs) {{to examine the}} effect of the OCs on the levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). The subjects were from two independent samples. Based on the day the blood was sampled, their hormone level readings were divided into follicular and luteal phases. Former OC users had higher FSH levels than did never users, regardless of menstrual cycle phase (group 1 : 1. 9 vs. 1. 6 mcg/l for follicular phase, 1. 6 vs. 1 mcg/l for luteal phase; p = 0. 004) (group 2 : 2. 05 vs. 1. 7 mcg/l, 1. 55 vs. 1. 25 mcg/l; p = 0. 028). The transient increase of FSH levels appeared to peak 12 months after the women stopped using the OC. The researchers found that the temporary increase in FSH levels was still significant after they excluded eight women with low progesterone levels (10 nmol/l in luteal phase and 3. 5 nmol/l in follicular phase) and adjusted for age (p = 0. 015). LH levels were much higher in former users than never users in the first sample (1. 6 vs. 1 mcg/l for follicular phase, 1. 8 vs. 1. 15 mcg/l for luteal phase; p = 0. 014), but not in the second sample. Smoking and time since awakening had no effect on FSH and LH levels. Present users experienced suppressed FSH and LH levels. These findings indicate that former OC users experience a rebound-like phenomenon in FSH levels. Since the sample size was small and only one blood sample was taken from each woman at each of the sampling times, the researchers caution that these findings are preliminary and unconfirmed...|$|R

Methods: This was a non-randomized parallel-control study with a 1 -year follow-up. Sixty-seven adolescents aged from 12 to 19 years, divided into COC users (n = 41) taking 20 mu g ethinylestradiol/ 150 mu g desogestrel and COC non-user controls (n = 26), were evaluated by bone densitometry examinations at baseline and after 12 months. Comparisons between the groups at the study onset were performed using the Mann-Whitney test with the significance level fixed at 5 % or p < 0. 05. Comparisons between the groups at the study onset and after 12 months were based on variations in the median percentages for bone mass variables. Results: The COC users presented with low bone mass acquisition in the lumbar spine, and had BMD and BMC median variations of 2. 07 % and + 1. 57 %, respectively, between the measurements at baseline and 12 months.

40|$|Contraception is an {{important}} issue for women with diabetes mellitus as unplanned pregnancy can present major maternal and perinatal complications. The rising incidence of diabetes worldwide means increasing thought needs to be given to contraceptive options for these women. This article reviews current evidence and recommends best practice for prescribing hormonal contraceptives in women with diabetes. Women with diabetes have the same choice of contraceptives as the general population, but the potential metabolic effects of hormonal methods need to be considered in relation to an individual’s diabetic profile and their need for effective contraception. Currently, there appear to be wide variations in the way that professionals evaluate the risk-benefit equation, and significant differences in prescribing practice have been identified. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established medical eligibility criteria to assist in assessing such risks. Cardiovascular disease is a major concern, and for women with diabetes who have macrovascular or microvascular complications, nonhormonal methods are recommended. Studies of young women with diabetes and no vascular changes who are taking <b>low-dose</b> <b>combined</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptives</b> (COCs) have been reassuring, although larger long-term studies are needed. There is little evidence that any changes in glycemic control caused by COCs are of clinical relevance. While low-dose COCs appear to cause minimal change in the lipid profile and may even be beneficial in this respect, there are some concerns in relation to progestogen only pills and injectable contraceptives in certain women. There is little evidence of best practice for the follow-up of women with diabetes prescribed hormonal contraception. It is generally agreed that blood pressure, weight, and body mass index measurements should be ascertained, and blood glucose levels and baseline lipid profiles assessed as relevant. Research on hormonal contraception has been carried out in healthy populations; more studies are needed in women with diabetes and women who have increased risks of cardiovascular disease...|$|R

Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the safety and efficacy of a flexible extended regimen of ethinylestradiol/drospirenone (flexible regimen) in Japanese women with dysmenorrhea. Methods: This multicenter, open-label study was performed in Japanese women with dysmenorrhea who, after a baseline observational phase, were randomized to receive ethinylestradiol 20 µg/drospirenone 3 mg in a flexible regimen (one tablet each day for 24 – 120 days followed by a 4 -day tablet-free interval) or in the standard 28 d regimen (one tablet each day for 24 days, followed by 4 days of placebo tablets for six cycles). The primary endpoint was the number of days with dysmenorrhea of at least mild intensity over a 140 -day evaluation period. Dysmenorrhea scores, bleeding patterns, and other pain-related parameters were also assessed. Results: A total of 216 women (mean age 29. 7 years) were randomized to the flexible regimen (n= 108) or 28 d regimen (n= 108) and 212 were included in the full analysis sets (flexible regimen, n= 105; 28 d regimen, n= 107). Women in the flexible-regimen group reported a mean of 3. 4 fewer days with dysmenorrheic pain than women in the 28 d-regimen group, with similar decreases in disease severity reported in both treatment groups. According to the investigators, 64. 8 % and 59. 4 % of women in the flexible-regimen and 28 d-regimen treatment groups had “very much improved” or “much improved” disease, while 54. 3 % and 50. 9 % of patients reported being “very much satisfied” or “much satisfied” with their treatment, respectively.

The mean levels of fasting glucose and insulin were similar at baseline and after 13 treatment cycles, whereas C-peptide and free fatty acid levels decreased slightly in both groups. All blood glucose and insulin values measured in the oral glucose tolerance tests were within normal ranges, despite a slight increase in the mean areas under the curves of 0 - 3 h [AUCs (0 - 3 h) ] of both variables from baseline to treatment cycle 13. Differences between both treatments were not statistically significant. The mean AUCs (0 - 3 h) for C-peptide were not markedly changed in any treatment group. Free fatty acid levels decreased by 42 % in the drospirenone group and increased by 48. 9 % in the desogestrel group, in terms of means of individual changes. Both preparations were well tolerated and equally efficacious regarding contraception and cycle control. The mean body weight was slightly decreased in most cycles during treatment with the drospirenone combination, as compared to baseline, while it was slightly increased versus baseline in all cycles during treatment with the desogestrel combination.

The primary target variables were total high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL 2 cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. These and additional lipid and lipoprotein fractions were measured at baseline and in the 3 rd, 6 th and 13 th treatment cycles in a total of 50 volunteers, and also assessed after density gradient ultracentrifugation. A slight increase in mean total HDL cholesterol vs. baseline was found for the DRSP group (+ 12. 8 %) and the DSG group (+ 11. 8 %) after 13 treatment cycles. HDL 2 cholesterol did not change remarkably in both groups. The mean LDL cholesterol values increased by 10. 6 % vs. baseline in the DSG group and remained nearly stable in the DRSP group (+ 1. 8 %). All measured values remained within the reference ranges. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the two treatment groups for those primary endpoints. A slight rise in mean total cholesterol was found for all cycles after the initiation of treatment. The mean increase after I year of treatment was approximately 8 % in both treatment groups. Mean triglyceride levels increased for both treatment groups without leaving the reference range. The increase for total triglycerides was + 73. 6 % in the DRSP group and + 61. 3 % in DSG group. For total phospholipids, an increase of + 13. 6 % (DRSP) and + 18. 5 % (DSG) over 13 cycles was measured. The apolipoproteins Apo A-I, Apo A-II and Apo B increased slightly more during DRSP treatment than during DSG treatment. The reduction of Apo E was similar in both groups. Lipoprotein (a) remained stable in the DRSP group, whereas it increased by + 10. 8 % in the DSG group. In conclusion, the <b>combined</b> <b>low-dose</b> <b>oral</b> <b>contraceptive</b> Yasmin, with 30 mug ethinylestradiol and 3 mg of the novel progestogen drospirenone,,as well as the reference preparation, had little impact on the lipid profile. While both preparations displayed a favorable lipid profile with increased total HDL cholesterol, the antiandrogenic or missing androgenic activity of Yasmin may be regarded as responsible for the stable LDL cholesterol levels. As a result, the ratio of total HDL:LDL was increased, a pattern that is usually considered clinically beneficial with respect to cardiovascular disease risk. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.
