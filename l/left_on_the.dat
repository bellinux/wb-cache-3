In the 1010s, {{during the reign of}} Catholicos Sarkis I, a mausoleum dedicated to the Hripsimean virgins was erected next to the cathedral. The mausoleum was built on some of the remnants of the virgins brought from Vagharshapat (Etchmiadzin). In the 1040s–1050s inscriptions were <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cathedral's eastern and western walls about urban projects, such as restoration of defensive walls, installation of water pipes and easing of the tax burden on the residents of Ani.|$|E

5|$|After the Bulls {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 Bulls (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roster, the Bulls missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E
5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of {{the casting}} it is inspected for defects. The most common defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface of the casting due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|Another {{high-profile}} clash came {{more than}} 20 years later, {{in the final}} of the FA Cup on 12 May 1979. A capacity crowd saw Arsenal take a 2–0 lead in the first half thanks to goals from Brian Talbot and Frank Stapleton, and with just five minutes <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clock their lead was still intact. Then, in the 86th minute, Gordon McQueen pulled a goal back for United, and two minutes later they equalised with a goal from Sammy McIlroy. However, barely a minute after United equalised, Arsenal's Alan Sunderland scored an 89th-minute goal to win the cup 3–2 for Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the city}} and the horizon are several rural islands, which today form part of central Stockholm. Behind the church and the castle is Skeppsholmen, which for centuries served as a base for the Swedish Navy {{together}} with Kastellholmen islet, which can be seen above the Blackfriars monastery. To the left of Skeppsholmen are two small islets, which are today merged into the peninsula of Blasieholmen. Behind these islands are Djurgården (right), Östermalm, and Norra Djurgården (<b>left).</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> horizon, the Lilla Värtan strait passes in front of Lidingö and, arguably, the interior islands of the Stockholm archipelago.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{consists}} of three rounds. A team of four contestants starts the game; one player is eliminated after two rounds of play. For each question, the team has 60 seconds to unanimously agree on an answer; the available money decreases the longer it takes. Each contestant must enter the same response on their respective panel and then everyone must simultaneously lock in an answer and stop the clock. If the team answers the question correctly, they bank whatever money is <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> clock; if they are wrong, or if time runs out, their bank is reduced by half.|$|E
5|$|Few {{buildings}} are <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{north side of}} the highway. The most notable are the wooden Southern Pacific saltbox-style section house and workers' bunkhouse, both built in 1887. A train depot and post office both stood in this area, but have been torn down. Three extant farmworkers' bungalows, built by the Del Valle family in 1916, are located west of the section house.|$|E

5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in stunted and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or stunted growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there.|$|E

5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves, while upper class members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands. The loss of such {{a large amount of}} mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of mummia, a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.|$|E
5|$|Otherwise, {{their stay}} in Paris {{was filled with}} well-wishers who came to call at the hotel.

He was given {{a tour of the}} headquarters of Le Figaro, and visited the Société de géographie. On August 15, the royal group, which now included Hoffnung, <b>left</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> evening train, bound for Portugal and Spain.|$|E
