40|$|By a {{convenient}} coincidence, this year marks the fiftieth {{anniversary of the}} Housing Act of 1949, celebrated widely in housing circles (and unnoticed elsewhere). That act enunciated the national housing goal: “a decent home in a suitable living environment for every American family. ” That’s a useful framework for considering the housing and neighborhoods in which children live: (1) housing—whether children live in decent homes, (2) neighborhoods—whether children live in suitable living environments, and (3) the homeless—the {{people who do not}} live in any home at all. Housing policy is different from other social welfare issues. Housing programs are fundamentally different from the other programs discussed in this volume, and housing policy analysts use different data sources and different measures of well-being. This chapter therefore describes housing data sources in some detail before discussing the substantive questions. One fundamental difference between housing and other social welfare programs is that housing assistance is not an entitlement. Until TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families), housing was the only major <b>low-income</b> <b>benefit</b> program that was not an entitlement, and in the entire history of federal housing programs, going back to the 1930 s, it never has been. Less than 30 percent of eligible households with children receive assistance. We are all familiar with the stereotypical welfare mother living in public housing, so it is worth pointing out that the stereotype is not the norm in either welfare or housing. In 1996, only about 25 percent of the households on AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{summarize}} the findings reported recently in the literature on non-energy benefits attributable to the weatherizing of <b>low-income</b> homes. Non-energy <b>benefits</b> are divided into three major categories: (1) ratepayer benefits; (2) household benefits; and (3) societal benefits. The ratepayer benefits can be divided into two main subcategories: payment-related benefits and service-provision benefits. Similarly, there are two key types of household benefits: those associated with affordable housing and those related to safety, health and comfort. Societal benefits can be classified as either environmental, social, or economic. Our study found the total lifetime value for all non-energy benefit-categories to be $ 3346 (in 2001 dollars) per household, which is slightly greater than the average value of energy savings for houses heated by natural gas, and substantially higher than the total cost per <b>low-income</b> weatherization. Societal <b>benefits</b> were much larger than either ratepayer or household <b>benefits.</b> <b>Low-income</b> weatherization Nonenergy <b>benefits...</b>|$|R

No matter how homogeneous the membership of an association or cooperative is, differential participation can create interest groups within the association that will determine the group cohesion {{and the use of}} resources.

40|$|Since the 1970 s, {{international}} {{preservation and}} funding agencies have promoted revitalization projects {{in developing countries}} aiming to, among other things, <b>benefit</b> <b>low-income</b> communities. For the most part, these projects have resulted in visibly improved physical spaces, reflecting upgraded infrastructure along with conservation of the architectural fabric. These outcomes are impressive in light of decades of neglect and decay. The impact on low-income residents, however, remains obscure. In what cases have the poor really benefited from these revitalization projects? Through what specific channels can <b>low-income</b> communities <b>benefit</b> from interventions? How have governments in these countries responded to the external pressure to <b>benefit</b> <b>low-income</b> residents given their often limited institutions and budgets? This thesis seeks address these questions. In particular, it aims to understand {{the conditions under which}} revitalization projects in historic cities of developing countries can <b>benefit</b> <b>low-income</b> communities. It begins by considering the evolution of international philosophy, following the shift from a central focus on monument preservation to that of urban revitalization, with a notable difference being the incorporation of social objectives in the latter phase. It then turns to exploring how these goals of revitalization have played out in two World Heritage Cities, Tunis and Quito. Findings indicate that low-income residents have indeed benefited from revitalization projects in both cases. Drawing from these experiences, this thesis reveals four common elements in the process through which this favorable outcome was achieved: 1) a significant component of public participation, 2) a semi-public development agency with operational flexibility and innovative financing strategies, 3) international catalysts in the form of World Heritage recognition and collaboration with international organizations and agencies, and 4) image improvement leading to a renewed self-image of the neighborhood. While these four elements by no means offer a template for success, they do indicate institutional structures that may support developing countries' efforts to reach the poor while revitalizing their cities. by T.

Relative poverty {{does not necessarily mean}} the child is lacking anything, but is more a reflection of inequality in society. Child poverty, when measured using relative thresholds, will only improve if <b>low-income</b> families <b>benefit</b> more from economic advances than well-off families. Measures of child poverty using income thresholds will vary depending on whether relative or absolute poverty is measured and what threshold limits are applied. Using a relative measure, poverty is much higher in the US than in Europe, but if an absolute measure is used, then poverty in some European countries is higher. It is argued that using income as the only threshold ignores the multidimensional aspect of child poverty, which includes consumption requirements, access to resources and the ability to interact in society safely and without discrimination.|$|R
