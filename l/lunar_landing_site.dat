40|$|The {{basis of}} the project was {{creating}} a scale model representation of the Apollo 17 <b>lunar</b> <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> Vital components included surface slope characteristics, crater sizes and locations, prominent rocks, and lighting conditions. The model was made for Project M support when evaluating approach and terminal descent as well as when planning surface operations with respect to the terrain. The project had five main mi lestones during the length of the project. The first was examining the best method to use to re-create the Apollo 17 landing site and then reviewing research fmdings with Dr. Tim Crain and EO staff which occurred on June 25, 2010 at a meeting. The second step was formulating a construction plan, budget, and schedule and then presenting the plan for authority to proceed which occurred on July 6, 2010. The third part was building a prototype to test materials and building processes which were completed by July 13, 2010. Next was assembling the landing site model and presenting a mid-term construction status report on July 29, 2010. The fifth and final milestone was demonstrating the model and presenting an exit pitch which happened on August 4, 2010. The project was very technical: it needed a lot of research about moon topography, lighting conditions and angles of the sun on the moon, Apollo 17, and Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT), before starting the actual building process. This required using Spreadsheets, searching internet sources and conducting personal meetings with project representatives. This information assisted the interns in deciding the scale of the model with respect to cracks, craters and rocks and their relative sizes as the objects mentioned could interfere with any of the Lunar Landers: Apollo, Project M and future Landers. The project concluded with the completion of a three dimensional scale model of the Apollo 17 <b>Lunar</b> <b>landing</b> <b>site.</b> This model assists Project M members because they can now visualize approach phase, terminal descent phase, and surface phase operations on the physical model.

40|$|The Schrödinger basin on {{the lunar}} farside is ~ 320 km in {{diameter}} and the best-preserved peak-ring basin of its size in the Earth–Moon system. Spectral and photogeologic analyses of data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on the Chandrayaan- 1 spacecraft and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) on the LRO spacecraft indicate the peak ring is composed of anorthositic, noritic, and troctolitic lithologies that were juxtaposed by several cross-cutting faults during peak ring formation. Hydrocode simulations indicate the lithologies were uplifted from depths up to 30 km, representing the crust of the lunar farside.

This translational Delta-V budget accounts for Earth-based LEO rendezvous with the lunar surface access module (LSAM) /Earth departure stage (EDS) stack, orbit maintenance during the lunar surface stay, an on-orbit plane change to align the CEV orbit for an in-plane LSAM ascent, and the Moon-to-Earth trans-Earth injection (TEI) maneuver sequence as well as post-TEI TCMs. Additionally, the CEV will have to execute TEI maneuver sequences while observing Earth atmospheric entry interface objectives for lunar high-latitude to equatorial sortie missions as well as near-polar sortie and long duration missions. The combination of these objectives places a premium on appropriately designed trajectories both to and from the Moon to accurately size the translational V and associated propellant mass in the CEV reference configuration and to demonstrate the feasibility of anytime Earth return for all lunar missions.

40|$|One of the {{critical}} datasets for optimal selection of future lunar landing sites is local- to regional-scale topography. Lunar base site selection will require such data for both engineering and scientific operations purposes. The Lunar Geoscience Orbiter or Lunar Observer is the ideal precursory science mission from which to obtain this required information. We suggest that a simple laser altimeter instrument could be employed to measure local-scale slopes, heights, and depths of lunar surface features important to lunar base planning and design. For this reason, we have designed and are currently constructing a breadboard of a Lunar Observer Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument capable of acquiring contiguous-footprint topographic profiles with both 30 -m and 300 -m along-track resolution. This instrument meets all the severe weight, power, size, and data rate limitations imposed by Observer-class spacecraft. In addition, LOLA {{would be capable of}} measuring the within-footprint vertical roughness of the lunar surface, and the 1. 06 -micron relative surface reflectivity at normal incidence. We have used airborne laser altimeter data for a few representative lunar analog landforms to simulate and analyze LOLA performance in a 100 -km lunar orbit. We demonstrate that this system in its highest resolution mode (30 -m diameter footprints) would quantify the topography of all but the very smallest lunar landforms. At its global mapping resolution (300 -m diameter footprints), LOLA would establish the topographic context for <b>lunar</b> <b>landing</b> <b>site</b> selection by providing the basis for constructing a 1 - 2 km spatial resolution global, geodetic topographic grid that would contain a high density of observations (e. g., approximately 1000 observations per each 1 deg by 1 deg cell at the lunar equator).
