Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a <b>loop</b> <b>pile.</b> There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|E

Christy & Sons Ltd - established by banker and hatter William Miller Christy - was manufacturing cotton goods. Christy's son, the noted collector and ethnologist Henry Christy, discovered the product that would make the company famous. While travelling in Istanbul, he saw an example of the <b>looped</b> <b>pile</b> fabric that is known today as terry towelling, but which was initially known as the 'Turkish towel'.The company found a method of weaving the <b>looped</b> <b>pile</b> fabric on an industrial scale using a machine designed by one of their employees Samuel Holt, who patented the design. The first Christy towels factory opened in Droylsden in 1850. A year later, Christy towels were displayed at The Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace, Queen Victoria became an early client. By 1891, the company's Fairfields Mill in Droylsden had 310 looms and 30,000 spindles, according to Worrall's Cotton Spinners Directory.|$|R

40|$|When {{a certain}} effect in {{textiles}} {{can be achieved}} on two different weaving apparatuses, it is common practice to assume the simpler method to be the more primitive and thus antecedent to the more advanced technique. This paper will discuss two unique Japanese weaving methods that testify {{to the fact that}} simple techniques do not always predate their more sophisticated counterparts. In these examples, the simpler weaving methods were actually created in imitation of preexisting textiles from other regions that had been woven on more complex looms. The first of these examples is the Japanese method for voided velvet; the other is a double cloth woven on the small island of Hachijo. Thanks to its location {{at the end of the}} Silk Road, the island nation of Japan was for centuries a cultural reservoir for numerous treasures imported from its Asian neighbors and far-off continents. Chinese and Korean artisans began immigrating to Japan in around the fifth century, bringing with them advanced technology from their respective cultures. At the same time, native Japanese artisans invented weaving methods to imitate the foreign textiles they saw, often without any knowledge of the original techniques they were trying to emulate. Over Japan 2 ̆ 7 s long history, there have been two periods when the foreign influence on textile culture was especially strong. The first of these periods was during the 7 th and 8 th centuries, when large quantities of primarily Chinese textiles were imported into Japan. Some of these still exist today in the Shoso-in Repository in the ancient capital of Nara. The other wave of foreign textiles into Japan took place between the 15 th and 18 th centuries, coming from such far reaches as Yuan- and Ming-dynasty China, India, Southeast Asia, and Europe. Among the treasures imported during these centuries were numerous patterned weaves that had been created in far off lands using highly advanced techniques. One of precious textiles in the later group was Chinese velvet. Japanese weavers had long puzzled as to how to make <b>looped</b> <b>pile</b> on the surface of silk fabrics, a secret that the Chinese had guarded for centuries. The way in which this technique eventually arrived in Japan is described in an Edo-period book, which tells that a metal rod was accidentally left in the loop of a velvet textile imported into Japan around 1650. With this fortuitous discovery, Japanese weavers finally understood that the raised <b>pile</b> <b>loops</b> were formed with wire rods...|$|R

50|$|On {{mechanical}} looms {{the technology}} of 'wire weaving' still exists, using modern technology and electronics. This weaving technique allows users to obtain both <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> and cut pile in the same fabric.

By cutting the pile ends in between the two layers one obtains two separate pile fabrics. With this technique only the cut pile effect can be obtained. This is known as 'face-to-face weaving'. Both 'wire weaving' and 'face-to-face' weaving are used for the manufacturing of upholstery and furnishing fabrics as well as in rug making (knotted-pile carpet).|$|E

50|$|Originally people {{refused to}} take de Mestral seriously when he took his idea to Lyon, which was then a center of weaving. He did manage to gain the help of one weaver, who made two cotton strips that worked. However, the cotton wore out quickly, so de Mestral turned to {{synthetic}} fibers. He settled on nylon as being the best synthetic, which had several advantages: it doesn’t break down, rot, or attract mold, {{and it could be}} produced in threads of various thickness. Nylon had only recently been invented, and through trial and error de Mestral eventually discovered that, when sewn under hot infrared light, nylon forms small hook shapes. However, he had yet {{to figure out a way}} to mechanize the process, and to make the looped side. Next he found that nylon thread, when woven in loops and heat-treated, retains its shape and is resilient; however, the loops had to be cut in just the right spot so that they could be fastened and unfastened many times. On the verge of giving up, a new idea came to him. He bought a pair of shears and trimmed the tops off the loops, thus creating hooks that would match up perfectly with the <b>loops</b> in the <b>pile.</b>|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpet, residential cut pile carpet, or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on cut pile carpet than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> carpet at both contamination levels.

The structure of the terry fabric is characterized by its complex weave which is obtained through interlacing two systems of warp and one system of weft. The <b>loop</b> <b>pile</b> is one of the most important elements of the terry woven fabric structure because the appearance of the product and many other properties depend on the loops formed on the surface of terry fabrics. Water absorption is important for terry fabrics as well. Consequently, in this study, water vapour absorption and water evaporation from terry fabrics are investigated. Other extremely important physical properties of terry woven fabrics are their permeability properties. Absorption and desorption properties of woven fabrics depend on their air permeability. Mechanical properties of terry fabrics are among the most important characteristics determining the service capability of the product; the strength properties of the products are influenced by the fabric strength and durability. Terry fabric finishing methods are being developed seeking not only to improve the fabric’s appearance or to provide it with additional functional properties but also in order to increase the demand for terry woven fabrics. The assessment of terry fabric wear was determined investigating the changes in mechanical properties after abrasion impact.
