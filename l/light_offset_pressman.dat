40|$|AbstractMelanopsin, a novel photopigment, has {{recently}} been localized to a population of retinal ganglion cells that display inherent photosensitivity. During continuous light and following <b>light</b> <b>offset,</b> primates are known to exhibit sustained pupilloconstriction responses that resemble closely the photoresponses of intrinsically-photoreceptive ganglion cells. We report that, in the behaving macaque, following pharmacological blockade of conventional photoreceptor signals, significant pupillary responses persist during continuous light and following <b>light</b> <b>offset.</b> These pupil responses display the unique spectral tuning, slow kinetics, and irradiance coding of the sustained, melanopsin-derived ganglion cell photoresponses. We extended our observations to humans by using the sustained pupil response following <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> to document the contribution of these novel ganglion cells to human pupillary responses.

40|$|Phasic {{and tonic}} light {{responses}} provide a fundamental division of visual {{information that is}} thought to originate in the inner retina. However, evidence presented here indicates that this duality originates in the outer retina. In response to a steady light stimulus, the temporal responses of On-bipolar cells fell into two groups.

The overeating was eliminated by administration of the D 2 antagonist raclopride. Another expectancy, timing of <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> in rats entrained to a fixed light-dark cycle, was violated by unexpectedly turning the lights off 1 h early. This provoked an elevation in food intake, which was also eliminated by the administration of raclopride. Feeding in two other situations not involving violation of expectancies (food deprivation; normal <b>light</b> <b>offset)</b> was unaffected by DA antagonism. These findings support the idea that DA signals errors in expectancy and that DA signaling is necessary for certain behavioral responses to unexpected events. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|ABSTRACT The lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis has an all-cone retina. In lizards {{maintained}} on a 12 -h light: 12 -h dark (12 L: 12 D) cycle, a {{burst of}} cone outer segment (COS) shedding occurs 2 h after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> (1400 h circadian time) (Young, R. W., 1977, /. Ultrastruct. Res. 61 : 172 - 72). In this investigation, we studied the effect of different lighting regimes on the pattern of cone disk shedding in this species. When lizards entrained to a 121 -: 12 D cycle are kept in constant darkness (DD), the shedding peak is advanced- 2 h and the magnitude of shedding is reduced to 30 % of control. COS increased in mean length from 12 Am in controls to 14 Am after one cycle in DD and maintained this length during a second cycle in DD. In constant light (LL), disk shedding was damped to- 10 % of control values. Shedding synchrony in LL was also perturbed and therefore cyclic shedding bursts could not be distinguished. During LL there was a much larger increase in COS mean length than in DD. After one cycle of LL, COS length was 15 Am and after two cycles COS length exceeded 17 Am. When lizards entrained to 121 -: 1 2 D are shifted to a 6 L: 18 D regimen, the first shedding cycle is biphasic. The first peak of 5 % shedding occurs 2 h after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> whereas a second larger peak (13 %) occurs according to the entrained schedule (1400 h). This manipulation separates out a dark triggered and circadian shedding component, which is normally superimposed in lizards entrained to a 12 L: 12 D cycle. When entrained lizards are placed in 36 h of LL followed by <b>light</b> <b>offset,</b> the peak shedding response after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> is double the control response (53 % vs. 27 %). After 30 h of LL (lights off 90 ° out of phase), there is a biphasic shedding response similar to the ó-: 18 D regimen although this time the dark-triggered shedding component is greater in magnitude then the circadian component. COS turnover is estimated by extrapolating from COS mean length increases during LL. From this method we obtained a 2. 7 -Am increase in COS length during each day in LL. If COS growth is not augmented during LL, this would yield a 4 - 5 -d turnover time for the averag...|$|R

40|$|The {{suprachiasmatic nucleus}} (SCN) is a {{circadian}} oscillator entrained to the day/night cycle via {{input from the}} retina. Serotonin (5 -HT) afferents to the SCN modulate retinal signals via activation of 5 -HT 1 B receptors, decreasing responsiveness to light. Consequently, 5 -HT 1 B receptor knockout (KO) mice entrain to the day/night cycle with delayed activity onsets. Since circulating corticosterone levels exhibit a robust daily rhythm peaking around activity onset, we asked whether delayed entrainment of activity onsets affects rhythmic corticosterone secretion. Wheel-running activity and plasma corticosterone were monitored in mice housed under several different lighting regimens. Both duration of the light:dark cycle (T cycle) and the duration of light within that cycle was altered. 5 -HT 1 B KO mice that entrained to a 9. 5 L: 13. 5 D (short day in a T = 23 h) cycle with activity onsets delayed more than 4 h after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> exhibited a corticosterone rhythm in phase with activity rhythms but reduced 50 % in amplitude compared to animals that initiated daily activity, 4 h after <b>light</b> <b>offset.</b> Wild type mice in 8 L: 14 D (short day in a T = 22 h) conditions with highly delayed activity onsets also exhibited a 50 % reduction in peak plasma corticosterone levels. Exogenous adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) stimulation in animals exhibiting highly delayed entrainment suggested that the endogenous rhythm of adrenal responsiveness to ACTH remained aligned with SCN-driven behavioral activity. Circadian clock gene expression in the adrenal cortex of these same animals suggested that the adrenal circadian clock was also aligned with SCN-driven behavior. Under T cycles, 24 h, altered circadian entrainment to short day (winter-like) conditions, manifest as long delays in activity onset after <b>light</b> <b>offset,</b> severely reduces the amplitude of the diurnal rhythm of plasma corticosterone.

To continue our effort towards a possible mechanism of photoreceptor cell death in retinal dystrophies, we have studied {{the impact of the}} rds mutation on diurnal expression of a ‘zinc-finger’ DNA-binding protein, NGF 1 -A mRNA in the isolated retinas ofrds mutant mice compared to those of BALB/c mice. Background levels of NGF 1 -A mRNA were maintained during the subjective light period. Higher levels of NGF 1 -A mRNA were observed immediately after the <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> and peaked two hours into the <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> for both the BALB/c and the rds mutant retinas and remained higher for several hours in the dark. If the animals were left continuously in light during the subjective dark period, NGF 1 -A mRNA levels were not induced and remained lower. On the other hand NGF 1 -A mRNA levels were transiently induced during the transition of the dark-to-light phase. These data suggest that NGF 1 -A mRNA is differentially regulated by light and dark stimuli in the retina and an absence of rod outer segments in the rds mutant retina does not alter the normal diurnal cycle of NGF 1 -A mRNA expression...|$|R

Here, we evaluated the photoreceptor contributions to the early phase PIPR (0. 6 s to 5. 0 s) by measuring the spectral sensitivity of the criterion PIPR amplitude in response to 1 s light pulses at five narrowband stimulus wavelengths (409, 464, 508, 531 and 592 nm). The retinal irradiance producing a criterion PIPR was normalised to the peak and fitted by either a single photopigment nomogram or the combined melanopsin and rhodopsin spectral nomograms with the +L+M cone photopic luminous efficiency (Vλ) function. We show that the PIPR spectral sensitivity at times ≥ 1. 7 s after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> is best described by the melanopsin nomogram. At times < 1. 7 s, the peak PIPR sensitivity shifts to longer wavelengths (range: 482 to 498 nm) and is best described by the combined photoreceptor nomogram, with major contributions from melanopsin and rhodopsin.

40|$|Following {{administration}} of a moderate dose of amphetamine, rats appear {{to pass through}} a sequence of physiological / psychological states, including stimulant and depressant states. The present research evaluated whether these states could be inferred from time-dependent changes in feeding-related measures. Male rats were housed in individual stations (light-dark 12 - 12 hr, free access to water) where, at three hour intervals, they could respond for food for one hour. The work requirement was fixed ratio 1, and each lever press produced 6 94 -mg food pellets. When the pattern of responding for food stabilized across the light-dark cycle, a series of 6 or 7 tests was run. During each test, rats received a saline treatment (1. 0 ml / kg, subcutaneously) followed by a 48 -hour monitoring period, and then they received an amphetamine treatment (2. 0 mg / kg, subcutaneously) followed by a 72 -hour monitoring period. Different groups were treated at either light onset or <b>light</b> <b>offset.</b> Lever presses and head-in-feeding-bin responses were monitored throughout these tests. Administration of amphetamine at light onset and at <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> produced cumulative food intake functions having four regions: post-treatment hours 1 - 6 (hypophagia), 7 - 12 (normal intake), 13 - 27 (hypophagia), and 28 and beyond (normal intake).

We aimed {{to identify the}} effects of circadian phase and sleepiness across 24 hours on {{various aspects of the}} pupil response to light stimulation. METHODS: We tested 10 healthy adults hourly in two 12 -hour sessions covering a 24 -hour period. Pupil responses to narrow bandwidth red (635 ± 18 nm) and blue (463 ± 24 nm) light (duration of 1 and 30 seconds) at equal photon fluxes were recorded, and correlated with salivary melatonin concentrations at the same circadian phases and to subjective sleepiness ratings. The magnitude of pupil constriction was determined from minimal pupil size. The post-stimulus pupil response was assessed from the pupil size at 6 seconds following <b>light</b> <b>offset,</b> the area within the redilation curve, and the exponential rate of redilation. RESULTS: Among the measured parameters, the pupil size 6 seconds after <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> correlated with melatonin concentrations (P < 0. 05) and showed a significant modulation over 24 hours with maximal values after the nocturnal peak of melatonin secretion. In contrast, the post-stimulus pupil response following red light stimulation correlated with subjective sleepiness (P < 0. 05) without significant changes over 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The post-stimulus pupil response to blue light as a marker of intrinsic melanopsin activity demonstrated a circadian modulation. In contrast, the effect of sleepiness was more apparent in the cone contribution to the pupil response. Thus, pupillary responsiveness to light is under influence of the endogenous circadian clock and subjective sleepiness...|$|R

After correcting for systematics, we found fourteen systems with significant detections {{in each of the}} phase curve components: planet's phase function, secondary eclipse, Doppler boosting and ellipsoidal variations. We model the full phase curve simultaneously, including primary and secondary transits, and derive albedos, day- and night-side temperatures and planet masses. Most planets manifest low optical geometric albedos (< 0. 25), with the exception of Kepler- 10 b, Kepler- 91 b and KOI- 13 b. We find that KOI- 13 b, with a small eccentricity of 0. 0006 + 0. 0001, is the only planet for which an eccentric orbit is favored. We detect a third harmonic with an amplitude of 1. 9 + 0. 2 ppm for HAT-P- 7 b for the first time, and confirm the third harmonic for KOI- 13 b reported in Esteves et al. : both could be due to their spin-orbit misalignments. For six planets, we report a planetary brightness peak offset from the substellar point: of those, the hottest two (Kepler- 76 b and HAT-P- 7 b) exhibit pre-eclipse shifts or to the evening-side, while the cooler four (Kepler- 7 b, Kepler- 8 b, Kepler- 12 b and Kepler- 41 b) peak post-eclipse or on the morning-side.

They find that a phase-dependent sensitiv-ity (“gating”) of light-induced period gene transcription enables a constant phase relation to dusk or dawn under different photoperiods.

Rod bipolar cells responded to light with a sustained depolarization (ON response) followed at <b>light</b> <b>offset</b> by a slight hyperpolarization. ON and OFF cone bipolar cells were encountered, both with diverse temporal properties. The responses of rod bipolar cells were composed primarily of two components, a nonspecific cation current and a chloride current. The chloride current was reduced greatly in axotomized cells and could be suppressed by coapplication of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline and the GABAC antagonist (1, 2, 5, 6 −tetrahydropyridine− 4 −yl) methylphosphinic acid. This suggests that it largely reflects feedback from GABAergic amacrine cells. The response latency of intact rod bipolar cells was shorter {{than that of the}} axotomized cells, and the sensitivity curve covered more than twice the dynamic range. Application of the GABA receptor antagonists partially mimicked the effects of axotomy. These findings suggest that functional properties of the axon terminal systemnotably synaptic feedback from amacrine cellsplay an important role in defining the response properties of mammalian bipolar cell...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTrace {{conditioning}} {{procedures are}} defined {{by the introduction of}} a trace interval between conditioned stimulus (CS, e. g. noise or <b>light)</b> <b>offset</b> and unconditioned stimulus (US, e. g. footshock). The introduction of an additional stimulus as a distractor has been suggested to increase the attentional demands of the task and to extend the usefulness of the behavioural model. In Experiment 1, the CS was noise and the distractor was provided by an intermittent light. In Experiment 2, the CS was light and the distractor was provided by an intermittent noise. In both experiments, the introduction of a 10 s trace interval weakened associative learning compared with that seen in a 0 s delay conditioned group. However, there was no consistent evidence of distraction. On the contrary, in Experiment 1, associative learning was stronger (in both trace and delay conditioned groups) for rats conditioned also {{in the presence of the}} intermittent light. In Experiment 2, there was no such effect when the roles of the stimuli were reversed. The results of Experiment 2 did however confirm the particular salience of the noise stimulus. The finding of increased associative learning dependent on salience is consistent with arousal-mediated effects on associative learning...|$|R
