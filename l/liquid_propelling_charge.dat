40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{was intended}} {{to improve the quality}} and safety of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> during their life cycle. The approach in three case studies was the evaluation of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> performance by the statistical utilization of the results collected in artillery gun test firings and conscript practice troop firings. The interior ballistics branch needs to adjust to the new demands for weapon systems. The literature review shows that the actual interdisciplinary challenges entail the development of new, more energetic but less sensitive and toxic gun propellant compositions, the development of high loading density charge constructions, enhancing the knowledge about the ignition event, research on heat transfer in the gun barrel and barrel wear and further development of mathematical modeling. Primarily due to firing safety it is essential to be able to measure correct pressure values during the ignition and combustion of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> in test firings. A discrepancy was detected in the maximum pressure levels measured by using two different pressure measurement methods in the interior ballistic test firings. This problem has been resolved by {{the development of a new}} dynamic calibration methodology for the crusher gauge pressure elements. The calibration methodology developed was verified and implemented (Case I). The acceptance control must provide a reliable baseline for the assessment of the performance of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charges.</b> Quality defects were found in several recently produced 155 -mm gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> lots. The reasons for the poor performance of the procedure for determining gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> weight were ascertained by applying multivariate analysis methods in new ways to the data set consisting of 155 mm charge weight establishment and uniformity test firing results (Case II). It was found possible to improve the test procedure. The chemical and physical changes occurring during the life cycle of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> may impair their safety and performance. It is essential to be aware of such changes as early as possible in the life cycle of the gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> type. Thanks to new technology, the acquisition of information on ammunition performance is no longer limited to the test firings. The new surveillance system developed and implemented enables the utilization of conscript practice field artillery troop firings for performance data collection of gun <b>propelling</b> <b>charges</b> (Case III) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{family of}} {{ammunition}} is currently under {{development for the}} 8 -in. major caliber lightweight gun (MCLWG) system. In this report the major alternatives for the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> portion of the ammunition are examined. There are three relatively independent subassemblies in the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge,</b> namely the case, the primer, and the <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> itself. Cases can be fabricated of drawn steel, spiral wrapped steel, or other materials, the most promising of which is fiberglass. For primers the major options are to rework an existing inventory, to redesign the primers using the traditional technology, or to redesign the primer using more advanced technology. <b>Propelling</b> <b>charge</b> options address the chemical composition (NACO or M 1 A 1) and physical characteristics (grain size). These alternatives are compared using the ideas of multidimensional utility analysis.

It had an increased <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> and a steel core bullet.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interior}} ballistic <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> design using the optimization methods {{to select the}} optimum charge design and to improve the interior ballistic performance. The <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> consists of a mixture propellant of seven-perforated granular propellant and one-hole tubular propellant. The genetic algorithms and some other evolutionary algorithms have complex evolution operators such as crossover, mutation, encoding, and decoding. These evolution operators have a bad performance represented in convergence speed and accuracy of the solution. Hence, the particle swarm optimization technique is developed. It is carried out in conjunction with interior ballistic lumped-parameter model with the mixture propellant. This technique is applied to both single-objective and multiobjective problems. In the single-objective problem, the optimization results are compared with genetic algorithm and the experimental results. The particle swarm optimization introduces a better performance of solution quality and convergence speed. In the multiobjective problem, the feasible region provides a set of available choices to the charge’s designer. Hence, a linear analysis method is adopted to give an appropriate set of the weight coefficients for the objective functions. The results of particle swarm optimization improved the interior ballistic performance and provided a modern direction for interior ballistic <b>propelling</b> <b>charge</b> design of guided projectile...|$|R
