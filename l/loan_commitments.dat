50|$|Kashyap and Stein then {{collaborated with}} Raghuram Rajan on two {{noteworthy}} papers on financial intermediation. The first, {{winner of the}} 2002 Brattle Distinguished Paper Prize and published in the Journal of Finance, proposed a theory for why banks have debt which is demandable and loans which are longer term. They conjectured {{that there is a}} synergy between offering sight deposits (aka checking accounts, or demandable debt) and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> (the antecedents to loans). Both checking accounts and <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> require the institution offering them to have a pool of liquidity. The liquidity can be used to honor a deposit withdrawal or the takedown of a commitment (after which it is converted into a loan). The link between these two goes back all the way to medieval money changers; Kashyap et al. presented empirical evidence showing that banks which had more <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> tended to also have more checking accounts, and they showed why this is optimal for imperfectly correlated withdrawals and commitment takedowns because of the cost savings from accommodating both with a common pool of liquidity.|$|E

40|$|Since banks often lend via commitments, their {{lending and}} deposit-taking may be two manifestations of one {{primitive}} function: {{the provision of}} liquidity on demand. We explore this function under a cap-based valuation. We find that (i) the strike price of the cap-based valuation increases the bank's liquid asset holdings by increasing its loan rate and <b>loan</b> <b>commitment</b> rate (with the strategic rate-adjustment complements) and decreases the bank's external finance need by increasing its deposit rate, when the bank realizes a less risky {{state of the world}} and (ii) the number of caplet days decreases the bank's liquid asset holdings by decreasing its loan rate and <b>loan</b> <b>commitment</b> rate (with the strategic rate-adjustment complements and the strategic timing substitutes) and increases the bank's external finance need by decreasing its deposit rate (with the strategic timing substitutes), when the bank realizes a more risky state. Our findings provide alternative explanations concerning the bank's liquidity function under the cap-based optimization. ...|$|R

5000|$|To {{other analysts}} the delay between CRA rule changes (in 1995) and the {{explosion}} of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA.

50|$|The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 {{established}} an affordable housing loan purchase mandate for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and that mandate {{was to be}} regulated by HUD. Initially, the 1992 legislation required that 30 {{percent or more of}} Fannie’s and Freddie’s loan purchases be related to affordable housing. However, HUD was given the power to set future requirements. In 1995 HUD mandated that 40 percent of Fannie and Freddie’s loan purchases would have to support affordable housing. In 1996, HUD directed Freddie and Fannie to provide at least 42% of their mortgage financing to borrowers with income below the median in their area. This target was increased to 50% in 2000 and 52% in 2005. Under the Bush Administration HUD continued to pressure Fannie and Freddie to increase affordable housing purchases - to as high as 56 percent by the year 2008. To satisfy these mandates, Fannie and Freddie eventually announced low-income and minority <b>loan</b> <b>commitments</b> totaling $5 trillion. Critics argue that, to meet these commitments, Fannie and Freddie promoted a loosening of lending standards - industry-wide.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{depository}} {{institutions are}} subject to risk-based capital guidelines issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB). These guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy based primarily on the perceived credit risk associated with balance sheet assets, as well as certain off-balance sheet exposures such as unfunded <b>loan</b> <b>commitments,</b> letters of credit, and derivatives and foreign exchange contracts. The risk-based capital guidelines are supplemented by a leverage ratio requirement. To be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage ratio of at least 4%, and {{not be subject to}} a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. To be well-capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency definitions, a bank holding company must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, a combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio of at least 10%, and a leverage ratio of at least 5%, and not be subject to a directive, order, or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. These capital ratios are reported quarterly on the Call Report or Thrift Financial Report. Although Tier 1 capital has traditionally been emphasized, in the Late-2000s recession regulators and investors began to focus on tangible common equity, which is different from Tier 1 capital in that it excludes preferred equity.|$|E
