5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> anomaly, which implies higher returns to stocks with a <b>low</b> nominal <b>price.</b> The research aims to broaden academic knowledge in a few ways. Firstly, we deliver some fresh evidence on the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect from the Polish market. Secondly, we analyze the interdependence between the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect and other return factors: value, size and liquidity. Thirdly, we investigate whether the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is present after accounting for liquidity. Fourthly, we check to see whether the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is robust to transaction costs. The paper is composed of three main sections. In the beginning, we review the existing literature. Next, we present the data sources and research methods employed. Finally, we discuss our research findings. Our computations are based on all the stocks listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE) in the years 2003 - 2013. We have concluded that the <b>low</b> <b>price</b> effect is present on the Polish market, although the statistical significance is very weak and it disappears entirely after accounting for transaction costs and liquidity...|$|R

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>price</b> signals (LPS), pricing tools where {{retailers}} {{promise to}} match or beat competitors' prices, have been increasingly popular in offline and online markets. We compare consumer evaluation of offline and online LPS {{as a function}} of how deeply they process the signals. Results of an experiment indicate that regardless of retail media consumers accept an LPS as an indicator of <b>low</b> <b>price</b> when they do not elaborate sufficiently on the signal. However, at high levels of elaboration, consumers challenge the assumptions underlying their acceptance of the signal at lower levels of elaboration whereby they become more skeptical of an online signal than an offline signal resulting in lower efficacy of the former. Implications of these findings for consumer vulnerability to false <b>low</b> <b>price</b> signaling are discussed along with other theoretical and managerial implications. Additionally, directions for future research are provided. <b>Low</b> <b>price</b> signal <b>Low</b> <b>Price</b> Guarantee Price-matching guarantee Signaling Cognitive elaboration...|$|R

25|$|In practice, the {{segmentation}} approach {{relies on}} adequate fences between consumers {{so that everyone}} doesn't buy at the <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> offered. The airlines use time of purchase to create this segmentation, with later booking customers paying the higher fares. The fashion industry uses time in the opposite direction, discounting later in the selling season once the item is out of fashion or inappropriate for the time of year. Other approaches to fences involve attributes that create substantial value to the consumer at little or no cost to the seller. A backstage pass at a concert {{is a good example}} of this. Initially yield management avoided the complexity caused by the interaction of absolute price and price position by using surrogates for price such as booking class. By the mid-1990s, most implementation incorporated some measures of price elasticity. The airlines were exceptional in this case, preferring to focus on more detailed segmentation by implementing O (Origin & Destination) systems.|$|E

The change in sales of form factors is due to the desktop iMac moving from affordable (iMac G3) to upscale (iMac G4) and subsequent releases are considered premium all-in-ones.

The swim takes five-ten minutes, with both the rider and the observers on hand to assist horses, especially foals, who may {{have a hard time}} with the crossing. Before the swim, the herd is evaluated and mares in the late stages of pregnancy and those with very young foals are removed from the herd to be trailered between the islands. During the swim, some lactating mares become affected with hypocalcemia, which is treated by on-site veterinarians.

500|$|January 1930 {{also saw}} {{the first issue of}} Astounding Stories of Super-Science, which would go on to become the most {{influential}} magazine in the field within a decade. [...] The publisher was William Clayton, a successful publisher of pulp titles. [...] In 1928 Harold Hersey, who by then was working for Clayton, had suggested a new science fiction magazine to add to the line-up; Clayton was unconvinced, but changed his mind the following year. [...] Astoundings editor, Harry Bates, was uninterested in the educational goals that motivated Gernsback. [...] Bates filled Astounding with adventure stories with minimal scientific content: the stories are generally considered to have been poor quality, and Ashley considers Bates to have been [...] "destroying the ideals of science fiction" [...] with formulaic plots. [...] Gernsback's magazines were infamous for low rates and very slow payment, and Astoundings high rates and quick payment attracted some well-known pulp writers such as Murray Leinster and Jack Williamson. [...] Astounding was also better value for money than its competitors, with both the <b>lowest</b> <b>price</b> and, along with Amazing, the most pages. [...] By mid-1930, Gernsback began to consolidate his magazines, merging Air Wonder with Science Wonder Stories. [...] The combined magazine was titled Wonder Stories, and Science Wonder Quarterly was similarly retitled Wonder Stories Quarterly. [...] At the same time Scientific Detective Monthly was retitled Amazing Detective Tales. [...] Dropping [...] "Science" [...] and [...] "Scientific" [...] from the titles may have been intended to avoid giving readers the impression that these were actually scientific periodicals. [...] Amazing Detective Tales, at least, was not helped by the title change, and after the October issue Gernsback sold the magazine to Wallace Bamber, who published five more issues the following year, though there was no longer any sf or fantasy content.|$|E
