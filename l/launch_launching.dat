On August 6, 1991, the Delta-IV {{submarine}} K-407 Novomoskovsk, {{under the command of}} Captain Second Rank Sergey Yegorov, performed a full salvo underwater <b>launch,</b> <b>launching</b> all 16 R-29RM missiles on board.

The 1st and the 16th missiles hit their targets at Kura testing range on the Kamchatka peninsula, while the rest were self-destructed in flight.

In the interests of the reduction of expenditures the operation was conducted on the planned combat training of the crew of submarine and the regular flight only of two rockets. The rockets, which start in the volley of the first and last, had to run complete flight program and fall onto the assigned aiming points. The remaining rockets, which participate in the volley, had to from all parameters of launch completely correspond to combat missiles, but the height of their flight could be arbitrary.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a monopolist’s product-launch {{strategy in the}} presence of network effects, focusing on how to exploit these effects to the maximum possible extent. In our formal framework, the firm sets a price for its product and chooses a sales scheme, which effectively determines how consumers can learn from each other about the product’s popularity. Our results on the profitability of different schemes provide insights on a variety of managerial issues that are of practical relevance for product launch. Specifically, to best exploit network effects, our results suggest releasing pre-order and sales information to consumers. They also suggest taking a sequential approach to multi-market product <b>launch,</b> <b>launching</b> first in smaller markets before larger ones. Moreover, they identify possible benefits of promoting pre-release consumer communication, and support the idea of targeting independent-minded consumers, so they can serve as opinion leaders for those who follow...|$|E
