5|$|After {{eighteen}} months of dead-end musical gigs, and disillusioned by his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> {{in the music}} business, Peart placed his aspiration of becoming a professional musician on hold and returned to Canada. Upon returning to St. Catharines, he worked for his father selling tractor parts at Dalziel Equipment.|$|E

50|$|The {{school was}} closed after the 2011-2012 school year when Greg Ballard, {{the mayor of}} Indianapolis, declined, in March 2011, to renew its charter due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{academic}} <b>progress.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although the Spanish had won decisive {{victories}} at Sonsonate and Acajutla, {{they failed}} to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco. Alvarado was informed that extensive lands lay ahead, with difficult terrain, many cities, and large populations. Frustrated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress,</b> Alvarado withdrew to Guatemala to regroup, {{with the intention of}} returning in the dry season; He had been in the province of Cuscatlan for seventeen days, and left it at the end of June 1524.|$|E
5|$|The Twittys {{and their}} {{supporters}} criticized a perceived <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> by Aruban police. The Twittys' own actions in Aruba were also criticized, and the Twittys were accused of actively stifling any evidence that might impugn Holloway's character by asking her fellow students to remain silent about the case and using their access to the media to push {{their own version of}} events. The Twittys denied this.|$|E
5|$|The {{agencies}} which funded AI research (such as the British government, DARPA and NRC) became {{frustrated with}} the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> and eventually cut off almost all funding for undirected research into AI. The pattern began as early as 1966 when the ALPAC report appeared criticizing machine translation efforts. After spending 20 million dollars, the NRC ended all support.|$|E
5000|$|Goldberg {{writes that}} [...] "in recent years McPeak has echoed the Mearsheimer-Walt view that American Middle East policy is being {{controlled}} by Jews {{at the expense}} of America's interests in the region." [...] Goldberg then quotes McPeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progressing</b> in getting Israelis and Palestinians together: [...] "New York City. Miami. We have a large vote -- vote, here in favor of Israel. And no politician wants to run against it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Marcus Caninius Rebilus, sent by {{the senate}} into Macedonia in 170 BC to {{investigate}} the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> Roman <b>progress</b> {{in the war against}} Perseus; one of the ambassadors appointed in 167 BC to return the Thracian hostages to Cotys.|$|R
50|$|While {{interviewing}} one of {{the suspects}} (without revealing any exceptional interest in him), police installed a listening device in his car. Later, as the evident <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> police <b>progress</b> caused the suspects to relax, the tapping of this car would prove vital in solving the case.|$|R
5|$|No Doubt became {{frustrated}} at the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> {{they were making}} with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn't want any songs {{to be released in}} an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded The Beacon Street Collection in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.|$|E
5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found themselves in a minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress,</b> the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
50|$|In Myanmar, {{political}} and economic ideological struggles have affected living standards. Decades of civil war and unrest have contributed to Myanmar's current levels <b>of</b> poverty and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>progress.</b> Improving basic human, social and economic infrastructure required to advance individual living standards have not received focused government efforts.|$|R
50|$|In January 29, 2017, guitarist Jack Roger Olsen {{announced}} his {{departure from the}} band via the band's official Facebook, citing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> motivation and <b>progress.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to such major public reversals, Murphy also {{faced with a}} growing dissatisfaction at the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> political <b>progress</b> coming from supporters. Moreover, he was by now being forced to defend against pressure coming from within {{the ranks of the}} UPC itself for him to take a more left-leaning agenda.|$|R
5|$|Wesley trains under Fox's leadership, {{learning}} endurance, knife {{fighting and}} {{hand to hand}} combat.He also learns to control and use his abilities for firearm marksmanship, including curving bullets around targets. Frustrated by his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> and the brutality of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of fresh supplies, Hurdt and Amangkurat were emboldened {{to find ways to}} cross the river. Forces led by Dutch {{commander}} Isaac de Saint Martin drove Trunajaya's forces from Manukan, on the west bank further south from Singkal. They tried to cross the river there, but were unsuccessful due to heavy opposing fire and the depth of the water. They made another attempt on the night of 6–7 November, but their boats were sunk and it failed too. Hurdt was frustrated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress,</b> and gave Amangkurat an ultimatum that the VOC would withdraw unless the king supplied pontoons for the crossing, and matches for its soldiers's matchlocks.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, the Argentine {{government}} was {{dissatisfied with the}} <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> the AATC (which enjoyed a near-monopoly on the city's tramways by this point) had made in expanding {{the rest of the}} network and thus revoked its right to build any more lines in 1930, seeking instead another company to do so. By this point, the AATC had only built 48 metres of what is today Line C, a line which would link two of the city's most important rail terminals (Constitución and Retiro) together. In 1933 a third company, the Hispano-Argentina Company of Public Works and Finances (Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF), in Spanish) began construction of the other Underground lines. Line C's first section, Constitución railway station-Diagonal Norte, was inaugurated on 9 November 1934 by Agustín P. Justo, then President of Argentina.|$|E
5000|$|Government {{officials}} made repeated assurances {{of optimism}} regarding a quick reappearance, based on [...] "substantial advances" [...] in the investigation, though evidence <b>of</b> this <b>progress</b> {{has not been}} presented to the public. The apparent laziness of the investigators, added to this <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> visible <b>progress,</b> has led some to suspect that information is being withheld or even that there is state complicity in the disappearance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{perceived}} {{disadvantage of}} utilitarian bioethics include: potential justifications for physicians to kill patients, a gravitation towards acceptance of mortality and death, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> medical <b>progress</b> (as {{the treatment of}} severe injuries would not be explored), the uncertainty in measuring 'happiness', {{and the possibility of}} classification of many disabled or old people as [...] "nonpersons".|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of folklore, superstition and {{emotional}} reaction {{is attached to the}} common cold, but established objective information is quite limited. The evidence concerning etiology, epidemiology, physiology, prevention and treatment of the common cold is briefly summarized and critically evaluated. There is disappointing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> real <b>progress</b> in any <b>of</b> these aspects of the common cold problem...|$|R
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated at the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled {{from the roof of}} the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E
5|$|Four young West Indian men, Roy Hackett, Owen Henry, Audley Evans and Prince Brown, {{formed an}} action group, later {{to be called}} the West Indian Development Council. They were unhappy with the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> in {{fighting}} discrimination by the West Indian Association. Owen Henry had met Paul Stephenson, whose father was from West Africa, and who had been to college. The group decided that the articulate Stephenson would be their spokesman. Stephenson set up a test case to prove the colour bar existed by arranging an interview with the bus company for Guy Bailey, a young warehouseman and Boys' Brigade officer. When Stephenson told the company that Bailey was West Indian, the interview was cancelled. Inspired by the refusal of Rosa Parks to give up her seat on a bus in Alabama and the ensuing Montgomery Bus Boycott in the United States in 1955, the activists decided on a bus boycott in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|Francis {{introduced}} {{players with}} top-level experience such as Manchester United skipper Steve Bruce. In {{his second season}} the club narrowly missed out on a play-off position, followed by three years of play-off semifinal defeats. They also reached the 2001 League Cup final against Liverpool at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Birmingham equalised in the last minute of normal time, but the match went to a penalty shootout which Liverpool won. By October 2001, <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> had made Francis's position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent, replaced two months later by Steve Bruce. Bruce shook up a stale team, taking them from mid-table into the play-offs where they beat Norwich City on penalties to win promotion to the Premier League.|$|E
50|$|The SNP's {{early years}} were characterised by a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> electoral <b>progress</b> and it wasn't until 1945 that the SNP's first member {{was elected to}} the UK {{parliament}} at Westminster. The party's first MP was Robert McIntyre who won a by-election for Motherwell under unusual wartime conditions, but he lost the seat in the general election later that year.|$|R
50|$|In July 2013, NASA {{released}} an internal audit citing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> technical <b>progress</b> {{and other factors}} as the agency's primary reason for dropping out as an active developer {{of the project and}} instead focus on the use of public clouds. This report is contradicted in part by remarks made by Ames Research Center CIO, Ray Obrien.|$|R
5000|$|The Government of Angola and {{specifically}} UNITA had to urgently complete {{the implementation of}} the Acordos de Paz and Lusaka Protocol peace agreements. The Council noted that overall, there was a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> significant <b>progress,</b> mainly due to UNITA not fulfilling its obligations. It recognised the important role of MONUA at this stage in the peace process.|$|R
5|$|In October 1931 Alcalá Zamora and his {{interior}} minister, Miguel Maura, resigned. Manuel Azaña became Prime Minister. Desiring {{the job for}} himself, Lerroux became alienated, and his Radical Party {{switched to}} the opposition, leaving Azaña dependent on the Socialists for support. The Socialists, who favoured reform, objected to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress.</b> The reforms that were made alienated the land-holding right. Conditions for labourers remained dreadful; the reforms had not been enforced. Rural landowners declared war on the government by refusing to plant crops. Meanwhile, several agricultural strikes were harshly put down by the authorities. Reforms, including the unsuccessful attempt to break up large holdings, failed to significantly improve the situation for rural workers. By the end of 1931, King Alfonso, in exile, stopped attempting to prevent an armed insurrection of monarchists in Spain, and was tried and condemned to life imprisonment in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's letters {{during the}} 1618–20 period, mainly to Striggio but {{occasionally}} to Don Vincenzo or Marigliani, offer various excuses for his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> on Andromeda, including his duties at St Mark's, his health, and his obligations to provide ceremonial {{music for the}} Doge (ruler) of Venice. In February 1619, Monteverdi had started work on another Mantuan project, a ballo (dance with sung parts) to Striggio's libretto entitled Apollo. On 9 January 1620, still with 400 lines of the Andromeda libretto to set to music, Monteverdi proposed to Striggio that the entire opera project be abandoned and the ballo substituted. This idea was rapidly quashed; Don Vincenzo ordered that the remaining Andromeda music be sent to him forthwith. The final segment of Andromeda, an eight-part song, was delivered to Marigliani on 15 February 1620.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd SS Panzer Division {{was making}} slow progress. They {{had managed to}} isolate the 155th Guards Regiment, of the 52nd Guards Rifle Division (of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps), {{from the rest of}} its parent division, but its {{attempts}} to sweep the regiment eastward into the flank of the neighbouring 375th Rifle Division (of the 23rd Guards Rifle Corps) had failed when the regiment was reinforced by the 96th Tank Brigade. Hausser, the commander of II SS Panzer Corps, requested aid from the III Panzer Corps to his right, but the panzer corps had no units to spare. By the end of the day, the 3rd SS Division had made very limited progress due in part to a tributary of the Donets river. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> undermined the advance made by its sister divisions and exposed the right flank of the corps to Soviet forces. The temperatures, reaching over 30 degrees Celsius, and frequent thunderstorms made fighting conditions difficult.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{functional}} strength and balance exercises can {{reduce the risk of}} falling in older people if they are done on a regular basis. However, the repetitive nature of these exercises; combined with the inherent <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> feedback <b>of</b> <b>progress</b> may discourage seniors from exercising in the home, thereby rendering such an intervention ineffective. This study hypothesizes that the use of visual feedback and multimodal games will be more effective in encouraging adherence to home rehabilitation than standard care; thereby promoting independence and improving {{the quality of life in}} older adults at risk of falling...|$|R
25|$|The {{next two}} years {{followed}} a similar pattern. Although success against lower rated sides such as Zimbabwe and New Zealand suggested that England were improving, the team continued to struggle against the talent of Australia and Pakistan. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> consistent <b>progress</b> {{and the effect of}} a back ailment contributed to Atherton's decision to resign after five years as captain.|$|R
25|$|Impetus for SB1070 is {{attributed}} to shifting demographics leading to a larger Hispanic population, increased drugs- and human smuggling-related violence in Mexico and Arizona, and a struggling state economy and economic anxiety during the late-2000s recession. State residents were also frustrated by the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> federal <b>progress</b> on immigration, which they viewed as even more disappointing given that Napolitano was in the administration.|$|R
