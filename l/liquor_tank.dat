50|$|The main {{byproducts}} of kraft pulping are crude {{sulfate turpentine}} and tall oil soap. The availability {{of these is}} strongly dependent on wood species, growth conditions, storage time of logs and chips, and the mill's process. Pines are the most extractive rich woods. The raw turpentine is volatile and is distilled of the digester, while the raw soap is separated from the spent black liquor by decantation of the soap layer formed on top of the <b>liquor</b> storage <b>tanks.</b> From pines the average yield of turpentine is 5-10 kg/t pulp and of crude tall oil is 30-50 kg/t pulp.|$|R
40|$|The {{inactivation}} of radioactively labeled poliovirus type 1 and coxsackievirus B 1 in soils {{saturated with}} surface water, groundwater, and septic <b>tank</b> <b>liquor</b> was {{directly proportional to}} temperature. Virus persistence was also related to soil type and the liquid amendment in which viruses were suspended. At 37 degrees C, no infectivity was recovered from saturated soil after 12 days; at 4 degrees C, viruses persisted for at least 180 days. No infectivity was recovered from dried soil regardless of temperature, soil type, or liquid amendment. Additional experiments showed that evaporation of soil water was {{largely responsible for the}} decreased recovery of infectivity from drying soil.

5000|$|Inside, {{the coal}} was {{transported to the}} top level where it was {{deposited}} in a long hopper at the top level of the building (which also contains the conveyor drive and water tank). From the hopper, the coal was fed via a single chute into the vertical retort block which was then divided into 8 separate retorts, where it was heated by furnaces (and later an additional steel furnace in the back room) located {{on the first floor}} (ground level). The extracted gas was collected in two parallel [...] "Collector Mains" [...] running {{along the top of the}} retort block. Accumulated tar and liquor was drained from the collector mains into a small <b>liquor</b> separating <b>tank</b> on the 3rd floor on the western side of the building. The collected gas was forced through the retort governor (recently removed for scrap) and into the foul main that runs down the back of the retort house where it was purified elsewhere on the site. Like the Horizontal Retorts, the Vertical Retort was run on Newcastle Coal imported from New South Wales. In the 1950s, modifications were made to the gasworks to allow the site to use Fingal Coal from the Fingal Valley in north east Tasmania.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the UK, highly {{radioactive}} (HA) liquor from the reprocessing of {{spent nuclear fuel}} is converted into a borosilicate glass at the Sellafield Waste Vitrification Plant (WVP) yielding a stable and durable waste form suitable for long-term storage and subsequent disposal. The WVP uses a two-stage design based on the continuous French AVH (Atelier de Vitrification de la Hague) process and as of April 2012 had produced ∼ 2, 200 te of waste glass in ∼ 5, 600 containers. WVP product glass is manufactured to a Quality Assured Process Specification, with an historic targeted waste oxide incorporation of 25 wt%. Recently, by using a full-scale inactive test rig to determine operational envelopes, it has been possible for the WVP to implement higher waste loadings. This will result in fewer containers being produced, which will provide considerable savings not only operationally, but also for storage, transport and final disposal. In addition to changes in Blend ratio and increased waste incorporation, future challenges for the WVP are related to post-operational clean-out (POCO) of the HA <b>liquor</b> storage <b>tanks</b> (HASTs). The waste feed arising from POCO will be enriched in certain species, e. g. molybdenum, which will limit the existing process in terms of waste loading. Hence, work is currently being undertaken to underpin the processing of POCO waste through the WVP...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{aluminum}} species {{constitute a}} predominant proportion of tank wastes, {{the chemistry of}} aluminum in these alkaline solutions is inadequately understood. This is due, in part, to the extreme conditions of the HLW supernatant <b>tank</b> <b>liquors.</b> In REDOX waste, for example, the concentration of Al in HLW supernatants can exceed 1. 5 M. In addition, the pH is often greater than 14, and the individual molar concentrations of Na+, NOi, and NOa- are in excess of 2 M. As {{a consequence of the}} high molar concentrations of A 13 +, Na+, NO;z-, and N 03 -, the activity of water in these supernatant solutions is greatly decreased. The concentration of water in these solutions, is in the range of 35 - 45 M, a significant reduction from the pure bulk water value of 55 M. On the molecular scale, there is not enough water present to satisfy the hydration requirements of the Na+ and AI(O) ions in the alkaline aluminum solutions. Thus, most of the water present in the HLW supernatants is chemically ''tied up'' as hydrated water around the Na+ and Al(OH) d- ions, as well as structural water present in solid aluminate hydrates. The solution-solid phase behavior of the HLW supernatants {{can be thought of as}} a competition for water between ionic hydration and the structural water required for the aluminate hydrates. The role of water in these liquid waste concentrates emerges as a key determinant of which solid phases will form and ultimately control the viscosity and precipitation properties as well as the activities of the radionuclides of interest in HLWs...|$|R
40|$|Borehole gamma-logging {{profiles}} {{beneath the}} SX-Tank Farm suggest that contamination from Cs- 137 extends {{to at least}} a depth of 40 m (130 ft), and may extend even deeper. What is presently not known is the pathway that Cs- 137 has taken to reach these depths. In this report we provide {{an analysis of the}} chemistry of tank supernates with emphasis on the REDOX waste stream disposed in SX tanks, Cs chemistry in aqueous solutions and adsorption properties onto minerals, available data on Cs adsorption onto Hanford sediments, and information on Cs migration from other Hanford tank leaks that have been studied. The data in this report was used to help guide the vadose zone transport analysis of the SX Tank Farm presented in a companion report, Ward et al. (1997). The goal of the vadose zone transport modeling is to attempt to explain the depth and extent of the Cs- 137 plume under the SX Tank farm, specifically {{in the vicinity of the}} greatest leak, near the SX- 109 Tank as inferred from the gamma logs (DOE 1996). In solution Cs is present as the monovalent cation and shows very little tendency to form aqueous complexes with inorganic or organic ligands. Cs is expected to adsorb primarily onto selective minerals that have unique adsorption sites. The small Cs+ion is accommodated on these frayed edge and interlayer sites. Adsorption within the interlayers often leads to collapse of the layers such that the Cs+ion is effectively trapped and not readily exchangeable by all other common cations. The degree of adsorption is thus only moderately dependent on the types and high concentrations of other cations in leaking <b>tank</b> <b>liquors...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to upgrade some {{conventional}} aeration processes, a laboratory-scale system for promoting nitrogen and phosphorus removal was set up and studied {{through a series of}} experiments, in which water hyacinth was planted {{on the surface of the}} mixed <b>liquor</b> in aeration <b>tanks.</b> The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of aeration, organic load (chemical oxygen demand) and residence time on the nutrient removal efficiency of a water hyacinth based system for the purification of raw and settled sewage wastewaters. The experiments indicated that the aeration with airflow intensity of 41 min?? can provide enough oxygen supply but no significant disturbance of water hyacinth growth. The water hyacinth grew better in a moderate organic strength of chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 18 - 80 mg l??. In this study, it was observed that chlorosis of water hyacinth occurred under conditions of nutrient deficiency, and possibility that it was caused by iron (Fe) deficiency was analyzed. The increase of solids retention time (SRT) from 5 to 20 days was of benefit for organic and nutrient removals. The system demonstrated a high performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removals up to 86 % and 80 % respectively from the raw sewage, which are far better than that in floating aquatic macrophyte-based treatment systems (FAMS) and wetland systems. Dissimilation via nitrification and denitrification was considered as a major pathway of N removal, and assimilation via plant uptake was thought to be responsible for more than half of the P removal in the designed system.

40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed <b>liquor</b> in the <b>tanks</b> have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.
