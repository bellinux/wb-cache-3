5|$|At {{the end of}} each 20 minute meal in {{the dining}} hall, the forks, spoons and knives were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table and {{carefully}} counted to ensure that nothing had been taken as a potential weapon. In the earlier years as a prison, prisoners were forbidden from talking while eating, but this was later relaxed, provided that the prisoners communicated quietly.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
5|$|Burial 23 was a royal tomb {{inserted}} {{by destroying}} the second {{version of the}} access stairway of Temple 33. The individual interred within the tomb has not been identified but the tomb {{is one of two}} proposed locations for the burial of the late 7th-century king Nuun Ujol Chaak. The tomb was cut into the bedrock under the temple, to the south of the burial of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The king appears to have been hastily interred in a tomb that was still being prepared while the burial took place, since plaster from the walls was splashed on some of the grave goods and a flint pick was accidentally left behind by a workman. The body of the king was laid upon a litter painted with cinnabar and overlain with jaguar-pelts; the corpse was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pelts and covered in layers of marine shells.|$|E
60|$|Crouched in a heap, Cole {{bent over}} the generator, deft fingers flying. He pulled the wiring to him and <b>laid</b> it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, tracing the {{circuits}} with feverish haste.|$|R
50|$|Maysville was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1834 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wabash and Erie Canal.|$|R
5000|$|The new town, {{which was}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> land <b>the</b> {{railroad}} had acquired {{as part of}} its right-of-way through Carter County, was originally to be called [...] "McDonald", after the chief engineer who had <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> the site of the town for the railroad. But the postal service rejected this name because it was too similar to McDowell, Missouri.|$|R
25|$|The next {{episode of}} {{construction}} involved three stages. A small platform was constructed near the southeastern ramp and four young males {{with their arms}} interlocked and missing their hands and skulls were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> platform. Some researchers {{have concluded that the}} four men may represent the four cardinal directions.|$|E
25|$|The {{grid plan}} became {{popular with the}} start of the Renaissance in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of Mannheim in Germany was the first Renaissance city <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grid plan. Later came the New Town in Edinburgh and almost the entire city centre of Glasgow, and many planned {{communities}} and cities in Australia, Canada and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Mynn {{suffered}} an ankle injury before the famous 1836 match. He batted with a runner and {{was unable to}} bowl. Leg guards had not yet been invented and as he made his hundred in the second innings his legs were badly bruised by the Northern fast bowler Sam Redgate. Mynn's captain, Lord Frederick Beauclerk sent him back to London <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> top of a stagecoach.|$|E
60|$|I {{pulled him}} up with her and <b>laid</b> him <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> raft. A very faint breeze from the {{south-west}} had sprung up; that and a strong seaward current that sets round the rocks were carrying us straight out from the Breton coast and all chance of rescue, towards the open channel.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{shops and}} {{restaurants}} are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Earlsdon Street, <b>the</b> suburban high street. Earlsdon Library {{is one of the}} largest libraries of the local authority libraries outside of the city centre.|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Kevorkian wrote {{a series}} of {{articles}} for the German journal Medicine and Law that <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> his thinking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ethics of euthanasia.|$|R
25|$|The {{town was}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flat {{slopes of the}} Savannah River, {{just east of the}} sand hills that would {{come to be known as}} Summerville. The townspeople got along peacefully most of the time with the {{surrounding}} tribes of Chickasaw, Creek, Yuchi and Shawnee Indians. The Shawnees in the region were known as the Savano Indians. The name of the Savannah River is an Anglicization of their tribal name.|$|E
25|$|He {{was the son}} of Apollo and, {{according}} to the earliest accounts, a mortal woman named Coronis. His mother was killed for being unfaithful to Apollo and was laid out on a funeral pyre to be consumed, but the unborn child was rescued from her womb. Or, alternatively, his mother died in labor and was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pyre to be consumed, but Apollo rescued the child, cutting him from Coronis's womb.|$|E
25|$|Evansville's {{original}} downtown plat {{was made}} on about 200 acres, with streets running parallel to the river from northwest to southeast. Other streets nearby were later <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cardinal points, due north-south and east-west. Thus, anyone entering or leaving downtown finds the street makes a confusing oblique-angle turn in one direction or another. In the 1970s, the city suffered from problems such as decreased economic activity and suburban flight, but city-sponsored revitalization has improved downtown conditions.|$|E
50|$|Monroe was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1817 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Dayton and Cincinnati pike. The city {{is named}} for President James Monroe, fifth President of the United States.|$|R
50|$|West Independence was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1849 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Findlay—Tiffin road. A {{post office}} called West Independence was {{established}} in 1854, and remained in operation until 1908.|$|R
50|$|Morley was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> about 1873 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{main line}} of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. First called Viroqua, it was renamed Morley in 1886.|$|R
25|$|On {{the upper}} surface, the scenes cover the Descent into Hell, Jesus' {{appearance}} before Mary Magdalene and Jesus' flagellation whilst on the frieze below {{we have a}} scene showing Jesus washing his disciples' feet (Foot washing) followed by a depiction of Jesus {{in the garden of}} Gethsemane and the Annunciation in which the Virgin Mary kneels at a prie-Dieu and receives the greeting of an angel. A book lies {{in front of her and}} other books are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tables behind her.|$|E
25|$|When {{the bodies}} had been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone floor, Lassie, a {{crossbred}} collie {{owned by the}} pub owner, found her way down amongst the bodies, {{and she began to}} lick the face of one of the victims, Able Seaman John Cowan. She stayed beside him for more than half an hour, nuzzling him and keeping him warm with her fur. To everyone’s astonishment, Cowan eventually stirred. He was taken to hospital and went on to make a full recovery. He visited Lassie again when he returned to thank all who saved his life.|$|E
25|$|South Staffordshire Waterworks Co. passed {{ownership}} of the pool back to Lichfield District Council in 1968 when the water supply from Stowe Pool was no longer needed. The pool remains an important public amenity {{to the city and}} memorial gardens have been laid out {{on both sides of the}} pool. The Garden of Remembrance was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north bank in 1920 to commemorate World War I and the small memorial gardens that lie alongside Minster Walk were opened in 1955 in memory of Lichfield citizens that lost their lives in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Village 117 km west-north-west of Johannesburg, 60 km {{south-west}} of Rustenburg and 17 km east of Koster. <b>Laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> {{portions of}} <b>the</b> farms Rietfontein and Vlakfontein, {{it was named}} after Lord Derby, British Secretary of State.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, {{in early}} 1890, Kelly and Moran fought a fourth time. Kelly managed {{to serve a}} {{definitive}} knockout to his rival during this match, as Kelly <b>laid</b> Moran <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canvas within a time of 38 minutes. Kelly held on to his world bantam-weight title until 1892, when he was dethroned by Englishman Billy Plimmer in 10 rounds at Coney Island.|$|R
5000|$|Agenda (formerly Neva) was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1887 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad line. The name Agenda {{derives from}} Latin meaning [...] "“what {{ought to be}} done".|$|R
25|$|One {{block was}} left vacant {{for a new}} church and in 1694 another site was given for a Presbyterian chapel. Most of the streets were {{relatively}} narrow, about ten yards, but the principal thoroughfare, Lowther Street, which ran through the town centre from the Lowther family residence to the waterfront, was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> more generous width of 16 yards. The old chapel of Whitehaven was demolished {{to make way for}} Lowther Street, and its materials used in the building of a new school for the town.|$|E
25|$|Initially PCBs were {{designed}} manually {{by creating a}} photomask on a clear mylar sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on dry transfers of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. To fabricate the board, the finished photomask was photolithographically reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.|$|E
25|$|The batsman and bowler are {{spring loading}} {{equipment}} where {{the direction and}} speed of the ball, power, timing and positioning of the batsman's shot can be controlled. The ball is a small metal ball-bearing. The playing field is typically a large green sheet or carpet of cloth which is <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table, and on which the game is played. The playing field has demarcations for the pitch, as well as zones of 1,2,3 and 4 runs. 10 fielders - besides the bowler - with ball-channeling mouths {{at the base of}} the miniature statuettes can be placed on the field.|$|E
50|$|Ambrose was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> in 1906 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Soo Railway. The {{city was}} {{named in honor}} of a {{railroad}} worker. A post office has been in operation at Ambrose since 1906.|$|R
60|$|Sherlock Holmes {{left the}} house alone, and only {{returned}} after eleven. He had obtained a large ordnance map of the neighbourhood, and this he brought into my room, where he <b>laid</b> it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bed, and, having balanced the lamp {{in the middle of}} it, he began to smoke over it, and occasionally to point out objects of interest with the reeking amber of his pipe.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} the design of feeding system, the gating and rising, and chill were {{appropriately}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> modulus of each structural element by using the modulus method. The top insulation riser and side insulation riser were {{set up in the}} local area, and the external chill was placed. In addition, a riser subsidy was set up at necessary parts to feed castings.|$|R
25|$|There {{were two}} groups {{coming from the}} Molotschna colony to settle in the East Reserve: Mennonites from the Bergthal and the Kleine Gemeinde churches. When the Kleine Gemeinde {{families}} arrived in 1874, they found {{that much of the}} better land had already been settled by some of the other Bergthaler and Kleine Gemeinde families. The earlier settlers and families had come to realize the area suffered from excessive moisture and settled upon much of the higher lands and gravel ridges. So Steinbach's earliest Mennonite settlers settled in the northeast corner of the East Reserve. The 20 homesteads were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> northeast side of present-day Main Street along the Steinbach Creek.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} Anglo-Saxon {{cremation}} is still debated; {{based on an}} examination of cremated remains at Illington, Calvin Wells speculated that at that site, the bodies had been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, with a pyre then built {{on top of them}} before being set alight. Wells believed that this would explain why the shoulder tips of corpses at the site were not always properly cremated. This idea was criticised by Jacqueline McKinley, who argued that such a process would lack sufficient oxygen to cremate the entire body. Instead she argued that Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres were most likely a criss-cross of timbers filled with brushwood, with the corpse laid on top. The process of cremating the body would likely have been visible to onlookers, creating a connection between living and dead.|$|E
25|$|In 1276 Archbishop Robert Kilwardby {{acquired}} a charter for a weekly market, and this probably marks {{the foundation of}} Croydon as an urban centre. Croydon developed {{into one of the}} main market towns of north east Surrey. The market place was <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher ground to the east of the manor house in the triangle now bounded by High Street, Surrey Street and Crown Hill. By the 16th century the manor house had become a substantial palace, used as the main summer home of the archbishops and visited by monarchs and other dignitaries. The original palace was sold in 1781, by then dilapidated and surrounded by slums and stagnant ponds, and a new residence, at nearby Addington, purchased in its place. Many of the buildings of the original Croydon Palace survive, and are in use today as Old Palace School.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the start}} of a close working {{relationship}} between Mennim and the College of which its greatest fruit was the collection of buildings of pleasing symmetry, constructed in hand-made Stamford bricks with the handsome Main Building in Weldon Stone, all arranged in well <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> courts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bredon House site between the years 1972-77. It became Wolfson College following the Wolfson benefaction in 1972.|$|R
60|$|The nine dogs--easy-going, jovial creatures--at once {{jump to the}} {{conclusion}} that the ham and cold chicken have been prepared and <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> green hill-side for their special entertainment. They make a prompt dash at the hampers. Gentlemen and ladies alike rush to the rescue, and the dogs are obliged to retire. They do so with a surprised and injured look in their innocent eyes.|$|R
50|$|The C-Group {{culture was}} related to the Kerma-Culture. Kerma was settled around 2400 BCE. It was a walled city {{containing}} religious building, large circular dwelling, a palace, and well <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> roads. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> East side of the city, funerary temple and chapel were <b>laid</b> <b>out.</b> It supported a population of 2,000. One of its most endearing structure was the Deffufa, a mud brick temple which ceremonies were performed on top.|$|R
