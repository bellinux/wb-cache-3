Given a function f ∈ I'x (a smooth function vanishing at x) we can form the <b>linear</b> <b>functional</b> df'x as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on I'x2 (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from I'x / I'x2 to the dual of the tangent space, (T'x'M)*.

25|$|The {{exterior}} algebra has notable {{applications in}} differential geometry, {{where it is}} used to define differential forms. A differential form at a point of a differentiable manifold is an alternating multilinear form on the tangent space at the point. Equivalently, a differential form of degree k is a <b>linear</b> <b>functional</b> on the k-th exterior power of the tangent space. As a consequence, the exterior product of multilinear forms defines a natural exterior product for differential forms.

25|$|Contravariant and {{covariant}} vectors are geometrically {{very different}} objects. The first {{can and should}} be thought of as arrows. A <b>linear</b> <b>functional</b> can be characterized by two objects: its kernel, which is a hyperplane passing through the origin, and its norm. Geometrically thus covariant vectors should viewed as a set of hyperplanes, with spacing depending on the norm (bigger = smaller spacing), with one of them (the kernel) passing through the origin. The mathematical term for a covariant vector is 1-covector or 1-form (though the latter is usually reserved for covector fields).|$|E
25|$|The {{usage of}} the word {{functional}} {{goes back to the}} calculus of variations, implying a function whose argument is a function and the name was first used in Hadamard's 1910 book on that subject. However, the general concept of a functional had previously been introduced in 1887 by the Italian mathematician and physicist Vito Volterra. The theory of nonlinear functionals was continued by students of Hadamard, in particular Fréchet and Lévy. Hadamard also founded the modern school of <b>linear</b> <b>functional</b> analysis further developed by Riesz and the group of Polish mathematicians around Stefan Banach.|$|E
