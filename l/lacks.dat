5|$|<b>Lacks</b> {{was buried}} in an unmarked grave in the family {{cemetery}} {{in a place called}} Lackstown in Halifax County, Virginia. Lackstown is the name that was given to the land in Clover, Virginia that was originally owned by white, land- and slave-owning members of the <b>Lacks</b> family before the Civil War. Later generations gave the land to the many black members of the <b>Lacks</b> family who were descendants of African slaves and their white owners.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 1941, Day and Henrietta <b>Lacks</b> {{were married}} in Halifax County, Virginia. Later that year, their cousin, Fred Garrett, {{convinced}} the couple to leave the tobacco farm in Virginia and move to Maryland where Day <b>Lacks</b> could work at Bethlehem Steel in Sparrow's Point. Not long after they moved to Maryland, Garrett was called to fight in World War II. With the savings gifted to him by Garrett, Day <b>Lacks</b> was able to purchase a house at 713 New Pittsburgh Avenue in Turner Station. Now part of Dundalk, Maryland, Turner Station {{was one of the}} oldest and largest African American communities in Baltimore County at that time.|$|E

5000|$|Lacan first {{designated}} a <b>lack</b> of being: what is desired is being itself. [...] "Desire is a relation to being to <b>lack.</b> The <b>lack</b> is the <b>lack</b> of being properly speaking. It {{is not the}} <b>lack</b> of this or that, but <b>lack</b> of being whereby the being exists." [...] (Seminar: The Ego in Freud's Theory) In [...] "The Direction of the Treatment and the Principles of Its Power" [...] (Écrits) Lacan argues that desire is the metonymy of the <b>lack</b> of being (manque à être): the subject's <b>lack</b> of being {{is at the heart}} of the analytic experience and the very field in which the neurotic's passion is deployed. In [...] "Guiding Remarks for a Convention on Feminine Sexuality" [...] Lacan contrasts the <b>lack</b> of being related to desire with the <b>lack</b> of having (manque à avoir) which he relates to demand.|$|R

5|$|The HeLa cell line's {{connection}} to Henrietta <b>Lacks</b> was first brought to popular attention in March 1976 {{with a pair}} of articles in the Detroit Free Press and Rolling Stone written by reporter Michael Rogers.

30|$|The rest {{of paper}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section  2, <b>LACK</b> and DST are reviewed, and their features and relations are analyzed {{in order to}} show the potentials to corporate them together. Section  3 focuses on one of the DST on <b>LACK</b> scheme without quality control; this scheme proves the possibility to utilize DST on <b>LACK</b> and shows the capacity gains by adding DST on <b>LACK.</b> Section  4 proposes a DST on the <b>LACK</b> scheme with quality control; it not only improves the capacity of the <b>LACK</b> but also has the <b>LACK</b> adaptive over different quality settings. Section  5 shows the numerical results of the two proposed DST over <b>LACK</b> schemes compared with the conventional <b>LACK</b> scheme. Section  6 concludes this paper and provides the overview of the future work.|$|R

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes are readily {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow stipe base, and reddish scabers on the stipe. Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and <b>lacks</b> the distinctive chrome-yellow stipe base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it <b>lacks</b> reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E

In this section, the DST is simply applied on the existing <b>LACK</b> without modifying the <b>LACK</b> scheme itself. In fact, the timing of <b>LACK</b> insertion and the insertion rate of <b>LACK</b> can be optimized along with DST to achieve an improved channel capacity for the <b>LACK</b> covert channel.|$|R

25|$|<b>Lack</b> of {{sanitation}} {{refers to}} the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means <b>lack</b> of toilets or <b>lack</b> of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of <b>lack</b> of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues. It is estimated that 2.4 billion people still <b>lacked</b> improved sanitation facilities as of 2015.|$|R

It is monotypic within the genus Monticolomys. It is found in the highlands of eastern Madagascar. A small mouse-like rodent, it is dark brown on the upperparts and dark gray below.

The skull is delicate and <b>lacks</b> crests and ridges on its roof.|$|E
