5|$|The Apple House, a small red-brick {{building}} {{to the west of}} the stables quadrangle, also dates from around 1636, and can be seen in a painting of Crewe Hall from around 1710. Originally a dovecote, it is used as a storehouse. Built on an octagonal plan with two storeys, it has two oval windows with stone surrounds. The <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> has a stone semicircular arch; a second doorway is located at first-floor height. The pyramidal tiled roof is topped by a glazed lantern with a lead cap. The building is listed at grade II.|$|E
25|$|Whilst Cadbury-Brown {{was away}} {{teaching}} at Harvard with J. L. Sert, Wells Coates and Serge Chermayeff, Goodden developed the brief in detail. Upon his return the design started again in earnest. The brief identified rooms which required space with both normal and higher ceiling heights and Cadbury-Brown developed an L-shaped step in section {{to allow this}} to be easily accommodated. This design device was similar in principle to one in Göldfinger's Willow Road house between the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> hall and higher studio and dining hall.|$|E
25|$|Formerly {{surrounded}} by a moat, the buildings of the cross-shaped four-story mansion, with rectangular towers in the front corners, are crowned by a central lantern roof {{dating back to the}} mid-17th century. The front entrance has an 18th-century imperial staircase, edged with balustrades made of trachyte, flanking the original round-arched doorway within a rectangular aperture designed to receive a raised drawbridge. On either side of this <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> are sandstone escutcheons bearing the Merode family coat of arms. Two octagonal towers flank the great hall.|$|E
50|$|During the winter, the Inuit {{lived in}} igloos, which were erected {{separately}} or connected by tunnels. Snow {{of a specific}} consistency was necessary to build them. They had the same general interior arrangement as the tents. The most important element was a <b>lowered</b> <b>entrance</b> tunnel, repelling the heavier cold air and the wind from entering inside. As additional prevention against cold, the sleeping area was elevated by a layer of snow {{as compared to the}} living area.|$|R

500|$|In 1863, the South Jordan LDS Branch was {{organized}} as {{a branch of}} the West Jordan Ward, giving South Jordan its name. [...] The Branch consisted of just nine families. [...] A school was built in 1864 out of adobe and also served as the LDS Meetinghouse for the South Jordan Branch. As South Jordan grew, a new and larger building was constructed in 1873 {{on the east side of}} the site of the present-day cemetery. [...] It had an upper and <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> with a granite foundation using left-over materials brought from the granite quarry at the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon. [...] The upper story was made of oversized adobe bricks. [...] The main hall had curtains which could be pulled to section off the hall for classes. The meetinghouse also served as the [...] "ward" [...] school when it was held during the fall and winter months. [...] It came to be known as the [...] "Mud Temple", and was in use until 1908.|$|E
500|$|In December 1761 Brindley {{undertook}} {{a survey of}} the route at Runcorn. [...] His initial plan was to make the terminus at Hempstones, east of Runcorn Gap, but following a study of the tides and depth of water there, he decided instead to build the terminus west of Runcorn Gap. [...] This change was designed to accommodate Mersey flats, although the low fixed bridges required that traffic on the canal be able to lower or unship their masts. [...] Runcorn basin was almost [...] above the Mersey, so a flight of ten locks, described as [...] "the wonder of their time", was built to connect the two. [...] Nine locks had a fall of , with a fall at the river lock of more than [...] at low water. [...] It allowed vessels to enter and leave the canal on any tide. [...] The connection to the Mersey was made on 1January 1773. [...] The river's tidal action tended to deposit silt around the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> to the locks, so to counteract this a channel, equipped with gates at each end and known as the Duke's Gut, was cut through the marshes upriver from the locks. [...] At high tide the gates were closed, and with the ebb of the tide were opened to release water, which scoured the silt from the entrance to the locks. [...] The cut created an island, known as Runcorn Island, crossed by Castle Bridge.|$|E
50|$|Norwegian {{geologist}} Steinar Foslie {{visited the}} RJR {{area in the}} late 1930s, and noted the presence of sinking streams resurging at sea level. In 1968, British caver David Heap of the Kendal Cave Club and Ulv Holbye (after whom Ulvgangen is named) led a school party to about 180 m partway down Storstupet, which was descended the next year by a KCC party using a winch, completing exploration {{of most of the}} cave and exiting via the middle entrance.

"It may be," [...] he thought, [...] "that {{some other}} {{prisoner}} has been confined here {{at some time}} or other, or possibly this {{has been done in}} order that if the trap-door above should be found, and the revenue men come down that way, the smugglers in their flight might lock the door behind them and so have time to get away in a boat or along {{at the foot of the}} cliffs before their pursuers could get down to the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> and open fire upon them." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{stood at}} the top of a garden {{stretching}} down to the lane or street that ran through a hermit-group of dwellings in Mellstock parish. From a green gate at the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance,</b> over which the thorn hedge had been shaped to an arch by constant clippings, a gravel path ascended between the box edges of once trim raspberry, strawberry, and vegetable plots, towards the front door. This was in colour an ancient and bleached green that could be rubbed off with the finger, and it bore a small long-featured brass knocker covered with verdigris in its crevices. For some years before this eve of demolition the homestead had degenerated, and been divided into two tenements to serve as cottages for farm labourers; but in its prime it had indisputable claim to be considered neat, pretty, and genteel.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} one of the sailors {{came down from the}} {{look-out}} above, and said that the signal had just been made from the offing, and that the lugger's boat would be below in a quarter of an hour. All prepared for departure; the lower door was unbolted, the lights extinguished, and they went down to the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance.</b> It was reached by a staircase cut in the chalk, and coming down into a long and narrow passage, at the further end of which was the opening Julian had seen from the sea. The party gathered at the entrance. In a few minutes a boat with muffled oars approached silently; a rope was lowered, a noose at its upper end being placed over a short iron bar projecting three or four inches from the chalk a foot or two inside the entrance.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] said Wally cheerfully. [...] "Going strong? How's {{everybody}} at home? Fine? So am I! By the way, am I wrong or did I hear {{something about a}} theatrical entertainment of some sort here to-night?" [...] He looked about him at the empty stage. In the wings, on the prompt side, could be discerned the flannel-clad forms of the gentlemanly members of the male ensemble, all dressed up for Mrs. Stuyvesant van Dyke's tennis party. One {{or two of the}} principals were standing perplexedly in the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance.</b> The O.P. side had been given over by general consent to Mr. Goble for his perambulations. Every now and then he would flash into view through an opening in the scenery. [...] "I understood that to-night was the night for the great revival of comic opera. Where are the comics, and why aren't they opping?" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{arriving}} at the aperture, he saw that, as he expected, he was looking over the sea. On {{one side of the}} hole there was a shelf cut in the chalk. This was stained as if by oil, and he guessed at once that it was a look-out and a spot for signalling a craft in the offing. The path here turned again and ran parallel with the face of the cliff. There was no occasion to exercise care in walking now, as here and there the light streamed in through openings a few inches long. He now unslung his gun, stooped and took off his boots, and then proceeded noiselessly. The descent was considerable, and in some places steps had been cut. At last he arrived at a door. It was roughly but very solidly made, and would doubtless sustain an attack for some time before it yielded, and so would give time to the occupants, in case the trap-door was discovered, to make their escape by the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> on to the beach. There was a latch to it. Lifting this quietly, he found the door yielded, and, holding his gun in his right hand ready to cover the fugitive the moment he entered, Julian threw the door wide open and sprang forward.|$|E
60|$|Julian nodded, threw two {{or three}} of the sheep-skins down in a corner, rolled another up for a pillow, drew a blanket over him, {{and for the first time}} looked round the cave. It was lighted only by a small hole used as a look-out; at present a blanket hung before this. There was a door similar to that by which he had entered from above leading to the lower cave. How far that <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> might be below them Julian had no means of knowing, but from the view he had {{obtained}} of the sea through a large loop-hole he had passed in his descent, he did not think that the cavern he was in could be less than seventy or eighty feet above the water. The sole ventilation, as far as he could see, was the current of air that found its way in through the door from below, and passed up through that above, and what could come in through the loop-hole seawards. Doubtless in warmer weather both the doors stood open, but were now closed more for warmth than for any other purpose, although he had noticed that the lower one had been bolted and locked after he had been first captured.|$|E

50|$|However, it wasn't all prosperity. In {{the years}} of 1914, 1915, and 1917, fires {{destroyed}} the Casino, the Old Mill, and structures near the <b>lower</b> gate <b>entrance,</b> respectively. A third dance hall opened in 1918, but this didn't help the ongoing decline in business. Smith left as park owner after the 1925 season.|$|R
60|$|We now {{returned}} to the hotel, and took a car for the valley of St. John. The sky seemed to portend rain in no long time, and Skiddaw had put on his cap; but {{the people of the}} hotel and the driver said {{that there would be no}} rain this afternoon, and their opinion proved correct. After driving a few miles, we again cane within sight of the Enchanted Castle. It stands rather more than midway adown the declivity of one of the ridges that form the valley to the left, as you go southward, and its site would have been a good one for a fortress, intended to defend the <b>lower</b> <b>entrance</b> of this mountain defile. At a proper distance, it looks not unlike the gray dilapidation of a Gothic castle, which has been crumbling and crumbling away for ages, until Time might be supposed to have imperceptibly stolen its massive pile from man, and given it back to Nature; its towers and battlements and arched entrances being so much defaced and decayed that all the marks of human labor had nearly been obliterated, and the angles of the hewn stone rounded away, while mosses and weeds and bushes grow over it as freely as over a natural ledge of rocks. It is conceivable that in some lights, and in some states of the atmosphere, a traveller, at the entrance of the valley, might really imagine that he beheld a castle here; but, for myself, I must acknowledge that it required a willing fancy to make me see it. As we drew nearer, the delusion did not immediately grow less strong; but, at length, we found ourselves passing at the foot of the declivity, and, behold! it was nothing but an enormous ledge of rock, coming squarely out of the hillside, with other parts of the ledge cropping out in its vicinity. Looking back, after passing, we saw a knoll or hillock, of which the castled rock is the bare face. There are two or three stone cottages along the roadside, beneath the magic castle, and within the enchanted ground. Scott, in the Bridal of Triermain, locates the castle in the middle of the valley, and makes King Arthur ride around it, which any mortal would have great difficulty in doing. This vale of St. John has very striking scenery. Blencathra shuts it in to the northward, lying right across the entrance; and on either side there are lofty crags and declivities, those to the west being more broken and better wooded than the ridge to the eastward, which stretches along for several miles, steep, high, and bare, producing only grass enough for sheep pasture, until it rises into the dark brow of Helvellyn. Adown this ridge, seen afar, like a white ribbon, comes here and there a cascade, sending its voice before it, which distance robs of all its fury, and makes it the quietest sound in the world; and while you see the foamy leap of its upper course a mile or two away, you may see and hear the selfsame little brook babbling through a field, and passing under the arch of a rustic bridge beneath your feet. It is a deep seclusion, with mountains and crags on all sides.|$|E

50|$|The Inuit {{tradition}} {{of living in}} tents during summer and in igloos and qarmait (singular: qarmaq, warm half-subterranean houses made from boulders, whale bones and sod) in winter still followed the Thule practices. The most important principle of all building constructions was the <b>lowered</b> <b>entrance</b> tunnel, which served as a windscreen and cold trap. The inner living area was constructed {{at a higher level}} so that the heavier cold air could not easily enter it. Girl children played with string figures within the igloos, as preparation for learning to sew and partly as a ritual act. The girls of the Chugach people mainly played this in autumn because it was believed this weaving captured the sunrays and thus delayed the beginning of winter. Often the creation of string figures was accompanied by rhymes and songs describing tales, legends and myths.|$|R
50|$|A {{subsequent}} reform {{divided the}} education system into four general categories: preschool, general eight-year program, secondary, and higher education.
