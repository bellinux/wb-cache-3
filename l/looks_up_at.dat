5|$|Shots in {{the film}} were drawn {{directly}} from panels in the graphic novel, illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. An instance of the direct influence is the scene in which Michael Jr. <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Chicago skyline from the vehicle, with the skyline reflected in the vehicle's glass.|$|E
5|$|In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario {{argue about}} the death of her husband, Ray. Nora {{believes}} Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man {{in the middle of the}} road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed as the car breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the man and says, “Ray?” The man’s arm slams through the windshield as Curtis screams.|$|E
5|$|The {{storyboard}} {{took six}} months to complete. Kamei struggled with several difficulties as he was under pressure due to how it would influence the entire film. The climax of the film also proved difficult to make. He also noted how the first scene had the challenge of attracting the audience's attention. Kamei's favorite scene is when Yuri <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky of Shizontania {{the night before the}} knights' expedition to the old ruins. It meant to emphasize the importance of Yuri's decision in regards to his future.|$|E

5|$|Falstaff, Shallow and Silence sit {{in front}} of a warm fire, {{continuing}} from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal {{went on to become a}} good and noble king.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{runs into}} {{the wreck of the}} Oberon and Leo runs after him, {{followed}} by General Thade. Thade and Leo fight. Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. A swarm of police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body {{and pulls out a}} sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

25|$|Folk {{beliefs that}} cats can cause strange {{phenomena}} {{are not limited}} to Japan. For example, in Jinhua, Zhejiang, in China, it is said that a cat, after having been raised for three years by humans, would then start bewitching them. Because it is said that cats with white tails are especially good at this, there arose the custom of refraining from raising white cats. Since it is said that their ability to bewitch humans comes from taking in the spiritual energy of the moon, it is said that when a cat <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon, whether its tail has been cut or not, it should be killed on the spot.|$|E
500|$|Van Eyck's {{depiction}} lays {{particular emphasis}} on the brutishness and indifference of the crowd witnessing Christ's suffering. They comprise a mixture of Roman legionaries, judges and various hangers-on arriving to witness the spectacle. A number are dressed in rich, brightly coloured clothes, a mixture of oriental and northern European styles, while several are mounted on horseback. Some openly jeer and taunt the condemned, others gape stupefied at [...] "just another" [...] execution, while others talk amongst themselves. The exception is the armoured centurion, seated on a white horse at the extreme right edge of the panel, who <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Christ, arms spread wide, head thrown back, at [...] "the very moment of his illumination" [...] in recognition of Christ's divinity. The horsemen closely resemble both the [...] and [...] from the lower inner panels of van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece. Art historian Till-Holger Borchert observes that these figures are given [...] "greater dynamism by being seen in rear rather than profile view", and that this vantage point draws the observer's eye upwards towards the mid-ground and the crucifixion.|$|E

500|$|Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), {{recovering}} from his Borg assimilation, visits his family's vineyard in La Barre, France, which {{is run by}} his elder brother Robert (Jeremy Kemp) {{along with his wife}} Marie (Samantha Eggar) and son René (David Birkin). Jean-Luc is considering a position on earth with an underwater research project called Atlantis. Robert has always been jealous of his brother's success and is concerned that Jean-Luc's presence will drive René to also join Starfleet. The two have a bitter argument and end up wrestling each other in a mud puddle, eventually culminating in an emotional reunion, with Jean-Luc admitting his sense of powerlessness and guilt at the things he did while {{under the influence of the}} Borg. Robert states that Jean-Luc will have to learn to live with what he did, regardless of where he goes. [...] Jean-Luc decides to go back to the Enterprise. The two spend the night getting drunk as they resolve their differences. After Jean-Luc leaves, Robert decides to let René follow his dream to join Starfleet as René sits under a tree and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> space.|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours it {{over her shoulder and}} it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was and <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{wrote that}} [...] "after an underwhelming pre-credits sequence... this sucker moved, {{and lots of}} things happened. [...] We met our four new regulars, {{squeezed}} in useful flashbacks about [...] and even found out the real reason they're on the island ... The flipside of all this business is that 'Confirmed Dead' didn't have the same emotional resonance as ' Beginning of the End'... but you clearly can't have everything in every episode." [...] Times James Poniewozik said that [...] "What amazed [...] about this episode was the economy and precision with which it introduced... {{the crew of the}} downed chopper from [...] [...] Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island, and yet {{by the end of the}} episode, I felt I had a true handle on what they were like as individuals." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives". [...] He had problems with Claire's lack of grief for Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) death and Jack waiting so long to find out the freighter folk's main objective. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] three out of five stars, calling it [...] "so-so", but commenting that [...] "the new revelations in the episode are fairly startling and provide a momentary distraction from the frustrations." ...|$|E

[...] In another cartoon in The New Yorker, a patient <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the masked surgeon about to operate on him and asks, [...] "Wait a minute! How do I know you're not George Plimpton?" [...] A feature in Mad Magazine titled [...] "Some Really Dangerous Jobs for George Plimpton" [...] spotlighted him trying to swim across Lake Erie, strolling through New York's Times Square in the middle of the night, and spending a day with Jerry Lewis.|$|E
2500|$|The right panel depicts John the Evangelist on {{the island}} of Patmos, {{recording}} his visions of the apocalypse in a book. The rest of the panel shows [...] "with astonishing literalness" [...] the most important events from the Book of Revelation, chapters four to twelve (...) [...] As with the two other two panels, Memling presents a series of events according to a narrative. The Evangelist <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Heaven; the detail of his vision [...] "unfold in a series of events at sea, on land, and in the air". The panel's detail is so densely packed, that according to Ridderbos it requires the Book of Revelations. Weale writes of the panel that it is perhaps the [...] "earliest example of so many of the incidents being included in one picture".|$|E

After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah (later revealed to be a stranger, he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, causing Katie to stop screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway.
