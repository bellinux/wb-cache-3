25|$|The {{completion}} {{of this project}} was a spectacular technological achievement. In {{the first three years}} of construction (1956–58), workers installed 3,500 kilometres of pipe, stretching from the Alberta-Saskatchewan border to Toronto and Montreal. Gas service to Regina and Winnipeg commenced in 1957 and the line reached the Lakehead before the end of that year. In late 1957, during a high pressure <b>line</b> <b>test</b> on the section of the line from Winnipeg to Port Arthur (today called Thunder Bay), about five and a half kilometres of pipeline blew up near Dryden. After quick repairs, the line delivered Alberta gas to Port Arthur before the end of the year, making the entire trip on its own wellhead pressure.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{aimed at}} investigating different activities involved in software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing</b> process and possible improvements towards achieving developing high quality software product lines at reduced cost and time. The research was performed using systematic review procedures of Kitchenham. The reviews {{carried out in}} this research covers several areas relating to software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing.</b> The reasons for performing a systematic review in this research are to; summarize the existing evidence covering testing in software product line context, to identify gaps in current research and to suggest areas for further research. The contribution of this thesis is research aimed at revealing the different activities, issues and challenges in software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing.</b> The research into the different activities in software product lines lead to the proposed SPLIT Model for software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing.</b> The model helps to clarify the steps and activities involved in the software product <b>line</b> <b>testing</b> process. It provides and easy to follow map for testers and managers in software product line development organizations. The results were mainly on how testing in software product lines can be improved upon, towards achieving software product line goals. The basic contribution is the proposed model for product <b>line</b> <b>testing,</b> investigation into, and possible improvement in, issues related to software product <b>line</b> <b>testing</b> activities. The main purpose of the research as presented in this thesis is to present {{a clear picture of}} testing in the context of software product lines, which is quite different from testing in single product. The focus of this thesis is specifically the different steps and activities involved in software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing</b> and possible improvements in software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing</b> activities and issues towards achieving the goals of developing high quality software product lines at reduced cost and time. But, for software product lines to achieve its goals, there should be a comprehensive set of testing activities in software product lines development. The development activities from performing analyses and creating designs to integrating programs in software product <b>line</b> context, component <b>testing</b> and tools support for software product <b>lines</b> <b>testing</b> should be taken into consideration. 0046762913149 eddy_odia 2002 @yahoo. co. u...|$|R

A solution for the noise caused by crosstalk could consist of first identifying the disturbers present in the cable binder of the <b>line</b> under <b>test</b> based on the measured noise PSD at the CO side and secondly estimating the noise PSD at the CP side by means of crosstalk models and the transmit PSD's of the identified disturbers.

The estimator is based on a maximum-likelihood (ML) cost function. The proposed algorithms have been experimentally verified by means of measurements on a France Telecom cable.
