5|$|Glinda and Elphaba {{meet again}} at the site where Nessarose has been crushed by {{a house with a}} girl named Dorothy inside. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument. The guards arrive, and Elphaba guesses that Glinda {{arranged}} for all of this. Fiyero arrives as well, and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba can escape. Glinda realizes that Fiyero does truly love Elphaba, and tells the guards not to hurt him, but they don't <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> they escort Fiyero to the field where they can interrogate him into revealing where Elphaba has fled to so they can recapture her. Elphaba tries to cast a spell to save his life and protect him from injury, but is frustrated by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West ("No Good Deed").|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} album, Listen, {{includes}} much more percussion and cross rhythms than previous material. Pritchard described the band's most recent album <b>Listen</b> <b>as</b> “percussion sonnets”. “The first couple albums I made I {{never really thought}} about rhythms, I focused on the recording and the lyrics”, Pritchard said.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} the ship was a severe blow to Britain during these {{early years of the}} war. When the {{officers}} heard the story of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they told it again and again to any reporter who would <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> it was inspirational and heart-warming. In 1938 the novel 'Lassie come home' was published by author Eric Knight and might have been inspired by this tale. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.|$|E

25|$|The Streltsy made it {{possible}} for Sophia, the Miloslavskys (the clan of Ivan) and their allies to insist that Peter and Ivan be proclaimed joint Tsars, with Ivan being acclaimed as the senior. Sophia acted as regent during the minority of the sovereigns and exercised all power. For seven years, she ruled as an autocrat. A large hole was cut {{in the back of the}} dual-seated throne used by Ivan and Peter. Sophia would sit behind the throne and <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> Peter conversed with nobles, while feeding him information and giving him responses to questions and problems. This throne can be seen in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.|$|E
25|$|Later, Smith and Pocahontas {{meet with}} Grandmother Willow {{and plan to}} bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. Smith and Pocahontas share a kiss, while Kocoum and Thomas (sent by Ratcliffe to spy on Smith) witness from afar. Enraged, Kocoum attacks and {{attempts}} to kill Smith, but Thomas intervenes with his musket and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas' necklace in the process. Smith commands Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen come and capture Smith while Kocoum's body is taken away. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with Smith's execution at sunrise. Pocahontas tries to convince him otherwise, but Powhatan refuses to <b>listen,</b> <b>as</b> he is furious with Pocahontas for not listening to his orders {{to remain in the}} village.|$|E
25|$|When Lord Somerset, the Protector, invaded Scotland in {{the summer}} of 1547 and was absent from court, his brother, Thomas, fomented {{opposition}} to his authority, voicing open disapproval of his brother's administrative skills. Because his activities seemed suspicious, several members of the nobility advised him to be content with his position, but he would not <b>listen.</b> <b>As</b> Lord High Admiral, he was able to control the English navy, and he openly asked for support in case of a rebellion. He entered into relations with pirates on the western coasts, whom it was his duty as Lord High Admiral to suppress, with a view to securing their support. Thomas seems also to have hoped to finance a rebellion through crooked dealings with the vice-treasurer of the Bristol Mint, Sir William Sharington.|$|E

25|$|The {{title track}} was premiered {{as the lead}} single in early June 2011 on {{national}} radio stations. The album appeared on 22 July that year, it was produced by Nick DiDia (Powderfinger). On 17 July Triple J played tracks from the album with further tracks played through the week prior to its release. The Living End also allowed fans on their mailing list a 24-hour stream of the record on 18 July. Fans could <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> many times as they wanted {{and were able to}} comment on the stream. In support of the album a live stream of a performance occurred on YouTube on 19 July. This featured an additional guitarist as well as Cheney playing rhythm guitar. From 2011 the band has employed Adrian Lombardi (ex-Mid Youth Crisis, Blueline Medic) on stage as their second guitarist. In July 2012 Cheney announced on Triple J that throughout November and December of that year, as part of The Retrospective Tour, they would perform each of their six studio albums over a week, in each of five Australian state capitals (Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne).|$|E
500|$|Spence D. of IGN said, [...] "If Britney Spears' Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{illuminates}} anything it's that Spears is {{a fairly}} proficient sonic chameleon, able to mimic and adopt the stylings {{of those who have}} come before her with enough panache and verve to convince younger generations that she's a bona fide pop revelation. [...] This is the kind of kitschy album that {{you can get away with}} having because Spears is such a prevalent component of pop culture." [...] James Gashinski of The Gazette said that [...] "As a time capsule, My Prerogative does its job well," [...] but [...] "Added together, the pop hits on this album are somewhat less than the sum of their parts". He explained, [...] "Even if it isn't as great a <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> a cohesive album, My Prerogative does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic agreed with Gashinski, but added [...] "if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music".|$|E

Pinafore). [...] The Utopian people are duly impressed, and they <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> each of the Flowers of Progress gives a piece of advice about how to improve the country. [...] Mr. Goldbury explains, at some length, the British limited liability companies law ("Some seven men form an association"). [...] The King decides to transform his entire country into a limited liability corporation [...] an innovation that even England herself has not yet accepted. [...] Everyone but Scaphio, Phantis and Tarara is enthusiastic.|$|E
2500|$|New {{material}} was written and debuted at several one-off live performances and acoustic showcases throughout 2008. Recording {{of the new}} album started in September 2008 at Strongroom 33 Studios in East London. In February 2009 all songs were written and [...] "Wade In" [...] was made available as a free download on the band's MySpace page. A demo of the new album's intro was posted to their MySpace for a free <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> well. In April 2009, it was stated that 13 songs were written and recorded for their then still untitled second studio album. In the following months, they were mixed with a release eventually expected in early 2010. Although the full album was leaked online as early as October 2009. While taking a short break from mixing the upcoming album, Stateless embarked on a small acoustic tour in the Netherlands in June 2009, playing 4 locations, which they repeated in late October 2009 with another 4 Dutch acoustic showcases.|$|E
2500|$|One day Makoto {{returns home}} to find Shizuko tied up and {{being used by the}} black soldier from his dreams. [...] He recoils in horror when the man rises to attack him. [...] His mother then steps in, paying the man, {{revealing}} that she staged the scene with a look-alike to render Makoto impotent once more. [...] Makoto tries to have sex with Shizuko again, despairing when he finds that his impotence has returned. [...] Despite this, he keeps training her, even taking her outside for a walk. [...] Taking a chance, he unties her so that she might use the restroom; after a long, worrying delay, Shizuko returns, to the delight of Makoto. [...] Later the two go to watch a pornographic film, which features a black man who resembles the soldier from Makoto's dreams. [...] Uncomfortable at first, Makoto starts to remember his childhood incident in detail, eventually remembering that it was his mother who shot the man, not him. [...] Overjoyed, Makoto calls his mother from a public phone booth to tell her he has remembered the truth, letting her <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> he has sex with Shizuko during the call.|$|E

2500|$|The {{assembled}} boyars <b>listen</b> <b>as</b> Shchelkalov, {{reading the}} Tsar's ukaz (edict), informs {{them of the}} Pretender's claim to the throne of Russia, and requests they pass judgment on him. After some arguments, the boyars agree ("Well, let's put it to a vote, boyars"), in a powerful chorus, that the Pretender and his sympathizers should be executed. Shuysky, whom they distrust, arrives with an interesting story. Upon leaving the Tsar's presence, he observed Boris attempting to drive away the ghost of the dead Tsarevich, exclaiming: [...] "Begone, begone child!" [...] The boyars accuse Shuysky of spreading lies. However, a dishevelled Boris now enters, echoing Shuysky: [...] "Begone child!" [...] The boyars are horrified. After Boris comes to his senses, Shuysky informs him that a humble old man craves an audience. Pimen enters and tells the story ("One day, at the evening hour") of a blind man who heard {{the voice of the}} Tsarevich in a dream. Dmitry instructed him to go to Uglich and pray at his grave, for he has become a miracle worker in heaven. The man did as instructed and regained his sight. This story is the final blow for Boris. He calls for his son, declares he is dying ("Farewell, my son, I am dying"), gives Fyodor final counsel, and prays for God's blessing on his children. In a very dramatic scene ("The bell! The funeral bell!"), he dies.|$|E
