40|$|The {{author of}} the {{monograph}} “Cytolytic Immune Lymphocytes [...] . ” (published in 2008 by Schenk Buchverlag Campus Dialog, Budapest, Passau, Pécs) proposed several research projects and described certain clinical events that require further elaboration and documentation. In this article the author provides what is required and has since become available. The first subject matter in question concerns the fusogenic viruses. The ancient fusogenic viruses might have created the first eukaryotic cell(s) by uniting archaeabacterial and prokaryotic/protobacterial protospheroplasts. Extant fusogenic viruses either produce tumor cell syncytia and lyse them, thus practicing viral oncolysis. Or, create chimaeric fusion products, the socalled “natural hybridomas”, of lymphoma cells exhibiting transmembrane budding of retrovirus particles or envelope proteins, and anti-viral specific antibody-producing plasma cells. The second topic concerns the horizontal-lateral mode of acquisition of those genes, which were “present in the waiting” in the amphioxus, sea urchin, and the agnathans, and met in the primitive gnatostomata sharks to encode in unison the entire adaptive immune system. The consensus of opinion is such that these genes derived from newly acquired transposons/retrotransposons. The author {{points out that the}} extant Epstein-Barr virus harbors genes displaying sequence homology with those genes from the sharks up to mammals that regulate the somatic hypermutation of specific antibody production. The author proposes that an ancient herpesvirus might have propagated the V(D) J and RAG genes from sea urchins to sharks. The third area is that of lymphocytes cytotoxic/cytolytic to virally infected or malignantly transformed host cells. This discovery led to the adoptive immune <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> of tumors. Installed in the adaptive immune system are regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells for he protection of “self”. Tumor cells masquerading as “self” are protected by these cells from attacks launched by immune T cells. The author supports the replacement of IL- 2 by IL- 15, inasmuch as IL- 2 stimulates not only immune T cells, but also regulatory T cells expressing the CD 25 IL- 2 receptor. The administration of low dose whole body radiotherapy prior to immune <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> increases the efficacy of immune <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy.</b> The author observed this phenomenon in the mid- 1960 s. The explanation of this phenomenon revealed itself just recently. In pre-irradiated hosts the intestinal wall becomes permeable to the gut flora; the intestinal bacteria activate the entire innate immune system in the mesenteric lymph nodes and a rapid activation of the adaptive immune faculties follows...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the novel}} {{biologic}} therapeutics {{that will increase}} our ability to cure human cancer {{in the years to}} come, T cell therapy {{is one of the most}} promising approaches. However, with the possible exception of tumor-infiltrating <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>therapy</b> for melanoma, clinical trials of adoptive T-cell therapy for solid tumors have so far provided only clear proofs-of-principle to build on with further development. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -associated malignancies offer a unique model to develop T cell-based immune therapies, targeting viral antigens expressed on tumor cells. In the last two decades, EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) have been successfully employed for the prophylaxis and treatment of EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders in immunocompromised hosts. More recently, this therapeutic approach has been applied to the setting of EBV-related solid tumors, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results are encouraging, although further improvements to the clinical protocols are clearly necessary to increase anti-tumor activity. Promising implementations are underway, including harnessing the therapeutic potential of CTLs specific for subdominant EBV latent cycle epitopes, and delineating strategies aimed at targeting immune evasion mechanisms exerted by tumor cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Conventional tumor therapy, {{including}} surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, effectively prolongs {{the survival}} time of tumor-bearing patients. However, critical adverse effects frequently occur during conventional tumor therapy, disturbing {{the quality of}} life (QOL) of these patients. Immunotherapy is therefore expected to be an alternative therapy for accelerating antitumor immunity, while inducing less adverse effects. In tumor-bearing animals, the activation of spontaneous cellular immunity to tumorous tissue is relatively limited, and this suppression of immune function is not easily compensated even after the removal of the tumor mass. The induction of both specific and nonspecific immunity, especially T cell function, is imperative for the activation of antitumor immunity, which is suppressed in tumor-bearing animals. Passive immunotherapy by administration of artificially proliferated effector cells that are activated ex vivo is considered to be applicable for these immunosuppressed animals. Activated <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> is a type of passive immunotherapy; it involves sequential administration of autologous lymphocytes stimulated and cultured with anti-cluster of differentiation (CD) - 3 antibody and human recombinant (hr) interleukin (IL) - 2. The majority of these cultured cells are speculated to be CD 3 + T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, which can induce both specific and nonspecific immunity against the tumor mass. It is essential to determine the optimum conditions for lymphocyte culture and cell administration and to evaluate this method, which is not yet well established. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to establish the methodology for the administration of activated <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> in tumor-bearing dogs and to evaluate this therapy. In the first part of this study, the dynamics of canine CD 56 + cells in peripheral blood collected from healthy beagles were investigated. CD 56 is considered to be one of the markers for NK cells in human beings; thus, canine CD 56 is expected to be a candidate marker for canine NK cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to determine canine CD 56 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in normal tissues, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and stimulated lymphocytes. The highest CD 56 mRNA expression was observed in the brain. The CD 56 mRNAexpression in stimulated lymphocytes was higher than that in PBMCs. To localize CD 56 mRNA, in situ hybridization was performed. The number of CD 56 + cells of stimulated lymphocytes was extremely higher than that of PBMCs. CD 56 mRNAexpression in canine lymphocytes was considerably lower; most lymphocytes were CD 56 -. However, in the lymphocytes activated by stimulated PBMCs, both the CD 56 mRNAexpression and the number of CD 56 + cells increased. In the second part of the study, PBMCs collected from clinically healthy dogs were activated using anti-CD 3 antibody and hr IL- 2 and reactivated using hr interferon (IFN) -α and IL- 2. The properties of the cells thus obtained were analyzed in order to investigate the adaptation of canine activated <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy.</b> In the obtained cells, the proportion of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells was significantly increased; the cytotoxicity of the cultured cells was reinforced; and CD 56 mRNA levels tended to be increased. These cells were confirmed to be activated lymphocytes. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of sequential administration of these cells in healthy dogs. This sequential administration was shown to increase the cell proliferative activity of PBMCs, the proportions of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells, and the serum IFN-γ concentration; no severe adverse effects were observed. We concluded that activated lymphocytes could be administered to healthy dogs, and sequential administration of these cells reinforced the recipient’s immunity. In the third part of the study, autogenous activated lymphocytes, which were activated in the second part of the study, were sequentially administered as an adjuvant antitumor therapy to 10 dogs with spontaneous malignant tumors, in Veterinary Teaching Hospital of Hokkaido University. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from tumor-bearing dogs were proliferated and activated for 14 days in culture. After sequential administration of these activated lymphocytes, the proliferation activities of PBMCs, proportions of CD 4 +CD 8 - cells and CD 4 -CD 8 + cells, and serum IFN-γ concentration increased in some cases. The general conditions of all 10 patients remained stable, and the patients were comfortable during the entire period of lymphocyte administration. The owners of these dogs considered this new concept of antitumor therapy acceptable. This shows that the QOL of these tumor-bearing dogs was maintained in a relatively favorable state, with no evidence of any adverse effects. Activated <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> was therefore thought to be applicable and effective as an adjuvant antitumor therapy; moreover, it maintained the QOL in immunosuppressed tumor-bearing dogs. In conclusion, CD 56 + cells existed in canine peripheral blood, and these cells proliferated during the process of activation to lymphocytes. Expression of canine CD 56 mRNApossibly indicates the activation of lymphocytes. The conditions of activation of lymphocytes were then optimized, using anti-canine CD 3 antibody, hr IL- 2, and hr IFN-α in healthy and tumor-bearing dogs. Sequential administration of these activated lymphocytes was an applicable and effective therapy for tumor-bearing small animals with immunosuppression induced by malignant tumors...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{perinatal}} outcomes and {{risk factors for}} further pregnancy loss in patients with recurrent miscarriage treated with lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT). Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of women {{with a history of}} two or more consecutive miscarriages who underwent LIT. All patients had undergone investigation of the etiology of the pregnancy losses according to a specific protocol. These etiologic factors were compared between those whose pregnancy outcome was successful and those who had a further miscarriage. The comparison between the groups was performed by Kruskal-Wallis, Fisher exact and Chi-square tests. Perinatal outcome data were collected for the successful pregnancies. Results: One-hundred six patients were included. The mean number (+/-SD) of previous pregnancies, deliveries and miscarriages in all patients were 2. 73 +/- 0. 8, 0. 19 +/- 0. 4 and 2. 54 +/- 0. 6, respectively. A successful pregnancy outcome after <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> occurred in 82 patients (group I), while 24 (22. 6 %) sustained a further miscarriage (group II). There was no statistical difference in the genetic, anatomic and hormonal causes of miscarriage between the groups (p > 0. 05). Antinuclear (ANA) and antithyroglobulin (TgAb) autoantibodies occurred more frequently in group II (p = 0. 0010 and p = 0. 0024, respectively). Of those with successful pregnancies, 11 women (13. 4 %) had a preterm delivery. The mean birth weight was 3036. 4 +/- 498. 6 g. Conclusion: In patients with recurrent miscarriage treated with LIT, the presence of ANA and TgAb was a risk factor for further pregnancy loss.

40|$|ObjectivesAlthough {{refractory}} to chemotherapy, {{metastatic melanoma}} may respond to adoptive immunotherapy. As novel treatments evolve, surgeons {{may be asked}} to perform metastasectomy not only for palliation or potential cure but also for isolation of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This study was undertaken to examine outcomes of patients with melanoma undergoing thoracic metastasectomy in preparation for investigational immunotherapy. MethodsA retrospective review identified 107 consecutive patients who underwent 116 thoracic metastasectomy procedures from April 1998 to July 2009. Indications for surgical intervention included procurement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, rendering of patients to no evaluable disease status, palliation, and diagnosis. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria were used to assess tumor response. ResultsThoracotomy, lobectomy, and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with nonanatomic resection were the most common procedures. Major complications included 1 death and 1 coagulopathy-induced hemothorax. Seventeen patients were rendered to no evaluable disease status. Virtually all patients with residual disease had tumor specimens cultured for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes; approximately 70 % of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte cultures exhibited antitumor reactivity. Of the 91 patients with residual or recurrent disease, 24 (26 %) underwent adoptive cell transfer of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, of whom 7 exhibited objective responses (29 % response rate and 8 % based on intent to treat). Rapid disease progression precluded tumor-infiltrating <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> in most cases. Actuarial 1 - and 5 -year survival rates for patients rendered to no evaluable disease status or receiving or not receiving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were 93 % and 76 %, 64 % and 33 %, and 43 % and 0 %, respectively. ConclusionsRelatively few patients currently having thoracic metastasectomy undergo adoptive cell transfer. Continued refinement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte expansion protocols and improved patient selection might increase the number of patients with melanoma benefiting from these interventions...|$|E

40|$|Few cancers arising in fluid organ {{systems can}} be cured with {{localized}} therapeutic modalities, such as radiation or surgical organ removal. Chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplants have long been employed as the standard of care for patients diagnosed with leukemias and lymphomas. Though research continues to propose new, more potent chemotherapeutic agents, a new paradigm of treating cancerous malignancies with tumor-specific monoclonal antibodies, adoptively transferred tumor-fighting cells, and other exogenously administered immunomodulatory agents, has emerged over the past decade. These immunotherapies have dramatically improved the outcomes of patients diagnosed with cancers of B lymphocytes, referred to as B-cell malignancies. Though curative FDA-approved therapies for patients diagnosed with B-cell malignancies {{have yet to be}} established, recent research in the field of adoptive T-cell therapy has produced promising results. Tumor infiltrating <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy</b> (TIL therapy), T-cell Receptor Therapy (TCR therapy) and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy (CAR T-cell therapy) are the three most extensively studied adoptive T-cell immunotherapies in the context of B-cell malignancies. TIL and TCR therapies, in which patients are provided with either the patient’s own tumor-specific T-cells or T-cells expressing engineered, tumor-specific TCRs, respectively, enhance the patient’s immune system to mount a more potent, anti-tumor response. However, these adoptive T-cell therapies do not change the mechanisms of the immune response. Cancerous cells can evade immune attack and dampen immune responses to survive and thrive in the body. By down-regulating their expression of human major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I), for example, cancer cells escape T-cell recognition, which is dependent on MHC expression. A chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), is composed of an antibody-derived (B-cell derived) extracellular, antigen-recognition domain, and T-cell derived intracellular domains. CAR T-cells, therefore, exploit the cytotoxic nature of CD 8 + T-cells, and the MHC independent recognition of B-cell receptors, to identify and destroy all cells expressing a specific target. Consequently, many of the cancer cell’s mechanisms of immune evasion are less effective in the presence of CAR T-cells. Progressive generations of CAR T-cell designs couple these receptors with costimulatory molecules to amplify the activation, efficacy, and potency of these cells in-vivo. Over the past five years, phase I and IIa clinical trials have produced remarkable results in the treatment of advanced stage, high-risk B-cell malignancies, namely Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL), Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), and Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL). However, the significant oncogenic risks and fatal adverse events associated with this therapy necessitate further research to improve safety and reliable clinical efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy. In spite of these risks, the adoptive transfer of CD 19 -targeting, CAR expressing, cytotoxic T-cells (anti-CD 19 CAR-T-cells) has produced sustained, complete remissions in patients diagnosed with progressive, advanced-stage, B-cell malignancies, for whom alternative treatments were not available. The unprecedented results of early clinical trials, as well as ongoing preclinical studies aimed at improving the design and production of CAR T-cells suggest a promising future for CAR T-cell therapy as a cure for B-cell malignancies...|$|E
40|$|In leukemic mice, {{the native}} host’s {{explicit}} and well-defined immune {{reactions to the}} leukemia virus (a strong exogenous antigen) and to leukemia cells (pretending in their native hosts to be protected “self” elements) are extinguished and replaced in GvHD (graft-versus-host disease) by those of the immunocompetent donor cells. In many cases, the GvHD-inducer donors display genetically encoded resistance to the leukemia virus. In human patients only antileukemia and anti-tumor cell immune reactions are mobilized; thus, patients are deprived of immune reactions to a strong exogenous antigen (the elusive human leukemia-sarcoma retroviruses). The innate and adaptive immune systems of mice have to sustain the immunosuppressive effects of leukemia-inducing retroviruses. Human patients {{due to the lack}} of leukemiainducing retroviral pathogens (if they exist, they have not as yet been discovered), escape such immunological downgrading. After studying leukemogenic retroviruses in murine and feline (and other mammalian) hosts, it is very difficult to dismiss retroviral etiology for human leukemias and sarcomas. Since no characterized and thus recognized leukemogenic-sarcomagenic retroviral agents are being isolated from the vast majority of human leukemias-sarcomas, the treatment for these conditions in mice and in human patients vastly differ. It is immunological and biological modalities (alpha interferons; vaccines; adoptive <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>therapy)</b> that dominate the treatment of murine leukemias, whereas combination chemotherapy remains the main remission-inducing agent in human leukemias-lymphomas and sarcomas (as humanized monoclonal antibodies and immunotoxins move in). Yet, in this apparently different backgrounds in Mus and Homo, GvHD, as a treatment modality, appears to work well in both hosts, by replacing the hosts’ anti-leukemia and anti-tumor immune faculties with those of the donor. The clinical application of GvHD in the treatment of human leukemias-lymphomas and malignant solid tumors remains a force worthy of pursuit, refinement and strengthening. Graft engineering and modifications of the inner immunological environment of the recipient host by the activation or administration of tumor memory T cells, selected Treg cells and natural killer (NKT) cell classes and cytokines, and the improved pharmacotherapy of GvHD without reducing its antitumor efficacy, will raise the value of GvHD to the higher ranks of the effective antitumor immunotherapeutical measures. Clinical interventions of HCT/HSCT (hematopoietic cell/stem cell transplants) are now applicable to an extended spectrum of malignant diseases in human patients, being available to elderly patients, who receive non-myeloablative conditioning, are re-enforced by post-transplant donor lymphocyte (NK cell and immune T cell) infusions and post-transplant vaccinations, and the donor cells may derive from engineered grafts, or from cord blood with reduced GvHD, but increased GvL/GvT-inducing capabilities (graft-versus leukemia/tumor). Post-transplant T cell transfusions are possible only if selected leukemia antigen-specific T cell clones are available. In verbatim quotation: “Ultimately, advances in separation of GvT from GvHD will further enhance the potential of allogeneic HCT as a curative treatment for hematological malignancies” (Rezvani, A.

The <b>therapy</b> consisted of either complete extractions or partial extractions and periodontal surgery combined with rigorous oral hygiene. Prior to <b>therapy</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from these subjects responded significantly to Streptolysin O (SLO) but were not transformed significantly by solubilized dental plaque. However, after <b>therapy</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from these same subjects responded significantly to both solubilized dental plaque and SLO. This indicates that the severe periodontitis patients were specifically unresponsive to solubilized dental plaque prior to therapy. The mechanism of the unresponsiveness is not clear, but probably does not involve serum factors because supplementation of the lymphocyte cultures with pooled homologous plasma from individuals with gingivitis or moderate periodontitis (instead of the patient's autologous plasma) did not significantly change the mean lymphocyte responses to solubilized dental plaque. In addition, lymphocytes from eleven long-term (5 [...] 18 yr) edentulous subjects, who were free of oral inflammation, were significantly transformed by solubilized dental plaque. The latter lymphocyte responses and those of the treated periodontitis patients could be due either to the presence of low levels of oral bacteria in the edentulous mouth or to the lymphocyte transformation assay being a measure of previous antigen sensitization rather than current disease status. In either case, lymphocyte transformation to solubilized dental plaque is not a useful diagnostic tool in periodontitis, but should continue to be a valuable research tool for investigating pathological mechanisms in periodontitis...|$|R

To address this issue, we demonstrated the efficacy of suicide gene therapy by introducing inducible caspase- 9 (iC 9) into iPSCs. Activation of iC 9 with a specific chemical inducer of dimerization (CID) initiates a caspase cascade that eliminates iPSCs and tumors originated from iPSCs. We introduced this iC 9 /CID safeguard system into a previously reported iPSC-derived, rejuvenated cytotoxic T <b>lymphocyte</b> (rejCTL) <b>therapy</b> model and confirmed that we can generate rejCTLs from iPSCs expressing high levels of iC 9 without disturbing antigen-specific killing activity. iC 9 -expressing rejCTLs exert antitumor effects in vivo. The system efficiently and safely induces apoptosis in these rejCTLs. These results unite to suggest that the iC 9 /CID safeguard system is a promising tool for future iPSC-mediated approaches to clinical therapy...|$|R
40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the treatment of cancer with targeted therapy and immunotherapy; several FDA-approved agents with associated improvement of 1 -year survival rates became available for stage IV melanoma patients. Before 2010, the 1 -year survival were quite low, at 30 %; in 2011, the rise to nearly 50 % in the setting of treatment with Ipilimumab, and rise to 70 % with BRAF inhibitor monotherapy in 2013 was observed. Even more impressive are 1 -year survival rates considering combination strategies with both targeted therapy and immunotherapy, now exceeding 80 %. Can we improve response rates even further, and bring these therapies to more patients? In fact, despite these advances, responses are heterogeneous and are not always durable. There is a critical need to better understand who will benefit from therapy, as well as proper timing, sequence and combination of different therapeutic agents. How can we better understand responses to therapy and optimize treatment regimens? The key to better understanding therapy and to optimizing responses is with insights gained from responses to targeted therapy and immunotherapy through translational research in human samples. Combination therapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, electrochemotherapy with immunotherapy agents such as Immune Checkpoint Blockers are under investigation but there is much room for improvement. Adoptive T cell therapy including tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and chimeric antigen receptor modified T cells therapy is also efficacious in metastatic melanoma and outcome enhancement seem likely by improved homing capacity of chemokine receptor transduced T cells. Tumor infiltrating <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>therapy</b> is also efficacious in metastatic melanoma and outcome enhancement seem likely by improved homing capacity of chemokine receptor transduced T cells. Understanding the mechanisms behind the development of acquired resistance and tests for biomarkers for treatment decisions are also under study and will offer new opportunities for more efficient combination therapies. Knowledge of immunologic features of the tumor microenvironment associated with response and resistance will improve the identification of patients who will derive the most benefit from monotherapy and might reveal additional immunologic determinants that could be targeted in combination with checkpoint blockade. The future of advanced melanoma needs to involve education and trials, biobanks with a focus on primary tumors, bioinformatics and empowerment of patients and clinicians...|$|R

Deep-sequencing technologies can identify mutations within the protein-coding part of the genome (the exome) and predict potential neoantigens. In mice models, for all novel protein sequences, potential MHC-binding peptides were predicted. The resulting set of potential neoantigens {{was used to assess}} T cell reactivity. Exome-based analyses were exploited in a clinical setting, to assess reactivity in patients treated by either tumor-infiltrating <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) cell <b>therapy</b> or checkpoint blockade.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} several important molecules involved in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I presentation pathway in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and to determine whether cytotoxic T <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) vaccine <b>therapy</b> was suitable for HCC. METHODS: Labeled streptavidin biotin (LSAB) method of immunohisto-chemistry was used to study 33 HCC tissue specimens. RESULTS: Most HCC tissues and adjacent histological normal hepatocytes expressed HLA-I antigens,TAP, and B 7, expression of B 7 was especially strong, {{and there was no}} significant difference between them (P> 0. 05).

40|$|Telomerase reverse {{transcriptase}} (TERT) {{is a good}} candidate for cancer immunotherapy because it is overexpressed in 85 % of all human tumors and implicated in maintenance of the transformed phenotype. TERT-based cancer vaccines {{have been shown to be}} safe, not inducing any immune-related pathology, but their impact on tumor progression is modest. Here we show that adoptive cell therapy with the use of high-avidity T lymphocytes reactive against telomerase can control the growth of different established tumors. Moreover, in transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate mice, which develop prostate cancer, TERT-based adoptive cell therapy halted the progression to more aggressive and poorly differentiated tumors, significantly prolonging mouse survival. We also demonstrated that human tumors, including Burkitt lymphoma, and human cancer stem cells, are targeted in vivo by TERT-specific cytotoxic T <b>lymphocytes.</b> Effective <b>therapy</b> with T cells against telomerase, different from active vaccination, however, led to autoimmunity marked by a consistent, although transient, B-cell depletion in primary and secondary lymphoid organs, associated with alteration of the spleen cytoarchitecture. These results indicate B cells as an in vivo target of TERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes during successful immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|DNA {{can cross}} the cell {{membrane}} by natural means, but the functional relevance {{of this phenomenon}} has not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed spontaneous transgenesis of human B cells using plasmid DNA coding for a functional immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene {{under the control of}} a B-cell-specific promoter. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase-PCR, and flow cytometry in combination, spontaneous transgenesis was documented in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines, and peripheral blood B lymphocytes of the mature naïve phenotype (IgM+ /IgD+ /CD 27 -). By immunoelectron microscopy, the internalized DNA was seen in the lysosomes/late endosomes and in the cytosol proximal to the nucleus. Importantly, spontaneously transgenic B cells processed and presented to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted T lymphocytes a peptide expressed in the transgenic product. This is the first demonstration that primary B lymphocytes possess a program for the spontaneous internalization of DNA, which in turn imparts the cell with new immunological functions. As spontaneous transgenesis is obtained using a nonviral vector, does not require prior cell activation, and is not associated with chromosomal integration, the findings reported here open new possibilities for genetic manipulations of mature naïve B <b>lymphocytes</b> for <b>therapy</b> and vaccination...|$|R
40|$|Adoptive {{cell therapy}} holds much promise in the {{treatment}} of cancer but results in solid tumors have been modest. The notable exception is tumor-infiltrating <b>lymphocyte</b> (TIL) <b>therapy</b> of melanoma, but this approach only works with high-dose preconditioning chemotherapy and systemic interleukin (IL) - 2 postconditioning, both of which are associated with toxicities. To improve and broaden the applicability of adoptive cell transfer, we constructed oncolytic adenoviruses coding for human IL- 2 (hIL 2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), or both. The viruses showed potent antitumor efficacy against human tumors in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. In immunocompetent Syrian hamsters, we combined the viruses with TIL transfer and were able to cure 100 % of the animals. Cured animals were protected against tumor re-challenge, indicating a memory response. Arming with IL- 2 and TNF-alpha increased the frequency of both CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) TILs in vivo and augmented splenocyte proliferation ex vivo, suggesting that the cytokines were important for T cell persistence and proliferation. Cytokine expression was limited to tumors and treatment-related signs of systemic toxicity were absent, suggesting safety. To conclude, cytokine-armed oncolytic adenoviruses enhanced adoptive cell therapy by favorable alteration of the tumor microenvironment. A clinical trial is in progress to study the utility of Ad 5 / 3 -E 2 F-d 24 -hTNFa-IRES-hIL 2 (TILT- 123) in human patients with cancer...|$|R
40|$|Adoptive {{cytotoxic}} T <b>lymphocyte</b> (CTL) <b>therapy</b> has {{an important}} implication in treating cancer patients. Here, we investigate whether adoptive transfer of human papillomavirus (HPV) E 7 -specific CTL can enhance tumor chemoresponse using an established cervical cancer animal model. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy plus CTL therapy showed an improved therapeutic effectiveness, along with antitumor protective responses to a parental tumor cell rechallenge. Cisplatin treatment dose-dependently increased the expression of Fas, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens (Ags) on tumor cells in vitro. However, CTL-expressing FasL failed to improve antitumor activity in vitro and in animals, resulting from nonfunctional Fas expressed on tumor cells. In contrast, ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) treatment blocked increased sensitivity of cisplatin-treated tumor cells to CTL-mediated killing in vitro, suggesting an important role of the perforin/granzyme-mediated pathway for improved therapeutic effectiveness. This notion was further confirmed by perforin knockout animal studies. Thus, this study shows that (i) modulation of Ag (Fas, ICAM- 1) expression by tumor cells has little effect on their increased sensitivity to CTL-mediated killing, (ii) improved therapeutic effectiveness is mediated mainly through the perforin/granzyme-mediated tumor killing pathway, and (iii) a combination of chemotherapy and adoptive E 7 -specific CTL transfer augments antitumor therapeutic activity in vivo. This finding may {{have important implications for}} treating HPV-associated cervical cancer...|$|R
40|$|High-level human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) replication and the rapid breakdown of the mucosal immune system are the hallmarks of HIV infection in the gut. Cytokine dysregulation {{may be related to}} both phenomena. Using real-time PCR we quantified the colonic mucosal mRNA expression of selected proinflammatory and regulatory (gamma interferon [IFN-gamma], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α], and interleukin- 2 [IL- 2], IL- 4, IL- 6, and IL- 10) and HIV-inhibitory (IL- 16, CCL 3, and CCL 5) cytokines for 10 HIV-infected patients before and during 9 months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HIV RNA and T-cell dynamics were measured in the colonic mucosa and the blood. Seven HIV-negative individuals served as controls. The mucosal mRNA expression of TNF-α, IFN-gamma, IL- 4, IL- 6, and IL- 10 was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients than in control patients and remained elevated during 9 months of HAART despite the decline in blood and mucosal HIV RNA levels and an increase in the level of CD 4 + T lymphocytes. The mRNA levels of CCL 3 and CCL 5, both of which were elevated before treatment, returned to nearly normal during therapy. Despite reductions in levels of mucosal HIV RNA and the restoration of mucosal CD 4 + T <b>lymphocytes,</b> antiretroviral <b>therapy</b> failed to restore the normal colonic immunologic environment...|$|R

40|$|Lymph nodes {{draining}} progressive tumors contain tumor-sensitized but not functional preeffector T lymphocytes. These {{cells can}} acquire antitumor reactivity after stimulation with tumor cells and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2). We demonstrated here that, {{in the absence}} of tumor cells, preeffector cells could be stimulated and expanded by sequential culture with anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibody and IL- 2. The adoptive transfer of such activated cells mediated immunologically specific reductions of established pulmonary metastases. The therapeutic effects could be enhanced by the admin-istration of IL- 2. This activation represents a secondary immune response because effector cells could be generated only from tumor-draining but not from normal or adjuvant-stimulated lymph nodes. Furthermore, treatment of advanced metastases with these cells resulted in prolongation of survival and cure of the disease.
