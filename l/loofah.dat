50|$|This {{piercing}} typically heals in one {{to three}} months, depending on the person‚Äôs body.

To protect against infection, antibacterial soap is the best way to keep clean. Make sure to not only clean the pierced area itself, but cleaning your hands before touching the piercing is equally important. The most convenient way to wash the piercing is in the shower so the water can run on it, however, never use a <b>loofah</b> or washcloth as those tend to harbor bacteria. Sea salt is recommended by some, but not others. Contact the person who did your piercing to hear their suggestions based on their choice of jewelry.

50|$|Where bathing is for {{personal}} hygiene, bathing in a bathtub or shower {{is the most}} common form of bathing in Western, and many Eastern, countries.

A soap and <b>loofah</b> is used to clean the body after, and then rinsed again using the mug. People most commonly bathe in their home or use a private bath in a public bathhouse.
