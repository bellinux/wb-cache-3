40|$|International audienceThere is {{a growing}} {{awareness}} of the need to reduce the negative impact of chemical analyses on the environment and to develop new eco-friendly and sustainable analytical methods without compromising performance. In this study, we developed a "green" analytical method enabling the accurate and simultaneous routine analysis of 21 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in reduced quantities (100 mg and 1 g wet weight (WW)) of marine biota samples (fish muscle, mussel and oyster tissues) using alkaline digestion combined with stir bar sorptive extraction-thermal desorption-gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SBSE-GC-MS/MS). The innovative method provides good selectivity and specificity for most compounds. In 1 gWW samples, limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged from 1 to 10 mu g/kgWW in fish muscle and from 0. 5 to 10 mu g/kgWW in mussel tissue. The method enables most analytes to be quantified below the restrictive limits established by the European Commission (2 and 10 mu g/kgWW in fish muscle and bivalve mollusc, respectively). Higher LOQs were obtained in 100 mgWW samples ranging from 1 to 50 mu g/kgWW. Recovery and <b>linearity</b> <b>were</b> <b>assessed</b> for all analytes. The results were satisfactory for most compounds with recoveries ranging from 94 % to 117 % in 1 gWW mussel samples at spike concentration of 10 ng/gWW with standard deviation not exceeding 12 %. However, results confirmed that the SBSE efficiency is affected by the complexity of biological matrices, especially for high molecular weight compounds in lipid-rich mussel tissue. Because of the matrix effects, matrix-matched calibrations were carried out. Validation was performed using the standard reference material 1974 c with recovery ranging from 71 % to 119 % except for naphthalene, anthracene and benzo(e) pyrene that were therefore not validated.

40|$|Ground {{vibration}} tests (GVTs) on aircraft prototypes {{are mainly}} performed to experimentally identify the structural dynamic behaviour {{in terms of}} a modal model. This assumes a linear dynmaic behaviour of the structure. However, in the practice of ground vibration testing it is often observed that structures do not behave in a perfectly linear manner. Non-linearities can be determined, for example, by free play in junctions, hydraulic systems in control surfaces, or friction. This paper compiles measured, typical, non-linear phenomena from various GVTs on large aircraft. The standard procedure in GVTs nowadays is the application of the Harmonic Balance method which linearizes the dynamic behaviour on the level of excitation. The procedure requires a harmonic excitation of the structure which is usually performed during phase resonance testing. The non-linear behaviour is investigated in terms of linearity plots in which the resonance frequency of a mode is plotted {{as a function of the}} excitation level. The experimental data is then compatible with all post-processing procedures for the measured results, e. g. updating of the finite element model or flutter calculations. This paper shows measured linearity plots for some typical non-linear phenomena. In the second part of the paper analytical linearity plots for different non-linear stiffness and damping models are considered in order to investigate whether the type of non-linearity can be identified from measured linearity plots. The analytical <b>linearity</b> plots <b>are</b> discussed with respect to their application limits.

Therefore, we described the relationship between radiation dose, biologic damage, and image quality to determine whether CT can be used without significantly compromising radiotherapy and tumor development studies. METHODS: The CT dose index generated by the nanoSPECT/CT system was compared with measurements using EBT 2 gafchromic film. The effects of micro-CT were evaluated in 2 mouse strains that differ in sensitivity to radiation. γH 2 AX foci analysis to determine leukocyte, liver, and jejunum DNA damage and hematoxylin and eosin staining to investigate macroscopic jejunum damage were performed.

Using simulation studies, {{the performance of}} the information criteria SIC and WIC as an alternative to <b>linearity</b> tests <b>are</b> <b>assessed</b> in time series with different degrees of persistence and different outlier magnitudes. For uncontaminated series and a small sample size the performance of SIC and WIC is similar to the performance of the linearity test at the 5 % and 10 % significance level, respectively. For an increasing number of observations the size of SIC and WIC tends to zero. In contaminated series the size of the test and of the information criteria increases with the outlier magnitude and the degree of persistence. SIC and WIC clearly outperform the test in larger samples and larger outlier magnitudes. The power of the test and of the information criteria depends on the sample size and on the difference between the regimes. The more distinct the regimes and the larger the sample, the higher is the power. Additive outliers decrease the power in distinct regimes in small samples and in intermediate regimes in large samples, but increase the power in similar regimes.

Total imprecision was 4. 06 %, 3. 3 % and 3. 4 % for each control level. The limit of quantitation which corresponds to the troponin I concentration at which CV= 10 % was 0. 05 µg/L. Method comparison with the Stratus CS assay produced the equation: Dimension EXL=− 0. 002698 + 1. 0233 ⁎(Stratus CS) with a confidence interval from − 0. 01562 to 0. 00626 for the intercept and (0. 979 to 1. 0875) for the slope. The 99 th percentile obtained for the reference population was 0. 047 µg/L. ConclusionsThe LOCI method for cardiac troponin I on the Dimension EXL meets all guidelines recommended criteria referring to limit of quantitation, imprecision and shows excellent transferability with the Stratus CS method...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{define the}} {{performance}} {{characteristics of the}} LOCIÂ® method for cardiac troponin I on the Dimension EXL system. Designs and methods: Three different levels of commercial control (mean concentrations 0. 426, 1. 42, and 18. 64 Â Âµg/L) {{were used for the}} imprecision study, quantifying separately within-run and between-run over 20 days. The limit of blank (LoB) and limit of detection (LoD) were assessed with 20 replicates of a sample without troponin I. <b>Linearity</b> <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> by regression analysis. In addition, we studied inaccuracy, carry-over and limit of quantitation and conducted a method comparison with the Stratus CS (n= 69). The reference interval was determined in 146 healthy blood donors using non-parametric method. Results: The within-run imprecision (coefficient of variation [CV], %) obtained at each level was 2. 4, 1. 4 % and 2. 2 %, while the between-run imprecision (CV,%) was 3. 3 %, 2. 9 % and 2. 5 %.

40|$|International audienceA method {{based on}} LC-ESI-High Resolution (HR) -MS analysis, using a single stage Orbitrap mass spectrometer, was {{developed}} for the quantification of casein allergens potentially present in white wines {{as a result of}} fining by caseinate. The method consists of i) extraction from the matrix by ultrafiltration, ii) digestion with trypsin and iii) detection/quantification of residual caseins, obtained by monitoring the LC-MS response of representative tryptic peptides (peak areas in extracted ion chromatograms). Method <b>linearity</b> <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> first on caseinate solutions prepared either in water or in wine matrix (the ultrafiltration retentate of a protein-free white wine). Limits of detection (LOD) ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 3 µg/mL (S/N = 3) in water, and between 0. 15 and 0. 7 µg/mL in wine matrix, depending on the selected peptide. Method repeatability and reproducibility, meant as response variability (standard deviation) due to LC-MS analysis alone and to both enzymatic digestion and LC-MS analysis, were assessed on caseinate standard solutions in water and ranged from 5 to 12 % and from 8 to 20 %, respectively. A higher variability was usually observed for the peptide marker response in the case of matrix-matched samples, the only exception being peptide GPFPIIV from α-casein, the marker providing also the highest sensitivity. The method was finally applied to a casein-free white wine ("Greco di Tufo") fined with caseinate at different concentrations, after discarding the precipitate due to casein-wine components aggregation. Minimum detectable added caseinate concentrations (i. e. those corresponding to responses with S/N = 3) were estimated between 39 and 51 μg/mL, according to the peptide marker chosen. These limits are compatible with caseinate concentrations typically adopted for wine fining purposes. Moreover, a cross-check with the calibration performed in wine matrix led to estimate the concentration of dissolved caseinate to be in the low ng/mL range...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{a linear}} no-threshold model {{is used to}} {{estimate}} health risks associated with exposure to low-dose radiation, a prevalent exposure in the general population, because the direct estimation from epidemiological studies suffers from uncertainty.
