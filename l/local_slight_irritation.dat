40|$|Capsaicin, {{a topical}} {{analgesic}} {{used in the}} treatment of chronic pain, has irritant properties that frequently interrupt its use. In this work, the effect of nanoencapsulation of the main capsaicinoids (capsaicin and dihydrocapsaicin) on skin irritation was tested in humans. Skin tolerance of a novel vehicle composed of chitosan hydrogel containing nonloaded nanocapsules (CH-NC) was also evaluated. The chitosan hydrogel containing nanoencapsulated capsaicinoids (CH-NC-CP) did not cause skin irritation, as measured by an erythema probe and on a visual scale, while a formulation containing free capsaicinoids (chitosan gel with hydroalcoholic solution [CH-ET-CP]) and a commercially available capsaicinoids formulation caused skin irritation. Thirty-one percent of volunteers reported <b>slight</b> <b>irritation</b> one hour after application of CH-NC-CP, while moderate (46 % [CH-ET-CP] and 23 % [commercial product]) and severe (8 % [CH-ET-CP] and 69 % [commercial product]) irritation were described for the formulations containing free capsaicinoids. When CH-NC was applied to the skin, erythema was not observed and only 8 % of volunteers felt <b>slight</b> <b>irritation,</b> which demonstrates the utility of the novel vehicle. A complementary in vitro skin permeation study showed that permeation of capsaicinoids through an epidermal human membrane was reduced but not prevented by nanoencapsulation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop a physiologically {{compatible}} inhalation solution of delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and to compare the pharmacokinetic and analgesic properties of pulmonal THC versus pulmonal placebo and intravenous (iv) THC, respectively. Eight healthy volunteers were included in this randomized, double-blind, crossover study.

At defined time points, blood samples were collected, and somatic and psychotropic side effects as well as vital functions monitored. An ice water immersion test was performed to measure analgesia. Using a pressure-driven nebulizer, the pulmonal administration of the THC liquid aerosol resulted in high THC peak plasma levels within minutes. The bioavailability of the pulmonal THC was 28. 7 +/- 8. 2 % (mean +/- SEM).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{efficacy}} of topical treatment of 12 episodes of severe life threatening haemoptysis from a pulmonary aspergilloma in 11 patients is reviewed. METHODS: A retrospective review {{was performed on}} five white and six African-American patients of mean age 49 years. The underlying diseases were bronchiectasis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or histoplasmosis. The patients were prospectively considered poor surgical risks {{because they had a}} forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) of < 50 % predicted and an arterial oxygen tension (PaO 2) of < 7. 95 kPa breathing room air. As surgical intervention was not possible, local intracavitary instillation of sodium or potassium iodide was performed. Two patients were previously treated with amphotericin B. In one patient sodium iodide alone was used and in the remaining eight potassium iodide alone was instilled. The transcricothyroid approach was used in six patients and the percutaneous approach in five. RESULTS: Haemoptysis ceased within 72 hours in all patients after the instillation of sodium or potassium iodide. There was no morbidity or mortality, and side effects included <b>slight</b> <b>irritation</b> on instillation of the iodide solution and occasional cough which was easily controlled. All patients were alive at least one year later. CONCLUSION: Intracavitary treatment is a viable option in the poor risk patient with life threatening haemoptysis from an aspergilloma...|$|R

60|$|We may {{conclude}} {{that a small}} dose of camphor in solution is a powerful stimulant to Drosera.

40|$|Ethylene glycol {{occupies}} a rather unique position among sol-vents {{because of the}} fact that it is both miscible with and dis-solves many organic soluble substances and yet has a marked solvent power for many water soluble substances. It {{occupies a}} position about midway between glycerol on the one hand and ethyl alcohol and acetone on the other; thus one may roughly predict solubility relations. Empirically we have found that an 80 per cent aqueous solution (boiling point about 121 #{ 176 }C.) of glycol is most useful for solvent purposes hence has been used exclusively in this research. SOME PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFECTS Glycol has a sweetish, not unpleasant taste provided it is pure, and very bitter when impure.

Dogs given doses up to 9 cc. per kilogram by stomach tube in 30 per cent solution showed no untoward effects.

Stempel:The chemistry between Holt and Martin was immediate. Tim was entertained by Chito's constant pursuit of the ladies, which gave Holt a variety of reactions to play: amusement, surprise, <b>slight</b> <b>irritation,</b> bafflement at the hopelessness of Chito's attempted conquests. Unlike Hopalong Cassidy's young sidekick Lucky, who just mooned after girls, Chito was active, which {{was a lot more}} interesting to watch, especially with Tim's reactions. Chito was not just a lovesick fool, but also ready for action. As he explained his name, his mother was Spanish, and the Spanish is for loving, and his father was Irish, which is for fighting. Chito performed the crucial functions of a B western movie sidekick: he was somebody with whom the hero could discuss the plot, and he provided some comedy relief. In the 47-52 series, the comic relief is verbal rather than visual, and often a part of the story. The directors can shoot both Chito's flirting and Tim's reaction in one shot. Unlike other B westerns, such as those Holts with Cliff Edwards, the movie does not have to stop while the comic does his routine.
