40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1994 This study explores {{cognitive}} {{processes involved in}} cultivation by examining recall and meaning of visual images in local television crime news and their relation to concern about crime. Data were gathered through a content analysis, viewing experiment, and survey. The content analysis documented visual patterns found {{in a sample of}} local television crime news in six U. S. cities, and provided data used to construct the study's viewing experiment. Free recall and meanings of visuals were measured in three crime news viewing treatments. The survey measured television exposure (including news and local news), concern about crime (through 15 measures and four indexes), criminal victimization, and general demographic data. A sample of 118 University of Washington students participated in the study. Results show significant differences between heavier and <b>lighter</b> <b>viewers</b> in their constructed meanings of television crime news visuals. The differences appear to be linked to higher concern about crime for the heavier viewers. Heavier news viewers, more often than <b>lighter</b> <b>viewers,</b> interpret crime-specific visuals (i. e. a body on a stretcher) with meanings that go far beyond what is evident in the pictures. Their interpretations also focus on crime. Viewers who remember crime-specific shots are more likely to express greater concern about crime than viewers who recall more general visuals. Results imply that specific content viewing, particularly the visual aspects of television news, play an integral role in cultivation. The findings further our understanding of the cultivation process by suggesting that cognitive differences in visual processing between heavier and <b>lighter</b> <b>viewers</b> contribute to greater concern about crime for heavier viewers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates {{relationships}} between reported television viewing and gender-attribute perceptions of Thai youth. It was conducted within a cultivation analysis framework that necessitated {{the collection of}} data {{about the nature of}} television output and about young people's perceptions of aspects of social reality. A detailed review and critique of the cultural indicators research literature identified both its relevance to this research and the limitations of early studies in this area. The main focus of this study was placed on TV drama representation and adolescents' social reality perceptions. The content analysis was used to extract the most frequent occurring of 416 TV male and female characters depicted on TV dramas containing relevant material in informational terms to the perceptions being explored. Audience survey was conducted using questionnaire methodology about their television viewing habits and gender-related perceptions. It obtained data from 962 male and female 10 -to- 19 years-of-age young adolescents in 15 secondary schools of Bangkok. This thesis argues that firstly, the stereotypes of gender-related social attributes, marriage, family or domestic, and occupational roles are evident in TV drama programmes. Secondly, heavy TV viewers adopt TV views of the world in some attributes and roles more than <b>light</b> <b>viewers</b> because of the effect of cumulative exposure to the depictions of gender-related roles. The original contribution to this thesis is based on Gerbner's cultivation indicator project of message system analysis and cultivation analysis. Message system analysis was referred to in order to assess the most representative, stable, and recurrent aggregate patterns of messages to which total communities are exposed over long periods of time. Cultivation analysis was used to compare real world perceptions of heavy and <b>light</b> <b>viewers</b> of television, assuming that heavy viewers will exhibit perceptions that are more consistent with the world of TV drama than do <b>light</b> <b>viewers</b> or cultivation effects...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a two-study inquiry into a particular type of consumer socialization: the construction of consumer social reality via exposure to television. In study 1, estimates of the prevalence of products and activities associated with an affluent lifestyle were positively related to the total amount of television respondents watched. The amount of television viewing was shown to function as a mediating variable between the demographic variables income and education and the affluence estimates. In study 2, which consisted of student participants who were either very heavy or very <b>light</b> soap opera <b>viewers,</b> heavy viewers again provided higher estimates of the prevalence of the same types of products and behaviors measured in study 1. In addition, heavy soap opera viewers constructed their estimates significantly faster than <b>light</b> <b>viewers,</b> which suggests that relevant information is more accessible in memory for heavy <b>viewers</b> than <b>light</b> <b>viewers.</b> The results are consistent with heuristic processing strategies, particularly the availability heuristic, in which individuals infer prevalence from the ease of retrieval of relevant examples (Tversky and Kahneman 1973). For many scholars (Fiske 1987; McLuhan 1964), one of the more socially significant events of the twentieth century has been the introduction and rapid diffusion of television. Those authors hold that television has forever changed our families and the way we elect our leaders, set social policy, judge the accused, and view ourselves in relation to others. Some believe this is because televi-sion has supplanted reading and interpersonal narrative as our primary means of storytelling and myth delivery (Silverstone 1991) and has thus fundamentally changed our culture (McLuhan 1964).

40|$|Since the 1960 s social {{scientists}} {{have demonstrated that}} exposure to television programming correlates with certain beliefs about the world that differ from statistical measures that define reality. Much of this research {{on the role of}} television in socialization, known as media cultivation, was conducted during a time in American history when television programming was dominated by three networks and distributed to viewers over the air. Beginning in the 1980 s, with the widespread market penetration of broadband coaxial cable, the television industry was transformed from a three-channel national program service characterized by uniformity of content to a cafeteria of narrowly segmented programming distributed to most Americans by cable. ^ Two surveys were conducted to investigate differences in patterns of media cultivation predicted by exposure to television programming broadcast over the air compared with exposure to television programming distributed only by cable. The results of the first survey, conducted with 77 college students, revealed differences in patterns of correlations indicating media cultivation in the domains of anomie, endorsement of sex-role stereotypes, perceived likelihood of victimization, and endorsement of paranormal beliefs. ^ The second survey was conducted in a medium-sized Southern city. A random sample of 113 adults was interviewed by telephone. Over-the-air versus cable-only viewing revealed only one difference in media cultivation: time spent viewing over-the-air networks was negatively related to the endorsement of sex-role stereotypes. This negative relationship was not revealed by time spent viewing cable-distributed programming. When groups were divided into heavy and <b>light</b> cable-only <b>viewers,</b> heavy cable viewers reported more fear of victimization. Differences in indicators of media cultivation for heavy and <b>light</b> <b>viewers</b> of over-the-air programming also emerged. Contrary to the cultivation hypothesis, <b>light</b> over-the-air <b>viewers</b> reported higher likelihoods of victimization and were more likely to perceive the world as a mean place. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portrayals {{of the use}} of {{over-the-counter}} (OTC) analgesics {{on television}} may stimulate their use. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between taking OTC analgesics and television viewing by adolescents. METHODS: A standardized self-administered questionnaire among first-year (mean age 13. 16 y) and fourth-year (mean age 16. 37 y) secondary students in Flanders, Belgium (n = 2546) was administered in a school setting. The independent variable was television viewing; control variables were school year, gender, drinking alcohol, days off sick, computer gaming, and Internet use. The main outcome variable was monthly use of OTC analgesics. RESULTS: On average, respondents watched 3 hours 18 minutes of television per day (boys more than girls, first-year students more than fourth-year students). Per additional hour of television per day, the odds that respondents were regular users of analgesics were 1. 16 times higher (95 % CI 1. 08 to 1. 24). For the 10 % heaviest viewers, the odds were 2. 30 times higher (95 % CI 1. 25 to 4. 24) compared with the 10 % <b>lightest</b> <b>viewers.</b> Odds of OTC analgesic use were higher for students reporting more sick days in the past year (OR 1. 38, 95 % CI 1. 28 to 1. 49), regular users of alcohol (OR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 17 to 1. 50), and girls (OR 1. 92, 95 % CI 1. 35 to 2. 73).
