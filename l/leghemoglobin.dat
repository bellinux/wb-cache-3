This contrasts with the expression of both the P. andersonii hemoglobin protein in P. andersonii nodules and the endogenous Lotus <b>leghemoglobins</b> that are expressed in the infected cells at very high levels. The expression pattern of the P. andersonii and T. tomentosa hemoglobin promoters in L. corniculatus resembles that of a nonsymbiotic hemoglobin gene from Casuarina glauca, which was introduced into this legume, and suggests that only the nonsymbiotic functions of the P. andersonii promoter are being recognized. Deletion of the distal segments of both the P. andersonii and T. tomentosa promoters identified regions important for the control of their tissue-specific and temporal activity in Lotus. Potential regulatory elements, which enhance nodule expression and suppress nonnodule expression, were also identified and localized to a distal promoter segment.

40|$|This review {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} land plant hemoglobins within the broader context of eukaryote hemoglobins and the three families of bacterial globins. Most eukaryote hemoglobins, including metazoan globins and the symbiotic and non-symbiotic plant hemoglobins, are homologous to the bacterial 3 / 3 -fold flavohemoglobins. The remaining plant hemoglobins are homologous to the bacterial 2 / 2 -fold group 2 hemoglobins. We have proposed that all eukaryote globins were acquired via horizontal gene transfer concomitant with the endosymbiotic events responsible for the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Although the 3 / 3 hemoglobins originated in the ancestor of green algae and plants prior {{to the emergence of}} embryophytes at about 450 mya, the 2 / 2 hemoglobins appear to have originated via horizontal gene transfer from a bacterium ancestral to present day Chloroflexi. Unlike the 2 / 2 hemoglobins, the evolution of the 3 / 3 hemoglobins was accompanied by duplication, diversification, and functional adaptations. Duplication of the ancestral plant nshb gene into the nshb- 1 and nshb- 2 lineages occurred prior to the monocot−dicot divergence at ca. 140 mya. It was followed by the emergence of symbiotic hemoglobins from a non-symbiotic hemoglobin precursor and further specialization, leading to <b>leghemoglobins</b> in N 2 -fixing legume nodules concomitant with the origin of nodulation at ca. 60 mya. The transition of non-symbiotic to symbiotic hemoglobins (including to <b>leghemoglobins)</b> was accompanied by the alteration of heme-Fe coordination from hexa- to penta-coordination.

50|$|<b>Leghemoglobin</b> (also {{leghaemoglobin}} or legoglobin) is a nitrogen or {{oxygen carrier}} and hemoprotein {{found in the}} nitrogen-fixing root nodules of leguminous plants. It is produced by legumes {{in response to the}} roots being colonized by nitrogen-fixing bacteria, termed rhizobia, as part of the symbiotic interaction between plant and bacterium: roots not colonized by Rhizobium do not synthesise <b>leghemoglobin.</b> <b>Leghemoglobin</b> has close chemical and structural similarities to hemoglobin, and, like hemoglobin, is red in colour. The holoprotein (protein + heme cofactor) is widely believed to be a product of both plant and the bacterium in which the apoprotein is produced by the plant and the heme (an iron atom bound in a porphyrin ring) is produced by the bacterium.

40|$|Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs) and <b>leghemoglobins</b> (Lbs) are plant {{proteins}} that can reversibly bind O 2 and other ligands. The nsHbs are hexacoordinate {{and appear to}} modulate cellular concentrations of NO and maintain energy levels under hypoxic conditions.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that all plant Hbs evolved from a common ancestor and that Lbs originated from nsHbs.

Predicted structural changes that appear to have occurred during the nsHb to Lb transition were a compaction of the CDloop and decreased mobility of the distal His inhibiting its ability to coordinate directly with the heme-Fe, leading to a pentacoordinate protein. Other predicted changes include shortening of the N- and C-termini, compaction of the protein into a globular structure, disappearance of positive charges outside the heme pocket and appearance of negative charges in an area located between the N- and C-termini.

40|$|Background: Nonsymbiotic hemoglobins (nsHbs) form a {{new class}} of plant {{proteins}} that is distinct genetically and structurally from <b>leghemoglobins.</b> They are found ubiquitously in plants and are expressed in low concentrations in a variety of tissues including roots and leaves. Their function involves a biochemical response to growth under limited O 2 conditions. Results: The first X-ray crystal structure of a member of this class of proteins, riceHb 1, has been determined to 2. 4 Å resolution using a combination of phasing techniques. The active site of ferric riceHb 1 differs significantly from those of traditional hemoglobins and myoglobins. The proximal and distal histidine sidechains coordinate directly to the heme iron, forming a hemichrome with spectral properties similar to those of cytochrome b 5. The crystal structure also shows that riceHb 1 is a dimer with a novel interface formed by close contacts between the G helix and the region between the B and C helices of the partner subunit. Conclusions: The bis-histidyl heme coordination found in riceHb 1 is unusual for a protein that binds O 2 reversibly. However, the distal His 73 is rapidly displaced by ferrous ligands, and the overall O 2 affinity is ultra-high (KD ≈ 1 nM). Our crystallographic model suggests that ligand binding occurs by an upward and outward movement of the E helix, concomitant dissociation of the distal histidine, possible repacking of the CD corner and folding of the D helix. Although the functional relevance of quaternary structure in nsHbs is unclear, the role of two conserved residues in stabilizing the dimer interface has been identified...|$|R

40|$|<b>Leghemoglobins</b> (Lbs) play an {{important}} role in legumes-rhizobia symbiosis. Lbs bind O 2 and protect nitrogenase activity from damage by O 2 in nodules, therefore, they are regarded as a marker of active nitrogen fixation in nodules. Additionally, Lbs are involved in the nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, acting as a NO scavenger during nodule development and nitrogen fixation. However, regulators responsible for Lb expression and modulation of Lb activity have not been characterized. In our previous work, a Jasmonate-Zim-domain (JAZ) protein interacting with a Lb (AsB 2510) in Astragalus sinicus was identified and designated AsJAZ 1. In this study, the interaction between AsJAZ 1 and AsB 2510 was verified using a yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, resulting in identification of the interaction domain as a TIFY (previously known as zinc-finger protein expressed in inflorescence meristem, ZIM) domain. TIFY domain is named after the most conserved amino acids within the domain. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) was used to confirm the interaction between AsJAZ 1 and AsB 2510 in tobacco cells, demonstrating that AsJAZ 1 -AsB 2510 interaction was localized to the cell membrane and cytoplasm. Furthermore, the expression patterns and the symbiotic phenotypes of AsJAZ 1 were investigated. Knockdown of AsJAZ 1 expression via RNA interference led to decreased number of nodules, abnormal development of bacteroids, accumulation of poly-x-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and loss of nitrogenase activity. Taken together, our results suggest that AsJAZ 1 interacts with AsB 2510 and participates in nodule development and nitrogen fixation.

In plants the most known group are the <b>leghemoglobins.</b> Still, other Hbs that not participate in symbiosis are also found. They are known as nonsymbiotic Hbs (nsHbs). NsHbs are divided into class- 1 and class- 2. In this thesis three nsHbs from sugar beet (BvHb 1 - 1, BvHb 1 - 2, and BvHb 2) and one class- 1 nsHb from poplar (PttHb 1) have been studied. Additionally, {{the possibility of using}} nsHbs for biotechnological application is explored. A holistic expression study of the three BvHbs was done. Following the recombinant production of the three BvHbs, their kinetics and binding affinities to oxygen and CO were determined. Concerning PttHb 1, its role as a NO scavenger was investigated by expressing it in roots and mutant yeast. We conclude that, even though differential roles have been given to both class- 1 and class- 2 nsHbs, a specific function can not be given to each group. On the contrary we found that for some nsHbs their roles may be complementary and overlapping. However, some class- 1 nsHbs seem to have a clear NO dioxygenase function. In this study we demonstrate that PttHb 1 alleviates NO toxicity in cells when expressed together with PtthFNR, a reductase. To finalize, given that nsHbs have a variety of potential roles, the possibility of being interesting biotechnological targets is studied. Early results regarding the expression of class- 2 nsHbs in the model plant A. thaliana and in a potential crop Lepidium campestre are presented...|$|R
40|$|Bright red hemoglobins, {{the most}} {{well-known}} paradigm in protein science, seem to be ubiquitous in nature. With advances in modern tools and techniques, discovery of new globins at a rapid pace has expanded this family. With every discovery, new insights emerged regarding their novel structure, function and several other characteristics previously not observed for hemoglobins. Even the classical function unanimously assigned to hemoglobins – oxygen transport and storage – needed re-evaluation. The ability of this class of proteins to show responses against various gaseous ligands, even the poisonous ones, indicate that it is obviously as ancient as life. As organisms evolved, hemoglobins also evolved, and accumulated a great degree of diversity in all aspects. The classical globin fold is very unique with 3 -on- 3 alpha helical bundle as observed in the traditional oxygen-transport hemoglobins like myoglobin, human blood hemoglobin and <b>leghemoglobins</b> in plants. However, a class of the newly discovered hemoglobins, which dominate the superfamily and appears ancient in origin mostly have 2 -on- 2 fold, commonly termed as “truncated” hemoglobins. These hemoglobins are phylogenetically distinct from their classical counterparts and are often shorter in their polypeptide length by 20 - 40 residues mainly {{due to a lack}} of short A helix, D helix and F helix. However, hemoglobins with 2 -on- 2 fold were also later found to have polypeptide chain lengths similar in size to classical globins. Disordered pre-F helix region, conserved glycine motifs and other key residues and apolar tunnels through their protein matrix for migration of ligands are some unique characteristics features of these truncated hemoglobins. Some of these are also hexacoordinated at heme iron where an amino acid from within the protein coordinates heme iron in absence of a ligand. These hemoglobins are well known for their high affinity towards ligand and have a diverse mechanism of ligand binding involving tunnel system and operated by “gate” mechanism of conserved residues. These hemoglobins seem to act as good detoxificant or scavenger of poisonous gases to protect the harbouring organism in adverse environmental condition. This mechanism might help pathogens harbouring these globins to evade host defence mechanism during infection.
