25|$|Alexander Luria's {{earlier work}} on neuropsychological {{processes}} {{led to the}} PASS theory (1997). It argued that only <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring.|$|E
25|$|Massively Parallel Sequencing is a newer {{method that}} can be used to detect mutations. Using this method, up to 17 gigabases can be sequenced at once, as opposed to limited ranges for Sanger {{sequencing}} of only about 1 kilobase. Several technologies are available to perform this test and it is being looked at to be used in clinical applications. When testing for different carcinomas, current methods only allow for <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> gene at a time. Massively Parallel Sequencing can test for a variety of cancer causing mutations at once as opposed to several specific tests. An experiment to determine the accuracy of this newer sequencing method tested for 21 genes and had no false positive calls for frameshift mutations.|$|E

500|$|Philip Sheridan was {{a career}} United States Army {{officer who was}} {{instrumental}} in securing Union successes during the Valley Campaigns of 1864, most notably the Battle of Cedar Creek. [...] Many of the Union generals would eventually be memorialized in Washington, D.C., with statues spread throughout the city. [...] While <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of his comrade's equestrian sculptures, Sheridan was not impressed with the depiction {{of the man and}} horse. [...] He reportedly told his wife [...] "Whatever you do after I'm gone, don't put me on a horse like that." [...] Following her husband's death in 1888, when an equestrian sculpture of her husband was being planned, Irene Sheridan insisted the horse be as [...] "proud and courageous as its rider." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowlby, who, {{unlike most}} psychoanalysts, had direct {{experience}} {{of working with}} deprived children through {{his work at the}} London Child Guidance Clinic, called for more investigation of children's early lives in a paper published in 1940. He proposed that two environmental factors were paramount in early childhood. The first was death of the mother, or prolonged separation from her. The second was the mother's emotional attitude towards her child. This was followed by a study on forty–four juvenile thieves collected through the Clinic. There were many problematic parental behaviours in the samples but Bowlby was <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> environmental factor that was easy to document, namely prolonged early separations of child and mother. Of the forty-four thieves, fourteen fell into the category which Bowlby characterised as being of an [...] "affectionless character". Of these fourteen, twelve had suffered prolonged maternal separations as opposed to only two of the control group.|$|E
500|$|By January 2016, {{ahead of}} the debut of Bernthal as armed vigilante Frank Castle / Punisher in the second season of Daredevil, Netflix was in [...] "very early development" [...] on a {{spin-off}} series titled The Punisher, and {{was looking for a}} showrunner. The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone series, outside of the series leading up to The Defenders. Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making [...] "the best 13 episodes of Daredevil season two" [...] at the time, but did say, [...] "I’m never going to discourage a network from <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> of our characters and encouraging us to do more....If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific." [...] In April 2016, Marvel and Netflix ordered The Punisher, along with confirming Bernthal's involvement and naming Steve Lightfoot as showrunner. Filming began in Brooklyn, New York in October 2016, and concluded in April 2017. The series is set to be released on November 17, 2017.|$|E

500|$|Stepping {{back into}} the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly [...] "what the fuck is going on?"

They lie back on the bed <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?"

500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were less}} {{enthusiastic about the}} episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared [...] "TS-19" [...] a [...] "compelling hour", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. [...] "While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action," [...] explained Wigler, [...] "not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution." [...] Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that {{in contrast to a}} [...] "great season", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that [...] "this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> another in shock; and, though I'm usually not bothered by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would have lived through it." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that it was an interesting episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{quadrupole}} (Q1) {{is connected}} with a collision cell (Q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles {{can be used in}} scanning or static mode, {{depending on the type of}} MS/MS analysis being performed. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) (sometimes referred to as multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)) and neutral loss scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (<b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>one</b> mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called [...] "daughter spectrum"). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a [...] "transition" [...] and forms the basis for SRM. [...] SRM is highly specific and virtually eliminates matrix background.|$|E
