5|$|Worldwide {{about one}} billion people are {{estimated}} to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In large population-based studies in Western countries with sufficient dietary iodine, 0.3–0.4% of the population have overt hypothyroidism. A larger proportion, 4.3–8.5%, have subclinical hypothyroidism. Of people with subclinical hypothyroidism, 80% have a TSH <b>level</b> <b>below</b> the 10mIU/l mark regarded as the threshold for treatment. Children with subclinical hypothyroidism often return to normal thyroid function, and a small proportion develops overt hypothyroidism (as predicted by evolving antibody and TSH levels, the presence of celiac disease, and the presence of a goiter).|$|E
5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom of , but the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the <b>level</b> <b>below</b> it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer parlour, {{projecting}} from {{the north end of}} the range, where members of the community received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior's rooms were probably located above the outer parlour, as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister and the outside world. The largest surviving fragment of the range comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor <b>level</b> <b>below</b> that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible {{to be charged with}} driving under the influence (DUI) with a BAC <b>level</b> <b>below</b> 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
5|$|Treatment for acute adrenal {{insufficiency}} requires the administration of intravenous saline or dextrose solution; volumes of over two liters may be required in an adult. This {{is followed by the}} administration of hydrocortisone, which is pharmaceutical grade cortisol, intravenously or into a muscle. The drug dexamethasone has similar properties, but its use is not recommended unless it is required to reduce swelling in the brain around the area of hemorrhage. Some are well enough not to require immediate cortisol replacement; in this case, blood levels of cortisol are determined at 9:00AM (as cortisol levels vary over the day). A <b>level</b> <b>below</b> 550nmol/l indicates a need for replacement.|$|E
5|$|Born in Glasgow, McAllister {{began his}} career in non-League {{football}} with Eastleigh in 2001. He signed for Isthmian League Premier Division club Basingstoke Town in March 2002 following a successful trial and scored on his debut in a 1–1 draw at home to Hampton & Richmond Borough. McAllister finished 2001–02 with three goals from 10 appearances. He scored on his first appearance of 2002–03 against Aylesbury United on {{the opening day of}} the season, which finished as a 2–2 draw. McAllister scored a hat-trick in a 3–1 win at home to Bishop's Stortford on 9 November 2002, and this was followed up with a hat-trick in the following match, a 3–0 win away to Braintree Town. He finished 2002–03 with 35 goals from 48 appearances. McAllister's success continued into 2003–04, during which he scored another 28 goals in 55 appearances. This success earned him a trial with Queens Park Rangers in the First Division, just one <b>level</b> <b>below</b> the Premier League, and later went on trial with Second Division club Luton Town.|$|E

40|$|SummaryMannose-binding lectin (MBL) {{deficiency}} {{is associated}} with increased susceptibility to airways infections and autoimmunity. We examined whether MBL deficiency was more common in COPD patients, and whether MBL deficiency was associated with COPD severity. 415 COPD patients and 231 healthy subjects, aged 40 – 75, were examined in 2006 / 07. Plasma MBL levels were determined by ELISA. Low or deficient MBL levels were defined as plasma <b>levels</b> <b>below</b> 500 ng/mL or 100 ng/mL respectively. Logistic regression models determined factors associated with MBL deficiency; with explanatory variables study category, sex, age, smoking, comorbid heart disease, and CRP. For COPD severity, explanatory variables were FEV 1, exacerbation history, hypoxia, respiratory symptoms, inhaled steroids, and CRP. 18. 2 % of healthy subjects and 22. 2 % of patients had MBL <b>levels</b> <b>below</b> 100 ng/mL (p= 0. 23); 42. 9 % of healthy subjects and 49. 6 % of patients had <b>levels</b> <b>below</b> 500 ng/mL (p= 0. 10). After adjustment for co-variables, patients had an OR (95 % CI) of 1. 26 (0. 7, 2. 2) for having MBL <b>levels</b> <b>below</b> 100 ng/mL compared with healthy subjects, and an OR (95 % CI) of 1. 06 (0. 7, 1. 7) for having <b>levels</b> <b>below</b> 500 ng/mL.

5|$|Eka-caesium was {{discovered}} in 1939 by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy <b>level</b> <b>below</b> 80keV. Perey thought this decay activity might {{have been caused by}} a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.|$|E
5|$|Growth hormone {{deficiency}} {{is almost}} certain if all other pituitary tests are also abnormal, and {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF-1) levels are decreased. If this is not the case, IGF-1 levels are poorly predictive of the presence of GH deficiency; stimulation testing with the insulin tolerance test is then required. This is performed by administering insulin to lower the blood sugar to a <b>level</b> <b>below</b> 2.2mmol/l. Once this occurs, growth hormone levels are measured. If they are low despite the stimulatory effect of the low blood sugars, growth hormone deficiency is confirmed. The test is not without risks, especially in those prone to seizures or are known to have heart disease, and causes the unpleasant symptoms of hypoglycemia. Alternative tests (such as the growth hormone releasing hormone stimulation test) are less useful, although a stimulation test with arginine may be used for diagnosis, especially in situations where an insulin tolerance test is thought to be too dangerous. If GH deficiency is suspected, and all other pituitary hormones are normal, two different stimulation tests are needed for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments {{proved to be a}} bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given one more year to reduce the budget deficit to a <b>level</b> <b>below</b> 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. The budget deficit for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014.
