5|$|In 1873 Busch {{returned}} {{several times}} to Munich, and {{took part in the}} intense life of the Munich Art Society as an escape from provincial life. In 1877, in a last attempt to be a serious artist, he took a studio in Munich. He left Munich abruptly in 1881, after he disrupted a variety show and subsequently made a scene through the effects of alcohol The 1878 nine episode illustrated tale Eight Sheets in the Wind describes how humans behave <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> when drunk. Busch's biographer Weissweiler felt the story was only superficially funny and harmless, but was a study on addiction and its induced state of delusion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other types}} of {{tessellation}} are possible under different constraints. For example, there are eight types of semi-regular tessellation, made {{with more than one}} kind of regular polygon but still having the same arrangement of polygons at every corner. Irregular tessellations can also be made from other shapes such as pentagons, polyominoes and in fact almost any kind of geometric shape. The artist M. C. Escher is famous for making tessellations with irregular interlocking tiles, shaped <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> and other natural objects. If suitable contrasting colours are chosen for the tiles of differing shape, striking patterns are formed, and these can be used to decorate physical surfaces such as church floors.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} rearing experience and <b>liking</b> <b>animals</b> {{to the development of}} empathy, 155 (88 male and 67 female) elementary school students in the fifth grade, 148 (72 male and 76 female) junior high school students in the second grade, 96 (51 male and 45 female) senior high school students in the second grade submitted a questionnaire. Using the ESC 6 scale or ESC 4 scale based on the Empathy Scale for Children constructed by Sakurai (1986) the scores of empathy were as follows. Both the empathy scores of male and female elementary school students who experienced rearing and male and female junior high school students and female high school students who experienced rearing and <b>liking</b> <b>animals</b> were higher. Therefore it was suggested that rearing and <b>liking</b> <b>animals</b> had positive effects on the development of empathy...|$|R
5|$|The Late Woodland in Iowa {{is perhaps}} best known for effigy mounds, large, low mounds shaped <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> such as birds and bears. Effigy mounds are {{distributed}} across southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and northeast Iowa. A large concentration of mounds in several groups is preserved at Effigy Mounds National Monument. Like most mounds in Iowa, excavation reveals that these mounds were commonly used as sacred burial locations but contain few artifacts. Recent ground-penetrating radar survey of selected mounds at Effigy Mounds National Monument reveal that many are badly disturbed, but others appear to be comparatively intact. The Folkert Mound Group in central Iowa contains an enigmatic cruciform mound {{that may or may not}} be astronomically aligned.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} von Stroheim used {{grotesque}} imagery and characters. This is most {{apparent in the}} wedding-banquet scene, which includes a midget, a hunchback, a woman with buck teeth and a boy on crutches. The wedding guests violently and crudely devour their meal <b>like</b> <b>animals.</b> This scene was unlike any other in films of that period, which treated meals with dignity {{and a sense of}} communion. Other instances of grotesque imagery include Trina's fingers becoming infected and amputated. Von Stroheim contrasted love scenes between McTeague and Trina with their ugly, lower-class environment, such as the sewer with the dead rat and a garbage truck driving by as they kiss.|$|E

25|$|The art of {{describing}} {{the natural world}} through direct observation divides Renaissance natural historians from their medieval predecessors, whose practitioners were largely uncritical adherents of the ancient texts. The earliest printed works in Renaissance natural history fell into two categories: 1. newly recovered, translated and corrected editions of ancient texts, and 2. herbals based on the empirical knowledge of the early botanists. Although Francis Bacon advocated inductive thinking based on observation or description (empiricism) as the way to understand and report on the natural world, the early Renaissance printed herbals were slightly modified adaptations {{of the works of}} their medieval predecessors. Generally, these somewhat unscientific early scientists contented themselves with listing plants and occasionally other things <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> and minerals, and noting their medical uses.|$|E
25|$|The worst {{experience}} for Libyan Jews {{in the war}} was the internment of Cyrenaican Jews in Giado, a concentration camp located 235 kilometres from Tripoli. In January 1942, the Italian authorities began to apply Mussolini’s “Sfollamento” order to Libyan Jews. Mussolini ordered the Jews of Benghazi, Derna, Tobruk, Barce, Susa and other towns {{in the region to}} be sent to a concentration camp in Gharian in retaliation. An eyewitness described these horrifying moments: “In the synagogue they started hanging up lists every day of 20-30 families that had to leave...They took Jews from Benghazi and from the vicinity: Derna, Brace, Tobruk...The journey took five days. We travelled about 2,000 km. from Benghazi to Giado. They took us <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> to the slaughter house. Forty people in each truck and each truck had two Italian policemen. They took only Jews. According to the rumour it was the Germans who gave the order”.|$|E
25|$|According to West German {{figures in}} late 1944 the Soviets transported 27,000 to 30,000 ethnic Germans, a {{majority}} of whom were women aged 18 to 35, to the Ukraine and the Donbass for forced labour; about 20% (5,683) were reported dead or missing. Data from Russian archives published in 2001, based on an actual enumeration, put the number of German civilians deported from Yugoslavia to the USSR in early 1945 for reparations labour at 12,579, where 16% (1,994) died. After March 1945, a second phase began in which ethnic Germans were massed into villages such as Gakowa and Kruševlje that were converted into labour camps. All furniture was removed, straw placed on the floor, and the expellees housed <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> under military guard, with minimal food and rampant, untreated disease. Families were divided into the unfit women, old, and children, and those fit for slave labour. A total of 166,970 ethnic Germans were interned, and 48,447 (29%) perished. The camp system was shut down in March 1948.|$|E

Froissart blamed Orléans for the tragedy, and the monk blamed the instigator, de Guisay, whose reputation for treating low-born servants <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> earned him such universal hatred that [...] "the Nobles rejoiced at his agonizing death".|$|E

500|$|Thierrée was {{the only}} actor allowed to improvise. His {{characterisation}} of Taloche was built on spontaneity, and in many instances, Gatlif had no clue how he would act in a scene, such as in [...] the tap scene in which he plunges into a stairwell. In another scene, in which he dances with war music in the background, Thierrée pretended {{to make love to}} the earth like an animal. Gatlif, who had wanted the character {{to have the ability to}} [...] sense forthcoming danger, <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> often do, stated that Thierrée was suitable [...] for the role because he is very much an animal. The dance scene where Taloche is shown falling from a tree was done without stunt doubles.|$|E
500|$|Bishop Desmond Tutu, who Bilheimer had {{previously}} interviewed for The Cry of Reason, appears {{towards the end}} of the film, saying, [...] "Each of us has the capacity to be a saint." [...] Bilheimer included Tutu in Not My Life because he felt that audiences might be in need of pastoral counseling after watching the film. The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana. His name is revealed to be Etse, and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued. Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo Sakomoto: [...] "I can't see a good life while there are people living <b>like</b> <b>animals.</b> Not because I'm a good person, not because it's my duty, but because they are human—like me." ...|$|E
500|$|The Hobbit employs {{themes of}} animism. An {{important}} concept in anthropology and child development, animism {{is the idea}} that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things <b>like</b> <b>animals</b> and plants—possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the [...] "Doctor Dolittle Theme" [...] in The History of the Hobbit, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the [...] "roots of mountains" [...] and [...] "feet of trees" [...] in The Hobbit as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate. Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: [...] "...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' saw things very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'." ...|$|E
