40|$|The {{single crystal}} Raman spectra of natural mineral finnemanite Pb 5 (AsO 3) 3 Cl from the Långban locality, Filipstad district, Värmland province, Sweden are {{presented}} {{for the first}} time. It is a hexagonal mineral belonging to the ortho arsenite group, where the [AsO 3] 3 - ion is isolated. The spectra of finnemanite are characterized by a strong band at 734 cm- 1 overlying a shoulder at 726 cm- 1, and broad overlapping bands in the lower wavenumber with the strongest band positioned at 174 cm- 1. Band assignments were made based on band symmetry, experimental band positions from literature and DFT calculated Raman spectrum, and spectral comparison with other ortho arsenite minerals reinerite, cafarsite, and nealite and synthetic <b>lead</b> <b>arsenite</b> compounds Pb 2 (AsO 2) 3 Cl, Pb 2 As 2 O 5, and PbAs 2 O 4. The band at 734 cm- 1 was assigned to υ 1 (AsO 3), bands at 726 and 640 cm- 1 assigned to υ 3, 372 and 357 cm- 1 to υ 2, and 244, 239 and 207 cm- 1 to υ 4. The single crystal spectra of finnemanite showed good mode separation, allowing bands to be assigned a symmetry species of Ag, E 1 g, or E 2 g...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{of the formation of}} periodic precipitate structure has attracted the attention of several research workers. The usual method of obtaining such structures is to diffuse the external electrolyte into the gel impregnated with internal electrolyte. In this thesis the phenomenon is explained based on diffusion mechanism and the following logarithmic relationship. 			Log (Xn-Xn- 1) = A + α Xn In the present studies six different systems, viz. <b>lead</b> <b>arsenite,</b> lead arsenate, lead carbonate, lead fluoride in aqueous agar agar gel and zinc carbonate and lead carbonate in aqueous polyvinyl alcohol gel. Data obtained for the spacings between the rings has been plotted as log (Xn-Xn- 1) against Xn. The curves obtained are straight lines proving the validity of the equation for all the systems. The influence of concentrations of external and internal electrolytes on the spacing of rings is another aspected predicted by the equation. From the general equation; 			(Xn-Xn- 1) = (P(S/CoCo 1)) eαXn The distance between the consecutive rings should be inversely proportional to the concentration of extend and internal electrolyte. Detailed studies were also made on the factors influencing the spacings in periodic precipitation with special reference to the effects of anions, acids, gel concentration, addition of glycerol, mixed gels, temperature, electric potential etc. All the above mentioned factors influence the ring spacings by increasing or decreasing the rate of diffusion of ions. The logarithmic relationship is also verified in all these cases. The correctness of the mathematical theory of the formation of periodic precipitation based on diffusion mechanism is proved from the various experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|The {{single crystal}} Raman spectra of natural mineral paulmooreite Pb 2 As 2 O 5 from the Långban locality, Filipstad district, Värmland province, Sweden are {{presented}} {{for the first}} time. It is a monoclinic mineral containing an isolated [As 2 O 5] 4 -. Depolarised and single crystal spectra of the natural and synthetic sample compare favorably and are characterized by strong bands around 186 and 140 cm- 1 and three medium bands at 800 – 700 cm- 1. Band assignments were made based on band symmetry and spectral comparison between experimental band positions and those resulting from Hartree-Fock calculation of an isolated [As 2 O 5] 4 - ion. Spectral comparison was also made with <b>lead</b> <b>arsenites</b> such as synthetic PbAs 2 O 4 and Pb 2 (AsO 2) 3 Cl and natural finnemanite {{in order to determine}} the contribution of the terminal and bridging O in paulmooreite. Bands at 760 – 733 cm- 1 were assigned to terminal As-O vibrations, whereas stretches of the bridging O occur at 562 and 503 cm- 1. The single crystal spectra showed good mode separation, allowing bands to be assigned a symmetry species of Ag or Bg...|$|R
40|$|The {{penicillinase}} plasmids, {{a series}} of extrachromosomal resistance factors in Staphylococcus aureus, were found to carry determinants of resistance to {{a series of}} inorganic ions as well as resistance to penicillin and, in some cases, erythromycin. Most of the ions involved were inhibitory but not lethal to the bacteria; the resistance markers conferred an increase in resistance by comparison with susceptible organisms of between 3 - and 100 -fold, depending on the ion involved. Separate genetic loci for resistance to arsenate, <b>arsenite,</b> <b>lead,</b> cadmium, mercuric, and bismuth ions were demonstrated. Resistance to antimony and resistance to zinc were also found but were not separated genetically from resistance to arsenite and cadmium, respectively. The ion resistance markers appeared to form a cluster on the plasmid, with no other known marker within it. Naturally occurring plasmids were observed that lacked {{one or more of these}} ion resistance markers, as well as penicillinase-negative strains that were resistant to one or more of the ions. The patterns of markers carried by these various strains may provide some understanding of the evolution of a plasmid linkage group...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Long-term {{exposure}} of <b>arsenite</b> <b>leads</b> to human skin cancer. However, the exact mechanisms of arsenite-induced human skin carcinogenesis {{remain to be}} defined. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we investigated the potential role of PI- 3 K/Akt/cyclin D 1 in the transformation of human keratinocytic cells upon arsenite exposure. METHODS: We used the soft agar assay to evaluate the cell transformation activity of arsenite exposure and the nude mice xenograft model to determine the tumorigenesis of arsenite-induced transformed cells. We used the dominant negative mutant and gene knockdown approaches to elucidate the signaling pathway involved in this process. RESULTS: Our results showed that repeated long-term {{exposure of}} HaCat cells to arsenite caused cell transformation, as indicated by anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. The tumorigenicity of these transformed cells was confirmed in nude mice. Treatment of cells with arsenite also induced significant activation of PI- 3 K and Akt, which {{was responsible for the}} anchorage-independent cell growth induced by arsenite exposure. Furthermore, our data also indicated that cyclin D 1 is an important downstream molecule involved in PI- 3 K/Akt–mediated cell transformation upon arsenite exposure based on the facts that inhibition of cyclin D 1 expression by dominant negative mutants o...|$|R
40|$|Summary When HeLa {{cells are}} exposed to brief heat shock at 45 °C there is a {{reduction}} in the cellular level of Na+K+ATPase. Return of the cells to the normal growth temperature of 37 °C leads to a partial restoration of enzyme activity. The pattern of this recovery of activity suggests that it may be associated with the induction of heat shock proteins. Indeed other means of heat shock protein induction such as continuous heat treatment at 42 °C, or treatment of cells at 37 °C with sodium <b>arsenite,</b> <b>leads</b> to elevated levels of Na+K+ATPase activity and alterations in the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Continuous hyperthermia at 42 °C led to increased lactate production which could be blocked with ouabain suggesting that effects on Na+K+ATPase activity could partly influence glycolysis. A number of other human and hamster cells also showed increased lactate production at 42 °C and also an inhibition of lactate production by ouabain. Whilst incubation of HeLa cells with cyanide had little effect on glycolysis at 37 °C elevation of the temperature to 42 °C (or 45 °C), in the presence of cyanide, impaired glycolysis. The possible role in this phenomenon, of an unusual oxygen-sensitive isoenzyme of lactate dehydrogenase, expressed in human cancers, is discussed. The potential of hyperthermia in cancer therap...|$|R
40|$|The genes {{encoding}} for beta-lactamase (bla+) {{and resistance}} to metallic ions (cadmium, mercury, <b>lead,</b> arsenate, and <b>arsenite)</b> were located in a 56. 2 -kilobase plasmid, pZA 10, isolated from a clinical strain, Staphylococcus aureus 6344. This strain produced enterotoxin B and enterotoxin C 1. Elimination of pZA 10 by either sodium dodecyl sulfate or heat treatment (43 degrees C) resulted {{in the loss of}} the capability of the bacteria to produce both enterotoxin B and enterotoxin C 1. A physical map of pZA 10 was constructed with BamHI, SalI and BglII restriction endonucleases. Penicillin-resistant, enterotoxin B- and C 1 -producing cotransformants were isolated by transformation with pZA 10 DNA with either S. aureus RN 450 or cured S. aureus 6344 as recipients. The transferred plasmids exhibited genetic instability shown by changes in restriction pattern and molecular size, loss of plasmid DNA, and addition of chromosomal DNA. Enterotoxin B production was related to a 18. 1 -kilobase pZA 10 fragment carried by such a rearranged plasmid. Chromosomal cointegration of bla+ with genetic determinants for metallic ion resistance and enterotoxin B and C 1 production were detected in heat-treated S. aureus 6344. Transformation employing chromosomal DNA containing the integrated plasmid resulted in excision and reestablishment of pZA 10 -related plasmids in the transformants. pZA 10 -linked resistance to cadmium, which was lost upon the integration of pZA 10 into the host chromosome, reappeared in transformants carrying the excised plasmid...|$|R
40|$|Organic and {{organometallic}} compounds dissolved in natural waters were studied {{by means of}} instrumental methods of chemical analysis of high sensitivity and selectivity. Most of the natural samples studied in this work were collected in two estuaries: Mira (a small estuary with low pollution) and Tejo (one of the major estuaries in Europe and heavilly polluted). Biological models (microscopic algae and methanogenic bacteria) were also studied measuring the chemical composition of the culture media {{as well as the}} effect on the biological activity of some compounds added to the media (<b>lead,</b> glycine and <b>arsenite).</b> The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was measured over a neap tidal cycle, in the cross section of a creek salt-marsh of the Mira estuary. The values of DOC measured by two analytical methods were compared and were applied to the import-export study of that estuarine region. The analysis of low molecular weight compounds, naturally occuring in waters (amino acids, sugars and organic acids) have been carried out in order to get information about the composition of natural waters and relating with biological activity. Organotin compounds were analysed in sediments collected in Tejo estuary. The measured values were used to access the contamination of the estuarine region with tin compounds and the possible interference in oyster culture. The chromatographic behaviour of synthetic arsenic compounds was studied in order to set up analytical methods suitable for the analysis of samples of natural waters. Samples of water from Tejo estuary were analysed in order to characterize the arsenic compoundsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av. D.
