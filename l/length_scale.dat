5|$|Using global geometry, some spacetimes can {{be shown}} to contain {{boundaries}} called horizons, which demarcate one region {{from the rest of}} spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the underdamped dynamics {{of a chain}} of atoms subject to a de driving force and a quasiperiodic substrate potential. The system has three inherent <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> which we take to be mutually incommensurate.

When the <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> are related by the golden mean (a quadratic irrational) the static friction is always nonzero. From considerations based on the connection of this problem to standard map theory, we postulate that zero static friction is generally possible for incommensurate ratios of the <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> involved. However, when the <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> are quadratic irrationals, or have some commensurability with each other, the static friction will be nonzero for all choices of interaction parameters.

25|$|Detached eddy {{simulations}} (DES) is {{a modification}} of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> {{is less than the}} maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart–Allmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions.|$|E
25|$|The {{validity}} of the continuum assumption {{is dependent on the}} density of the gas and the application in question. For the continuum assumption to be valid, the mean free path length must be much smaller than the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> of the application in question. For example, many aerodynamics applications deal with aircraft flying in atmospheric conditions, where the mean free path length is on the order of micrometers and where the body is orders of magnitude larger. In these cases, the <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> of the aircraft ranges from a few meters to a few tens of meters, which is much larger than the mean free path length. For such applications, the continuum assumption is reasonable. The continuum assumption is less valid for extremely low-density flows, such as those encountered by vehicles at very high altitudes (e.g. 300,000ft/90km) or satellites in Low Earth orbit. In those cases, statistical mechanics is a more accurate method of solving the problem than is continuum aerodynamics. The Knudsen number can be used to guide the choice between statistical mechanics and the continuous formulation of aerodynamics.|$|E

40|$|The {{small-scale}} environment {{characterized by}} the local density is known to {{play a crucial role}} in deciding the galaxy properties but the role of large-scale environment on galaxy formation and evolution still remain a less clear issue. We propose an information theoretic framework to investigate the influence of large-scale environment on galaxy properties and apply it to the data from the Galaxy Zoo project which provides the visual morphological classifications of ∼ 1 million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a non-zero mutual information between morphology and environment which decreases with increasing <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> but persists throughout the entire <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> probed. We estimate the conditional mutual information and the interaction information between morphology and environment by conditioning the environment on different <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> and find a synergic interaction between them which operates upto at least a <b>length</b> <b>scales</b> of ∼ 30 h^- 1 Mpc. Our analysis indicates that these interactions largely arise due to the mutual information shared between the environments on different <b>length</b> <b>scales.</b> Comment: 6 pages, 1 figure, minor revision, Accepted for publication in MNRAS Letter...|$|R
25|$|The {{equation}} for an oblong {{object is}} identical {{to that of a}} sphere, with the object being approximated as an ellipsoid and the axis of length being chosen as the characteristic <b>length</b> <b>scale.</b> Such considerations are important in natural streams, for example, where there are few perfectly spherical grains.

A more correct speed would be that characteristic of the swirl fd, where f is the precession (and sound) frequency, based on the Rossby number. To test the relevance of this new characteristic speed, the flow rate was increased and the frequency and level of the sound was measured. Using the dipole model, the calculated force was found to be nearly proportional to (fd)2, confirming the correctness of the new characteristic speed.|$|E

25|$|Baryon {{acoustic}} oscillations (BAO) are regular, {{periodic fluctuations}} in {{the density of the}} visible baryonic matter (normal matter) of the universe. These are predicted to arise in the Lambda-CDM model due to the early universe's acoustic oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid and can be observed in the cosmic microwave background angular power spectrum. BAOs set up a preferred <b>length</b> <b>scale</b> for baryons. As the dark matter and baryons clumped together after recombination, the effect is much weaker in the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe, but is detectable as a subtle (~ 1 percent) preference for pairs of galaxies to be separated by 147 Mpc, compared to those separated by 130 or 160 Mpc. This feature was predicted theoretically in the 1990s and then discovered in 2005, in two large galaxy redshift surveys, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. Combining the CMB observations with BAO measurements from galaxy redshift surveys provides a precise estimate of the Hubble constant and the average matter density in the Universe.
