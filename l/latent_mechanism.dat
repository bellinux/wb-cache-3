40|$|The {{profound}} {{inhibitory effect}} of Tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA) on atherosclerosis has been demonstrated, whereas the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is not completely}} cleared. This study aimed to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Tan IIA protecting against atherosclerosis. Oil Red O staining and ELISA assay showed that Tan IIA suppressed the progress of atherosclerosis and reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines in serum of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE–/–) mice. Flow cytometry assay revealed that Tan IIA inhibited oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) -induced apoptosis of VSMCs. MTT and transwell assay indicated that Tan IIA suppressed the ox-LDL-stimulated proliferation and migration of RAW 264. 7 cells. Moreover, Tan IIA ameliorated inflammatory cytokine upregulation elicited by ox-LDL in RAW 264. 7 cells. Additionally, Tan IIA inhibited the apoptosis of VSMCs and decreased the levels of MMP- 2, MMP- 9 in ApoE–/– mice. In conclusion, our study demonstrated Tan IIA suppressed the progression of atherosclerosis by inhibiting vascular inflammation, apoptosis of VSMCs and proliferation and migration of macrophages induced by ox-LDL...|$|E
30|$|The {{cytotoxic}} effect of AgNPs on cell viability {{has a major}} role in antitumor activity, thereby reducing disease progression. Cellular internalization of silver might provide the basis for the cytotoxicity of AgNPs [39, 53]. Sriram et al. found that AgNPs could enter the cell through endocytosis, acted on the nucleus to interfere with chromosome stability, and interrupt the mitosis [29]. Active anticancer components are known to exhibit a consistent antitumor effect by blocking abnormal expression alterations of multiple signaling proteins, such as VEGF, p 53, JAK-STAT, and CDC 14 A [45, 54, 55]. The antitumor activity of AgNPs was also shown to be mediated by induction of proliferation and apoptosis by active caspase 9 and active caspase 3 in a GBM tumor system in vitro [56]. These biological responses eventually lead to the survival or apoptosis of the cancer cells and prompt a promising way of AgNPs for prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of targeting has not fully understood for the inhibitory effects of AgNPs on the prostate cancer cells. Further research efforts are deserved to elucidate the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism</b> and then lead to more effective measures for prostate cancer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAngiotensin II (Ang II) -elicited {{excessive}} proliferation, hypertrophy {{and migration}} of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) {{are vital to}} the pathogenesis of atheroclerosis. Glutathione S-transferase pi (GSTpi) exists extensively in various kinds of cells and protects cells against different stresses. However, knowledge remains limited about what GSTpi acts in VSMCs. We investigated the effect of GSTpi on Ang II-induced VSMC proliferation, hypertrophy and migration and its <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Overexpression and RNAi experiments demonstrated that GSTpi inhibited Ang II-induced proliferation, hypertrophy and migration of VSMCs and arrested progression of cell cycle from G 0 /G 1 to S phase. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy analyses showed that GSTpi directly associated with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) to prevent Ang II-triggered binding of Src to STAT 3 and thus suppressed Ang II-stimulated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT 3, as well as cyclin D 1 expression. In contrast, GSTpi didn't affect Ang II-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK 1 / 2). GSTpi acts as a negative regulator to prevent Ang II-triggered proliferative signaling in VSMCs, suggesting that it may protect vessels against the stresses associated with atherosclerosis formation...|$|E

The reported causes were indicated as acute rejection (El-Gamel et al. 1999), lymphocytic bronchitis (Husain et al. 1999), cytomegalovirus pneumonitis (Heng et al. 1998), adenoviral infection (Murtagh et al. 2009), single lung transplant (Hadjiliadis et al. 2002), anti-human leukocyte antigen antibody development (Palmer et al. 2002), and et al.

40|$|This article {{sets out}} to reveal and analyse one element of a <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism,</b> namely the {{marginalisation}} and social exclusion within schools of pupils who obtain bad school results. Under {{the pressure of the}} ideology of democratisation and equalisation of opportunities, schools have the tendency to make fewer demands in order to allow students to stay longer at school. This has not, however, resolved the problem: pupils do stay on at school. but they are subjected to processes of exclusion within it. Following up on this observation, we pose the following questions: what are the social relations between these students and those who achieve and are successful at school?What factor or factors determine these relations? Are these relations marked by integration or by rejection in the microenvironment that constitutes the school? It is the latter point which refers to the hypotheses of our article. Our empirical research on this subject, which involved a sample of 301 students in their last year of primary schooling, confirmed our hypotheses that the relations of attraction and exclusion are correlated to the school results obtained by pupils; which themselves are dependent on the social origins of students. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In plants, post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} (PTGS) is mediated by DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL 1) -dependent microRNAs (miRNAs), which also trigger 21 -nucleotide secondary short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) via RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR 6), DCL 4 and ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO 1), whereas transcriptional {{gene silencing}} (TGS) of transposons is mediated by 24 -nucleotide heterochromatic (het) siRNAs, RDR 2, DCL 3 and AGO 4 (ref. 4). Transposons can also give rise to abundant 21 -nucleotide 'epigenetically activated' small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in DECREASED DNA METHYLATION 1 (ddm 1) and DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (met 1) mutants, {{as well as in}} the vegetative nucleus of pollen grains and in dedifferentiated plant cell cultures. Here we show that easiRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana resemble secondary siRNAs, in that thousands of transposon transcripts are specifically targeted by more than 50 miRNAs for cleavage and processing by RDR 6. Loss of RDR 6, DCL 4 or DCL 1 in a ddm 1 background results in loss of 21 -nucleotide easiRNAs and severe infertility, but 24 -nucleotide hetsiRNAs are partially restored, supporting an antagonistic relationship between PTGS and TGS. Thus miRNA-directed easiRNA biogenesis is a <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism</b> that specifically targets transposon transcripts, but only when they are epigenetically reactivated during reprogramming of the germ line. This ancient recognition mechanism may have been retained both by transposons to evade long-term heterochromatic silencing and by their hosts for genome defence...|$|E

To explore the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism,</b> male wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats (WTR) and transgenic rats harboring the hKLK 1 gene (TGR) were fed to 4 and 18 months old and {{divided into four}} groups: young WTR (yWTR) as the control, aged WTR (aWTR), aged TGR (aTGR) and aged TGRs with HOE 140 (aTGRH). Erectile function of all rats was evaluated by cavernous nerve electrostimulation method and measured by the ratio of intracavernous pressure/ mean arterial pressure (ICP/MAP) in rats. Expression levels of cAMP and cGMP were assessed, and related signaling pathways were detected by western blot, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. Our experiment results showed erectile function of the aWTR group and aTGRH group was lower {{compared with those of}} other two groups. Also, expression levels of cAMP and cGMP were significantly lower than those of other two groups. Moreover, expressions of related signaling pathways including DDAH/ADMA/NOS/cGMP and COX- 2 /PTGIS/cAMP were also downregulated in the corpus cavernosum of rats in aWTR group. Our finding revealed hKLK 1 played a protective role in age-related ED.

How can agents develop such goals autonomously? This paper proposes a detailed conceptual and computational account to this longstanding problem. We argue to consider goals as high-level abstractions of lower-level intention mechanisms such as rewards and values, and point out that goals need to be considered alongside with a detection of the own actions' effects. We propose Latent Goal Analysis as a computational learning formulation thereof, and show constructively that any reward or value function can by explained by goals and such self-detection as <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We first show that learned goals provide a highly effective dimensionality reduction in a practical reinforcement learning problem.

30|$|Rumor {{spreading}} {{in complex}} social networks has recently attracted an increasing {{amount of attention}} from researchers [9 – 12]. They describe {{the dynamics of the}} models by deriving corresponding mean-field equations to formulate the characteristics and analyze the critical threshold of rumor spreading in the complex networks. In 1965, Daley and Kendall put forward the first classical DK rumor spreading model [13]. Some researchers applied a mathematical model to study the rumors and developed another classical model [14 – 17]. Early classical representations of rumor spreading dynamics assumed that all individuals have the homogeneous probability of connection [18 – 20]. Obviously, these simple models can not completely reflect the realistic feature of the spread of rumor, which is subsequently extended in ways to make them more realistic in recent years. Such extensions are combining with spreading mode that the online networks platform could affect the topology of rumor spreading network. Another direction to research rumor spreading model is to focus on the complex topology of social interactions. In the field of social network, the scale-free property is the fundamental characteristic, and the nodes stand for individuals and the edges stand for various interactions of people. Therefore, it makes more sense to study spreading dynamics on scale-free networks [21 – 26]. For further understanding of the rumor spreading dynamic in the real world, the counterattack and self-resistance mechanisms, trust mechanism, <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism,</b> rumor-killer mechanism, and information pushing mechanism [27 – 33] have been taken into account. These models more accurately reflect the spread of rumors and also give a lot of control strategies for rumors.|$|E
40|$|What are the {{mechanisms}} behind {{the origin of}} novel animal traits, {{and how can we}} use them to improve the sustainability and efficiency of different food-producing sectors such as livestock meat production, aquaculture and fisheries? The evolutionists have clearly established that adaptative evolution is a two-step process that begins with the production of phenotypic variation through the developmental processes and then continues with selection. Hence, evolution begins with genetically variable development, but the environmental sensitivity of development suggests that environmental variations can also be the source of the selectable phenotypic variations (West Eberhard, 2003). In nature a great variety of traits such as large or small animals can be observed but we still do not know why evolution has selected and preserved such environmentally sensitive mechanisms that regulate animal phenotypes. However, the potential phenotype repertoire of an individual is much greater than that actually expressed in its lifetime. The question of generating new traits for animal production therefore amounts to designing targeted experimental interventions into the developmental processes. Fertilization is a pivotal event that constitutes a perfectly integrated mechanism and it is considered that egg metabolism is a fundamental process that should be maintained in a precise functional range for normal development. However, since early stage of fertilization organizes the zygotic genome expression, we took the freedom of experimentally throwing out of gear (Needham, 1933) two metabolic pathways that regulate genome expression, i. e. the regulation of the NAD+/NADH ratio and the mitochondria energy production, to induce different developmental paths. We report here that the post-natal growth rates of animals can be up or down regulated by experimentally dissociating the NADH and FAD 2 + cofactor signaling following fertilization. Zygotes experiencing cytosolic NADH oxidation result in smaller animals while cytosolic alkalization which increases NAD+ reduction provides animals that become significantly and persistently larger than controls. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the phenotypes are the product of a non-lethal "environmentally induced" trait. To our knowledge {{this is the first time}} that such traits have been precisely modulated by transient manipulation of metabolic parameters during the short time window of fertilization. It underlines the fact that the environment has a strong morphogenetic impact rather than just a selective role in evolution. The results show evidence for the existence of a powerful developmental mechanism that regulates animal growth. This still unknown process may potentially represent a <b>latent</b> <b>mechanism</b> that can be exploited to identify how morphological or physiological traits can be amplified or reduced via direct manipulation of egg functioning. Therefore, through the utilization of state-of-the-art engineering and modeling technologies alongside real time intracellular manipulations of egg metabolism, we can see that the inductive period of fertilization offers an unparalleled opportunity to harness and control the developmental processes. Driving egg metabolism in relation to chromatin remodeling will make it possible to develop a multidisciplinary approach for driving epigenetical processes on purpose to program animal health and fitness for sustainable food production...|$|E

40|$|Stem cells, their niches, {{and their}} {{relationship}} to cancer are under intense investigation. Because tumors and metastases acquire self-renewing capacity, mechanisms for their establishment may involve cell–cell interactions similar to those between stem cells and stem cell niches. On the basis of our studies in Caenorhabditis elegans, we introduce the concept of a “latent niche” as a differentiated cell type that does not normally contact stem cells nor act as a niche but that can, under certain conditions, promote the ectopic self-renewal, proliferation, or survival of competent cells that it inappropriately contacts. Here, we show that ectopic germ-line stem cell proliferation in C. elegans is driven by a <b>latent</b> niche <b>mechanism</b> and that the molecular basis for this mechanism is inappropriate Notch activation. Furthermore, we show that continuous Notch signaling is required to maintain ectopic germ-line proliferation. We highlight the latent niche concept by distinguishing it from a normal stem cell niche, a premetastatic niche and an ectopic niche. One of the important distinguishing features of this mechanism for tumor initiation is that it could operate in the absence of genetic changes to the tumor cell or the tumor-promoting cell. We propose that a <b>latent</b> niche <b>mechanism</b> may underlie tumorigenesis and metastasis in humans...|$|R

According to recent systematic reviews residential energy efficiency interventions may benefit health. It is argued that home energy improvement are complex interventions and that {{a better understanding of}} the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> and contextual issues that may shape the outcome of interventions is needed for effective intervention design. This realist review synthesises the results of 28 energy efficiency improvement programmes. This first part provides a review of the explanatory factors of the three key pathways, namely warmth in the home, affordability of fuel and psycho-social factors, and the pitfall of inadequate indoor air quality. The review revealed that REEIs improved winter warmth and lowered relative humidity with benefits for cardiovascular and respiratory health. In addition, residential energy efficiency improvements consolidated the meaning of the home as a safe haven, strengthened the householder&# 039;s perceived autonomy and enhanced social status. Although satisfaction with the home proved to be an important explanation for positive mental health outcomes, financial considerations seemed to have played a secondary role. Evidence for negative impacts was rare but the risk should not be dismissed. Comprehensive refurbishments were not necessarily more effective than thermal retrofits or upgrades. A common protocol for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of interventions would facilitate the synthesis of future studies.

40|$|Amblyopia is {{a common}} visual {{disorder}} that results in a spatial acuity deficit in the affected eye. Orthodox treatment is to occlude the unaffected eye for lengthy periods, largely determined by {{the severity of the}} visual deficit at diagnosis. Although this treatment is not without its problems (poor compliance, potential to reduce binocular function, etc) it is effective in many children with moderate to severe amblyopia. Diagnosis and initiation of treatment early in life are thought to be {{critical to the success of}} this form of therapy. Occlusion is rarely undertaken in older children (more than 10 years old) as the visual benefits are considered to be marginal. Therefore, in subjects where occlusion is not effective or those missed by mass screening programs, there is no alternative therapy available later in life. More recently, burgeoning evidence has begun to reveal previously unrecognized levels of residual neural plasticity in the adult brain and scientists have developed new genetic, pharmacological, and behavioral interventions to activate these <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in order to harness their potential for visual recovery. Prominent amongst these is the concept of perceptual learning—the fact that repeatedly practicing a challenging visual task leads to substantial and enduring improvements in visual performance over time. In the normal visual system the improvements are highly specific to the attributes of the trained stimulus. However, in the amblyopic visual system, learned improvements have been shown to generalize to novel tasks. In this paper we ask whether amblyopic deficits can be reduced in adulthood and explore the pattern of transfer of learned improvements. We also show that developing training protocols that target the deficit in stereo acuity allows the recovery of normal stereo function even in adulthood. This information will help guide further development of learning-based interventions in this clinical group...|$|R

Firstly, the statistical benefits of Bayesian estimation in cognitive models of decision-making are demonstrated. In this research stream, I cover fundamentals of Bayesian estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. I demonstrate {{the benefits of}} such techniques with two applications of a well-validated evidence accumulation model, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA: Brown & Heathcote, 2008). The first application {{highlights the importance of}} the Bayesian estimation of the LBA in a clinical setting; I uncover <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> involved in the inability of individuals with major depressive disorder to disengage from negative emotional stimuli. The second application explores the foundational aspects of the LBA mechanisms from a neural perspective. To conclude this section, I describe a novel development in joint modelling. A model framework was developed which quantitatively links neural and behavioural data streams. The framework allows both data streams to jointly influence parameters, via Bayesian estimation. The second stream of research focuses on Bayesian frameworks for the description of cognition, rather than as tools to measure it. Motivated by current debates in the literature I directly and quantitatively compare human and Bayesian inference, demonstrating that human inference deviates from statistically optimal Bayesian inference, at least for simple inference. I finally describe work which explores the potential mental representations of alphabetic letters using a novel graphing algorithm based on Bayesian principles. The work in this thesis highlights the benefits of Bayesian statistical framework, both demonstrating and adding to their lasting contribution in cognitive psychology. Conversely, this thesis provides a direct critique of Bayesian cognitive frameworks, demonstrating some short-comings and adding to existing debates about the suitability of the analogy...|$|R

40|$|Attention and {{learning}} are cognitive control {{processes that are}} closely related. This thesis investigates this inter-relatedness by using computational models to describe the mechanisms that are shared between these processes. Computational models describe the transformation of stimuli to observable variables (behaviour) and contain the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that affect this transformation. Here, I captured these mechanisms with the reinforcement learning (RL) framework applied in two different task contexts and three different projects to show 1) how attentional selection of stimuli involves the learning of values for stimuli, 2) how the learning of stimulus values is influenced by previously learned rules, and 3) how explorations of value-related mechanisms in the brain benefit from using intracranial EEG to investigate the strength of oscillatory activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex. 	In the first project, the RL framework is applied to a feature-based attention task that required macaques to learn the value of stimulus features while ignoring non-relevant information. By comparing different RL schemes I found that trial-by-trial covert attentional selections were best predicted by a model that only represents expected values for the task relevant feature dimension. 	In the second project, I explore mechanisms of stimulus-feature value learning in humans {{in order to understand}} the influence of learned rules for the flexible, on-going learning of expected values. I test the hypothesis that naive subjects will show enhanced learning of feature specific reward associations by switching to the use of an abstract rule that associates stimuli by feature type. I found that two-thirds of subjects (n= 22 / 32) exhibited behaviour that was best fit by a ‘flexible-rule-selection’ model. 	Low-frequency oscillatory activity in frontal cortex has been associated with cognitive control and integrative brain functions, however, the relationship between expected values for stimuli and band-limited, rhythmic neural activity in the human brain is largely unknown.

The present article explores the motivational mechanisms underlying memory for pro-social intentions through the manipulation of the social relevance of goals and presence of material rewards during an activity-based PM task. Results revealed that memory for the intention was better under pro-social than under standard conditions. However, when a material reward was introduced under pro-social conditions, it had the detrimental effect of reducing prospective remembering. Ongoing task performance was faster under pro-social than under No PM and standard PM conditions and it was unrelated to PM performance. In addition, the outcome of the ratings of two independent groups of participants confirmed that people are not aware of the potential conflict between pro-social and self-gain motives. Taken together, these new findings extend current PM theories by suggesting a prominent role of <b>latent</b> motivational <b>mechanisms</b> in guiding memory for pro-social intention...|$|R

30|$|Possible {{explanations}} {{for the lack of}} consensus and difficulties in measuring CSR have been given in previous studies (Waddock and Graves 1997). One possibility is to attribute this inconsistency to the multidimensional CSR concept and its interrelationship across many disciplines; varying concepts and issues from strategic perspectives to human resource management, culture, and stakeholder/shareholder ones. Another research group suggested that these unidentified and omitted explanatory variables (McWilliams and Siegel 2000) made it difficult understand the <b>latent</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Meanwhile, several studies tested the existence of a relationship between a firm’s CSR performance and FP. However, these findings are rather inconclusive in answering the question as to whether a firm’s performance in terms of its corporate social responsibility can be translated into positive corporate financial performance (FP). While such a relation (Margolis et al. 2009) sounds appealing, this finding is still fragile, since a range of other studies have reported either negative (Mittal et al. 2008) or mixed results (Schreck 2011). Most of those studies relied heavily on the dataset provided by Kinder, Lydenberg and Domini (KLD). Due to this shortfall, Margolis et al. suggested the need to consider alternative measures of CSR performance. Furthermore, those studies based on the KLD dataset only test for a linear relationship between a firm’s CSR and its FP. However, recent developments in microeconomic theory suggested that a non-linear set-up should be considered (Manasakis et al. 2013, 2014; García-Gallego and Georgantzis 2009). A non-linear relationship between CSR and FP is therefore in line with economic intuition, but has rarely been tested, as pointed out in Barnett and Salomon (2012). For instance, those firms which voluntarily engage in more socially responsible activities incur higher corresponding costs at an earlier stage and, therefore, the increase in their CSR score has a negative relationship with their FP if the study is done only linearly. In this line of consideration, Nollet et al. (2016) tested both linear and non-linear relationships between CSR performance and FP. They also used an alternative third-party auditors’ data set, viz. Bloomberg’s ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) disclosure score, as a new proxy for CSR.|$|R

The patterns of association for the 4 psychosis dimensions were stable across neurocognitive domains and were independent of age, gender, and chronicity of illness. In addition, significantly higher correlations were found for the negative dimension in relation to verbal fluency (p =. 005) and for the disorganized dimension in relation to reasoning and problem solving (p =. 004) and to attention/vigilance (p =. 03). Psychotic psychopathology and neurocognition are not entirely orthogonal, as heterogeneity in nonaffective psychosis is weakly but meaningfully associated with measures of neurocognition. This association suggests that differential <b>latent</b> cerebral <b>mechanisms</b> underlie the cluster of disorganized and negative symptoms versus that of positive and affective symptoms. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} process and molecular functions {{involved in the}} cancer progression remain difficult to understand for biologists and clinical doctors. Recent developments in high-throughput technologies urge the systems biology to achieve more precise models for complex diseases. Computational and mathematical models are gradually being used {{to help us understand}} the omics data produced by high-throughput experimental techniques. The use of computational models in systems biology allows us to explore the pathogenesis of complex diseases, improve our understanding of the <b>latent</b> molecular <b>mechanisms,</b> and promote treatment strategy optimization and new drug discovery. Currently, it is urgent {{to bridge the gap between}} the developments of high-throughput technologies and systemic modeling of the {{biological process}} in cancer research. In this review, we firstly studied several typical mathematical modeling approaches of biological systems in different scales and deeply analyzed their characteristics, advantages, applications, and limitations. Next, three potential research directions in systems modeling were summarized.

40|$|Reducing design defects by {{proactive}} actions requires {{comprehensive understanding}} {{of how and why}} they happen. To achieve this, it is necessary to know the causal relationships of inherent factors, by which design defects arise. This paper represents a causal mechanism of defective design occurrence by considering interactions of underlying factors in designing process. The mechanism draws on the system approach to human errors to describe defects in design caused by designers' active failuresand failures of design reviews as defences to catch defects. It portrays the causal process of the failures with workplace factors and organizational factors as influencing factors. Workplace factors arise from designers' working conditions and include internal and external factors to the actors. Organizational factors comprise elements due to client and designer company's conditions. Then, two failure pathways are discussed to show how the factors lead to design defects. Two case studies are presented in this paper to clarify and explain the mechanism. Active Failures, Defective Design, Defences Failures, Human Error, <b>Latent</b> Factors, <b>Mechanism,</b> System Approach,...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the Sasang {{typology}} {{have focused on the}} differential diagnosis of each Sasang type with type-specific pathophysiological symptoms (TSPS). The {{purpose of this study was}} to elucidate the <b>latent</b> physiological <b>mechanism</b> related to these clinical indicators. We searched six electronic databases for articles published from 1990 to 2015 using the Sasang typology-related keywords, and found and analyzed 35 such articles. The results were summarized into six TSPS categories: perspiration, temperature preference, sleep, defecation, urination, and susceptibility to stress. The Tae-Eum and So-Eum types showed contrasting features with TSPS, and the So-Yang type was in the middle. The Tae-Eum type has good digestive function, regular bowel movement and defecation, high sleep quality, and low susceptibility to stress and cold. The Tae-Eum type has relatively large volumes of sweat and feels fresh after sweating; however, the urine is highly concentrated. These clinical features might be related to the biopsychological traits of the Tae-Eum type, including a low trait anxiety level and high ponderal and body mass indices. This study used the autonomic reactivity hypothesis for explaining the pathophysiological predispositions in the Sasang typology. The Tae-Eum and So-Eum Sasang types have a low threshold in parasympathetic and sympathetic activation, respectively. This study provides a foundation for integrating traditional Korean personalized medicine and Western biomedicine...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{femtosecond}} control {{experiments are}} expanding {{the possibilities for}} using laser pulses as photophysical and photochemical reagents. However, {{because of the large}} number of variables necessary to perform these experiments (usually 100 - 200), it has proven difficult to elucidate the underlying control mechanisms from the optimized pulse shapes. If adaptive control is to become a widespread tool for examining chemical dynamics, methods must be developed that reveal <b>latent</b> control <b>mechanisms.</b> This manuscript presents a generally applicable method for dimension reduction of adaptive control experiments based on partial least squares regression analysis (PLS) of the normalized covariance matrix of the total data set. When applied to experimental results obtained in our laboratory, it shows that only seven fundamental dimensions from an original 208 -dimension search space are needed to account for 90 % {{of the variance in the}} observed fitness of 11 700 laser-pulse shapes explored during the optimization experiment. Furthermore, the seven dimensions have a remarkable regularity in their functional form. It is anticipated that this work will facilitate theoretical treatments directly linking the optimal fields to control mechanisms, allow quantitative comparisons of independent control results, and suggest new experimental methods for rapid adaptive searches. The adaptive femtosecond control methodology first proposed by Rabitz 1 offers a powerful tool for chemical research b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Amyloids {{are highly}} {{organized}} protein filaments, rich in beta-sheet secondary structures that self-assemble to form dense plaques in brain tissues affected by severe neurodegenerative disorders (e. g. Alzheimer’s Disease). Identified as natural functional materials in bacteria, {{in addition to}} their remarkable mechanical properties, amyloids have also been proposed as a platform for novel biomaterials in nanotechnology applications including nanowires, liquid crystals, scaffolds and thin films. Despite recent progress in the understanding amyloid structure and behavior, the <b>latent</b> selfassembly <b>mechanism</b> and the underlying adhesion forces that drive the aggregation process remain poorly understood. On the basis of previous full atomistic simulations, here we report a simple coarse-grain model to analyze the competition between adhesive forces and elastic deformation of amyloid fibrils. We use simple model system to investigate self-assembly mechanisms of fibrils, focused on the formation of self-folded nanorackets and nanorings, and thereby address a critical issue in linking the biochemical (Angstrom) to micrometer scales relevant for larger-scale states of functional amyloid materials. We investigate the effect of varying the interfibril adhesion energy on the structure and stability of self-folded nanorackets and nanorings and demonstrate that such aggregated amyloid fibrils are stable in such states even when the fibril-fibril interaction is relativel...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{efficient}} and inexpensive energy storage devices {{is an important}} as developing new sources of energy. The material element was designed for storing high charging and low discharging efficiency. The size of the element was taken such that exposed contact surface area could be high. The thermal energy storage (TES) {{can be defined as}} the temporary storage of thermal energy at high or low temperatures [...] Energy storage can reduce the time or rate mismatch between energy supply and energy demand, and it {{plays an important role in}} energy conservation. Energy storage improves performance of energy systems by smoothing supply and increasing reliability. For example, storage would improve the performance of a power generating plant by load leveling. The higher efficiency would lead to energy conservation and improve cost effectiveness. The demand for energy, on the other hand, is also unsteady following yearly and diurnal cycles for both industrial and personal needs. The thermal properties are strongly influenced by the deposit physical structure, i. e. the particle size distribution, the porosity and the degree of sintering. Thermal storage can utilize sensible or <b>latent</b> heat <b>mechanisms</b> or heat from chemical reactions. Sensible heat is the means of storing energy by increasing the temperature of a solid or liquid. Latent heat, on the other hand, is the means of storing energy via the heat of transition from a solid to liquid state...|$|R
