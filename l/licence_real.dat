40|$|Exclusive rights {{granted by}} public authorities, like {{concessions}} to develop natural resources or electromagnetic spectrum licences, often have option-like features. However, to avoid licences being unused for lengthy periods, regulators sometimes set time limits, {{after which the}} exclusive right of exercise may be revoked. In this paper we analyse the impact of use or lose ("UOL") provisions upon the private time of investment. We find {{that the risk of}} losing the licence because of inaction generally increases the probability of early investment. However, when capital costs are expected to decline over time, UOL provisions may involve a "perverse effect", by increasing, rather than reducing, the expected time of investment, with respect to a situation where the date of investment is left entirely to the licencee’s discretion. <b>Licences,</b> <b>Real</b> Options, Use or Lose Provisions, Time of Investment...|$|R

50|$|The {{arrival of}} new {{immigrants}} from the former Soviet Union and from Ethiopia {{in recent years has}} increased the population of Kiryat Malakhi by 40 percent. Some 22,000 people now live in the city.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the new Property Occupations Act 2014 (POA) and relevant provisions of the Agents Financial Administration Act 2014 (AFAA) and the impacts for property practitioners. The Acts are due to commence later in 2014 once regulations and relevant forms are drafted. Coinciding with the commencement of the Acts further versions of the REIQ Houses and Land Contract and REIQ Community Title Contract will also be released. The POA introduces changes for <b>licencing</b> of <b>real</b> estate agents, property developers and resident letting agents as well as significant changes for the contract formation process. The AFAA includes the trust account and claim fund provisions of PAMDA, which avoids duplication of these provisions across each of the industry-specific Bills.

50|$|Although Bernaldo had {{dreamt of}} flying as a child, {{it was not}} until this second {{marriage}} that she began training under José Rodríguez y Díaz de Lecea in a de Havilland DH.60 Moth. Bernaldo received her <b>licence</b> from the <b>Real</b> Aeroclub de España at the Getafe aerodrome south of Madrid. She took part in various demonstrations and exhibitions in northern Spain, including those in Vitoria, San Sebastián, Oviedo, Gijón and Vigo. She also flew over the car of the Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia when he arrived in La Coruña in 1929, throwing flowers out as he passed below. The same year, as a result of public acclaim, she received the military aviation insignia from the Royal Aero Club, a rare distinction. A relationship developed with her instructor Díaz de Lecea, leading to a secret divorce with her husband in 1929, becoming one of the first women {{to take advantage of the}} Ley del Divorcio de la Segunda República (Divorce Law of the Second Republic).|$|R
