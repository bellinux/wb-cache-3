Data accident shows that each year died 6000 people in Europe as a consequence of a traffic accident. The lower extremities are represented by the <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> in the laboratory tests. The lower legform that is being used nowadays is the one of the TRL. The magnitudes that it measures and the biomechanics limits are:- Acceleration; with 150 g as a limit value. - Knee bending angle; angle between tibia and femur, with 15 º as a limit value. - Shear displacement; gap between tibia and femur, with +/- 6 mm as a limit value. The main target of this research project is to obtain a simplified model to analyse and to predict the behaviour of the front of the vehicle in the lower legform pedestrian protection.

The understanding of the influence and sensitivity between important variables describing a pedestrian crash is key {{for the development of}} more efficient and reliable safety systems. This paper reflects the related work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results summarized out of virtual and physical tests provide valuable information for further development. 1168 virtual and 120 physical tests were carried out with adult and child pedestrian headform as well as upper and <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> representatives of 4 different vehicle front geometries {{in a wide range of}} impact speeds, angles and locations. This test matrix was based on previous work carried out within the AsPeCSS project. The results obtained show several trends and influences of input variables (impact speed, angle, location, impactor masses, impactor type) on the particular outcomes. In general, impact speed was the most influential parameter. The increase of impact speed resulted in higher HIC, bending moment or force presumably generating a higher injury risk. The work carried out provided the results to enable further development of Injury Risk Curves regarding VRU protection for different body regions. This work provides insight into the variation of injury criteria when also considering different speed and angles which is especially useful for the evaluation of active safety systems (e. g.

40|$|Pedestrian {{protection}} {{is one of}} the key topics of discussion in the area of vehicle safety legislation in Europe and Japan. Leg injuries are the most common injuries found in nonfatal pedestrian accidents. The EC regulation and Euro NCAP are evaluating pedestrian leg protection performance in current vehicles. The TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> is specified by the EC regulation, where Phase 1 took effect during 2005 and a draft phase 2 is scheduled to take effect in 2013. The global technical regulation (GTR) pedestrian protection test protocol was made basically using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> However, a flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> has been under development. When the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> development is fully completed and evaluated, it is possible that both <b>legform</b> <b>impactors</b> may be determined to be useful in the GTR. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the characteristics of pedestrian leg protection performance of the frontal area of current vehicles using the TRL <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the flexible <b>legform</b> <b>impactor.</b> Different types of vehicles (sedan, sport utility vehicle (SUV), height wagon, and 1 box car) were used.

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCar-pedestrian {{collision}} fatalities {{have been}} reported for {{a significant number of}} roadside accidents around the world. Protection of pedestrians is taking on an increasingly significant role to car manufactures in developing new designs. The dynamic responses of the pedestrians in vehicle crashes can better be evaluated by examining the biomechanical responses. In order to reduce the lower extremity injuries in car-pedestrian collisions, it is important to determine the impact forces on the pedestrian and conditions that the car frontal side impacts on the lower extremities of the pedestrian. The Working Group 17 (WG 17) of the European Enhanced Vehiclesafety Committee (EEVC) has developed a <b>legform</b> subsystem <b>impactor</b> and procedure for assessing pedestrian collisions and potential injuries. This study describes a methodology for the evaluation of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> kinematics after a collision utilizing finite element (FE) models of the legform and cars, and comparing the simulation results with the ones from a multi-body legform model as well as a 50 th percentile male human pedestrian model responses. Two approaches are carried out in the process. First, the collision strike simulations with the FE model using an FE <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> is considered and validated against the EVVC/WG 17 regulation criteria. Secondly, the collision strike simulations with a multi-body legform and an ellipsoidal multi-body car model are conducted to compare the responses from the FE model and the multibody model. The results from the impact simulations of FE legform and the multi-body legform are also compared with the ones from a full-size pedestrian model at different speeds. All the FE models of the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the car model are developed and evaluated using the LSDYNA nonlinear FE code, while the multibody legform, car, and full-sized pedestrian models are developed and evaluated in MADYMO.

40|$|Vehicle-pedestrian {{collisions}} {{had claimed}} {{the lives of}} many in the world roads yearly. Among the types of injury that may occur in a vehicle-pedestrian collision, lower extremity injuries have the highest account. These alarming statistic has encouraged joining effort from researchers, car manufacturers and the government to find solutions in reducing the risk of vulnerable road users. The car bumper structure design plays a crucial role in cushioning the impact on the pedestrian leg during a collision. The European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) has developed test methods to evaluate severity of the lower leg injury, upper leg injury and head impact injury in a vehicle-pedestrian simulated collision. Since lower extremity injury are most common, undivided attention should be paid on the <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> to bumper test. The maximum bending angle, maximum shearing displacement and maximum tibia acceleration are among the three injury criterion determined for <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> to bumper test. Before the <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> to bumper test can be perform the <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> has to be certified statically and dynamically.

40|$|In {{the current}} test {{procedure}} {{proposed by the}} European Enhanced Vehicle-safety Committee (EEVC) /WG 17 for evaluating leg injuries to pedestrians, a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure is used. The risk of damages to knee ligaments is evaluated with the shearing displacement and the bending angle at the knee joint. A recent study has focused on evaluating biofidelity of the legform. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a local deformation at the knee joint from published experiments with Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHSs). In addition, past PMHS experiments have suggested that the height of a bumper significantly affects the risk of ligamentous damages. In this study, three kinds of finite element models were used in order to investigate the relationship between the bumper height and the shearing displacement / bending angle of the knee; 1) a <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> with a rigid bony structure, 2) a recently developed pedestrian dummy (Polar) with both a flexible tibia and a biofidelic knee joint structure, 3) a human lower limb. By utilizing the human model, a local deformation at the knee joint could be obtained. The model for the <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> and the pedestrian dummy have been validated against experiments with an actual car and in component level, respectively. The human lower limb model has been validated against published PMHS experiments. The result of a parameter study with these models in a range of bumper heights showed that the dynamic response of the dummy model is quite similar to that of the human model. In addition, it was found that the mass of the upper body significantly affects the bending angle of the knee. A geometric analysis of the knee joint was also performed to obtain tensile strains of four principal knee ligaments as a function of both the shearing displacement and the bending angle. The result suggested that the shearing displacement and the bending angle should be considered in combination when developing an injury criteria for knee ligaments...|$|R

Recent {{research suggests that the}} primary improvement to the current test device would be a flexible legform, or one that has more biofidelity (i. e., simulates actual human lower limb response).

Considering knee joint kinematics under lateral car-pedestrian impacts, a stiffness matrix was established including lateral bending, lateral shearing and torsion effects that significantly influence pedestrian lower limb injuries. Then, this stiffness matrix was applied in a developed legform model. The structural responses of the legform were obtained by the impact with a family car model.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} and improve {{the performance of a}} newly developed safety system intended to protect pedestrians during frontal car collisions. This system includes a remote sensor system, a contact sensor, a reversible bumper system (RBS), and a reversible hood (RH). The remote sensor system was evaluated for its ability to detect pedestrians at risk in a vehicular traffic environment. In this assessment, car-pedestrian accident scenarios were analyzed based on the cases selected from the Swedish TRaffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) database. The two most common scenarios were identified as cars entering and leaving intersections, and colliding with pedestrians crossing the road. The accident data for these two scenarios were then investigated in terms of specific factors, such as the trajectory and velocity of the pedestrians and cars involved. Based on the accident data, a mathematical model was presented, and the remote pedestrian sensor system was evaluated using this model. The contact sensor was analyzed for the temperature-independent measurement of pedestrian impacts. A baseline bumper finite element (FE) model was initially developed and validated using the European New Car Assessment Program (EuroNCAP) <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the production bumper. Based on the baseline bumper model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the acceptance requirements of the European Enhanced Vehicle–safety Committee Working Group 17 (EEVC WG 17) <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> impact tests. A lower limb FE model was then developed and used to evaluate further the protective performance of the baseline and improved bumper models. Finally, the contact sensor was incorporated into the improved bumper model, and a performance study was conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of temperature stability and mass sensitivity of the sensor output. The performance of the RBS was investigated for the protection of pedestrians’ lower limbs during bumper collisions. The detailed FE model of a production car front was developed and validated based on the EuroNCAP <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the production car front. Next, a model RBS was developed to replace the original bumper in the car front model. In order to investigate the performance of the RBS, the lower limb model and the EEVC WG 17 <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> model were used to collide with the RBS model of different design configurations under various impact conditions. Finally, the effects of the design parameters on the protective performance of the RBS were calculated using the statistical method for factorial experiment design. The RH was evaluated and optimized for the prevention of head injuries among adult pedestrians from hood collisions. The car front FE model was validated based on the EuroNCAP adult headform impact tests conducted on the car hood. The baseline RH was subsequently developed from the original hood of the validated car front model. The FE models of a 50 th percentile human head and the EEVC WG 17 adult headform were used in parallel to evaluate the protective performance of the baseline RH. In order to minimize the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform model, the response surface method was applied to optimize the RH in terms of material stiffness, lifting speed and lifted height. Finally, the headform and human head models were once again used to evaluate the protective performance of the optimized RH. The results of this study indicated that the remote sensor system can detect almost all visible pedestrians in the two most common scenarios in a timely manner when the detection angle is greater than 60 degrees. The contact sensor can also identify pedestrian impacts with the car bumper. Moreover, enhanced sensor output stability and mass sensitivity can be achieved by using a 25 mm rather than 50 mm sensor tube. The RBS performance can be improved by reducing bumper stiffness; however, such performance is impaired in the bumper-deploying process at speeds of 2. 5 m/s or greater. Less than 150 mm, the deployment distance of the RBS has no influence on the bumper protective performance. Compared with the retracted and lifting baseline RH, the lifted baseline RH can definitely minimize the injury parameters of the headform and human head models. When the optimized RH is lifted, the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) values of the headform and human head models are reduced to much lower than 1, 000. Thus, the risk of pedestrian head injuries can be prevented as required by EEVC WG 17...|$|R

Finally, the new contact sensor was built into the improved bumper model. A performance study was then conducted to evaluate the sensor effectiveness. Consequently, a better diameter for the sensor tube was identified in terms of the temperature stability and mass sensitivity of the sensor output...|$|R
40|$|The EEVC WG 17 {{upper leg}} test {{as used in}} Euro NCAP was reviewed. Previous work {{revealed}} shortcomings of the EEVC WG 17 test set-up. Recent published accident data show that injuries to the lower extremities by the bonnet leading edge, not including ground impacts, only accounted for 5 % of all AIS 2 + injuries and 4 % of all AIS 3 + injuries. Previous work and this data indicate a discrepancy in importance of the upper leg test between Euro NCAP and real-life injury frequencies. Suggested <b>legform</b> <b>impactor</b> threshold values have {{so far not been}} based on human injury risk transferred to impactor values. The implications of the proposed improvements to the test set-up from Snedeker et al. (2005) for Euro NCAP test results have not been assessed. Both the above issues are aimed at in this study. They are important as only with the right targets and evaluation methods, traffic related injuries can be minimized. Human injury threshold values for femur and pelvis impact were derived from applicable and original PMHS data. Data was scaled to a mid-sized male, survival analysis with Weibull fit was performed with exact femur 3 -point bending data, logistic regression with doubly censored pelvis impact data. Legform thresholds were derived using a linear regression between impactor and THUMS values derived form tests conducted by Snedeker et al. (2005). It is assumed that THUMS and upper leg surrogates have a similar response. The implications of the new set-up and thresholds for Euro NCAP test results were assessed for results published 2009 and 2010 using empirical relationships between impact energy, measured force and moment. Using this approach, the resulting thresholds to be used with the legform were determined to be 7. 9 - 9. 0 kN for the pelvis test and 300 - 365 Nm for the femur test. These values correspond to 5 and 20 % fracture risk, respectively. With the currently used set-up and limits, the average score for the upper leg test is 22 % of the maximum score. With the proposed method and limits, the average score calculated is 70 %. With only 30 % missing, the score matches better with the accident frequency of bonnet leading edge induced injuries to lower extremities...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{pedestrian}} casualties in vehicle traffic accidents, safety countermeasures, for example the active hood system and external airbag system, have been proposed to protect pedestrians in vehicle collisions. Such a protection system must consist of a sensing system to detect the pedestrian impact and/or the potential impact. It is a key issue to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} detection system. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the performance of a remote sensing system and a contact sensor for the detection of pedestrian impacts. In paper I, a remote sensing system was evaluated for the pedestrian detection in vehicle traffic environment. In this study, the car-pedestrian accident data were selected from the Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA), a database developed by collecting accident data from the police and hospitals. In this database, 9 scenarios of car-pedestrian accidents were defined according to pedestrian and car trajectories and accident locations. A total of 2, 199 car-pedestrian impacts with identified accident scenarios were selected from the database and further analyzed in this study. Based upon the analysis, the two most common scenarios–accounting for 46. 8 percent of all the cases–were identified as cars entering and leaving intersections colliding with pedestrians crossing the road. Based on this understanding, the knowledge of these two scenarios was developed in terms of the trajectories and speeds of pedestrians and cars: the qualitative pedestrian and car trajectories were described by the definition of the accident scenarios, while the quantitative speeds of pedestrians and cars were estimated based on pedestrian ages and road speed limits. By using both the qualitative and quantitative data, a mathematical model was presented with the hypothesis that all the pedestrians in both scenarios were not obstructed. The effectiveness of the sensing system for the detection of potential pedestrian collisions was then evaluated by using this model. In paper II, a new pedestrian air-tube contact sensor in the car bumper was developed at Autoliv Research due to that a traditional contact sensor can be unstable at varying temperatures. This paper aimed to evaluate the new contact sensor for the temperature-independent measurement of pedestrian impacts. First, the baseline FE bumper model of a production car was developed and validated according to the EuroNCAP <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> impact tests performed on the car bumper. The results of the validation analysis were comparable with the test results, but they have exceeded the limits of the EEVC WG 17 <b>lower</b> <b>legform</b> impact tests. The baseline bumper model was therefore considered as valid, but it required an enhanced safety performance. Based on the baseline model, an improved bumper model was subsequently developed to meet the EEVC requirements. Following the EEVC test methods, the legform impact simulations were conducted in the middle and on the left and right sides of the improved bumper model, resulting in the maximum legform responses of tibia accelerations from 117 to 139 g and knee bending angle from 7. 7 to 9. 3 degree, thereby meeting the EEVC requirements. Second, a FE human lower extremity model was developed; the baseline and improved bumper models were further evaluated using this human model. The improved model was shown to protect the human knee joint effectively, but the risks of tibia and fibula fractures were increased. Finally, the contact sensor was built into the improved bumper model and an analysis was conducted to evaluate the sensor performance. From paper I, it was concluded that the sensing system can detect almost all the pedestrians in the two scenarios, if the detective angle of the system is greater than 60 degrees. From paper II, it was determined that using a 25 -mm instead of 50 -mm air-tube sensor resulted in more stable sensor output at varying temperatures in the EEVC WG 17 legform impacts; moreover the sensor was more sensitive to the different masses of the impact objects. The 25 -mm air-tube sensor was thus a better choice for the contact sensor design...|$|R
