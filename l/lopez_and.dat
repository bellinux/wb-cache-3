As she enters, she takes off a wig and changes her clothing. She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. These scenes are intercut with scenes of <b>Lopez</b> <b>and</b> her lover laying in a grass.

5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno grouped Furgaleus with Hemitriakis, Iago, and Gogolia as {{the tribe}} Iagini within the {{subfamily}} Galeorhininae {{of the family}} Triakidae. A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés <b>López</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, affirmed that Furgaleus and Hemitriakis are sister taxa; the study was equivocal regarding the position of Iago and did not include Gogolia.|$|E
5|$|Deal was {{satisfied}} with the material recorded up to this point, but realized {{she would not be}} able to tour without a band. She returned to New York to look for a backing group in March 2000. After a chance meeting with members of Fear, she invited drummer Andrew Jaimez, bassist Mando <b>Lopez,</b> <b>and</b> guitarist Richard Presley to jam with her at the studio she was renting. Deal wanted to continue playing with these musicians, and so within three months she moved to Fear's hometown Los Angeles. Jaimez, <b>Lopez,</b> <b>and</b> Presley joined the Breeders, and Kelley Deal rejoined the group soon after. About a month after Kim Deal's arrival, Jose Medeles replaced Jaimez, who decided he did not have enough time for the Breeders because of his involvement in other musical projects. The new line-up spent the rest of the year writing and rehearsing.|$|E

5|$|The Gloucester was {{the first}} ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, {{under the command of}} Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, {{departed}} from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the Spanish flag from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez <b>López</b> <b>and</b> his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez <b>López</b> <b>and</b> three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.|$|E

5|$|In 1819 Buenos Aires was at {{war with}} José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao <b>López,</b> <b>and</b> {{requested}} San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies {{to take part in}} the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao <b>López</b> <b>and</b> Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano's health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the litoral or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, just one year old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew's fiddle, but Belgrano's doctor Josef Redhead objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took control of the government of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{joined by}} her sister Kelley, Deal began {{recording}} sessions with engineer Steve Albini in Chicago. Fear members Mando <b>Lopez</b> <b>and</b> Richard Presley, and musician Jose Medeles, joined the line-up. The group continued recording with Albini in 2001.

5|$|In the North Atlantic, feeding areas {{range from}} Scandinavia to New England. Breeding {{occurs in the}} Caribbean and Cape Verde. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, {{southern}} and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whale visits into Gulf of Mexico have been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically. In the South Atlantic, about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea. Comparison of songs between those at Cape <b>Lopez</b> <b>and</b> Abrolhos Archipelago indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} reassigned the sharptooth houndshark to the genus Triakis, more {{specifically}} to the subgenus Cazon alongside the sharpfin houndshark (T. acutipinna) and the spotted houndshark (T. maculata). A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés <b>López</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, based on four protein-coding gene sequences, found that this species did not group with the leopard shark (T. semifasciata). Instead, it and the flapnose houndshark (Scylliogaleus quecketti) formed a clade within the Mustelus lineage. This result suggests that the two subgenera of Triakis—Cazon and Triakis—may not be closely related, which would warrant a redefinition of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{took the}} gold to {{authorities}} who confirmed its worth. <b>Lopez</b> <b>and</b> others began {{to search for}} other steambeds with gold deposits in the area. They found several in the northeastern section of the forest, within present-day Ventura County. In 1843 he found gold in San Feliciano Canyon near his first discovery. Mexican miners from Sonora worked the placer deposits until 1846, when the Californios began to agitate for independence from Mexico, and the Bear Flag Revolt caused many Mexicans to leave California.|$|E

5|$|The genus Triakis {{contains}} two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. The leopard shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis {{along with the}} banded houndshark (T. (Triakis) scyllium). A 2006 phylogenetic analysis by J. Andrés <b>López</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, based on protein-coding genes, revealed that Triakis and Cazon are in fact not closely related, and additionally that the leopard shark {{may be the most}} basal member of its family.|$|E
