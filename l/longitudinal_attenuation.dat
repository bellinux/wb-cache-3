40|$|The {{advancement}} of additive manufacturing methods {{for the production}} of metallic parts has initiated the potential development of materials with tailored microstructures to enhance their material properties. To help facilitate the development, methods based on ultrasonic grain scattering are proposed to provide in-situ monitoring of the microstructure’s evolution during the build process. In this work, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient is considered, theoretically and experimentally, as a function of temperature during an annealing process of steel. Theoretically, an iterative solution to the attenuation model of Stanke and Kino is given. The theory is compared against experimental measurements of the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient for a steel sample taken at various stages of annealing. Laser ultrasound was employed because it is a remote technique that minimizes unwanted temperature related effects. The annealing process brought the sample from room temperature to 950 o C. A phase transformation from ferrite to austenite occurred at 800 o C, which caused a significant drop in the measured attenuation coefficient. The theoretical attenuation model borrowed previously measured temperature-dependent single-crystal elastic constants of pure iron as model inputs. A mixing formula that considers the volume fraction of ferrite to austenite was applied near the 800 o C mark where the drop in attenuation appeared. Remarkably, the theoretical attenuation model almost exactly reproduced the experimental data points. This concurrence supports: (1) the employment of laser ultrasound for measurement of the attenuation during heating of materials, (2) the suitability of theoretical ultrasonic grain scattering models during highly transient temperature behavior, and (3) the ability of the theoretical attenuation model to represent the effect of a phase transformation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In guided urban {{automated}} transportation systems, {{the maintenance}} of a high-quality broadband train-to-wayside communication at all locations along the track poses a major problem. Several techniques are currently used. However, to achieve sufficient rates, a communication frequency range of 2 – 6 GHz is widely in use. At these frequencies, the natural propagation in tunnels usually works efficiently, but the communication through a leaky waveguide that is continuously laid along the track has several advantages. Over the required communication ranges of several hundred meters, between stations, such waveguides provide low <b>longitudinal</b> <b>attenuation</b> and remain of reasonable size. They also provide predictable communication ranges that could offer significant advantages over the natural propagation approach.

40|$|Diffuse {{ultrasonic}} backscatter measurements {{have been}} especially useful for extracting microstructural information and for improving flaw detection in materials. In this dissertation, this approach is applied to inspection of railroad wheels. To improve the wear resistance, the tread surfaces of railroad wheels are usually quenched with water to increase the hardness. The pearlite phase of iron, characterized by alternating ferrite and cementite phases, is created by the quenching and the lamellar spacing within grains increases progressively from the quenched tread surface to deeper locations due to the non-uniform cooling rate. The quench depth is an important parameter governing the wheel performance. ^ In this dissertation, several aspects of ultrasonic methods are studied. A new singly-scattered response (SSR) model that includes lamellar duplex microstructure within grains is developed to investigate the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on such a microstructure in pearlitic wheel steel. An ultrasonic attenuation model is developed to study the influence of pearlite phase on ultrasonic attenuation. The experimental results show that both ultrasonic scattering amplitudes and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>attenuation</b> drop dramatically near the tread surface of a quenched wheel due {{to the presence of}} pearlite. The quench depth is measured by fitting the variance curve from the tread surface with the SSR model that includes the graded lamellar spacing on the propagation path. A mode-converted (longitudinal-to-transverse, or L-T) SSR model that includes duplex microstructure within grains is also developed to examine the preferred orientation of microstructure in a quenched sample. Finally, the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on stress is verified by observing the decrease of backscatter amplitudes measured from a 1018 steel block under a uniaxial load. The experimental results show a trend that is similar to the theoretical prediction. The residual stress in a quenched steel sample is estimated by quantifying the change of backscatter amplitudes with and without residual stress. ^ Diffuse ultrasonic backscatter techniques exhibit strong sensitivity to duplex microstructure, texture and stress, outcomes that can be applicable for quality control including microstructure evaluation, measurement of quench depth and residual stress. ...|$|E

40|$|Ultrasonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation (NDE) and inspection of cast {{austenitic stainless steel}} (CASS) components used in the nuclear power industry is neither as effective nor reliable as is needed due to detrimental effects upon the interrogating ultrasonic beam and interference from ultrasonic backscatter. The root cause is the coarse-grain microstructure inherent to this class of materials. Some ultrasonic techniques perform better for particular microstructural classifications and {{this has led to}} the hypothesis that an ultrasonic inspection can be optimized for a particular microstructural class, if a technique exists to reliably classify the microstructure for feedback to the inspection. This document summarizes scoping experiments of in-situ ultrasonic methods for classification and/or characterization of the material microstructures in CASS components from the outside surface of a pipe. The focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate ultrasonic methods and provide an interim report that documents results and technical progress. An initial set of experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that in-service characterization of cast austenitic stainless steel (CASS) is feasible, and that, if reliably performed, such data would provide real-time feedback to optimize in-service inspections in the field. With this objective in mind, measurements for the experiment were restricted to techniques that should be robust if carried forward to eventual field implementation. Two parameters were investigated for their ability to discriminate between different microstructures in CASS components. The first parameter was a time-of-flight ratio of a normal incidence shear wave to that of a normal incidence longitudinal wave (TOFRSL). The ratio removed dependency on component thickness which may not be accurately reported in the field.
