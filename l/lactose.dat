5|$|<b>Lactose</b> is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of <b>lactose</b> is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and they are unable to digest <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oral {{administration}} of enzymes {{can be used}} to treat some functional enzyme deficiencies, such as pancreatic insufficiency and <b>lactose</b> intolerance.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{galactose}} {{does not}} occur {{in the free state}} but is a constituent with glucose of the disaccharide <b>lactose</b> or milk sugar. It is less sweet than glucose. It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lactose,</b> maltose, and sucrose are all {{compound}} sugars, disaccharides, {{with the}} general formula C12H22O11. They are formed by the combination of two monosaccharide molecules with the exclusion of a molecule of water.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, {{but there are a}} few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but <b>lactose</b> content does not.|$|E
5|$|The hide of the {{blackbuck}} (krishnajina in Hindi) {{is deemed}} to be sacred in Hinduism. According to the scriptures, {{it is to be}} sat upon only by brahmins (priests), sadhus and yogis (sages), forest-dwellers and bhikshus (mendicants). Blackbuck meat is highly regarded in Texas. In an analysis, blackbuck milk was found to have 6.9% protein, 9.3% fat, and 4.3% <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam regular {{release and}} orally {{disintegrating}} tablets are available as 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, and 2mg tablets, while extended release tablets are available as 0.5mg, 1mg, 2mg, and 3mg. Alprazolam oral solutions are available as 0.5mg/5 mL and as 1mg/1 mL oral solutions. Inactive ingredients in alprazolam tablets and solutions include microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, docusate sodium, povidone, sodium starch glycollate, <b>lactose</b> monohydrate, magnesium stearate, colloidal silicon dioxide, and sodium benzoate. In addition, the 0.25mg tablet contains D Yellow No. 10 and the 0.5mg tablet contains FD Yellow No. 6 and D Yellow No. 10.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% <b>lactose</b> and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{food items}} {{commonly}} consumed by humans are toxic to hamsters {{and should be}} avoided completely in captivity. After they are completely weaned at around 21 days of age, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are <b>lactose</b> intolerant and cannot digest milk. Onions and garlic are very dangerous and can cause severe haemolytic anemia. Leafy green vegetables such as cabbage and celery contain {{a large amount of}} water, so can have severe laxative effects on small animals. Grapes and raisins may contribute to acute renal failure, due to their high level of acidity. Chocolate and other sticky foods such peanut butter may solidify in a hamster's cheek pouches and lead to infections, which can lead to death.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Kroger tells Monk he {{has found}} a therapist, Dr. Jonah Sorenson (Rick Curry); in session, he remembers where the rock came from. Monk goes to Dr. Kroger's office and shows Dr. Kroger the rock came from the courtyard, to which only Dr. Kroger and Merrigan have access to. In Merrigan's office, they find {{powdered}} milk but not a coffeemaker and, as powdered milk is made from <b>lactose</b> and drug dealers use it to cut heroin, Monk deduces Merrigan is trafficking drugs, and he probably also killed Teresa. Suddenly, Merrigan appears, ties them to chairs, and loads them {{into the back of}} his truck.|$|E
5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of <b>lactose</b> metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of non-infectious causes of {{inflammation}} of the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the more common include medications (like NSAIDs), certain foods such as <b>lactose</b> (in those who are intolerant), and gluten (in those with celiac disease). Crohn's disease is also a non-infectious source of (often severe) gastroenteritis. Disease secondary to toxins may also occur. Some food-related conditions associated with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea include: ciguatera poisoning due to consumption of contaminated predatory fish, scombroid associated with the consumption of certain types of spoiled fish, tetrodotoxin poisoning from the consumption of puffer fish among others, and botulism typically due to improperly preserved food.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the walrus, which has five- to six-year-long inter-birth intervals, female pinnipeds enter estrous shortly after they give birth. All species go through delayed implantation, wherein the embryo remains in suspended development for weeks or months before it is implanted in the uterus. Delayed implantation postpones the birth of young until the female hauls-out on land or until conditions for birthing are favorable. Gestation in seals (including delayed implantation) typically lasts a year. For most species, birthing takes place {{in the spring and summer}} months. Typically, single pups are born; twins are uncommon and have high mortality rates. Pups of most species are born precocial. Unlike terrestrial mammals, pinniped milk has little to no <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are <b>lactose</b> intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed <b>lactose</b> tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{contains}} {{several different}} carbohydrate including <b>lactose,</b> glucose, galactose, and other oligosaccharides. The <b>lactose</b> gives milk its sweet taste and contributes approximately 40% of whole cow's milk's calories. <b>Lactose</b> is a disaccharide composite of two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Bovine milk averages 4.8% anhydrous <b>lactose,</b> which amounts to about 50% {{of the total}} solids of skimmed milk. Levels of <b>lactose</b> are dependent upon the type of milk as other carbohydrates can be present at higher concentrations that <b>lactose</b> in milks.|$|E
25|$|This {{test can}} be used to {{diagnose}} <b>lactose</b> intolerance in infants, for whom other forms of testing are risky or impractical. The infant is given <b>lactose</b> to drink. If the individual is tolerant, the <b>lactose</b> is digested and absorbed in the small intestine; otherwise, it is not digested and absorbed, and it reaches the colon. The bacteria in the colon, mixed with the <b>lactose,</b> cause acidity in stools. Stools passed after the ingestion of the <b>lactose</b> are tested for level of acidity. If the stools are acidic, the infant is intolerant to <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactose</b> {{intolerance}} {{does not}} cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. There are four types: primary, secondary, developmental, and congenital. Primary <b>lactose</b> intolerance is when the amount of lactase decline as people age. Secondary <b>lactose</b> intolerance is due to injury to the small intestine such as from infection, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or other diseases. Developmental <b>lactose</b> intolerance may occur in premature babies and usually improves over {{a short period of}} time. Congenital <b>lactose</b> intolerance is an extremely rare genetic disorder in which little or no lactase is made from birth. When <b>lactose</b> intolerance is due to secondary lactase deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease allows lactase activity to return to normal levels. <b>Lactose</b> intolerance is different from a milk allergy.|$|E
25|$|Chromatography {{can be used}} to {{separate}} and identify undigested sugars present in faeces. Although <b>lactose</b> may be detected in the faeces of people with <b>lactose</b> intolerance, this test is not considered reliable enough to conclusively diagnose or exclude <b>lactose</b> intolerance.|$|E
25|$|When <b>lactose</b> {{intolerance}} is due {{to secondary}} lactase deficiency, treatment of the underlying disease may allow lactase activity to return to normal levels. In people with coeliac disease, <b>lactose</b> intolerance normally reverts or improves several months after starting a gluten-free diet, but temporary dietary restriction of <b>lactose</b> may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Butter – {{the process}} of making butter largely removes <b>lactose,</b> but it is still present in small quantities; {{clarified}} butter contains a negligible amount of <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates are an {{important}} source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow's milk-based formulas, <b>lactose</b> is the main source of carbohydrates present, but <b>lactose</b> is not present in cow's milk-based lactose-free formulas nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with milk protein sensitivity. <b>Lactose</b> is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without <b>lactose</b> will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and glucose, dextrins, and natural and modified starches. <b>Lactose</b> is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{where an}} {{estimated}} 4.7% {{of the population}} are affected by <b>lactose</b> intolerance, Lactofree produces milk, cheese, and yogurt products that contain only 0.03% <b>lactose.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 30 to 50 million Americans have some degree of <b>lactose</b> intolerance. Certain populations are more affected than others, including 75% of African American, Jewish, Mexican and Native American, and 90% of Asian populations. Thus, having probiotic bacteria such as GLB44 without any <b>lactose</b> {{is especially important for}} the <b>lactose</b> sensitive population.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of dairy foods containing <b>lactose</b> can promote a colonic bacteria adaptation, enhancing a favorable microbiome, which allows people with primary lactase deficiency to diminish their intolerance and to consume more dairy foods. The way to induce tolerance {{is based on}} progressive exposure, consuming smaller amounts frequently, distributed throughout the day. <b>Lactose</b> intolerance can also be managed by ingesting live yogurt cultures containing lactobacilli {{that are able to}} digest the <b>lactose</b> in other dairy products. This may explain why many South Asians, though genetically <b>lactose</b> intolerant, are able to consume large quantities of milk without many symptoms of <b>lactose</b> intolerance, since consuming live yogurt cultures is very common among the South Asian population.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} {{of people who have}} <b>lactose</b> intolerance, {{intestinal}} bacteria feeding on <b>lactose</b> can give rise to excessive gas production when milk or lactose-containing substances have been consumed.|$|E
25|$|A {{deficiency}} in digestive enzymes {{can also cause}} some types of food intolerances. <b>Lactose</b> intolerance {{is a result of}} the body not producing sufficient lactase to digest the <b>lactose</b> in milk; dairy foods which are lower in <b>lactose,</b> such as cheese, are less likely to trigger a reaction in this case. Another carbohydrate intolerance caused by enzyme deficiency is hereditary fructose intolerance.|$|E
25|$|In a {{hydrogen}} breath test, {{the most accurate}} <b>lactose</b> intolerance test, after an overnight fast, 25 grams of <b>lactose</b> (in a solution with water) are swallowed. If the <b>lactose</b> cannot be digested, enteric bacteria metabolize it and produce hydrogen, which, along with methane, if produced, can be detected on the patient's breath by a clinical gas chromatograph or compact solid-state detector. The test takes about 2.5 hours to complete. If the hydrogen levels in the patient's breath are high, they may have <b>lactose</b> intolerance. This test is not usually done on babies and very young children, because it can cause severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|The primary way of {{managing}} the symptoms of <b>lactose</b> intolerance is to limit the intake of <b>lactose</b> to a level that can be tolerated. Lactase deficient individuals vary {{in the amount of}} <b>lactose</b> they can tolerate, and some report that their tolerance varies over time, depending on health status and pregnancy. However, as a rule of thumb, people with primary lactase deficiency and no small intestine injury are usually able to consume at least 12 grams of <b>lactose</b> per sitting without symptoms, or with only mild symptoms, with greater amounts tolerated if consumed with a meal or throughout the day.|$|E
25|$|MacConkey agar is a {{selective}} and differential medium used {{to differentiate between}} Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. The addition of bile salts and crystal violet to the agar inhibits the growth of most Gram-positive bacteria, making MacConkey agar selective. <b>Lactose</b> and neutral red are added to differentiate the <b>lactose</b> fermenters, which form pink colonies, from <b>lactose</b> nonfermenters that form clear colonies. An alternative medium, eosin methylene blue serves a similar purpose.|$|E
25|$|Lactose-free {{milk can}} be {{produced}} by passing milk over lactase enzyme bound to an inert carrier. Once the molecule is cleaved, there are no <b>lactose</b> ill effects. Forms are available with reduced amounts of <b>lactose</b> (typically 30% of normal), and alternatively with nearly 0%. The only noticeable difference from regular milk is a slightly sweeter taste due to the generation of glucose by <b>lactose</b> cleavage. It does not, however, contain more glucose, and is nutritionally identical to regular milk.|$|E
25|$|Diarrhea: The {{prevalence}} of CF in Europe might {{be connected with}} the development of cattle domestication. In this hypothesis, carriers of a single mutant CFTR had some protection from diarrhea caused by <b>lactose</b> intolerance, prior to the appearance of the mutations that created <b>lactose</b> tolerance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lactose</b> {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, caseinate, whey, lactoserum, milk solids, modified milk ingredients, etc. As such <b>lactose</b> is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers in the milk stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain <b>lactose.</b> <b>Lactose</b> is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though product labeling seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of <b>lactose</b> in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E
25|$|Cheese – {{fermentation}} also {{reduces the}} <b>lactose</b> content of cheeses and aging reduces it further; traditionally made hard cheeses might contain 10% of the <b>lactose</b> {{found in an}} equivalent volume of milk. However, manufactured cheeses may be produced using processes {{that do not have}} the same lactose-reducing properties.|$|E
25|$|Stool pH in <b>lactose</b> {{intolerance}} is {{less than}} 5.5.|$|E
25|$|Lactase {{supplements}} {{are sometimes}} {{used to treat}} <b>lactose</b> intolerance.|$|E
