5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone’s long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day. The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young, and in the same age group as many of our readers, makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens.</b> –THE EDITORS ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 5 June 2006 {{article on}} the alleged killings of Iraqi civilians by U. S. Marines in Haditha, Hitchens argued that {{whether or not a}} {{massacre}} had taken place, comparisons with the My Lai massacre in Vietnam were [...] "so much propaganda and hot air" [...] that ignored substantial changes in the rules of engagement and US Army procedures and training designed to prevent and discourage such an event. He argued that lesson had been learned such that [...] "as a consequence, a training film about My Lai – [...] "if anything <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> you have really, truly screwed up" [...] – has been in use for U. S. soldiers for some time".|$|E

6000|$|BARTHWICK. [Walking to the window.] I've {{never been}} frightened in my life. You heard what Roper said. It's enough to upset one when a thing <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens.</b> Everything one says and does seems {{to turn in}} one's mouth--it's--it's uncanny. It's {{not the sort of}} thing I've been {{accustomed}} to. [As though stifling, he throws the window open. The faint sobbing of a child comes in.] What's that? ...|$|E

5000|$|... “I {{know it is}} hard to understand, but {{sometimes}} painful things <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happen.</b> It’s all {{part of the process of}} exploration and discovery. It’s all part of taking a chance and expanding man’s horizons. The future doesn’t belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we’ll continue to follow them.” ...|$|R
60|$|We {{have been}} accustoming {{ourselves}} {{to put our}} trust in material, technical skill, invention, and scientific contrivances {{to such an extent}} that we have come at last to believe that with these things we can overcome the immortal gods themselves.

5000|$|There's {{been a lot}} of {{talk about}} that, but if there are radical {{feelings}} in people anything can wake them - a painting, a picture, whatever. It's just a coincidence that it happened to be our music. It's important to think about what caused them to make their decisions, how they became animals, not their taste in music. Whenever something <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> it's like [...] "Okay, let's blame the artist". Such bullshit.|$|E

50|$|Omkar started {{collecting}} medicine after realising {{the acute}} medicine shortage, when he witnessed the Delhi Metro under-construction bridge collapsed in East Delhi in 2008, claiming {{the lives of}} two labourers and injuring many others.
