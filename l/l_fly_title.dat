40|$|We have {{established}} a Drosophila model of Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker (GSS) syndrome by expressing mouse prion protein (PrP) having leucine substitution at residue 101 (MoPrPP 101 <b>L).</b> <b>Flies</b> expressing MoPrPP 101 L, but not wild-type MoPrP (MoPrP 3 F 4), showed severe defects in climbing ability and early death. Expressed MoPrPP 101 L in Drosophila was differentially glycosylated, localized at the synaptic terminals and mainly present as deposits in adult brains. We found that behavioral defects and early death of MoPrPP 101 <b>L</b> <b>flies</b> were not due to Caspase 3 -dependent programmed cell death signaling. In addition, we found that Type 1 glutamatergic synaptic boutons in larval neuromuscular junctions of MoPrPP 101 <b>L</b> <b>flies</b> showed significantly increased numbers of satellite synaptic boutons. Furthermore, the amount of Bruchpilot and Discs large in MoPrPP 101 <b>L</b> <b>flies</b> was significantly reduced. Brains from scrapie-infected mice showed significantly decreased ELKS, an active zone matrix marker {{compared with those of}} age-matched control mice. Thus, altered active zone structures at the molecular level may be involved in the pathogenesis of GSS syndrome in Drosophila and scrapie-infected mice...|$|R

In 1985, honey bees alone were significantly better pollinators than flies alone, but in 1988, a combination of honey bees and flies produced more carrot seed per cage than did honey bees or flies alone. Seed obtained by using the two pollinators did not differ significantly in 100 seed weight or germination percentage. Considerable time savings resulted from using insect pollinators rather than hand pollination. In the future, the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station will use a combination of honey bees and flies to pollinate carrots for germplasm seed increase...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila cryptochrome (CRY) {{is a key}} {{circadian}} photoreceptor that {{interacts with}} the period and timeless proteins (PER and TIM) in a light-dependent manner. We show here that a heat pulse also mediates this interaction, and heatinduced phase shifts are severely reduced in the cryptochrome loss-of-function mutant cry b. The period mutant per L manifests a comparable CRY dependence and dramatically enhanced temperature sensitivity of biochemical interactions and behavioral phase shifting. Remarkably, CRY is also critical {{for most of the}} abnormal temperature compensation of per <b>L</b> <b>flies,</b> because a per L; cry b strain manifests nearly normal temperature compensation. Finally, light and temperature act together to affect rhythms in wild-type flies. The results indicate a role for CRY in circadian temperature as well as light regulation and suggest that these two features of the external 24 -h cycle normally act together to dictate circadian phase...|$|R
40|$|This key {{provides}} morphological {{features to}} distinguish {{most of the}} species of chalcid parasitic wasps (Chalcidoidea) that have been reared as parasitoids of filth flies (Diptera: Muscidae) in America north of Mexico or that have been introduced and definitely or possibly established in North America. The 32 keyed species, listed below, have either been recorded in the literature as reared from Haematobia irritans (<b>L.)</b> (horn <b>fly),</b> Musca domestica <b>L.</b> (house <b>fly),</b> M. autumnalis DeGeer (face fly) or Stomoxys calcitrans (<b>L.)</b> (stable <b>fly)</b> (Gibson et al. 2000), or include specimens in the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes (CNC) or the United States National Museum (USNM) that are labelled as reared from one of these four fly species. The key differentiates species of Urolepis and Trichomalopsis based on the revisions of Gibson (2000) and Gibson and Floate (2001), respectively. Species of Muscidifurax are differentiated primarily by biological features {{and because of this}} are not completely distinguished by morphological features in the key. Individuals who use the key to identify chalcid parasitoids of filth flies from areas other than North America should be wary because the key does not include all world species and the characters used may not adequately encompass extralimital variation. Users of the key should also be aware that taxonomic problems remain in Spalangia. I have seen specimens of Spalangia from North America that represent undescribed species or that are described but are not yet recorded from the region...|$|R
