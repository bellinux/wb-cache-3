40|$|Vertically Integrated Moisture Flux Convergence (VIMFC) {{alone and}} in {{combination}} with the lifted stability index of the most unstable layer (SMUL) is evaluated as a thunderstorm predictor. By using six-hourly standard pressure weather analysis data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) during 30 days in the summers of 1992 and 1994 containing several severe weather events along with quiescent events in northwestern Europe 17, 206 events are obtained. The location and time of a lightning discharge are obtained from the Arrival Time Difference (ATD) sferics lightning location system from the UK Meteorological Office. Using the Heidke Skill Score (HEIDKE) to determine the best threshold we conclude that VIMFC alone, does not perform well as a dichotomous thunderstorm predictor compared to the stability index. However, the Thundery Case Probability (TCP) tested as function of VIMFC results in a high correlation with thunderstorms. By combining SMUL and VIMFC the surplus value as a thunderstorm predictor of VIMFC was established. TCP percentages up to 95 % were found in an unstable environment with high positive values of VIMFC. In a marginally unstable environment with a high positive VIMFC the thunderstorm probability is higher than in a very unstable environment with no or negative VIMFC. These results are illustrated with a study of the case of the disastrous flash flood at Vaison-La-Romaine (southeastern France) on September 22, 1992.

Setting: Center for Spinal Disorders and Injuries, Bibai Rosai Hospital, Japan. Methods: A 68 -year-old man with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) had sustained tetraplegia after tumbling over a stone. Initially, the patient was diagnosed with an acute C 4 – 5 spinal cord injury without radiological abnormalities and was treated conservatively. At 7 h after the injury, the patient had an ascending neurological deficit, which required respiratory assistance. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a marked swelling of the spinal cord above C 4 – 5 extending to the medulla oblongata. Results: Retrospective radiological assessment revealed that the spine was unstable at the injury level because of discontinuities in both anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. There was also signal intensity change within the retropharyngeal space at the C 4 – 5 intervertebral disc. This injured segment was highly vulnerable to post-injury dynamic stenosis and easily sustained secondary neural damage.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the initial state of sands on the potential for undrained instability. The main goal is to illustrate how advanced constitutive modeling of sand behavior can be used to evaluate the susceptibility for static liquefaction. The methodology is based on the concept of <b>latent</b> <b>instability,</b> in which the potential for collapse is contingent on particular boundary conditions. A generalized effective stress soil model, MIT-S 1, is used to support the analysis and is combined with a theoretical approach for identifying loss of control owing to undrained shear perturbations. The theory is evaluated using experimental evidence available for Toyoura sand to point out the key role of void ratio and consolidation history and to provide experimental validation for the theory. Model predictions are then used to disclose the subtle role of drained preloading paths in promoting liquefaction instabilities. The ability of the constitutive model to reproduce the interplay between undrained kinematic constraints and material failure is fundamental in predicting potential instabilities arising from changes in drainage conditions. The examples shed light on the mechanics of static liquefaction and set a framework for applying the principles of material stability to the triggering analysis of flow slides induced by undrained shear perturbations...|$|E
40|$|In {{many respects}} Vladimir Nabokov's 1962 novel Pale Fire and Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, first {{published}} in 2000, are strikingly similar texts.

Nabokov's novel is fundamentally author-directed, while Danielewski's novel is expressly reader-oriented.

40|$|Steel slag {{has been}} used as {{supplementary}} cementitious materials or aggregates in concrete. However, the substitution levels of steel slag for Portland cement or natural aggregates were limited due to its low hydraulic property or <b>latent</b> volume <b>instability.</b> In this study, 60 % of steel slag powders containing high free-CaO content, 20 % of Portland cement and up to 20 % of reactive magnesia and lime were mixed to prepare the binding blends. The binding blends were then used to cast concrete, in which up to 100 % of natural aggregates (limestone and river sands) were replaced with steel slag aggregates. The concrete was exposed to carbonation curing with a concentration of 99. 9 % CO 2 and a pressure of 0. 10 MPa for different durations (1 d, 3 d, and 14 d). The carbonation front, carbonate products, compressive strength, microstructure, and volume stability of the concrete were investigated. Results show that the compressive strength of the steel slag concrete after CO 2 curing was significantly increased. The compressive strengths of concrete subjected to CO 2 curing for 14 d were up to five-fold greater than that of the corresponding concrete under conventional moist curing for 28 d. This is attributed to the formation of calcium carbonates, leading to a microstructure densification of the concrete. Replacement of limestone and sand aggregates with steel slag aggregates also increased the compressive strengths of the concrete subjected to CO 2 curing. In addition, the concrete pre-exposed to CO 2 curing produced less expansion than the concrete pre-exposed to moist curing during the subsequent accelerated curing in 60 °C water. This study provides a potential approach to prepare concrete with low-carbon emissions via the accelerated carbonation of steel slag.

40|$|In {{response}} to Sherwood’s comments {{and in an}} attempt to restore proper usage of terminology associated with moist instability, the early history of moist instability is reviewed. This review shows that many of Sherwood’s concerns about the terminology were understood {{at the time of their}} origination. Definitions of conditional instability include both the lapse-rate definition (i. e., the environmental lapse rate lies between the dry- and the moist-adiabatic lapse rates) and the available-energy definition (i. e., a parcel possesses positive buoyant energy; also called <b>latent</b> <b>instability),</b> neither of which can be considered an instability in the classic sense. Furthermore, the lapse-rate definition is really a statement of uncertainty about instability. The uncertainty can be resolved by including the effects of moisture through a consideration of the available-energy definition (i. e., convective available potential energy) or potential instability. It is shown that such misunderstandings about conditional instability were likely due to the simplifications resulting from the substitution of lapse rates for buoyancy in the vertical acceleration equation. Despite these valid concerns about the value of the lapse-rate definition of conditional instability, consideration of the lapse rate and moisture separately can be useful in some contexts (e. g., the ingredients-based methodology for forecasting deep, moist convection). It is argued that the release of potential (or convective) instability through layer lifting may occur in association with fronts, rathe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{results from}} numerical experiments {{which have been}} performed as the author's first step toward {{a better understanding of}} the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO). This study uses the author's mesoscale-convection-resolving model that was developed in the 1980 s to improve parametrization schemes of moist convection. Results from numerical experiments by changing the SST anomaly in the warm pool area indicate that the period of the MJO does not monotonously change with increasing SST anomaly. Between the two extreme cases (no anomaly and strong anomaly), there is a regime in which the period varies in a wide range from 20 to 60 days. In the case of no warm pool, eastward-propagating Kelvin waves are dominant, whereas in the case of a strong warm pool, it produces a quasi-stationary convective system (with pronounced time variation). In a certain regime between the two extreme cases, convective activities with two different properties are strongly interacted, and the period of oscillations becomes complicated. The properties and behaviors of large-scale convective system (LCS), synoptic-scale convective system (SCS), mesoscale convective system (MCS), and mesoscale convection (MC), which constitute the hierarchical structure of the MJO, are also examined. It is also shown that cloud clusters, which constitute the SCS (such as super cloud cluster SCC), consist of a few MCS, and a new MCS forms to the west of the existing MCS. The northwesterly and southwesterly low-level flows contribute to this feature. In view of recent emphasis of the importance of the relative humidity above the boundary layer, it is shown that the model can simulate convective processes that moisten the atmosphere, and the importance of <b>latent</b> <b>instability</b> (positive CAPE), which is a necessary condition for the wave-CISK, is emphasized...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Oligomeric coiled-coil motifs {{are found}} in {{numerous}} protein structures; among them is fibritin, a structural protein of bacteriophage T 4, which belongs to a class of chaperones that catalyze a specific phage-assembly process. Fibritin promotes the assembly of the long tail fibers and their subsequent attachment to the tail baseplate; {{it is also a}} sensing device that controls the retraction of the long tail fibers in adverse environments and, thus, prevents infection. The structure of fibritin had been predicted from sequence and biochemical analyses to be mainly a triple-helical coiled coil. The determination of its structure at atomic resolution was expected to give insights into the assembly process and biological function of fibritin, and the properties of modified coiled-coil structures in general. RESULTS: The three-dimensional structure of fibritin E, a deletion mutant of wild-type fibritin, was determined to 2. 2 A resolution by X-ray crystallography. Three identical subunits of 119 amino acid residues form a trimeric parallel coiled-coil domain and a small globular C-terminal domain about a crystallographic threefold axis. The coiled-coil domain is divided into three segments that are separated by insertion loops. The C-terminal domain, which consists of 30 residues from each subunit, contains a beta-propeller-like structure with a hydrophobic interior. CONCLUSIONS: The residues within the C-terminal domain make extensive hydrophobic and some polar intersubunit interactions. This is consistent with the C-terminal domain being important for the correct assembly of fibritin, as shown earlier by mutational studies. Tight interactions between the C-terminal residues of adjacent subunits counteract the <b>latent</b> <b>instability</b> that is suggested by the structural properties of the coiled-coil segments. Trimerization is likely to begin with the formation of the C-terminal domain which subsequently initiates the assembly of the coiled coil. The interplay between the stabilizing effect of the C-terminal domain and the labile coiled-coil domain may be essential for the fibritin function and for the correct functioning of many other alpha-fibrous proteins. status: publishe...|$|E

We tested this hypothesis by determining whether proliferation potential and genetic in-stability {{are associated with}} the risk of lung cancer. Methods: In a study of 183 lung cancer patients and 227 matched control subjects, we examined the joint effects of <b>latent</b> genetic <b>instability</b> (measured as mutagen sensitivity) and elevated proliferation potential (as-sessed by measuring IGFs) in lung can-cer risk. Levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGF-binding protein- 3 (IGFBP- 3) in plasma were measured by use of immu-noassay kits. Mutagen sensitivity was assessed by quantitating bleomycin-and benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) -induced chromatid breaks in peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures. Results: Although not statistically sig-nificant, the mean levels of IGF-I and the molar ratio of IGF-I/IGFBP- 3 were higher in patients with advanced or poorly differentiated disease than in patients with early or well-differenti-ated disease. Variation in IGFs was not associated with any specific histologic type or tumor stage. High levels of IGF-I and enhanced mutagen sensitiv-ity were individually associated with in-creased risk of lung cancer: odds ratio (OR) of 2. 13 (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 20 – 3. 78) for IGF-I, 2. 50 (95 % CI = 1. 49 – 4. 20) for bleomycin sensitiv-ity, and 2. 95 (95 % CI = 1. 72 – 5. 06) for BPDE sensitivity. The OR was statisti-cally significantly elevated to 8. 88 for both higher IGF-I and bleomycin sen-sitivity (95 % CI = 3. 67 – 21. 50) and to 13. 53 for higher IGF-I and BPDE sen-sitivity combined (95 % CI = 4. 48 – 40. 89). With all three risk factors con-sidered together, the OR was 17. 09 (95 % CI = 4. 16 – 70. 27).

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{atmospheric}} boundary layer (BL) is presented that explicitly calculates a two-way interaction of the background flow and convective motions. The model is utilized for investigation {{of the formation of}} large eddies (roll vortices) and their effects on the structure of the marine boundary layer under conditions resembling those of tropical cyclones. It is shown that two main factors controlling the formation of large eddies are the magnitude of the background wind speed and air humidity, determining the cloud formation and latent heat release. When the wind speed is high enough, a strong vertical wind shear develops in {{the lower part of the}} BL, which triggers turbulent mixing and the formation of a mixed layer. As a result, the vertical profiles of velocity, potential temperature, and mixing ratio in the background flow are modified to allow for the development of large eddies via dynamic <b>instability.</b> <b>Latent</b> heat release in clouds was found to be the major energy source of large eddies. The cloud formation depends on the magnitude of air humidity. The most important manifestation of the effects of large eddies is a significant increase of the near-surface wind speed and evaporation from the sea surface. For strong wind conditions, the increase of the near-surface speed can exceed 10 m s 21 and evaporation from the sea surface can double. These results demonstrate an important role large eddies play in the formation of BL structure in high wind speeds. Inclusion of these effects in the BL parameterizations of tropical cyclone models may potentially lead to substantial improvements in the prediction of storm intensity. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a gyroscopic system under {{the action of}} small dissipative and non-conservative positional forces, which has its origin in the models of rotating bodies of revolution being in frictional contact. The spectrum of the unperturbed gyroscopic system forms a "spectral mesh" in the plane "frequency -gyroscopic parameter" with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at zero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces lead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue {{with the creation of}} the so-called "bubble of instability" - a ring in the three-dimensional space of the gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which corresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a positive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real parts making the bubble a <b>latent</b> source of <b>instability</b> because it can "emerge" to the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both indefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} copies {{within the}} field of art museums by way of mapping strategies for copy practices. This mapping leans heavily towards parts of the wri-tings of Jacques Derrida (1930 - 2004). Against the backdrop of this theoretical premise, the article distinguishes five main strategies. Firstly, the copies which of-ten are considered to be typical museum copies, characterize the strategy for the disseminating relation between original and copy, that is, reproductions, magnets, etc. This strategy implies how copy practices are closely integrated into museum practices in general. Secondly, the supplementing relation between original and copy will be introduced. This strategy frames, for example, artists' citations of other works and forgeries. Both show that copy practices often lead to new originals, in principle, ad infinitum. Thirdly, this leads to the strategy for the displacing relation between original and copy which encompasses, for example, artistic reworkings of other artists' originals and conservatorial restorations. This approach partly ex-cludes the copy and partly displaces the original, while still, unavoidably, referring to the latter. In general, this strategy signifies the <b>latent</b> <b>instability</b> of the origi-nal. Fourthly, the strategy for the informational relation between original and copy will be discussed as it has a vital function in terms of talking about museum originals and copies. This is the strategy which grants the original artifacts their status as museum objects. An informational copy is just as unique as an original object of art, and at the same time, it defines the original and is itself defined by this opposition. Lastly, the strategy for the imagined relation between original and copy follows. This strategy is dependent upon several of the previous approaches, and, in addition, handles signs that exist without explicit originals, as the strategy covers copies referring to originals which have disappeared, been destroyed, not seen yet, etc.; that is, this strategy produces images of originals not least by way of the disseminating relation between original and copy from the first strategy...|$|E
40|$|Oman faces a water {{resources}} crisis as the demand {{of fresh water}} increases day by day. Most of the renewable {{water resources}} {{in the country are}} directly or indirectly dependent on the rainfall. The Western Hajar Mountains extend to the borders with the UAE. This area is a very important source of ground water for both countries. A collaborative program to investigate the feasibility of rainfall enhancement over the Omani mountains by means of hygroscopic cloud seeding was implemented in the UAE during the summer of 2003 and 2004. Due to the complicated logistics and astronomical cost involved in the cloud seeding experiment, it is crucial that timely and accurate forecasts are made for these mesoscale storms. However, convective clouds of the Al Hajar Mountains are notoriously difficult to predict as they result from mesoscale circulation. This study developed forecasting techniques for seedable storms over the Western Hajar Mountains in the Sultanate of Oman. A period of 10 days (5 th- 14 th of July 2004) was investigated in order to describe the differences in the atmospheric parameters between days when convection occurred and days which remained dry. The main ingredient for convective development is the influx of surface moisture from southeast over the Arabian Sea. This moisture often results from the circulation around the surface low over {{the central part of the}} Arabian Peninsula but may occasionally be caused by the sea breeze circulation. The northeasterly sea breeze moves in from the Gulf of Oman to the mountains where it converges with the southeasterly moist flow and this may result in the occurrence of convective clouds. Localized wind convergence zones near the mountains are good indicators of the onset of convection. The Oman Convection Index (OCI) was developed to replace the K-index (KI) and was found to provide a good indication of convective development over the mountains. A forecasting decision tree table for predicting convective storms over the Al Hajar Mountains is proposed where circulation criteria are stipulated as well as critical values for meteorological variables. The ingredients includes the location of the heat low over the centre of Arabian Peninsula, <b>latent</b> <b>instability</b> of the atmosphere, and critical values of mixing ratio and the OCI. This research results have shown that careful investigation and manipulation of the available data allow for increased accuracy in the forecast of convection. The OCI was developed to describe the conditions favorable for summer convection over the mountains of Oman specifically. The results show that the OCI fairs considerably better than the KI in identifying days when significant convection is likely to occur. However, the OCI is only one element of the forecasting techniques table. For truly significant convection to occur there are at least four other circulation criteria which should be satisfied. The forecasting decision tree table provides a systematic approach to the forecasting of convection of the mountains and therefore, for the first time in Oman, objective verification is possible and opens the door for improving these and other forecasting techniques. The techniques developed here may therefore contribute to future cloud seeding projects in the mountains of Oman. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|We {{consider}} a gyroscopic system with two {{degrees of freedom}} under the action of small dissipative and non-conservative positional forces, which has its origin in the models of rotating bodies of revolution being in frictional contact. The spectrum of the unperturbed gyroscopic system forms a ”spectral mesh ” in the plane ”frequency – gyroscopic parameter ” with double semi-simple purely imaginary eigenvalues at zero value of the gyroscopic parameter. It is shown that dissipative forces lead to the splitting of the semi-simple eigenvalue with the creation of the so-called ”bubble of instability ” – a ring in the three-dimensional space of the gyroscopic parameter and real and imaginary parts of eigenvalues, which corresponds to complex eigenvalues. In case of full dissipation with a positive-definite damping matrix the eigenvalues of the ring have negative real parts making the bubble a <b>latent</b> source of <b>instability</b> because it can ”emerge ” to the region of eigenvalues with positive real parts due to action of both indefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces. In the paper, the instability mechanism is analytically described {{with the use of the}} perturbation theory of multiple eigenvalues. Explicit conditions are established for the origination of the bubble of instability and its transition from the latent to active phase, clarifying the key role of indefinite damping and non-conservative positional forces in the development and localization of the subcritical flutter instability. As an example stability of a rotating circular string constrained by a stationary load system is studied in detail. The theory developed seems to give a first clear explanation of the mechanism of selfexcited vibrations in the rotating structures in frictional contact, that is responsible for such well-known phenomena of acoustics of friction as the squealing disc brake and the singing wine glass...|$|R
