50|$|Anosmia {{can have}} a number of harmful effects. Patients with sudden onset anosmia may find food less appetizing, though {{congenital}} anosmics rarely complain about this, and none report a loss in weight. Loss of smell can also be dangerous because it hinders the detection of <b>gas</b> <b>leaks,</b> <b>fire,</b> and spoiled food. The common view of anosmia as trivial can {{make it more difficult for}} a patient to receive the same types of medical aid as someone who has lost other senses, such as hearing or sight.|$|R
50|$|It was {{believed}} that the explosion {{was caused by the}} combination of a <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> and <b>fire</b> inside a Nigerian-owned clothing store just off the main street of Freetown. Killing at least 17 people, the explosion also trapped a significant number of people underneath the rubble. The explosion damaged a fire engine which was on the scene to battle the fire inside. The Connaught Hospital was reported to have struggled in caring for the wounded. Both President Ernest Bai Koroma and Vice President Samuel Sam-Sumana visited injured people in the hospital.|$|R
50|$|The carbine was {{designed}} and patented by Ambrose Burnside, who resigned his commission in the U.S. Army to devote himself full time to working on the weapon. The carbine used a special brass cartridge, also invented by Burnside. Pressing the weapon's two trigger guards opened the breech block and allowed the user to insert a cartridge. When the trigger was pulled, the hammer struck a percussion cap and caused a spark; {{a hole in the}} base of the cartridge exposed the black powder to this spark. The unique, cone-shaped cartridge sealed the joint between the barrel and the breech. Most other breech-loading weapons of the day tended to <b>leak</b> hot <b>gas</b> when <b>fired,</b> but Burnside's design eliminated this problem.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Automatic sensing of gas {{distributions}} {{could be}} very useful {{for a number of}} industrial applications. However, while individual gas sensors can be relatively cheap, they can only cover a small area. To cover larger scale environments such as warehouses and factories with a fixed installation of sensors, an arbitrarily large number of sensors would be required, resulting in very high set-up costs. As an alternative solution, the design of an electronic nose is presented (the "Mark III Mobile Nose") that can be used on mobile robots. One possible application of this mobile nose would be an "electronic watchman" that can detect, localise and identify odours caused by <b>leaking</b> solvents, hazardous <b>gases,</b> <b>fires,</b> etc. However, before such an application can be realized, {{there are a number of}} practical problems that must be addressed. For example, the metal oxide sensors used in this research are subject to a long response time and an even longer recovery time. Also, the spread o...|$|R

Buildings are subjected to natural risks such as earthquakes, strong winds and manmade risks such as fire and crimes. So we have to monitor different measurable factors such as aging of structural performance, fatigue, damage, <b>gas</b> <b>leak,</b> <b>fire</b> etc. To monitor these parameters by using different kinds of sensors which are placed in different parts of the building and provide risk control of the buildings from these hazards.

40|$|AbstractPeople {{spend an}} {{increasing}} amount {{of their time}} indoors. Thus, environmental conditions and air quality but also safety aspects are of specific concern in indoor settings. This contribution gives an overview of chemical sensor technologies used for indoor applications, focusing on explosive <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> and <b>fire</b> detection as well as indoor air quality as the most relevant applications. These applications are traditionally addressed {{with a variety of}} technologies, such as metal-oxide semiconductor gas sensors for <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detection or infrared sensors for CO 2 monitoring. Increased requirements led to multisensor developments especially for security applications such as fire detection which demand a high reliability of the sensor system. In recent years, modern signal processing techniques have increasingly been used to overcome typical problems of chemical sensors, especially limited selectivity as well as drift and aging. Some examples for state-of-the-art chemical sensor systems for indoor applications are given showing the growing potential in this area...|$|R

50|$|Proponents of {{this event}} suggest that since there are {{relatively}} fewer visible and practical difficulties associated with olfactory disorders than with visual or auditory impairments, the nature of olfactory dysfunction and its consequences for an individual's safety {{and quality of life}} are not widely understood. Anosmia Awareness Day aims to expose this situation, push for the development of successful treatments, and inform the general public about the serious impact that anosmia can have on a person's life. Anosmia sufferers {{have been shown to be}} susceptible to dangerous situations such as <b>gas</b> <b>leaks,</b> <b>fires,</b> hazardous chemical vapors, and ingesting spoiled food. Additionally, people with smell loss can also experience difficulty with eating due to the close relationship between smell and taste. Studies also indicate that some individuals develop depression in response to feelings of social isolation, fears regarding safety and personal odor management, and a diminished connection to pleasure, emotion, and memory.|$|R
40|$|As {{a special}} sense, {{olfaction}} is an inherited biologic function to monitor our environment. This sense alerts us to dangerous situa-tions such as <b>gas</b> <b>leaks</b> or <b>fires,</b> and provides cues to {{the freshness of}} food. Smell is tightly associated with flavor and taste, and there-fore smell and taste loss frequently occur simultaneously. Olfacto-ry stimuli evoke emotions and memories {{that are related to}} the neighbouring brain circuits of the amygdala and hypocampus [1, 2]. Animals use this sense to avoid predators, while searching for food and evaluating potential sex-partners. Therefore, sense of smell is the primitive brain function and the first door to under-stand brain sciences. The olfactory epithelium is located on the most superior struc-tures of the nasal cavity at the cribriform plate, superior turbinate, and superior septum [3]. Olfactory epithelium consists of multiple functional cells such as 1) olfactory receptor cells (chemoreceptor...|$|R

This message is often called as alarm message where it is indicating the current operational state of the system. An alarm needs to be broadcast to the other nodes as soon as possible,when a critical event (e. g., <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> or <b>fire)</b> occurs in the monitoring area and is detected by a sensor node, then, sensor nodes can inform users nearby to take some response to the event. The life of sensor nodes for event monitoring are expected {{to work for a}} long time without recharging their batteries, sleep scheduling method is always preferred during the monitoring process. Sleep scheduling could cause transmission delay because sender nodes should wait until receiver nodes are active and ready to receive the message.

40|$|This paper brings {{together}} considerations of <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> behaviour and leak detector design and use, {{with a view}} to improving the detection of low-pressure natural <b>gas</b> <b>leaks.</b> An atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel has been used to study ground–based releases of methane at full scale over distances of up to 3 m, under controlled conditions. These scales are relevant to the detection of natural <b>gas</b> <b>leaks</b> from mains and services using hand-portable gas detectors. The mean spatial distribution of the <b>leaking</b> <b>gas</b> plume was determined and used to test and fit a Gaussian dispersion model. This was used for subsequent analysis with respect to the ability of <b>gas</b> <b>leak</b> detectors to confirm and locate a leak. For ground-based <b>leaks,</b> <b>gas</b> concentrations drop rapidly with height such that instruments should ideally sample the air from within 10 cm of ground level. The rapid dilution of gas with distance from the source means that instruments with lower limits of detection, ideally of a few parts per million, have much improved ability to detect a leak from greater distances downwind. Finally, observations showed the variable temporal nature of the gas and the potential for confusion when sampling gas at a single point in time and space.

40|$|AbstractThe fire {{triggered}} by the <b>leak</b> of combustible <b>gas</b> is {{a serious threat to}} the safety of the public and firefighters. Backdraft is a special fire phenomenon in a limited-ventilation apartment. It can develop from fires of combustibles that become oxygen-starved and continue to generate a fuel-rich environment. If abundant fresh air is abruptly supplied by opening a door or a window, the hot gas in this vitiated apartment will rapidly combust and a fire ball and a blast wave will take place. This paper presents laws of <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> backdraft phenomenon based on series of experimental tests in a reduced-scale compartment (length×width×height with 1. 08 m× 0. 36 m× 0. 72 m), fitted with an opening which could be changed in six cases quickly. The effects of varying ventilation conditions, ignition locations, and mass fluxes of gas leakage are discussed. In addition, the effect of the <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> backdraft phenomenon on the temperature of the compartment is analyzed. The experimental results and the analysis show that the smaller the opening is, the further the ignition osition is away {{from the center of the}} compartment and the larger the mass flux of gas leakage is, the more easily the <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> backdraft is produced. Furthermore, it is found that the ventilation condition is the key parameter determining the occurrence of <b>gas</b> <b>fire</b> backdraft, followed by the ignition position, and the mass flux of gas leakage through the analysis of orthogonal experiments...|$|R

The solar hot water driven absorption chiller {{is clean and}} energy saving but hard to work steady and continuously. In this paper, a system for cooling and heating based on an absorption chiller that can be driven by both <b>gas</b> <b>firing</b> and solar hot water was proposed and built. The system is a hybrid capable of solar cooling in single effect and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> cooling in double effect and also thus a combination. It has the advantages of both solar driven and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> absorption systems. This system works in solar driven mode (single effect) when the solar energy is enough. It works in <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> mode (double effect) when solar energy is not enough or solar hot water temperature is low. The design and operation strategy is to use solar at first and <b>gas</b> <b>fired</b> as a backup, thus fossil energy saving is obvious.
