And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be}} one of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Mauboy {{audition}}ed {{for the fourth}} season of Australian Idol in Alice Springs, Northern Territory singing Whitney Houston's [...] "I Have Nothing". Her audition impressed all three judges, and she progressed through to the semi-finals. Following the semi-final process, Mauboy had advanced through to the toptwelve. The media cited her previous Sony contract as grounds for dismissal, but since the contract had expired, Australian Idol producers refused to remove her from the show. Throughout the series, Mauboy continued to impress the judges with her performances. In the final eleven week, following her rendition of Kelly Clarkson's [...] "Walk Away", judge Kyle Sandilands commented on Mauboy's weight, that if she wished {{to succeed in the}} music industry, she should [...] "lose the jelly belly". Mauboy appeared stunned by the comment. In an interview with Who magazine's Alicia Neil, two years after the comment was made, Mauboy stated [...] "I kind of took it as a joke...I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as a positive thing – it made me a stronger person." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} album, Wentz drew lyrical {{inspiration}} from rapper Lil Wayne, whom he called [...] "the best lyricist of [...]" [...] Speaking of Infinity on Highs lyrical themes, Wentz stated, [...] "On the last record, the lyrics were about 'This is where we're {{going to be}} a year from now, and this is what you're going to be saying about us.' But this time, we realized that a lot of bands should spend less time running their mouths and more time writing their songs." [...] In 2013, Wentz reflected, [...] "on a record like Infinity on High, I feel like I tried really hard to explain my perspective – and when I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in hindsight I think it’s an extremely unrelatable record. Critics felt that much of the lyrics address the band's rise to fame and the pressure of maintaining a loyal fanbase. Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker commented that [...] "The only top-ten acts that talk about fame as much as Fall Out Boy does are rappers, although their take on selling records is less conflicted." [...] Cory Apar of Allmusic opined that [...] "Wentz' lyrics are oftentimes resentful, full of fame-induced angst, and really emphasize his need to drive home his position that stardom has not changed the band." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2013, {{asked about}} how {{he wanted to be}} remembered in his retirement, Beckham said, [...] "I just want people to see me as a hardworking footballer, someone that's passionate about the game, someone that – every time I stepped on the pitch – I've given {{everything}} that I have, because that's how I feel. That's how I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> and hope people will see me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s got some of the great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it seemed like {{it was going to be}} kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the band}} {{prepared}} {{to work on their}} next album in 2002, founding member James Nunn left the group. While original bassist Clint Weinrich filled in on tours, guitarists Eric Davis and Scott Sheldon played bass for the album’s recording along with studio bassist Hedge. The musical direction shifted to territory the band had not hitherto explored, and the resulting album Gusto was substantially different from their previous efforts, with a slower speed and more melody and pop influence. Though the band’s irreverent sense of humor remained intact, the music was much less characteristically [...] "punk" [...] than anything the band had played before. Response to the album was mixed, and the band members would later <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as something of a failed experiment. In 2003 Weinrich again rejoined the band for a series of shows including a performance at the House of Blues in Aneheim which was filmed and released by Kung Fu Records as a live concert CD and DVD package. The show’s closing performance of [...] "Perfect World" [...] was removed from the DVD release of the show because a minor could be seen drinking alcohol on stage with the band. However, on the packaging of the DVD itself it is said that it was edited due to a frenzied crowd that damaged equipment, although the audio portion was preserved on the CD.|$|E
500|$|The {{contemporary}} {{review in}} Trouser Press praised the Furs for their [...] "increased sophistication" [...] as songwriters and musicians. The album {{was described as}} both [...] "alluring and amusing" [...] in Rolling Stone, and music critic Robert Christgau graded it with an [...] "A-" [...] rating in The Village Voice. Later assessments have been similarly kind: writing for AllMusic, Ned Raggett effusively called it [...] "simply fantastic" [...] while Stylus <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> as [...] "the Furs' masterpiece".|$|R

[...] "It's surreal for me, it's such an honor," [...] Mariota said.

5000|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1968, Irvine and his first wife Muriel headed off to Eastern Europe and the Balkans. I kind of remembered that, as a stamp collector, I had liked Bulgarian stamps {{because they had a}} weird script. And, of course, I had left-wing leanings. Also, nobody went there. So, I decided to go. It was 1968 and, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> that became a period where a lot of people decided to broaden their horizons. —Andy Irvine, The Humours of Planxty by Leagues O'Toole.|$|R
50|$|Some theonomists {{go further}} and embrace {{the idea that}} the whole Law {{continues}} to function, contending that the way in which Christians observe some commands has changed but not the content or meaning of the commands. For example, they would say that the ceremonial commands regarding Passover were looking forward to Christ's sacrificial death and the Communion mandate is <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> the former is given to the Levitical priesthood and the latter is given to the priesthood of all believers, but both have the same content and meaning.|$|R
2500|$|Of Human Bondage is {{considered}} to have many autobiographical elements. Maugham gave Philip Carey a club foot (rather than his stammer); the vicar of Blackstable appears derived from the vicar of Whitstable; and Carey is a medic. Maugham insisted the book was more invention than fact. The close relationship between fictional and non-fictional became Maugham's trademark, despite the legal requirement to state that [...] "the characters in [...] are entirely imaginary". He wrote in 1938: [...] "Fact and fiction are so intermingled in my work that now, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> I can hardly distinguish one from the other." ...|$|R

40|$|Alarmed by the anti-immigration {{campaigns in}} the summer 2013 and wary that expressing outrage in {{publications}} and on social media might do little other than amplify the ‘Go Home’ message, a group of academics and activists came together primarily through interactions on Twitter, and decided to put our social research skills to some use in the debate. We organised ourselves quickly, informally – and, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> rather impressively! – to conduct a series of street surveys that would gather the views {{of people living in}} the areas affected by the Go Home van and high profile spot checks, on those interventions and the immigration debate more broadly. ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I hate {{to sound}} typical, but our record company {{was not the}} best. We had the {{greatest}} radio promotion department you could ever hope for, and our success at radio is proof of that. But Virgin is a very urban, pop music company. There were absolutely people at the label {{in positions of power}} that did not give a shit about Brother Cane, or care about getting product in stores in smaller cities in the mid-western United States, which is where our biggest audience was. Some of our problems were not unusual; others, especially now <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> could have easily been avoided." ...|$|R
5000|$|Skene played college {{football}} for the University of Michigan from 1989 to 1992. [...] He {{played on the}} offensive line for Michigan and was coached there by Les Miles. Skene later recalled: [...] "The thing that Les hammered us on was the attention to detail. I never went through more walk-throughs {{in my entire life}} and more meetings and detailed study of the opponents than with Les. I felt he was really hard on me, and I told him later that at times I hated him. But <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> he was the best coach of Xs and Os and the best technician I ever had." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' he said, 'it is not bitterness. That is over. I am {{thankful to}} have broken loose, {{and to be}} able to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> calmly, as a past delusion.

And after all, Honor, though it is a terrible past to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>on,</b> <b>it</b> is so very {{pleasant}} to be coming home, and to realize mercy and pardon, and hopes of doing better, that I can't feel half the broken-down sorrow that perhaps ought to be mine.

60|$|But though Courtier {{eyed the}} 'facts' with such suspicion, the keenness of {{everyone}} {{about the business}} struck him as really splendid. They went at it with a will.

It was evidently a religious ceremony, summing up most high feelings; and this seemed to one who was himself a man of action, natural, perhaps pathetic, but certainly no matter for scorn.|$|E

Boulez conducted all three recordings. Only the third recording presents the work in its final form. In 1983, comparing the first two recordings, Paul Griffiths noted the latter's markedly longer playing times and wrote: [...] "Boulez in 1969 {{appears to have been}} excited with a work that was still new; in 1981 he was <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> with affection, certainly, but perhaps too with a faint sense of regret." ...|$|R
60|$|The Settlement {{effected}} by our 'Healing Parliament' in the Year of Grace 1660, though accomplished under universal acclamations {{from the four}} corners of the British Dominions, turns out to {{have been one of the}} mournfulest that ever took place in this land of ours. It called and thought itself a Settlement of brightest hope and fulfilment, bright as the blaze of universal tar-barrels and bonfires could make it: and we find <b>it</b> now, <b>on</b> <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> with the insight which trial has yielded, a Settlement as of despair. Considered well, it was a Settlement to govern henceforth without God, with only some decent Pretence of God.|$|R
500|$|Although {{they came}} to {{learn a great deal}} about the game, neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players. Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw the baby out with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|R

60|$|The {{passage of}} the days, which had so sapped the stamina of the {{efficient}} Baxter, had had the opposite effect on Mr. Peters.

5000|$|Mays {{was born}} in Irving, Texas, the son of Stafford Mays, a former NFL {{defensive}} lineman, and Laurie Mays (née Black), a Nordstrom executive. He is African-American and Jewish and was raised in his mother's Jewish religion. Growing up he attended Sunday school from a young age, and then Hebrew school twice a week. He had a football-themed bar mitzvah in February 2001. Speaking of his bar mitzvah, he said: [...] "I don't think at the time I really understood what <b>it</b> meant. Now, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> I feel like I {{have come a long}} way in regards to maturity and becoming an adult. I think it helped me do that".

60|$|For several months--how short {{the time}} seemed, when they <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in after-years!--the {{happiness}} {{of the painter}} and his wife more than fulfilled the brightest hopes which they had formed as lovers. As for the doctor's cautious words, they were hardly remembered now; or, if recalled, were recalled only to be laughed over. But the time of bitter grief, which had been appointed, though they knew it not, came inexorably, even {{while they were still}} lightly jesting at all medical authority round the painter's fireside. Lavinia caught a severe cold. The cold turned to rheumatism, to fever, then to general debility, then to nervous attacks--each one of these disorders, being really but so many false appearances, under which the horrible spinal malady was treacherously and slowly advancing in disguise.|$|R
