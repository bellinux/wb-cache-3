While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough people knew about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, when you <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit {{a far cry from the}} 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E

Described in its profile as a Christ figure due to the heroic nature often assigned to it throughout ancient and medieval mythology, the first spot in the Icelandic manuscript is instead replaced by the phoenix, whose behaviors and moralization are of a similar nature.

Despite the phoenix actually being a mythical beast, the lion was — in a sense — more mythical, given that the image of birds was more present than large, predatory quadrupeds in Iceland.|$|E

40|$|Esta dissertaÃÃo tem por objetivo {{investigar}} as particularidades do manejo da transferÃncia nos centros de atenÃÃo psicossocial (CAPS). Estes podem ser mais bem compreendidos com base na polÃtica de saÃde resultante da crÃtica ao modelo institucional e asilar de atendimento e ao saber psiquiÃtrico. Trata-se, pois, de um serviÃo que propÃe uma forma especÃfica de clÃnica. A dinÃmica de atendimento multidisciplinar do modelo CAPS constitui, assim, objeto privilegiado de reflexÃo sobre as transformaÃÃes da saÃde mental na atualidade. Nesse contexto, a transferÃncia, tal como acontece na clÃnica privada, desempenha lugar central. Considerando-se a reflexÃo de Freud sobre a prevalÃncia da forma negativa da transferÃncia nas instituiÃÃes, pergunta-se pelas conseqÃÃncias deste fato em relaÃÃo ao CAPS. Concluiu-se que as perspectivas do manejo clÃnico implicam, nÃo apenas, os atendimentos individuais, mas tambÃm o reconhecimento da transferÃncia perante as atividades realizadas em equipe. Desta forma, evita-se que a transferÃncia seja confundida com outro tipo de vÃnculo que leve a uma dependÃncia em relaÃÃo Ã instituiÃÃo. O trabalho aponta, entre outras coisas, para a necessidade da Ãtica psicanalÃtica como aquela dimensÃo que possibilita um manejo eficaz da transferÃncia, freqÃentemente imersa nos dispositivos do CAPS. This work aims {{to investigate}} the handling of transference at the psychosocial care centers (CAPS). The references on the health politics that guides this model of attendance show that the psychiatric reform {{is one of the}} main sources to understand the CAPS. This service sets a specific form of clinic historically originated from the criticism of the asylum model, and the knowledge of psychiatry. The dynamics of multidisciplinary attendance of CAPS model constitute a privileged subject of reflexion on the changes in mental health nowadays. In the context of this institutional model, the handling of the transference assumes a central role, as it does in private clinics. This should <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> indicated by Freud: the lack of recognition of the transference and its prevalence in a negative way in institutions. Considering this, one asks here on the consequences of such prevalence at the CAPS. One had also concluded that the perspectives of the transferencial handling in the CAPS imply, ahead of this, not only the individual care, but also the recognition of the transference before collective activities realised normally in the work team. More than a technique would be the psychoanalytical ethics that it would make possible the handling of the transference that appears immersed in the devices of the CAPS...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how an organization which is based on ethic and social responsibility works with segmentation, positioning and brand. Do their specific need of credibility have any impact on how they work with segmentation, positioning and brand? How do they work with credibility? KRAV is an ingredient brand based on ethic and social responsibility, they operate in the Swedish organic foodstuff market offering organic standards, certification and inspections according to these standards and a KRAV-label. In other words, credibility is the base for KRAV’s operations. KRAV is also receiving national grants to finance information material/marketing material. Research questions: How does KRAV work with segmentation, positioning and brand? How does KRAV work with credibility? Method: I have chosen to do this study by studying documents published by KRAV; the main source has been KRAV’s annual reports from 1999 - 2006, the second source has been KRAV’s homepage and the third source has been folders published by KRAV. The analysis was done by combining findings about KRAV with theories about segmentation, positioning, brand and credibility to see how KRAV works with these areas. Result & Conclusions: By summarization, my study shows that KRAV both is adopting and actively working with segmentation, positioning and brand which may be business driven and at the same time trying to tone done the business incentive on how they formulate goals and missions. Marketing theories are getting more and visible over the years. KRAV has formulated its’ vision and mission based on four principals; Good environment, Animal welfare, Good health and Social responsibility but they also include inspected organic products with high credibility and they try to position itself not only as an eco-label but also with added value in the areas of the four principals. Suggestions for future research: One limitation in this study is that I have not studied competitors on the Swedish foodstuff market. Or the actual impact of the fact that KRAV receives national grants, does this disturb the competition? One interesting aspect is if an ingredient brand based on ethic and social responsibility can work with segmentation, positioning and brand without loosing any credibility? May this cause a conflict in the long run? One may also <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that KRAV, by far the dominating label on the Swedish organic foodstuff market, is financing most of its information material/marketing material by national grants. Is it better for the increase of organic foodstuff market to support one large player (KRAV) or should national grants be used to increase knowledge of organic foodstuff and sustainability in general not supporting one specific actor? Which way would maximum the use of the tax money? Or is both needed? Contribution of the thesis: This study has shown that KRAV, which is based on ethics and social responsibility, has adopted theories such as segmentation, positioning and brand...|$|E
40|$|Summary The {{national}} minority “Travellers and school”, is {{the topic of}} my thesis. There has been research on the people since pioneer and social scientist Eilert Sundt first began to {{take an interest in}} them in the mid- 1800 s. Especially the last twenty years there has been an increase in the interest of national minorities in Norway, such as Travellers. In at least five centuries, these people have lived in Norway and attempts have been many to try to integrate the people. Such integration requires a determination of the integrated party to be integrated. And here are my findings equivocal. Travellers want to be regarded as "one hundred percent" Norwegian, yet they are clear that they are in many ways very different from "the others". The school is the arena in the egalitarian Norway, which is best suited to represent the integration process. It's still been seen as a paradox that Travellers "need" to undergo some kind of integration process after five hundred years in the country. It bears witness to a people who have a strong internal culture to stand out and preserve their traditions. A people who see themselves as different and to some degree strongly want to be. The society around will also perceive Travellers as different. It looks as if the theoretical knowledge is disregarded in favor of the practical teachings. Although the Travellers say they feel school is important, suggests the practice and their actions to the contrary. Absence rate is too high. Education is essential {{to have the opportunity to}} participate in society. Lacking of it is likely to exclude people from society. The parents say that they understand this, but still do not manage to motivate their children for schooling. Some parents express a clear distrust and fear of authorities. The school is also an authority. Individual experiences are transferred to the next generation and help to shape both the parents and the children's views on whether the school is important. This transferred collective memory must be processed and be overcome if schools are to succeed with children of Travellers. Opportunity for praise and positive feedback are important motivators in their schoolwork. This can only be done with a safe environment and sense of security built up over time. My issue is twofold and therefore the conclusion must also be twofold. Taters experiences with the school situation are mostly positive. Parents expressed appreciation to the efforts they experience school does for their children. They know they are lucky with this school. The school also expresses optimism on Travellers behalf. They see that they have managed to create security and good relations with the families and they also feel they have a certain degree of continuity. My assignment also tries to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the school and parents I study are communicating better than most of 3 the other schools. And therefor are better off and better equipped to succeed in their goal for education for the future Travellers...|$|E
