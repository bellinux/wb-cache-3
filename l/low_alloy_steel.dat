5|$|To {{identify}} different electrodes, the American Welding Society {{established a}} system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> carry the prefix E, followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand {{pounds per square inch}} (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- The {{main idea}} of this paper {{consists}} in creation of the optimal depth of shell which provides optimal stress distribution in quenched steel parts. For small steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by using of low and limited hardenability steels (LH). For big steel parts optimal quenched layer can be provided by use of <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b> Since the LH steel core does not harden significantly, the ductility of the core is also maintained. The same is true when using <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> for manufacturing big steel parts. The grain sizes of LH steels are above ASTM 8. It is shown that {{the high level of}} compressive surface residual stresses and steel superstrengthening phenomenon can eliminate the need for secondary shot peening or surface induction operations.

The disadvantages are that ductility and toughness are {{not as good as}} quenched and tempered (Q&T) steels.

50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite {{due to the}} toughness it imparts. During continuous cooling, higher alloy contents or faster cooling generally delay transformation, which will then take place at lower temperatures, below the bainite start temperature, and lead to higher hardness. The efficacy of inclusions as nucleation sites in modern <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steel</b> weld metals is such that fine-scale intragranular bainite can nucleate on them, both by continuous cooling and by isothermal transformation below the bainite start temperature. Some confusion has arisen in the literature, as this fine-scale intragranular bainite, which can resemble acicular ferrite in appearance in the optical microscope, has been called acicular ferrite by some researchers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{critical}} fracture stresses (σ f(sp)) {{in various}} <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels</b> for a reactor pressure vessel(RPV) {{were evaluated by}} a small punch test (SP test) and a finite element analysis (FEA) in the cleavage temperature region(- 150 ~- 196 º C).

The maximum principal stresses (SP fracture stresses, σf(SP)) were determined from the FE analysis, when the maximum load {{was applied to the}} SP test. The SP critical fracture stress, σ f(sp) in various reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels was found to have a linear relationship with the values obtained from the precracked specimens (σ f(PCVN)). The σ f(sp) shows a lower value than σ f(PCVN) because the SP specimen had a lower triaxial stress condition.

The conventional weathering steel (SMA: 0. 6 % Cr- 0. 4 % Cu-Fe) showed higher corrosion resistance as compared to the carbon steel (SM), and Ni bearing steel exhibited the highest one. Raman spectroscopy showed that the inner rust of Ni bearing steel was mainly composed of α-FeOOH and spinel oxides. On the other hand, SMA contained β- and γ-FeOOH in inner rust, which increased the corrosion. TEM showed that nano-scale complex iron oxides containing Ni or Cr were formed in the rust on the <b>low</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>steels,</b> which suppressed the corrosion of steels in high Cl− and high SOx environment...|$|R
