25|$|Despite {{opposition}} from some groups, the form-fitting style proved popular. It {{was not long}} before swimwear started to shrink further. At first arms were exposed and then <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> to mid-thigh. Necklines receded from around the neck down to around the top of the bosom. The development of new fabrics allowed for new varieties of more comfortable and practical swimwear.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and '90s a very {{revealing}} costume style {{developed with}} skirts designed to display both <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> to the hip, and plunging bras or even pasties. Such styles still exist in some venues {{but there are}} also many Turkish belly dancers who wear more moderate costumes. Even so, many Turkish belly dance costumes reflect the playful, flirty style of Turkish belly dance.|$|E
25|$|Egg-laying {{is done by}} {{bringing}} the abdomen close to the mouthparts where the pap is being held. The female holds her front <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> and open and appears {{to use them to}} touch her abdomen. Her antennae are completely still and her wings are closed during the operation. Then her abdomen begins to vibrate, and her sting is turned inside and out and folded backwards. During this process, the egg is expelled and placed directly on the pap that the female is holding in her mouth. She does not touch it with her legs at all. Then her abdomen relaxes and the female places the egg inside the cell. The average length of the eggs laid by L. vechti is 1.36mm, and ovarian eggs are considered ready to be laid once they reach 1.16mm.|$|E

25|$|A woman's legs {{can remain}} flat or raised toward her chest, or {{wrapped around the}} {{penetrating}} partner at various heights: {{at the back of}} the legs, at the buttocks or back or over the shoulders, in a position called the Wiener Auster or Viennese oyster. In the higher leg positions the woman's legs may need some support, which may be achieved by crossing the ankles behind the partner or resting on his shoulders. She may also hold them with her hands or cross her arms around them at the knees. Some are flexible enough to cross the legs behind their heads. Alternatively, her partner may hold her <b>legs</b> <b>up.</b> Separating straight legs carry the risk of muscle pull of thigh muscles. The laying by the partner on raised legs puts excessive pressure on the woman's back.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae kwon do. Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E

Overall, the lyrics portray the subject of having a [...] "romantic evening" [...] of making love like wild animals (gorillas), despite being high from cocaine and drunk from liquor.

The singer roams around with some friends, laughing and joking in a restaurant, while she stands on the seat. Gaga then comes from around the block walking with her friends in pace and singing in the camera. Next, she is shown sleeping in a bed, and waking up to reveal pink high-heeled shoes. She sings and cooks for {{a man in a}} house while dancing. She irons clothes while the man is on phone screaming at someone.

2500|$|The {{swing and}} row simply {{consists}} of the vaulter swinging the trail leg forward and rowing the pole, bringing the top arm down to the hips, while {{trying to keep the}} trail leg straight to store more potential energy into the pole, the rowing motion also keeps the pole bent {{for a longer period of}} time for the vaulter to get into optimum position. Once in a [...] "U" [...] shape the left arm hugs the pole tight to efficiently use the recoil within the pole. The goal is to carry out these motions as thoroughly and as quickly as possible; it is a race against the unbending of the pole. Effectively, this causes a double pendulum motion, with the top of the pole moving forward and pivoting from the box, while the vaulter acts as a second pendulum pivoting from the right hand. This action gives the vaulter the best position possible to be [...] "ejected" [...] off the pole. The swing continues until the hips are above the head and the arms are pulling the pole close to the chest; from there the vaulter shoots their <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> over the cross bar while keeping the pole close.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, Weber was {{a popular}} banquet speaker renowned for his [...] "polysyllabic fluency," [...] "mind--boggling after-dinner speeches," [...] and his often humorous talks {{about the history of}} Michigan football. It was noted that he would [...] "regale with dubious rhetoric" [...] audiences before whom he would thunderously and whimsically [...] "expatiate upon" [...] Michigan's storied history. Another {{described}} Weber's unusual speaking style this way: [...] "He still sounds like an educated foghorn, and still flips that king's English around in a manner to amaze and apall old Noah Webster." [...] Praising a piledriver spotted among a current crop of Wolverines, the coach would exclaim, [...] "When he hits 'em, generations yet unborn feel the shock of the impact!" [...] Jim Brandstatter wrote in his book Tales from Michigan Stadium that Weber was still a regular visitor at the football offices when he enrolled in 1968. He recalled Weber as a master story teller and a favorite among the students at pep rallies: ‚ÄúWho can forget Wally Weber rolling his pant <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> to his knees as the student body roared before he spoke so eloquently about his beloved Michigan?‚Äù Weber also held positions in the 1960s and early 1970s in alumni relations and the physical education department. Weber also provided color commentary on WPAG radio's broadcasts of Michigan football games with Bob Ufer for several years. He retired in 1972 {{at the same time as}} Oosterbaan. With the exception of four years at Benton Harbor, Weber had been a student or employee of U-M for 48 years at the time of his retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Golden eagles are {{sometimes}} {{considered the most}} superlative fliers among eagles and perhaps among all raptorial birds. They are equipped with broad, long wings with somewhat finger-like indentations on {{the tips of the}} wing. Golden eagles are unique among their genus in that they often fly in a slight dihedral, which means the wings are often held in a slight, upturned V. When they must engage in flapping flight, golden eagles appear at their most labored but this flight method is generally less common than soaring or gliding flights. Flapping flight usually consists of 6‚Äì8 deep wing-beats, interspersed with 2 to 3 second glides. While soaring the wings and tail are held in one plane with the primary tips often spread. A typical, unhurried soaring speed in golden eagles is around [...] When hunting or displaying, the golden eagle is capable of very fast gliding, attaining speeds of up to [...] When diving (or stooping) in the direction of prey or during territorial displays, the eagle holds its wings tight and partially closed against its body and the <b>legs</b> <b>up</b> against its tail. In a full stoop, a golden eagle can reach spectacular speeds of up to [...] when diving after prey. Although less agile and maneuverable, the golden eagle is apparently quite the equal and possibly even the superior of the peregrine falcon‚Äôs stooping and gliding speeds. This places the golden eagle as the one of the two fastest moving living animals on earth. Although most flight in golden eagles has a purpose (e.g., territoriality, hunting, etc.), some flights (such as those by solitary birds or between well-established breeding pairs) seem to function merely as acts of playfulness.|$|E
