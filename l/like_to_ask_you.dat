2500|$|Raeder's last speech {{occurred}} as Commander-in-Chief occurred on 30 January 1943 before the Reichstag, where {{he asserted that}} he had brought the Navy [...] "smoothly and completely" [...] into {{the service of the}} Führer in 1933. Raeder argued that: [...] "This was possible only because, despite all outside efforts to influence it, the training of the Navy [...] derived from an inner attitude that was itself truly National Socialist. For this reason, we did not have to change, but could become followers of the Führer with open hearts. I find it particularly satisfying that the Führer has always attributed this to me, and I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> all of <b>you</b> <b>to</b> see to it that the Navy remains a strong and reliable support of the Führer in this regard". Though Hitler had cordial relations with Raeder, the two had never been close, and there was nothing like the mutual admiration that Hitler and Dönitz shared.|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2010. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com From X-rays to being X-ed out On 8 November 1895 Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen observed a special type of radiation {{that was created}} from an electric discharge passing through a vacuum tube. He labelled this radiation “X-rays ” using the mathematical designation for something unknown. Through X-rays matter became transparent, as so vividly demonstrated by the well-known X-ray image of the hand of Röntgen’s wife. Röntgen, {{at the time of}} his groundbreaking discovery was the Chair of Physics at the University of Würzburg (1888 – 1900). He had no financial affiliations with industry; instead he argued with them over the costs for the vacuum tubes he used for his experiments: “Ihre Röhren sind in der Tat sehr gut, aber für meine Verhältnisse zu theuer,…Ich möchte mir deshalb die Frage erlauben, ob Sie mir die Röhren nicht zu M[ark] 20 statt zu M[ark] 30 liefern könnten…Falls Sie auf meinen Vorschlag eingehen, bitte ich Sie mir für die zwei bereits verbrauchten Röhren 4 andere gleicher Qualität zu schicken…Hochachtungsvoll ” (Your tubes are indeed very good but too expensive for me [...] Therefore, I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> whether <b>you</b> could provide me with the tubes at a price of 20 Marks instead of 30 Marks [...] .

2500|$|However, {{when the}} Great Railroad Strike of 1877 occurred, {{after only a}} couple of months into Grant's tour, he began {{receiving}} numerous letters from America with references to the situation, many of them expressing the general idea that a [...] "strong man fitted to cope with the emergency" [...] like himself, was presently lacking in the U.S. government. The crisis did not persist long, but Badeau estimated that if it had, Grant was likely to have returned {{out of a sense of}} duty. After the strike ended, the idea of entertaining a third attempt at a presidential nomination had quickly become an unlikely consideration. By March 1878, Grant wrote to Badeau, that since the railroad crisis ended [...] "Most every letter I get from the States, <b>like</b> Porter's <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>asks</b> me <b>to</b> remain abroad", suggesting it was best for Grant to spare himself any political trouble and inquiry.|$|R

5000|$|In a study {{looking at}} the DITF technique, {{researchers}} found that DITF requests that required metacommunication in the responses had higher rates of compliance than requests that did not. [...] The researchers define metacommunication as establishing social boundaries. This is important because the DITF technique often involves strangers making extreme requests, which might elicit a response that requires metacommunication. For example, a person may use metacommunication to indicate that it is inappropriate for a stranger make such an extreme request. This study included four different groups: one starting with a large request and including a metacommunicative statement, one starting with a large request and excluding a metacommunicative statement, one with only a smaller request and including a metacommunicative statement, and one with only a smaller request and excluding a metacommunicative statement. For all of the groups a confederate <b>asked</b> participants <b>to</b> fill out a questionnaire about campus activities. The large request required a few hours, while the smaller one required 20 minutes. In the groups that started with a large request, the confederate followed up with the smaller one after a refusal. The requests with metacommunication included a sentence stating, [...] "This is kind of awkward. There is something else I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> of <b>you,</b> but tell me if even this seems inappropriate between strangers" [...] prior to filling out the 20-minute questionnaire (p. 92). Results show significantly greater compliance to requests that included the metacommunicative statement. The researchers suggest that the explicit statement regarding social boundaries makes participants comply to avoid engaging in metacommunicative conflict.|$|R

It is {{a desire for}} justice, space, and the sharing of subjugated forms of knowledges that compels us to produce, and {{participate}} in, platforms such as writing from Below. When I was invited by {{the editors of the}} journal to undertake an interview of Carolyn D’Cruz, Convenor of Gender Sexuality and Diversity Studies (GSDS) at La Trobe University, I pictured a dialogue on important issues that preoccupy those of us working in academia. I aspired to transcribe this tête-à-tête while incorporating my own musings on teaching, theory, and research, and I wanted to do justice to both writing from Below and GSDS. Space does not allow me to fully reproduce the rich conversation that occurred but the following is, hopefully, a faithful rendition of a provocative, lively and inspiring dialogue.

40|$|I’d <b>like</b> <b>to</b> open by <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} three questions: 1. Your {{students use}} an online peer revision tool {{provided by the}} publisher of your textbook. Can that publisher then take those student papers and make them available as sample work to other teachers at other schools? 2. You upload your assignments, handouts, and other class materials to your institution’s course management system. Can your institution claim ownership of those materials? Can the company that produces the software? 3. Your students upload papers to a central Web site service, which checks them for originality. Can that service then increase its profits by adding those papers to its proprietary database? The answer {{to each of these}} questions may seem instinctively obvious to us as educators, yet the actual answers reside not in our guts or in common sense, but in the legal document governing the software in each case: the EULA. You may not be familiar with the term, but if you’ve ever installed a piece of computer software or used a service on the Web you’ve certainly encountered one. EULAs—short for End User License Agreements—are the legal contracts that specify the rights and responsibilities of both the company offering the service or software and you, the end user.
