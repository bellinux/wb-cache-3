50|$|AAW {{developed}} from the simple observation that the aeroelasticity can be offset by the deployment of other control surfaces on the wing. In particular, almost all modern aircraft use some form of slat along the wing's leading edge to provide more lift during certain portions of flight. By deploying the slats {{at the same time}} as the ailerons, the torque can be equalled out on either side of the spars, eliminating the twisting, which improves the control authority of the ailerons. This means that less aileron input is needed to produce a given motion, which, in turn, will reduce aileron drag and its associated negative control aspects. Better yet, the wing is already designed to be extremely strong in the <b>lift</b> <b>component,</b> eliminating the torque requires lift, converting the undesired torque into an acceptable <b>lift</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E

50|$|In aeronautics, a spoiler (sometimes {{called a}} lift spoiler or lift dumper) is a device {{intended}} to intentionally reduce the <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> of an airfoil {{in a controlled}} way. Most often, spoilers are plates on the top surface of a wing that can be extended upward into the airflow to spoil it. By so doing, the spoiler creates a controlled stall over {{the portion of the}} wing behind it, greatly reducing the lift of that wing section. Spoilers differ from airbrakes in that airbrakes are designed to increase drag without affecting lift, while spoilers reduce lift as well as increasing drag.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, net {{aerodynamic}} force may be decomposed into the three translational directions {{with respect to}} a boat's course over the surface: surge (forward/astern), sway (starboard/port—relevant to leeway), and heave (up/down). The scalar values and direction of these components can be dynamic, depending on wind and waves (for a boat). In this case, FT is considered in reference to the direction of the boat's course and is decomposed into driving force (FR), in line with the boat's course, and lateral force (FLAT), perpendicular with the boat's course. Again for windsurfers, the <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> vertical to the surface plane ( [...] FVERT) is important.|$|E

50|$|An {{overhead}} crane, {{commonly called}} a bridge crane, {{is a type}} of crane found in industrial environments. An overhead crane consists of parallel runways with a traveling bridge spanning the gap. A hoist, the <b>lifting</b> <b>component</b> of a crane, travels along the bridge. If the bridge is rigidly supported on two or more legs running on a fixed rail at ground level, the crane is called a gantry crane (USA, ASME B30 series) or a goliath crane (UK, BS 466).|$|R
50|$|An {{approximate}} way {{to relate}} the sound generated to the flow characteristics is to perturb the standard drag equation with velocity perturbations {{as shown in the}} upper equation below.(lift measurements for cylinders are generally not available). The upper equation is the modified drag equation with both drag component u and <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> v and the cross sectional area dL where d is the cylinder diameter and w is the length. Manipulation of the equation yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a vortex is shed, the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the vortex is shed on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole would be expected to be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.|$|E
50|$|The {{demand for}} {{increasing}} power ratings could first be answered with larger rudderpropellers. Limits {{were set to}} this trend by mechanical stress {{and the fact that}} with an increasing propeller diameter, the draft of the vessel inevitably increases. Schottel therefore developed a thruster where the required power is divided between two counter-rotating thrusters that share a single shaft. The Twin Propeller is equipped with a pull propeller and a push propeller. The vortex street of the front pull propeller passes between the blades of the rear push propeller without impeding it. Contraction of the slip stream in the pull propeller means that more water reaches the push propeller from the sides. The strut is equipped with a fin, thus the swirl energy generated in the propeller stream is recovered. Additionally, the flow around the fins creates a <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> in the thrust direction, which has a thrust-enhancing effect.|$|E
5000|$|On a given sail, the net {{aerodynamic}} {{force on the}} sail is located approximately at the maximum draught intersecting the camber of the sail and passing through a plane intersecting the centre of effort, normal to the leading edge (luff), roughly perpendicular to the chord of the sail (a straight line between the leading edge (luff)and the trailing edge (leech)). Net {{aerodynamic force}} {{with respect to the}} air stream is usually considered in reference to the direction of the apparent wind (VA) over the surface plane (ocean, land or ice) and is decomposed into lift (L), perpendicular with VA, and drag (D), in line with VA. For windsurfers, <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> vertical to the surface plane is important, because in strong winds windsurfer sails are leaned into the wind to create a vertical lifting component ( [...] FVERT) that reduces drag on the board (hull) through the water. Note that FVERT acts downwards for boats heeling away from the wind, but is negligible under normal conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} later the American Vought XF5U circular-winged fighter {{prototype}} was designed with large radial-lift propellers. These were angled upwards when the craft was on the ground, creating a cyclic variation in the blades' angle of attack or pitch when the craft was moving forwards. This cyclic variation induced a radial <b>lifting</b> <b>component</b> to the blades, when in the horizontal segment of rotation, which was intended to augment the wing lift. A prototype aircraft was completed but the project was closed before the prototype had flown.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 January 2011, Gates {{said that}} the 2012 budget would call for a two-year pause in F-35B {{production}} during which the aircraft faced redesign, or cancellation if unsuccessful. In 2011, Lockheed Martin executive vice president Tom Burbage and former Pentagon director of operational testing Tom Christie stated that most program delays were due to the F-35B, which forced massive redesigns of other versions. Lockheed Martin Vice President Steve O’Bryan has said that most F-35B landings will be conventional to reduce stress on vertical <b>lift</b> <b>components.</b> These conventional mode takeoffs and landings cause an [...] "unacceptable wear rate" [...] to the aircraft's [...] "poorly designed" [...] tires.

50|$|CD= CD,O + KCL2Where CDO {{is the sum}} of C(D,friction) and C D,thickness, and k for {{supersonic}} flow {{is a function of the}} Mach number. The skin-friction component is derived from the presence of a viscous boundary layer which is infinitely close to the surface of the aircraft body. At the boundary wall, the normal component of velocity is zero; therefore an infinitesimal area exists where there is no slip. The zero-lift wave drag component can be obtained based on the supersonic area rule which tells us that the wave-drag of an aircraft in a steady {{supersonic flow}} is identical to the average of a series of equivalent bodies of revolution. The bodies of revolution are defined by the cuts through the aircraft made by the tangent to the fore Mach cone from a distant point of the aircraft at an azimuthal angle. This average is over all azimuthal angles. The drag due-to <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> is calculated using lift-analysis programs. The wing design and the lift-analysis programs are separate lifting-surfaces methods that solve the direct or inverse problem of design and lift analysis.|$|E
50|$|To turn, an {{aircraft}} must {{roll in the}} direction of the turn, increasing the aircraft's bank angle. Turning flight lowers the wing's <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> against gravity and hence causes a descent. To compensate, the lift force must be increased by increasing the angle of attack by use of up elevator deflection which increases drag. Turning can be described as 'climbing around a circle' (wing lift is diverted to turning the aircraft) so the increase in wing angle of attack creates even more drag. The tighter the turn radius attempted, the more drag induced, this requires that power (thrust) be added to overcome the drag. The maximum rate of turn possible for a given aircraft design is limited by its wing size and available engine power: the maximum turn the aircraft can achieve and hold is its sustained turn performance. As the bank angle increases so does the g-force applied to the aircraft, this having the effect of increasing the wing loading and also the stalling speed. This effect is also experienced during level pitching maneuvers.|$|E
5000|$|The MiG-23's predecessor, the MiG-21, {{was fast}} and agile, but {{limited in its}} {{operational}} capabilities by its primitive radar, short range, and limited weapons load (restricted in some aircraft {{to a pair of}} short-range R-3/K-13 (AA-2 [...] "Atoll") air-to-air missiles). Work began on a replacement for the MiG-21 in the early 1960s. The new aircraft was required to have better performance and range than the MiG-21, while carrying more capable avionics and weapons including beyond-visual-range (BVR) missiles. A major design consideration was take-off and landing performance. Existing Soviet fast jets required very long runways which, combined with their limited range, restricted their tactical usefulness. The VVS demanded the new aircraft have a much shorter take-off run. Low-level speed and handling was also to be improved over the MiG-21. Manoeuvrability was not an urgent requirement. This led Mikoyan to consider two options: lift jets, to provide an additional <b>lift</b> <b>component,</b> and variable-geometry wings, which had been developed by TsAGI for both [...] "clean-sheet" [...] aircraft designs and adaptations of existing designs.|$|E

This study investigated the test–retest reliability of manual handling tasks within the WorkHab FCE in healthy adults. Method: A convenience sample of 25 healthy subjects, consisting of 19 women and 6 men {{with a mean age of}} 29 years (SD: 12. 0) participated in this study. Two FCE sessions were held a week apart and subjects completed a floor to bench, bench to shoulder and bench to bench lift. Analysis of the outcomes of the FCE included descriptive analysis, intra-class correlations (ICC), kappa, percentage agreement and 95 % limits of agreement where appropriate. Results: The ICCs for the three lifts show an excellent reliability (0. 90 – 0. 92), and a moderate reliability for the manual handling score (0. 74). Further analysis of the components of the manual handling score found the percentage agreement was high for all components ranging from 72 to 92 %; however, the kappa scores suggested poor to moderate reliability (range: − 0. 06 to 0. 52). Internal consistency of the manual handling score was good (Cronbach's Alpha[*]=[*] 0. 92) indicating this is a reliable scale.

40|$|Summary. This report {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the effect of blowing a jet stream, simulating conventional jet engines, downwards from the lower surface of a slender delta wing (aspect ratio unity), for the purpose of obtaining additional lift at take-off and landing. Initial experiments investigated a spanwise jet sheet blown respectively from 70, 80 and 90 per cent of the mid-chord from the apex, and a trailing-edge jet flap. It was found that a spanwise jet blown forward of the trailing edge was inefficient in providing lift; a flow investigation showed that this was associated with a region of low pressure behind the jet and a strong vortex at {{the outer edge of the}} jet. Further experiments were then carried out using a narrow chordwise jet sheet and a concentrated group of jets on the wing centre-line, to avoid the adverse effects of the spanwise jet. The concentrated jets proved far more efficient than the other two arrangements, and a total recovery of the thrust component and up to 75 per cent recovery of the <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> of the jet reaction (for the jet directed at 60 deg to the wing plane) was achieved. Tests with the concentrated jets were also made with ground effect and elevator control.

The apex flap comprised approximately 6 {{percent of the}} wing area forward of a transverse hinge, allowing for upward and downward deflection angles from + 40 deg to - 20 deg. Upward deflection forces leading-edge vortex formation on the apex flap, resulting in an increased <b>lift</b> <b>component</b> on the apex area. The associated nose-up moment balances the nose-down moment due to trailing-edge flaps, resulting in sizeable increase in the trimmed lift coefficient particularly at low angles of attack.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{acoustic}} resonance on the dynamic lift force {{acting on the}} central tube in square and normal triangle tube arrays is investigated experimentally. For each array pattern three different tube spacing ratios, corresponding to small, intermediate and large spacing ratios, are tested. The resonant sound field in the tube array is found to cause two main effects. First, it generates a “sound-induced” dynamic lift due to the resonant acoustic pressure distribution {{on the surface of}} the tube, and secondly, it synchronizes vorticity shedding from the tubes and thereby enhances the hydrodynamic lift force due to vortex shedding. The combined effect of these two unsteady lift forces depends on the phase shift between them, which is dictated by the frequency ratio of the acoustic mode to the natural vortex shedding frequencies. When the flow velocity is increased during the coincidence resonance range, the phase shift increases rapidly and therefore the effects of the two <b>lift</b> <b>components</b> change from reinforcing to counteracting each other. For the pre-coincidence lock-on range, the frequency ratio remains larger than unity and the two <b>lift</b> <b>components</b> always reinforce each other. Numerical simulations are also performed to compute the sound-induced lift force, and sound-enhancement coefficients are developed to estimate the effect of sound on the vortex shedding forces. The simulation and experimental results are implemented in a simplified design guide, which can be used to evaluate the dynamic lift forces acting on the tubes during acoustic resonances...|$|R
