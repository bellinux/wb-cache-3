2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{policies}} – owner and lender. [...] Just as lenders require fire insurance and other types of insurance coverage to protect their investment, nearly all institutional lenders also require title insurance [...] to protect their interest in the collateral of <b>loans</b> <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> real estate. Some mortgage lenders, especially non-institutional lenders, may not require title insurance. Buyers purchasing properties for cash or with a mortgage lender often want title insurance [...] as well. [...] A loan policy provides no coverage or benefit for the buyer/owner and so the decision to purchase an owner policy is independent of the lender's decision to require a loan policy.|$|E
2500|$|... banchi a minuto ("small" [...] or retail [...] "bank"): {{the most}} obscure of the three, they {{were sort of}} {{combinations}} of lenders and pawnbrokers. They dealt in, among other things, bullion, installment sales of jewels and <b>loans</b> <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> jewels, and currency exchange. None of the surviving records mention anything but time deposits (for the purposes of raising capital), so they generally did not offer demand accounts and maintain the interest by lending out a portion of the deposits. Such banks did lend without security, though; one example of a banco a minuto (run by Bindaccio de' Cerchi) invested heavily in purchasing future interest payments from the Monte (Monte delle doti, a [...] "seven percent dowry fund" [...] founded in the 1340s by the state of Florence), loans to the Monte Comune, maritime insurance, and speculation in horse races. The Medici bank was not a banco a minuto, although between 1476 and 1491, Francesco di Giuliano de' Medici (14501528) was involved in two that dealt heavily in jewelry (one of whose partnership contracts explicitly state that as a goal, though the more successful one dealt in all sorts of luxuries like Spanish tuna). Such banks were members of the Arte del Cambio as they were not [...] "manifest usurers".|$|E

5000|$|Cross-{{collateral}}ization is a {{term used}} when the collateral for one loan is also used as collateral for another loan.

Technically, cross-collateralization expires when the borrower has no outstanding loans with the bank. In the context of bankruptcy, cross-collateralization also means the collateralization of general unsecured prepetition debt <b>by</b> collateral <b>securing</b> postpetition <b>loans.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{prohibition}} on cramdowns on <b>loans</b> <b>secured</b> <b>by</b> primary residences {{was the result}} of a political compromise during the process of enacting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. At the time, Congress was confronted with brutal stagflation in which economic stagnation was combined with sky-high inflation and interest rates, which were severely frustrating the United States' long-term federal public policy of promoting homeownership (which goes back to the National Housing Act of 1934).
