It emerged that the consent form issued to parents {{did not say that}} winter {{mountaineering}} was involved. Also, only one of the parents had been told the outing was going to be to the Cairngorms. The Inquiry reported that the deaths had been due to cold and exposure. It recommended (1) there should be special regard for fitness and training, (2) parents should be given fuller information about outdoor activities, (3) parties should be led by fully qualified instructors and accompanied by certified teachers, (4) suitable locations for summer and winter expeditions should be identified in consultation with mountaineering organisations, (5) experts should advise on whether high-level shelters should be removed, (6) the mountain rescue teams were praised and consideration should be given to supporting the teams financially and generally, (7) following any future disaster there should be closer <b>liaison</b> between <b>authorities</b> and parents. The jury did not want to discourage future adventurous outdoor activities. The advocate for the parents suggested that the overall leader of the expedition and the principal of Lagganlia should be found at fault but the Inquiry did not make any finding of fault.|$|R
30|$|Motocross is {{a popular}} sport both in the UK and worldwide, {{with the number of}} tournaments and racers {{doubling}} in the past 5  years [2, 3]. Children as young as 3 years old have participated in this activity. The recognised protective equipment includes kidney belts, neck braces, helmets, goggles, knee and elbow supports; however, despite these, there are still a high number of severe injuries as shown by our data. The injuries sustained in the paediatric population ranged from minor contusions and lacerations to severe life-threatening injuries. Motocross competitions can cause a significant burden on small local hospitals following large, competitive events despite safety measures taken at the venue. Such safety measures include on-site health and safety management, license applications, local <b>authority</b> <b>liaisons,</b> crowd management planning, fire safety management, crisis management planning, safe working practice documents, and pedestrian management solutions [4, 11].|$|R
40|$|CHDS State/LocalApproved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{problem of how}} preparedness and response organizations effectively elicit, develop, capture and disseminate organizational knowledge {{has been difficult to}} answer. Although techniques such as the after action review (AAR) have been practiced for over 40 years, not much is known about how it actually works at a theoretical level or if it still has viability in an increasingly complex world. Research also suggests that within many agencies, the AAR is not being practiced regularly and the lessons learned from the AARs being completed are not distributed or implemented effectively. An over-reliance on AARs and lessons learned might in fact be creating more harm than help. The complexity of modern day exercises and emergencies demands that responders be able not just to apply learning from past events but also to reflect, act, and learn in real time. Determining how to create the proper individual and organizational conditions for response professionals to make sense of and act upon the various learning opportunities inherent both during and after an event is crucial. Thinking of the problem within a larger emergency learning framework (ELF) and identifying learning as its own discrete organizational capability are recommended as potential solutions.

40|$|Healthcare {{services}} {{within the}} western economies are currently undergoing many fundamental changes. Growing demand within {{a context of}} economic constraint are creating a need for efficiency savings and tighter control of limited resources. Healthcare managers are invariably faced with organisations which are highly complex and interactive in nature. Increasingly they require the tools which {{will enable them to}} accurately assess and quantify the impact of possible changes. This paper describes a generalised simulation system aimed to address some of these needs. This has been developed in <b>liaison</b> with health <b>authorities</b> in West Yorkshire, UK. where a new hospital is currently planned. The simulation system is designed as a `shell' to support the development and use {{of a wide range of}} models rather than representing a bespoke solution to a specific issue. Developed in the Windows environment it utilises a Visual Basic graphical user interface linked to WITNESS simulation software. Key features are its ease of use, visual interaction and its flexibility, making it an accessible tool for direct use by healthcare managers. A sample case study is summarised which illustrates the use of the system to conduct `what-if' type experiments. The results are validated against real healthcare data and the potentials of the system are evaluated within the strategic management process...|$|R
40|$|As American {{health care}} {{undergoes}} great change, academic pathology is uniquely positioned to establish pathologists as {{key to the}} new health-care environment. Pathologists are {{at the forefront of}} major innovations in health care and are specialists who interact with all other medical specialists and essentially the entire range of health-care services. Academic pathologists benefit from being subspecialist experts who provide care to patients referred from large geographic areas, who can attain high academic stature over the course of their careers, and who serve as mentors for learners across virtually all medical specialties. Academic medical centers, in turn, have excellent credibility in the community, strong information technology infrastructure with the ability for data accrual and analysis not available in community health-care settings, and strong <b>liaisons</b> with civic <b>authorities</b> and policy makers. However, pathologists have to overcome their own tendencies toward modesty and lack of assertiveness, in order to help counter the significant trends in the health-care marketplace that disempower health-care providers and place health industry decision-making in the hands of nonmedical stakeholders. Specifically, academic pathologists need to proactively {{play a major role in}} institutional efforts to improve performance in quality, patient safety, efficiency, and coordinated care delivery and become leaders in the delivery of effective and efficient patient care. They need to play an essential role in utilization management, including molecular testing. They need to develop their value propositions for payers and seek to gain access to payers in order to represent these value statements. They should gain visibility directly to patients seeking expertise for second opinions and pursue opportunities for outreach programs in the community well beyond the academic medical center. Absent such efforts by academic pathologists, pathology is at risk of continued commoditization by nonpathologists, with weakening of the value proposition that pathology might bring forward...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of New Zealand {{planning}} history, planning {{can be seen in}} two forms. Informal planning describes planning-related activities already taking place before the establishment of formal town planning in the early 20 th century. Formal planning describes planning activities based on legislation, a developing body of knowledge, and a planning profession. Whether informal or formal, planning has been concerned with the arrangement and control of activities in space, with the objective of creating a better living environment. For Napier, a provincial centre, the influence of planning on the growth and development of the town is discussed in terms of four principal themes, covering the period from the birth of the town in the 1850 s until 1968. These themes are reclamation, reconstruction, suburban growth, and place promotion/civic improvement. Reclamation planning was important, given that the original town was almost totally surrounded by sea or swamp, with insufficient land for future expansion. A major earthquake in 1931 destroyed the business area of Napier, but helped solve the expansion problem by raising the level of land so that reclamation became easier or was now unnecessary. From the 1930 s to the 1960 s, new suburbs were planned and developed as single entities. Throughout its existence, the Napier Borough/City Council endeavoured to promote growth and improve town amenities. From about 1900, tourism became an increasing interest. The planning associated with each of these themes was largely informal, with the focus on project and development planning. This is not surprising, given that legislation creating the need for formal planning was not enacted until 1926. The informal planning undertaken involved <b>liaison</b> among public <b>authorities,</b> particularly the Council, the Harbour Board, and the neighbouring County Council. While the earthquake provided Napier with an opportunity to create a town that might have been fully planned under the new planning legislation, the Commissioners, who assumed control of Napier affairs for two years, opted to introduce a partial town planning scheme only. This set a precedent so that future town planning schemes were initially developed on a sectional basis, with the town not becoming fully covered until the 1960 s...|$|R
