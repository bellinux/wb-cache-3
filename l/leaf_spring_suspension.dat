5|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed from the}} prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The suspension {{was replaced by the}} superior vertical volute system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the pre-world-war-II period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.|$|E
25|$|In late 1962 Alan Turner, AC's chief {{engineer}} completed a major design {{change of the}} car's front end to accommodate {{rack and pinion steering}} while still using transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> The new car entered production in early 1963 and was designated Mark II. The steering rack was borrowed from the MGB while the new steering column came from the VW Beetle. About 528 Mark II Cobras were produced in the summer of 1965 (the last US-bound Mark II was produced in November 1964).|$|E
25|$|Sheffield 513 {{was built}} by Charles Roberts & Co. of Wakefield to a design by Sheffield Transport, {{as one of a}} batch of 35 double deck trams {{constructed}} between 1950-1952. Fitted with comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, it ran on a 4-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors with a pair of Crompton-West CT/TJ controllers (fitted in restoration). Braking systems feature air brakes acting on all wheels, with electric braking for emergency use. It only operated in Sheffield for eight years, as they abandoned their trams in 1960. It ran in the closing procession held on 8 October.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} for this series, number 501, was built at Queens Road works in August 1946. With comfortable upholstered seating for 62 passengers, {{it was the}} last car to be built at the works. From 1950 to 1952 35 more, numbered 502536, were constructed by Charles Roberts & Co. of Horbury near Wakefield. They were carried on a four-wheel Maley and Taunton hornless type 588 truck with rubber and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> powered by two Metrovick 101 DR3 65hp motors. Air brakes were fitted, acting on all wheels, and electric braking was available for emergency use. Car 536, which entered service on 11 April 1952, was the last tram to be constructed for Sheffield. Representing the ultimate development of the traditional British four-wheel tram, the class worked for only 10years, as Sheffield tramway closed in 1960. On 8 October of that year, car 513, ran specially decorated in the final procession; so too did sister tram 510, now preserved by the National Tramway Museum at Crich.|$|E
2500|$|The chassis was understandably substantial, with a {{conventional}} semi-elliptic <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> arrangement at the front. [...] At the rear the forward-facing Bugatti quarter-elliptics were supplemented {{by a second}} set facing to the rear.|$|E
2500|$|The M-30 had {{a modern}} split trail {{carriage}} with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and steel wheels with rubber tires. It was usually towed by vehicle without a limber. The carriage {{allowed for a}} towing speed of up to 50km/h on paved road and up to 35km/h on gravel or dirt roads, although the gun could also be moved {{by a team of}} six horses, in which case a limber was used. When the trails were swung open the suspension locked automatically [...] In an emergency it was possible to shoot in a [...] "single trail" [...] mode, at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1°30'). The time required to set the gun up for combat was about 1 [...] 1.5 minutes.|$|E
50|$|All models had <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>suspension.</b> The SD33 {{vehicles}} feature 24-volt electronics. Different trim {{options and}} colors were available, with options including vinyl or carpet floors and blue or brown interior trim. Air conditioning and power steering were available on deluxe models.|$|R
50|$|Many {{trucks are}} {{supported}} by <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions.</b> <b>Leaf</b> <b>springs</b> offer exceptional articulation, a large payload and can take {{a substantial amount of}} abuse. With the correct methods they can be modified to help a vehicle carry more weight, have better articulation or to fit large oversized tires. Some vehicles may be equipped with front and rear <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> or just rear <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with independent front suspension.|$|R

30|$|The chassis is a force-path subsystem. By {{comparing}} different classic automotive {{structures for}} technical feasibility and cost, a chassis frame is designed using swing arm and <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions</b> {{as shown in}} Figure  6 (c). The combination of the steering subsystem with the chassis is shown as Figure  6 (d) and 6 (e). The chassis links the steering system using interface E. The rotation is performed by the steering shaft and bearings.|$|R
50|$|The {{steerable}} front {{truck was}} fitted with twin duplex wheels (four tyres), the inner wheels equipped with pneumatic drum brakes. The duplex wheels rode on swinging wishbone axles with transverse semi-elliptical <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension.</b> A steering lock was included for use during rear towing.|$|E
50|$|The gun {{had split}} trail {{carriage}} {{adapted from the}} 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20). The carriage was fitted with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and metal wheels with pneumatic tires. The carriage also featured equlibrator. The shield gave the crew some protection from small arms and shell fragments.|$|E
50|$|Harry C. Stutz, {{who later}} formed a company bearing his name, {{designed}} {{the first car}} for the new enterprise. However, Stutz quickly left and Fred L. Tone took over as chief engineer in 1906. Tone re-designed the chassis (frame) below the axles and the semi-elliptic <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> system mounted above.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, Germany was {{restricted}} in military development by the Treaty of Versailles, however a secret program under the name cover [...] "Traktor" [...] was developing armoured military vehicles and artillery. Its engine was mounted inside the front portion of the hull and the turret was mounted above the fighting compartment {{in the rear of}} the tank. Both Rheinmetall and Krupp produced prototypes, and in 1928, Rheinmetall was awarded the order of 289 tanks. However, some time later, the order was cancelled. [...] Krupp models had coil <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions,</b> while Rheinmetall had <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{configuration of}} the Arena consists {{of a combination of}} independent MacPherson strut suspensions from a saloon car at the front, and torsion beam, <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>suspensions</b> at the rear. Other modifications include the use of a rigid rear axle, an uprated front stabiliser bar, and 14" [...] front ventilated discs and 9" [...] rear drum brakes with load sensing proportioning valves (LSPV), optimised weight distribution and the use of reinforced high profile tyres. Lotus Engineering provided additional ride and handling enhancements.|$|R
40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>springs</b> must be {{regarded}} as safety components of a vehicle which failures can cause severe accidents. They have to fulfill various functions as a spring element and for guiding the axles and are also responsible for driving comfort. Therefore, the durability approval {{must be carried out}} under representative service-like loading, which take into account complex leaf deformations in operational usage. In this paper the influencing parameters for the durability approval of <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspensions</b> are discussed and the test rig and the standardized test program SPRILOS (SPRIng LOad Sequence) for the durability approval are described...|$|R
50|$|All {{vehicles}} were built with space frames made from welded aircraft grade aluminum tube and ABS plastic bodies. They all had solid axles with <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> front and rear. Top speeds were about 30 mi/h km/h - 50 mi/h km/h, and range {{was up to}} 40 mi per charge.|$|E
50|$|M1910/34 {{combined}} {{a barrel}} of the M1910/30 with a carriage of the 122-mm gun M1931. The barrel was of built-up construction; it was equipped with interrupted screw breechblock and recoil system consisting of hydraulic buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. The split-trail carriage had <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> and wheels with solid rubber tires.|$|E
50|$|In June 1965, the Renault Super Goélette SG2 {{replaced}} the Goélette with new features: wide curved windscreen, {{replacement of the}} sheet metal dashboard, steering wheel shifter, front independent, variable flexibility suspension with coil springs (rear <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> in 1967), telescopic shock absorbers and high ground clearance. However, the gasoline engine was a Étendard type.|$|E
50|$|The {{ladder frame}} was retained, with the {{aluminum}} body supported by hoops. Lockheed twin-shoe disc brakes became standard, coupled to two master cylinders. The suspension was Fiat 500 transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> independent <b>suspension,</b> used at front and rear.|$|R
50|$|Early vehicles, {{like the}} Ford Model T, with its <b>leaf</b> <b>spring,</b> live axle <b>suspension</b> design, were both uncomfortable and handled poorly.|$|R
50|$|The {{tubular steel}} chassis was a short-wheelbase {{version of the}} 1800 saloon, {{featuring}} transverse <b>leaf</b> <b>sprung</b> independent <b>suspension</b> at the front and a live axle with semi-elliptic springs at the rear. The rear track was wider than the front by some 4 inches. Brakes were hydraulic.|$|R
50|$|A further {{development}} of the Panzer IV series also by Krupp. It used <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> the HL 116 engine and the motor compartment of the VK 20.01(III). Maximum speed was to be 42 km/h, {{same as it was}} on the Panzer IV Ausf. C. This was later redesignated as the VK 20.01(BW) and then as the B.W.40.|$|E
50|$|King Kong and Bear Foot each {{followed}} Bigfoot to 66 in tires, {{and soon}} other monster trucks, such as King Krunch, Maddog, and Virginia Giant were being constructed. These early trucks were built off of stock chassis which were heavily reinforced, used <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension,</b> a stock body, and heavy military axles {{to support the}} tires.|$|E
5000|$|The first vehicle {{built by}} the {{automotive}} division of Fuji Heavy Industries was called the Subaru 1500, with the development code-name of P1. The prototype used a monocoque body structure and adopting the [...] "ponton" [...] style appearance, with an independent front wishbone suspension and a rear <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> <b>suspension</b> with three plates and a live rear axle.|$|E
50|$|The XJ uses a <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> Each <b>leaf</b> pack {{contains}} four <b>leaf</b> <b>springs</b> with a {{fixed eye}} {{at the front}} of the spring and a compression-style shackle at the rear of the spring. Two gas-charged shock absorbers are also used, along with a mild anti-sway/anti-roll bar. The suspension used on vehicles with the optional UpCountry package did not employ the rear anti-sway/anti-roll bar and provided one inch of lift over the standard suspension.|$|R
50|$|The FK36(r) and Pak 36(r) {{both had}} a split-trail carriage, with a {{transverse}} <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> axle <b>suspension,</b> and steel wheels, with foam rubber filled tires. The guns were {{equipped with a}} semi-automatic vertical breech block; the recoil mechanism consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydropneumatic recuperator. There was no limber; therefore the gun could not be towed by a horse team.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} main {{frames are}} constructed from welded steel; {{there are two}} longitudinal support beams and several transverse members (example: Windhoff intermediate cars). The driving vehicle bogies have rubber primary suspension. The Windhoff unpowered vehicles use <b>leaf</b> <b>spring</b> primary <b>suspension.</b> the Talbot vehicles use rubber. All train axles have disc brakes. The vehicles are within the EBO G2 structure gauge.|$|R
