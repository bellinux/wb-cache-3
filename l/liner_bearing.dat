40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis {{concentrates}} {{on the study of}} hybrid gas journal bearings (bearings with externally pressurized mass addition). It differs from most work in that it goes back to “basics” to explore the hydrodynamic phenomena in the bearing gap. The thesis compares geometrically identical bearings with 2 configurations of external pressurization, porous liners where mass-addition compensation is varied by varying the liner’s permeability, and bushings with 2 rows of 6 feedholes where the mass-addition compensation is varied by the feedhole diameter. Experimentally, prototype bearings with mass-addition compensation that spans 2 orders of magnitude with differing clearances are built and their aerostatic properties and mass addition characteristics are thoroughly tested. The fundamental equations for compressible, laminar, Poiseuille flow are used to suggest how the mass flow “compensation” should be mathematically modeled. This is back-checked against the experimental mass flow measurements and is used to determine a mass-addition compensation parameter (called Kmeas) for each prototype bushing. In so doing, the methodology of modeling and measuring the mass addition in a hybrid gas bearing is re-examined and an innovative, practical, and simple method is found that makes it possible to make an “apples-to-apples” comparison between different configurations of external pressurization. This mass addition model is used in conjunction with the Reynolds equation to perform theory-based numerical analysis of virtual hybrid gas journal bearings (CFD experiments). The first CFD experiments performed use virtual bearings modeled to be identical to the experimental prototypes and replicate the experimental work. The results are compared and the CFD model is validated. The ontological significance of appropriate dimensionless similitude parameters is re-examined and a, previously lacking, complete set of similitude factors is found for hybrid bearings. A new practical method is developed to study in unprecedented detail the aerostatic component of the hybrid bearings. It is used to definitively compare the feedhole bearings to the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings.</b> The hydrostatic bearing efficiency (HBE) is defined and it is determined that the maximum achievable hydrostatic bearing efficiency (MAHBE) is determined solely by the bearing’s mass addition configuration. The MAHBE of the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined to be over 5 times that of the feedhole bearings. The method also presents a means to tune the Kmeas to the clearance to achieve the MAHBE as well as giving a complete mapping of the hitherto misunderstood complex shapes of aerostatic load versus radial deflection curves. This method also rediscovers the obscure phenomenon of static instability which is called in this thesis the “near surface effect” and appears to be the first work to present a practical method to predict the range of static instability and quantify its resultant stiffness fall-off. It determines that porous <b>liner</b> type <b>bearings</b> are not subject to the phenomenon which appears for feedhole type bearings when the clearance exceeds a critical value relative to its mass-addition compensation. The standing pressure waves of hydrostatic and hybrid bearings with the 2 configurations of external pressurization as well as a geometrically identical hydrodynamic bearing are studied in detail under the methodology of the “CFD microscope”. This method is used to characterize and identify the development, growth, and movement of the pressure wave extrema with increased hydrodynamic action (either increasing speed or increasing eccentricity). This method is also used to determine the “cause” of the “near surface effect”. A gedanken experiment is performed based on these results which indicates that a bearing with a “stronger aerostatic strength” component should be more stable than one with a low aerostatic strength component. Numerical instability “speed limits” are found that are also related to the hydrostatic strength of the bearing. The local conditions in the standing waves are characterized in terms of their local Mach number, Knudsen number, Reynolds number, and Taylor Number. It is concluded that low eccentricity bearing whirl {{can be attributed to the}} off load-line orientation of the bearing load force caused by the overlay of the hydrodynamic bearing standing wave onto the hydrostatic bearing wave of the hybrid bearing, whereas it is hypothesized that aperiodic and random self-excited vibration which occurs at high eccentricity, as reported in the literature, is probably due to shock waves, turbulence, near surface effect, and slip at local areas of the standing wave...|$|R

A cylinder-on-flat oscillating wear test bench developed within Cardiff University allowed for the gathering of physical data including temperature and Acoustic Emission (AE) signals during an accelerated wear test of the liner material. A radial load of 2. 5 kN and oscillation frequency of 5 Hz were applied to replicate typical operating conditions within a pitch control system. Frequency analysis techniques were carried out on the AE data, successfully identifying the transition from healthy contact into the failure region...|$|R
40|$|Alloys of Al-Sn and Al-Si {{are widely}} used in {{tribological}} applications such as cylinder <b>liners</b> and journal <b>bearings.</b> Studies {{of the influence of}} the as-cast microstructures of these alloys on the final mechanical properties and wear resistance can be very useful for planning solidification conditions in order to permit a desired level of final properties to be achieved. The aim {{of the present study was}} to contribute to a better understanding about the relationship between the scale of the dendritic network and the corresponding mechanical properties and wear behavior. The Al-Sn (15 and 20 wt pct Sn) and Al-Si (3 and 5 wt pct Si) alloys were directionally solidified under unsteady-state heat flow conditions in water-cooled molds in order to permit samples with a wide range of dendritic spacings to be obtained. These samples were subjected to tensile and wear tests, and experimental quantitative expressions correlating the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), yield tensile strength, elongation, and wear volume to the primary dendritic arm spacing (DAS) have been determined. The wear resistance was shown to be significantly affected by the scale of primary dendrite arm spacing. For Al-Si alloys, the refinement of the dendritic array improved the wear resistance, while for the Al-Sn alloys, an opposite effect was observed, i. e., the increase in primary dendrite arm spacing improved the wear resistance. The effect of inverse segregation, which is observed for Al-Sn alloys, on the wear resistance is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, <b>bearings</b> with compliant <b>liners</b> may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant <b>liner</b> on <b>bearing</b> surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, radial clearance, pivot offset, and pad inclination angles. Influence of the elastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting pad journal bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant bearings compared to white metal bearings. Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE. Oil film thickness, oil film temperature and loads on tilting pad journal bearing were measured on 10 MW Kaplan hydroelectric power machine. Test results were compared to FEM model. It was shown that stiffness of the supporting structure may be more important to machine performance than the stiffness of the bearing alone. QC 20150409 Swedish Hydropower Centr...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigation}} on wheel wear losses from bogie rotation resistance have only considered as designed curve operations [1, 2], {{with a small}} cant deficiency present in the curve design. Results in such curves show a relatively small increase in overall wheel and rail wear due to bogie rotation resistance. The bulk of increased wheel/rail wear is caused by rotation friction moments at the centre bearing, which are generated in the curve transition, being retained into the constant radius curve. Cant Deficient design curves are shown to not retain the full rotational friction moment that is generated in curve transitions. The wear losses on individual wheelsets is shown to be greatly affected by bogie rotation resistance even when the total wheel rail wear for the wagon is not greatly altered. The wheel/rail wear is best described by classifying curves {{by the number of}} wheelsets in flange contact with the high rail. The Queensland coal operations have proportionally much higher wear rate increases attributed to bogie rotation friction. Large reductions of wheel wear have been anecdotally report by QR rollingstock maintenance staff following the introduction of lubricating polymer centre <b>bearing</b> <b>liners.</b> Case study simulations show that the track’s dominant tight curve is very sensitive to high centre bearing friction. The curves occur on a 1 : 50 grade for which loaded traffic is downhill at 40 kph compared to the empty traffic climbing at the speed limit of 60 kph. Hence these dominant downhill curves have a cant excess. Bogie rotation friction management is shown to be particularly important on rollingstock with low warp stiffness that operate through tighter curves at lower than the cant design speed. Such rollingstock will exhibit significantly shortened wheel maintenance cycle times due to high bogie rotation friction retained into the curve and high wheelset angles of attack seen on the leading bogie. Wear rates can become further accelerated due to the negative impact high angles of attack have on gauge face lubrication. Bogie warp and wheelset angles of attack retained in constant radius curves are affected by lateral forces such as coupler angling train forces...|$|R
40|$|The most {{sensitive}} {{component in the}} propulsion shafting system is the aft stern tube bearing, which is exposed to heavy static and dynamic propeller loads exerted to the bearing surface by the propeller shaft. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb, and the American Bureau of Shipping intend {{to work on the}} development of the theoretical model of the stern tube journal bearing behaviour, which is proposed to be done in several stages. The initial stage is to consider nonlinear fl uid structural interaction, and this is the theory shown in this article. Owing to the fact that the shaft journal in operation lies on a lubricating fl uid fi lm, which separates the journal in the bearing from the <b>bearing</b> <b>liner,</b> the theoretical nonlinear model of the journal bearing may provide more insight in the behaviour of the shaft inside the bearing and help us to determine a more realistic elastic line of the shafting. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) initiated a research project to measure actual interaction between the shaft and the stern tube bearing with the goal of applying obtained knowledge in development of an accurate analytical/numerical model for shaftbearing analysis. The initial focus of the investigation was to capture the transient operation of the shaft inside the bearing and to observe the shaft’s hydrodynamic lift during starting, stopping and reversing of the engine. Proximity probes were used to monitor the shaft bearing interaction with micron precision. The installed probes measure the distance between the shaft and the bearing at eight locations inside the aft stern bush and at four locations inside the forward stern bush, and utilize obtained data to defi ne the shaft orbit and dynamics as it revolves in the bearing. The results of presented measurements show that the shaft behaviour inside the stern bush is very different depending on the locati inside the bush. Therefore, an analytical approach, which uses a simplifi ed theory of shaft bearing interaction, provides no practical value since it neglects shaft dynamics and interaction between fl uid and the structure...|$|R
