Leonardo da Vinci mentions natural camera obscura that are formed by dark caves {{on the edge of a}} sunlit valley. A hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed,</b> upside down image on a piece of paper. So the birth of photography was primarily concerned with inventing means to capture and keep the image produced by the camera obscura.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} this prism is the roof {{pentaprism}} which {{is commonly used}} in the viewfinder of single-lens reflex cameras. The camera lens renders an image that is both vertically and <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed,</b> and the reflex mirror re-inverts it leaving an image <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed.</b> In this case, the image needs to be reflected left-to-right as the prism transmits the image formed on the camera's focusing screen. This lateral inversion is done by replacing one of the reflective faces of a normal pentaprism with a [...] "roof" [...] section, with two additional surfaces angled towards each other and meeting at 90째, which laterally reverses the image back to normal. Reflex cameras with waist-level finders (viewed from above), including many medium format cameras, display a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> image directly from the focusing screen which is viewed from above.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{earliest}} reliably dated {{photograph of}} people, taken by Daguerre one spring morning in 1838 {{from the window}} of the Diorama, where he lived and worked. It bears the caption huit heure du matin (8 a.m.). Though it shows the busy Boulevard du Temple, the long exposure time (about ten or twelve minutes) meant that moving traffic cannot be seen; however, the bootblack and his customer at lower left remained still long enough to be distinctly visible. The building signage at the upper left shows that the image is <b>laterally</b> (left-right) <b>reversed,</b> as were most daguerreotypes. Daguerre presented this daguerreotype together with two others: a still-life and a view from the same window labelled midi (noon) to King Ludwig I of Bavaria (The Munich Triptych) in order to publicise his invention. All three daguerreotypes were destroyed by cleaning in 1974 but they are preserved in reproduction.|$|R
50|$|A pentamirror is {{an optical}} device {{used in the}} {{viewfinder}} systems of various single-lens reflex cameras instead of the pentaprism. It is used to reverse again the <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> image coming from the reflex mirror.|$|E
5000|$|Writers {{of stories}} in {{magazines}} used the hyperspace concept in various ways. In The Mystery of Element 117 (1949) by Milton Smith, a window is opened {{into a new}} [...] "hyperplane of hyperspace" [...] containing those who have already died on earth. In Arthur C. Clarke's Technical Error (1950), a man is <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> by a brief accidental encounter with [...] "hyperspace".|$|E
5000|$|Jan van Haelbeck {{worked on}} many {{publication}} projects. Some {{of these were}} original creations. Others were re-engravings of popular works published earlier. An example of the latter is the publication [...] published by Jean Leclerc IV in Paris in the early 1600s. This publication was a reworking in <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> format of a 1585 Jesuit publication, which comprised 32 prints engraved by Giovanni Battista de'Cavalieri depicting in graphic detail the martyrdoms of various saints.|$|E

50|$|While the 35 mm SLR camera {{had already}} {{appeared}} before the war, its major disadvantage was the waist-level finder which gave a <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> image, taking away the immediacy between the photographer and his subject. In the Contax reflex, {{to be called the}} Contax S, a pentaprism was positioned directly above the focusing screen, which offered an eye-level, unreversed view of the viewfinder. This major technical advantage was critical in establishing the 35 mm SLR as the definitive camera type for the decades that followed.|$|E
5000|$|Through the Viewfinder {{photography}} (TtV) is {{a photographic}} or videographic technique {{in which a}} photograph or video or motion picture film is shot with one camera through the viewfinder of a second camera. The viewfinder thus acts {{as a kind of}} lens filter. [...] The most popular method involves using a digital camera as the image taking camera and an intact twin-lens reflex camera (TLR) or pseudo-TLR as the [...] "viewfinder" [...] camera. [...] TLRs typically have square waist-level viewfinders, with the viewfinder plane at 90 degrees to the image plane. The image in a TLR viewfinder is <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed,</b> i.e. it is a mirror image.Most photographers use a cardboard tube or similar 'contraption' to connect the two cameras. This serves to eliminate stray light and prevent reflections appearing on the viewfinder glass or on the lens of the imaging camera.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the collapsible finder hood is to shield the focusing screen from outside stray light, but by lowering the hinged magnifying glass into the finder for critical focusing, it also becomes a direct vision frame finder. By looking into the rectangular opening {{at the back of}} the hood, it provides the field of view of a 50mm lens, a useful feature since the focusing screen image is <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed,</b> which makes it less useful as an action finder. Pushing a small notch to the side at the lover right on the rear finder hood panel, flips the lowered magnifying glass up and away. The finder panels are stowed away one by one, sides first, and covered by the front lid, which is held down by a hook at the back. The hook is furnished with a release button to erect the hood. A small sector lever close to the shutter dial, with R and V engraved next to it in the top plate, controls the film transportation, R for rewind and V for advance, for R체ckw채rts and Vorw채rts in German. A knob on the left-hand edge of the body slides downwards to release the back, which is not hinged, only hooked onto the right-hand edge just before closing by a firm pressure on the left-hand back.|$|E

40|$|<b>Laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> (mirrored) {{fingerprints}} {{are difficult}} to detect by applying routine search procedures. One suggestion to avoid errors when dealing with probable reversals is to perform comparisons with both direct and reversed fingerprints. This simple procedure has been applied {{and led to the}} detection of two more cases of reversed fingerprint usage in fake documents. In one of the reported cases, experts found on the web the same fingerprints used by criminals in fake documents. This finding is important because it indicates that matched fingerprints do not necessarily link different criminal cases...|$|E
40|$|Ants have a {{well-developed}} olfactory system, and pheromone {{communication is}} essential for regulating social life within their colonies. We compared the organization of primary olfactory centers (antennal lobes, ALs) in the brain of two closely related species of leaf-cutting ants (Atta vollenweideri, Atta sexdens). Both species express a striking size polymorphism associated with polyethism. We discovered that the ALs of large workers contain a substantially enlarged glomerulus (macroglomerulus, MG) {{at the entrance of}} the antennal nerve. This is the first description of anMG in non-sexual individuals of an insect. The location of the MG is <b>laterally</b> <b>reversed</b> in the two species, and workers of different size express a disproportional allometry of glomerular vol-umes. While ALs of large workers contain an MG, glomeruli in small workers are all similar in size. We further compared electro-antennogram (EAG) responses to two common trail pheromone components of leaf-cutting ants: 4 -methylpyrrol- 2 -carboxylate and 2 -ethyl- 3, 6 -dimethylpyrazine. At high concentrations the ratio of the EAG signals to 2 -ethyl- 3, 6 -dimethylpyrazine versus 4 -methylpyrrol- 2 -carboxylate was significantly smaller in A. vollenweideri compared with the ratio of EAG signals to the same two components in A. sexdens. The differences in EAG signals and the species specific MG location in large workers provide correlative evidence that the MG may be involved in the detection of the trail pheromone.
