25|$|An OLED display works {{without a}} backlight; thus, it can display deep black levels {{and can be}} thinner and lighter than a <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD).

In 1964, George H. Heilmeier invented the dynamic scattering mode found in liquid crystal displays, wherein an electrical charge is applied which rearranges the molecules so that they scatter light.|$|E

25|$|A more {{successful}} series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD {{was launched in}} 1972 by Sharp Inc with the Sharp EL-805, which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's Calculator On Substrate (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> {{was used as a}} substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.|$|E
25|$|The C4 Corvette {{was known}} for its evolved, sleek and modern look.

The C4 fastback coupe was the first general production Corvette to have a glass hatchback (the limited edition 1982 Collector Edition being the first Corvette equipped with this feature) for better storage access. The Corvette C4 came standard with an electronic dashboard with a digital <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> dash, with graphics for speed and RPM and digital displays for other important engine functions.|$|E
25|$|One common {{application}} of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode ray tube (CRT), <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD), plasma display, or {{organic light emitting diode}} (OLED) display such as a television, a computer’s monitor, or a large scale screen. Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources. At common viewing distance, the separate sources are indistinguishable, which tricks the eye to see a given solid color. All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image.|$|E

25|$|Liquid {{crystals}} made of rod-like molecules {{had been}} discovered in 1888, and many compounds had been synthesized at Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany in the 1920s and 30s. Some physical studies had been undertaken by the German and Russian schools during that era, but the subject later languished till the mid-fifties. Starting in the late fifties, the systematic synthetic effort by George William Gray in the UK and the physical studies by Wilhelm Maier in Germany (including the well-known Maier–Saupe or MS theory) started {{a revival of the}} subject. Chandrasekhar and his co-workers made contributions to the application of the dynamical theory of reflections to study the fascinating optical properties of cholesteric liquid crystals which have a helical structure with a pitch which is usually ~ 0.5mm, and to the extensions of the molecular theory of nematic liquid crystals beyond the MS model. Chandrasekhar was invited to establish a liquid crystal laboratory in RRI after the Department of Science and Technology started supporting it in 1971. The move had a highly positive impact on his productivity. Along with a couple of former students who moved with him to RRI, in a short time, he developed a laboratory with all the essential facilities needed for research in the chosen area. Realizing that cutting-edge research would not be possible without an in-house capacity to produce new materials, a synthetic organic chemistry laboratory was set up. Soon many new experimental and a few theoretical results emerged and the Liquid Crystal Laboratory at RRI became one of the leading centres of research in the world. The twisted nematic <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> was invented in Europe in 1971 and recently, LCDs have displaced CRTs as commercially the most important displays. In cooperation with Chandrasekhar and his colleagues, the Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore, developed indigenous know-how for the manufacture of simple LCDs for the domestic market.|$|E
500|$|The iPad's {{touchscreen}} {{display is}} a 1,024 by 768 pixel, [...] <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (diagonal [...] ), with fingerprint- and scratch-resistant glass. As {{a result of}} the device's screen dimensions and resolution, the screen has a pixel density of 132ppi. The display responds to other sensors: an ambient light sensor to adjust screen brightness and a 3-axis accelerometer to sense the iPad's orientation and switch between portrait and landscape modes. Unlike the iPhone and iPod Touch's built-in applications, which work in three orientations (portrait, landscape-left and landscape-right), the iPad's built-in applications support screen rotation in all four orientations, including upside-down. Consequently, the device has no intrinsic [...] "native" [...] orientation; only the relative position of the home button changes.|$|E

Its CPU and overall speed closely resembled those of its predecessor, the Macintosh Portable. It had a Motorola 68000 16-megahertz (MHz) processor, 2-8megabytes (MB) of memory, a [...] monochrome backlit <b>liquid</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>display</b> (LCD) with 640400pixel resolution, and the System 7.0.1 operating system. It did not have a built-in floppy disk drive and was noted for its unique compact design that placed a trackball pointing device in front of the keyboard for ease of use.|$|E
