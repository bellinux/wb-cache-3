50|$|Mangifera indica, {{commonly}} known as mango, is a species of flowering plant in the sumac and poison ivy family Anacardiaceae. It {{is found in the}} wild in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan where it is indigenous and cultivated varieties have been introduced to other warm regions of the world. It is a <b>large</b> <b>fruit-tree,</b> capable of a growing to a height and crown width of about 100 feet and trunk circumference of more than twelve feet. The species appears to have been domesticated in India at around 2000 BC. The species was brought to East Asia around 400-500 BCE from India; next, in the 15th century to the Philippines; and then, in the 16th century to Africa and Brazil by the Portuguese. The species was described for science by Linnaeus in 1753.|$|R
40|$|A sharp {{increase}} in 2005 of pp'DDT and its metabolites was observed in mussels and fish from lakes Como and Iseo, the main glacier-fed southern Alpine lakes. DDTs in zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) were more than 150 times higher than levels in 2003, and concentrations in pelagic fish (0. 12 mg kg(- 1) w. w.) exceeded the Italian safety threshold for human consumption (0. 05 mg kg(- 1) w. w.). The histological examination of the ovaries revealed many mussels with oocyte degeneration throughout the studied period. Prior to being banned in Italy in 1978, DDT was used in <b>large</b> amounts for <b>fruit-tree</b> treatment from the 1950 s to 1970 s in valleys just below the glaciers. Since glacier volume was increasing {{at that time and}} then continuously retreated, meltwater should be the main cause of the pollution peak recently observed in biota of downstream lakes. PCBs did not peak in biota tissues to a comparable extent probably because local sources were not as important as for DDTs...|$|R
