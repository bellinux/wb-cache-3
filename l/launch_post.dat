5|$|In Angry Birds, {{the player}} {{controls}} {{a flock of}} multi-colored birds that are attempting to retrieve their eggs, which have been stolen {{by a group of}} hungry green pigs. In each stage of the gameplay, enemy pigs are sheltered by structures made of various materials such as wood, glass, and stone resembling children's toy building blocks. The objective of the game is to eliminate all the pigs on the level. Using a slingshot, players launch a limited set of birds with the goal of either striking the enemy pigs directly or damaging their surrounding structures, causing the blocks to collapse and squash the pigs. The player must set the angle and force of the bird's travel by pulling back on the slingshot (using intuitive touch-controls in the mobile versions). The launch process is quick and casual, with no visible trajectory data, and a player simply selects a point in the X-Y field behind the <b>launch</b> <b>post</b> from which the virtual slingshot will be released. In various stages of the game, additional objects such as TNT crates and rocks are incorporated into the structures, and power-ups may be used to enhance the birds to attack hard-to-reach pigs.|$|E
50|$|The {{shape of}} the Al-Shamal Stadium {{is derived from the}} {{traditional}} dhow, the local fishing boats commonly used in Arab States of the Persian Gulf, and appears from afar as a boat on the shore waiting to <b>launch.</b> <b>Post</b> FIFA World Cup, the modular upper tier of the stadium will be disassembled for shipment to developing countries.|$|E
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of both SACLOS guidance systems in an anti-tank role is that working on angular differences evaluation, {{it does not}} allow any notable separation between guidance system and missile <b>launch</b> <b>post</b> the opposite of MCLOS ones, thus allowing updated version of such anti-tank weapons (notably AT-3 Malyutka) to still remain in service in some countries.|$|E
50|$|The missile {{is fired}} from the 9P151 <b>launching</b> <b>post,</b> which has a simple tripod for support. It can also be {{fired from the}} {{shoulder}} - but this apparently requires more skill {{on the part of}} the operator. The <b>launching</b> <b>post</b> weighs 10.2 kg. The missile is launched from the tube by a booster rather than the gas generator used on the 9K111 Fagot system, despite both missiles being designed by the same design bureau. The 9S816 guidance system is powered by a thermal battery attached to the launch tube shortly before launch - the missile itself is remotely powered along the guidance wires.|$|R

50|$|In Russian service, the Metis is {{deployed}} {{with motor}} rifle companies, with three launchers per company. The missile is {{operated by a}} two-man team; the gunner carries the 9P151 <b>launching</b> <b>post</b> and one missile, his assistant carries an additional three missiles.|$|R
50|$|The Eryx missile uses a SACLOS {{guidance}} system, the launcher tracks a {{light source}} {{on the rear}} of the missile and compares its position with the center of the launcher's cross-hair, sending corrective signals down a trailing control wire. The missile increases resistance to jamming by having a beacon as the light source on {{the rear of the}} missile that pulsates or blinks at a special encoded rate recognized by the Eryx's tracking device located on the <b>launch</b> <b>post.</b> Unlike most wire guides antitank missiles that use SACLOS guidance, which require a complex optical tracker unit that has to zoom from a wide to narrow view in micro seconds after the missile is launched (e.g. the MILAN), the Eryx uses one charge-coupled device (CCD) matrix that operate in the IR spectrum, and two fields of view (one narrow and one large) with an automatic switch during missile flight. Again Aérospatiale also states that this unique and simplified SACLOS tracking system provides for a far more cost effective solution and enable the Eryx to be highly resistant to decoys or jamming and other enemy counter measures.|$|E

40|$|The Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory (EChO) is a space mission {{dedicated}} to undertaking spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets over the widest wavelength range possible. It is based around a highly stable space platform with a 1. 2 m class telescope. The mission {{is currently being}} studied by ESA {{in the context of}} a medium class mission within the Cosmic Vision programme for <b>launch</b> <b>post</b> 2020. The payload suite is required to provide simultaneous coverage from the visible to the mid-infrared and must be highly stable and effectively operate as a single instrument. In this paper we describe the integrated spectrometer payload design for EChO which will cover the 0. 4 to 16 micron wavelength band. The instrumentation is subdivided into 5 channels (Visible/Near Infrared, Short Wave InfraRed, 2 x Mid Wave InfraRed; Long Wave InfraRed) with a common set of optics spectrally dividing the input beam via dichroics. We discuss the significant design issues for the payload and the detailed technical trade-offs that we are undertaking to produce a payload for EChO that can be built within the mission and programme constraints and yet which will meet the exacting scientific performance required to undertake transit spectroscopy...|$|E

50|$|Chilkoot Lake is {{considered}} a good water body for safe and peaceful kayaking, particularly for beginners in paddle kayaking (for learning the basic skills). The kayak <b>launching</b> <b>post</b> is the State Park {{at the southern end}} of the lake where facilities available are a ramp, floating dock, free parking grounds, picnic shelters and rest rooms. Kayaking offers good sights of wild life such as bald eagles and salmon spawning. Kayaking trip around the lake takes about 5 hours. Even though a USGS map is available as guide for kayakers, the small lake does not require any help of a map for navigation. The main security precaution to be observed by kayakers is not disturb the bears, which may be seen hunting for fish on the shore line.|$|R
