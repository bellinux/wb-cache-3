2500|$|Most {{computer}} keyboards {{are designed to}} send scancodes to the operating system, rather than directly sending characters. From there, the series of scancodes is converted into a character stream by keyboard <b>layout</b> <b>software.</b> [...] This allows a physical keyboard to be dynamically mapped to any number of layouts without switching hardware components – merely by changing the software that interprets the keystrokes. It is usually possible for an advanced user to change keyboard operation, and third-party software is available to modify or extend keyboard functionality.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, InPage Urdu, {{which is}} a fully {{functional}} page <b>layout</b> <b>software</b> for Windows akin to Quark XPress, was developed for Pakistan's newspaper industry. This was done by an Indian [...] software company – Concept Software Pvt Ltd – led by Rarendra Pratap Singh and Vijay Krishan Gupta, with the input and help of Firoz Hashmi expert in calligraphy & Urdu Language and a UK company called Multilingual Solutions (Limited) led by Kamran Rouhi. In this version 40 other non- fonts which were created by Syed Manzar Hasan Zaidi. They licensed and improved the Noori Nastaliq font from Monotype at that time. This font, with its vast ligature base of over 20,000, is still used in current versions of the software for Windows. As of 2009 InPage has become Unicode based, supporting more languages, and the Faiz Lahori Nastaliq font with Kasheeda developed by Syed Manzar Hasan Zaidi, Axis SoftMedia Pvt. Ltd., {{has been added to}} it along with compatibility with OpenType Unicode fonts. Nastaliq Kashish has been made {{for the first time in}} the history of [...] Typography.|$|E

40|$|Clustering <b>layouts</b> of <b>software</b> systems combine two {{important}} aspects: they reveal groups of related artifacts {{of the software}} system, and they produce a visualization of the results that is easy to understand. Co-change visualization is a lightweight method for computing clustering <b>layouts</b> of <b>software</b> systems for which the change history is available. This paper describes CCVISU, a tool that implements cochange visualization. It extracts the co-change graph from a version repository, and computes a layout, which positions the artifacts of the software system in a two- or threedimensional space. Two artifacts are positioned closed together in the layout if they were often changed together. The tool is designed as a framework, easy to use, and easy to integrate into reengineering environments; several formats for data interchange are already implemented. The graph layout is currently provided in VRML and SVG format, in a standard text format, or directly drawn on the screen...|$|R
