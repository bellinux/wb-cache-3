500|$|The {{song was}} mixed by Bruce Swedien times—unusual for Swedien, who usually mixed a song just once. Jones had told Swedien {{to create a}} drum sound {{that no one had}} ever heard before. The audio {{engineer}} was also told to add a different element: [...] "sonic personality". [...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special <b>little</b> <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The bottom line is that there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is." [...] He concluded, [...] "But I think that is the case with 'Billie Jean'—and that I attribute to sonic personality." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Dragon Quest, Horii play-tests {{the games}} {{to make certain}} the controls feel right. This includes going into meticulous details such as how fast a page opens or the way a door opens. According to Horii, [...] "... <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> here and there the controls not feeling right and such can really grate the players' nerves if the tempo isn't right." [...] He believes players {{should be able to}} control the game unconsciously, which is not easy to accomplish. Horii tries to design the games {{in such a way that}} players never need to read a manual nor play through a tutorial in order to figure out how to play the game, and tries to create good storylines with short dialogues. Ryutaro Ichimura, who has worked on Dragon Quest titles with Horii since Dragon QuestVIII, has implemented Horii's suggestions even when it is not obvious why his ideas will work. [...] " [...] lot of the time when he [...] points these things out, we cannot see them at first, but eventually you get it." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented {{on the structure of}} the series' first season. [...] "I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [...] go back and see all of the <b>little</b> <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up." [...] When asked if the House [...] "pulled" [...] the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, [...] "I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh." ...|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode [...] "was able to rise a few notches above the last one" [...] {{and that he}} enjoyed Leslie's antics and many of Tom's antics, {{including}} his suggestions for Leslie's introduction for her mom. He also liked the scene in which Mark pinched Leslie's nose, which he described as [...] "a nice, playful scene that brought some much needed humanity to her cartoonish character". Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode, particularly the characters Tom and Ann. He said of the episode, [...] "The <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> (Leslie's haircut and Ann overdressing) are what's making this show work a little more with each episode. Finding humor in the small things of small government." [...] Brian Howard of The Journal News said the series is not great yet, but that [...] "The Banquet" [...] included glimpses of possible greatness in the future, particularly in the performances by Poehler, Jones, Ansari and Schneider. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the laughs in the episode, particularly involving Leslie's haircut and her perceived romantic relationship with Ann, were [...] "a bit thin". Phipps also said he found himself disliking Leslie, of whom he said, [...] "Here she seems more stupid than pleasantly naïve." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the funeral}} service, her {{daughter}} Luci Baines Johnson gave a eulogy, saying, [...] "A {{few weeks before}} Mother died, I was taking visiting relatives to the extraordinary Blanton Art Museum...Mother was on IV antibiotics, a feeding tube, and oxygen, but she wasn't gonna let <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that deter her from discovering another great art museum. What a picture we were -literally rolling through the museum like a mobile hospital." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Stoics, Epicureans showed little interest in participating {{in the politics of}} the day, since doing so leads to trouble. He instead advocated seclusion. This principle is epitomised by the phrase lathe biōsas (...) , meaning [...] "live in obscurity", [...] "get through life without drawing attention to yourself", i.e., live [...] without pursuing glory or wealth or power, but anonymously, enjoying <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> food, the company of friends, etc. Plutarch elaborated on this theme in his essay Is the Saying [...] "Live in Obscurity" [...] Right?

2500|$|On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci {{said that}} Dream Theater were already [...] "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just {{start to get}} planted. One {{of the great things}} about this career is that you have the {{opportunity}} every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to writer-producer Martin Gero, Beckett was set {{to appear}} in {{only a handful of}} episodes after the Stargate Atlantis pilot episode, [...] "Rising", but the {{character}} had such a big connection to the fans that Gero labeled McGillion the [...] "breakout star" [...] in Stargate Atlantis. The producers decided to give Beckett a larger role and made him a recurring character with a total of fifteen episode appearances in the first season, followed by a regular in season two. Although McGillion was born in Scotland, he only put on a Scottish accent during filming. McGillion {{said in an interview with}} The Sci-Fi World, [...] "We improv a lot after the scene's over, and sometimes they'll keep some of the material and sometimes they won't. I'll often throw in <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> 'Ya cheeky little bugger'." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they <b>little</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ... Once Jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music—just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another." ...|$|E
