The end of Lawrence's drawing career sparked his interest in other forms of art. Inspired by his father's classic black <b>light</b> <b>screen</b> printing shop, Lawrence began to experiment in abstract black light art. This led him to discover a new method of traditional paper marbling, which he began to market with paintings on clothing items, such as shirts, hats, and shoes.

50|$|The Japanese {{success in}} sinking or {{damaging}} {{almost all the}} US Pacific Fleet's battleships at Pearl Harbor forced the Americans to base their tactics on the aircraft carrier (though they would possibly have developed such tactics anyway). The Americans quickly assembled a group of task forces, each based around a single carrier. Through a series of raids on Japanese-held islands, the American gradually grew more confident in their handling of aircraft carriers, learning that the right place for the task force commander was aboard a carrier, {{not one of the}} escortingcruisers, and developing tactics like having a single fighter direction officer for task forces operating in company. The four great carrier battles of 1942 - Coral Sea, Midway, Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz - were all fought by aircraft without the ships on either side actually coming in sight of one another. The Japanese carriers were caught time and again by American aircraft with a <b>light</b> <b>screen</b> of cruisers and destroyers, contributing to the loss of six Japanese carriers in the four battles.|$|E
5000|$|Some recent TV and {{computer}} displays {{are starting to}} include yellow as a fourth primary color, often in a four-point square pixel area, so as to achieve brighter pure yellows and a larger color gamut. Even the four-primary technology does not yet reach the range of colors that the human eye can see from light reflected by illuminated surfaces (as defined by the sample-based estimate called the Pointer Gamut), with 4-primary LED prototypes providing typically about 87% and 5-primary prototypes about 95%. Several firms, including Samsung and Mitsubishi, have demonstrated LED displays with five or six [...] "primaries", or color LED point light sources per pixel. [...] A recent academic literature review claims a gamut of 99% can be achieved with 5-primary LED technology. While technology for achieving a wider gamut appears to be within reach, other issues remain; for example, affordability, dynamic range, and brilliance. In addition, there exists hardly any source material recorded in this wider gamut, nor is it currently possible to recover this information from existing visual media. Regardless, industry is still exploring {{a wide variety of}} [...] "primary" [...] active light sources (per pixel) with the goal of matching the capability of human color perception within a broadly affordable price. One example of a potentially affordable but yet unproven active light hybrid places an LED screen over a plasma <b>light</b> <b>screen,</b> each with different [...] "primaries".|$|E

40|$|Hydrolysis of triffoxystrobin was {{investigated}} in pH 4 - 10 aqueous solutions at 25, 40 and 50 degrees C. Its photochemical experiments in acidic, neutral, alkaline solutions and 1 - 10 mg/L humic acid solutions were conducted. Trifloxystrobin hydrolytic rate was first-order with respect to hydroxide ion concentration. For each 10 temperature rising, the rate constant for hydrolysis increased 2 - 4 times. The photolytic T- 1 / 2 of trifloxystrobin at pH 4, 7 and 9 was 13. 0, 11. 9 and 4. 3 h, respectively. In the 1 - 10 mg/L humic acid solutions, the photodegradation rate constants corrected for <b>light</b> <b>screening</b> of trifloxystrbin were 0. 0592 - 0. 0577 h(- 1), basically decreasing with the humic acid concentration increasing.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a simple optical {{coupling}} method for water-jet guided laser machining system is introduced and its characteristics are studied. By the introduced method the output spot pattern behind the water-jet was observed {{instead of the}} laser focus. In order to acquire the pattern a piece of glass was used to block the water-jet but let the laser through, and a <b>light</b> <b>screen</b> was placed behind the glass in a certain distance to display the pattern image. Since the image scale could be adjusted by changing {{the distance between the}} glass and the <b>light</b> <b>screen,</b> the CCD magnifying system was no longer needed. It is found that the pattern varied while the coupling condition changed. Only in small chance the pattern was a tiny spot but more commonly it was in a ring-like shape which could be easily recognized. So such ring-like patterns could be signals for optical coupling guidance. Furthermore a series of study to analyze the correlation between the pattern shape and coupling parameters was carried out by simulation with the help of Zemax...|$|E
