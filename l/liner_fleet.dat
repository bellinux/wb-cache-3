As liner shipping services have fixed schedules, the ship-related operating cost is determined at the CLFD stage. This paper provides a critical review of existing mathematical models developed for the CLFD problems. It first gives a systematic overview of the fundamental assumptions used by the existing CLFD models. The operating characteristics dealt with in existing studies are then examined, including container transshipment and routing, uncertain demand, empty container repositioning, ship sailing speed optimization and ship repositioning.

This paper thus formulates this realistic short-term planning problem as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model.

40|$|Facing sharp {{competition}} {{in the market for}} shipping companies, it is necessary to make reasonable and efficient decisions to optimize the container shipping line network so as to improve the shipping efficiency and reduce the transportation cost, as well as to realize the transportation sustainability. Therefore, the <b>liner</b> ship <b>fleet</b> deployment problem with collaborative transportation is proposed in this paper. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming model that takes collaborative transportation into consideration. The model includes fixed cost, variable cost, berth cost, transport cost, penalty, compensation cost, and so on. To achieve the sustainable development of collaborative transportation, the shipping companies could make a selection between the internal routes and the external routes to serve each task by comparing the distance between the above routes. A real Asia-Europe-Oceania numerical experiment shows that the proposed sustainable collaborative transportation model can be efficiently solved by C++ calling ILOG CPLEX. Results demonstrate that the optimized shipping line network with sustainable collaborative transportation can improve the service efficiency, as well as the service level of shipping companies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{particularly}} difficult class of scheduling and routing problems involves an objective {{that is a}} sum of time-varying action costs, which increases the size {{and complexity of the}} problem. Solve-and-improve approaches, which find an initial solution for a simplified model and improve it using a cost function, and Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) are often used for solving such problems. However, Constraint Programming (CP), particularly with Lazy Clause Generation (LCG), {{has been found to be}} faster than MIP for some scheduling problems with time-varying action costs. In this paper, we compare CP and LCG against a solve-and-improve approach for two recently introduced problems in maritime logistics with time-varying action costs: the <b>Liner</b> Shipping <b>Fleet</b> Repositioning Problem (LSFRP) and the Bulk Port Cargo Throughput Optimisation Problem (BPCTOP). We present a novel CP model for the LSFRP, which is faster than all previous methods and outperforms a simplified automated planning model without time-varying costs. We show that a LCG solver is faster for solving the BPCTOP than a standard finite domain CP solver with a simplified model. We find that CP and LCG are effective methods for solving scheduling problems, and are worth investigating for other scheduling and routing problems that are currently being solved using MIP or solve-and-improve approaches. 1...|$|R

An important contribution to the subject is in [8]; this paper proposes a short-term <b>liner</b> ship <b>fleet</b> planning problem by taking into account container transshipment and uncertain container shipment demand. In the same way in [9] the authors proposed a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm for the exact solution of a variation of the vehicle routing problem with time windows in which the transportation fleet is made by vehicles with different capacities and fixed costs, based at different depots. In turn, in [10] the authors suggest a new optimization model for the tactical design of scheduled service networks for transportation systems, where several entities provide service and internal exchanges and coordination with neighboring systems is critical. A very interesting contribution to the subject can be found in [11]. This proposal is concerned with model development for a short-term fleet deployment problem of liner shipping operations.

In late 1898 the Manchester City, at 7,698gross tons, became the largest vessel {{to reach the}} terminal docks.

It covers deciding {{on the number of}} vehicles in a fleet (the fleet sizing problem—FS) and types of vehicles in a fleet (the fleet composition problem—FC). Another interesting perspective is found in [13] where the article considers the developed system of solid domestic waste collection and removal. A mathematical model estimating the efficiency of a specialized motor transport enterprise functioning, engaged in collecting and removing solid domestic waste is drawn. An interesting model for transport planning in the ferry area is found in [14]. The article is concerned with the description and development of the mathematical model of empty railcar distribution for loading at the railway transport node. It takes into account the requirements of railcar owners in terms of their cars application, the operating work level of railroad stations of the transportation node and the possibility of adding the groups of empty railcars to the transfer trains, clean-up trains and industrial railway trains operating on a tight schedule. A similar model for scheduling and fleet planning can be found in [15]. Some interesting alternatives are those that combine two or more techniques to solve an instance. For example in [16] the paper presents an algorithm which combines the linear programming technique with dynamic programming to improve the solution to the linear model for fleet planning. A similar instance is considered in [17]. This article deals with a short-term <b>Liner</b> Ship <b>Fleet</b> Planning (LSFP) problem with cargo shipment demand uncertainty for a single liner container shipping company. The cargo shipment demand uncertainty enables us to propose a chance constraint for each liner service route which guarantees that the liner service route can satisfy the customers demand at least with a predetermined probability. Similar approaches to the subject can be found in [18 – 21]. Finally, in [22], the authors present an inventory model that integrates continuous review with production and distribution for a supply chain involving a pharmaceutical company and a hospital supply chain, and in [23], a study is presented about a thorough study of a local Italian healthcare network.

This research investigates the impact of economic and political transition on the liner sector of post-Soviet Europe. Former socialist shipping corporations have begun to offer services under market conditions and left behind the rigid leeway of central planning (Cottam and Roe 2007). Extensive adjustments in ownership, organisation, fleets and markets have transpired. Successful transformation of the maritime industries has a major influence upon the speed and route of economic development in transition countries (Von Brabant 2011). Despite this, liner shipping has received very little attention from academia. There have been no profound investigations, nor a recognised transition model concerning the Eastern European liner sector. However, developments within this field and its importance for liner shipping internationally make transition shipping a topic worthy of rigorous analysis. A review of Eastern European liner shipping during the period of transition was undertaken in order to assess the level of adaptation to the demands of the free market placed upon the Eastern European liner shipping corporations by the post- 1989 transformations. Eastern European maritime literature supported the application of the concept from a transition context and assisted in the development of a conceptual model. The role of the model is to provide a visual representation of the most important elements of restructuring processes used in the facilitation of liner shipping in the European free market. Analysis of the research synthesis resulted in the identification of key dimensions crucial to successful transition. A three-tiered Delphi survey classified major areas of change and the relationship of changes to the liner industries. From a systemic point of view, research findings indicate the existence of a number of transitional processes utilised in the restructuring of <b>liner</b> shipping <b>fleets.</b> These are: liberalisation, deregulation, commercialisation, privatisation and European Union accession. Such processes are intricately linked and deeply dependent upon evolutionary timing and sequencing. A discussion of the results provides serious implications for world practitioners. Based on the findings of this study, European Union competitors may take advantage of the fact that transitional liner shipping has largely lost touch with market decisive players, although it has undergone broad privatisation and restructuring. Conversely, Eastern European liner corporations can analyse the effect of transition upon shipping, and draw comparisons between the varying techniques applied and the results achieved by national fleets in order to identify the most advantageous commercialisation strategies. Government initiative will now be required to overcome the conflict between the interest of the liner industry and that of the national citizen, such that there will be public acceptance of free competition, privatisation and foreign investment.

40|$|Introducing {{composite}} vessels {{into the}} Space Shuttle Program represented a significant technical achievement. Each Orbiter vehicle contains 24 (nominally) Kevlar tanks for storage of pressurized helium (for propulsion) and nitrogen (for life support). The use of composite cylinders saved 752 pounds per Orbiter vehicle compared with all-metal tanks. The weight savings is significant considering each Shuttle flight can deliver 54, 000 pounds of payload to the International Space Station. In {{the wake of}} the Columbia accident and the ensuing Return to Flight activities, the Space Shuttle Program, in 2005, re-examined COPV hardware certification. Incorporating COPV data that had been generated over the last 30 years and recognizing differences between initial Shuttle Program requirements and current operation, a new failure mode was identified, as composite stress rupture was deemed credible. The Orbiter Project undertook a comprehensive investigation to quantify and mitigate this risk. First, the engineering team considered and later deemed as unfeasible the option to replace existing all flight tanks. Second, operational improvements to flight procedures were instituted to reduce the flight risk and the danger to personnel. Third, an Orbiter reliability model was developed to quantify flight risk. Laser profilometry inspection of several flight COPVs identified deep (up to 20 mil) depressions on the tank interior. A comprehensive analysis was performed and it confirmed that these observed depressions were far less than the criterion which was established as necessary to lead to <b>liner</b> buckling. Existing <b>fleet</b> vessels were exonerated from this failure mechanism. Because full validation of the Orbiter Reliability Model was not possible given limited hardware resources, an Accelerated Stress Rupture Test of a flown flight vessel was performed to provide increased confidence. A Bayesian statistical approach was developed to evaluate possible test results with respect to the model credibility and thus flight rationale for continued operation of the Space Shuttle with existing flight hardware. A non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique utilizing Raman Spectroscopy was developed to directly measure the overwrap residual stress state. Preliminary results provide optimistic results that patterns of fluctuation in fiber elastic strains over the outside vessel surface could be directly correlated with increased fiber stress ratios and thus reduced reliability...|$|R
