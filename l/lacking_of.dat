Maurice of Nassau laid a bridge over the Rhine and tried to take Meurs by surprise, but the enterprise was discovered. He also committed Count William Louis of Nassau-Dillenburg to intercept five Spanish companies sent by Mondragón to lodge in Twente, but the Spaniards managed to reach Enschede, leaving only a few chariots with supplies in Dutch hands. On 11 October, <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> forage, Mondragón retired back to Brabant. Maurice aimed to cut off his retreat, but the Spaniard succeeded in bringing his troops to a secure position. Mondragón re-crossed the Meuse in November and distributed his troops in different towns. Before crossing the river the Swiss mercenaries were paid and liscended. On 4 January 1596, the elderly general died in the citadel of Antwerp. On his deathbed {{he wrote a letter}} to Philip II asking for the castellany of Antwerp for his son Alonso and a company of lances for his grandson Cristóbal, but both requests were denied.|$|E
25|$|Within {{two years}} after the law was implemented, no land was being {{purchased}} under its term and conditions caused by the peasants' inability to purchase the land. Besides, the government seemed <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> strong political will, as shown by the Congress' allotment of only one million Philippine pesos for the implementation of this code. At least Php200million was needed within a year from the enactment and implementation of the code, and Php300million in the next three years for the program to be successful. However, by 1972, the code had benefited only 4,500 peasants covering 68 estates, at the cost of Php57million to the government. Consequently, by the 1970s, the farmers ended up tilling less land, with their share in the farm also being less. They incurred more debts, depending on the landlord, creditors, and palay buyers. Indeed, during the administration of Macapagal, the productivity of the farmers further declined.|$|E

He ordered Patih Natakusuma {{to do all the}} dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC’s posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August and they were all wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch.|$|E

25|$|Another {{problem of}} the Hungarian army was {{that many of the}} talented, {{experienced}} Hungarian generals, who helped in a decisive way the success of the Spring Campaign, were no more available (János Damjanich, who broke his leg; Lajos Aulich who became ill; András Gáspár) who resigned from the Hungarian army because of political reasons) and General Görgei was forced to put in their place other officers who were talented soldiers, but were not experienced as army corps leaders, many of them <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> capacity of acting independently when it needed and they had no order to do so, but the military situation required this. So, Görgei put General Károly Knezić in Damjanich's place to lead III. corps, Colonel Lajos Asbóth in Aulich's place to lead II. corps, General Ernő Poeltenberg in Gáspár's place. General György Klapka who formerly was the commander of the I. corps, but who became temporary main commander of the main Hungarian army, called Hungarian Army of the Upper Danube (Feldunai Hadsereg), taking the place of Görgei, who became War Minister, had to give his position at the head of his corps to General József Nagysándor. These new corps commanders lacked the former generals talent, intuition and experience. Görgei himself, because of now being War Minister, had to fulfill these two heavy tasks (ministry and high commandment of the army), could not focus in the same way on the military actions as he did in the Spring Campaign.|$|E

It serves as the follow-up to Mars' debut record Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010). The album was initially planned to be more [...] "energetic" [...] than his previous work, but, it ended presenting {{a wide range of}} styles such as reggae rock, disco and soul music. The singer co-wrote the whole record and worked with several past collaborators, while enlisting new producers and no guest vocalists. Lyrically, Unorthodox Jukebox revolves around the theme of relationships, incorporating more explicit lyrics and subjects than his previous material. Critical response to Unorthodox Jukebox was generally favorable; many reviewers compared Mars' work to that of his previous album, while others deemed the lyrical content as shallow and <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> depth.|$|E

500|$|Beginning {{nearly a}} century later, as {{the rule of the}} Qing Empire {{expanded}} over wider groups of people, writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree of acculturation, and toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule. Qing used the term [...] "raw/wild/uncivilized" [...] (...) to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule, and [...] "cooked/tamed/civilized" [...] (...) for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax. According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes, the epithet [...] "cooked" [...] was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms, and living as a subject of the Empire, but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> the non-Han people.

500|$|After {{his loss}} to Kofi Kingston, The Miz turned {{face for the}} first time in his career when he joined Mick Foley's team at Survivor Series after confronting Paul Heyman on the November 18 Raw. At Survivor Series, The Miz {{eliminated}} Wade Barrett before being eliminated by Alberto Del Rio. In the months to come, Miz's turn was not well received by critics, who commented that Miz as a babyface was too similar to his heel character because he was [...] "still cocky, arrogant, and egotistical" [...] while [...] "pivoted toward calling out established heels". Other criticisms were that Miz was [...] "juvenile", <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> depth, [...] "grating and not endearing to the audience" [...] and that [...] "there was not that moment when he officially turned and aligned his values with the audience's". The Miz then began a feud with United States Champion Antonio Cesaro, after Cesaro insulted America. During this feud Ric Flair became Miz's mentor, and he subsequently adopted the figure-four leglock from Flair as a new finisher. The Miz challenged for Cesaro's United States Championship at the Royal Rumble pre-show, at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, and on the March 3 episode of SmackDown, but was unsuccessful each time.|$|E

2500|$|According to Carnap, {{many words}} of metaphysics do not fulfill these {{requirements}} and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word 'principle'. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence [...] "x {{is the principle}} of y" [...] {{is supposed to be}} equivalent to the sentence [...] "y exists by virtue of x" [...] or [...] "y arises out of x". The latter sentence is perfectly clear: y arises out of x when x is invariably followed by y, and the invariable association between x and y is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of 'principle'. They assert that no empirical relation between x and y can completely explain the meaning of [...] "x is the principle of y", because there is something that cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the <b>lacking</b> <b>of</b> any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word 'principle' when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as [...] "water is the principle of the world" [...] or [...] "the spirit is the principle of the world" [...] are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.|$|E
