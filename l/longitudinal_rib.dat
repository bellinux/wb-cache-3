50|$|The {{operation}} of the closure valve was to be critical:Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower plates fitting into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar {{to act as a}} hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of beeswax and tallow: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a protecting cover, which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next {{in the direction of the}} piston's motion, thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.|$|E

5000|$|... (Original description) The high, narrow, angulated {{shell is}} obsoletely ribbed. It is tubercled, thin, polished, flinty white, with an {{elongated}} conical base, longish columella, and a blunt apex. The {{lower half of}} the whorls is crossed by obsolete, rounded, oblique, straight longitudinal ribs, with very slight rounded depressions between.; There are about 12 ribs, of increasingindistinctness, on the body whorl, and 9 on the first regular whorl. They take their origin in a row of small, round, sharpish tubercles. They do not extend to the base. The lines of growth are faint sharpish scratches, and are quite independent of the ribs. A little above the middle, each whorl is angulated and carinated, the carinal thread being set with small, sharpish-pointed tubercles, in which the longitudinal ribs originate. The sinus area is smooth. The rest of the surface is marked by very obsolete, depressed, rounded threads. The colour of the shell is greyish transparent white. The high spire is narrow and conical.Its profile-lines are but little interrupted by the broad, shallow, sutural depression which extends from keel to keel of the successive whorls. The protoconch consists of nearly 2 embryonic whorls, which are cylindrical, quite smooth, and end in a perfectly rounded tip, which is slightly immersed, and scarcely, if at all, oblique. The 7 whorls are short and of slow increase. They are angulated above the middle, with a drooping, scarcely hollowed shoulder above, and a very slight contraction of their straight line below. The last is small, rapidly contracted on the conical base, and running out into a somewhat one-sided, and slightly twisted, narrow, longish snout. The suture is a little oblique, linear and a little disturbed by the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> well defined by the superior and inferior slope of the whorls. The aperture is club-shaped, oval above, with a longish, open, rather oblique siphonal canal. The outer lip is thin, with a flattened, convex curve, which is steepish at the shoulder and elongated at the siphonal canal. On leaving the body it sweeps at once backwards, leaving a very narrow shelf between the body whorl and the sinus. The sinusis rounded, rather shallow and open, but large, from the very considerable forward sweep of the pinion-like edge of the lip as it approaches the siphonal canal, from which it retreats toward the point of the shell. The inner lip is a thinly glazed, narrow, slightly depressed area. It is very slightly hollowed {{at the base of the}} longish finely conical columella. The point ofthe columella is cut off with a long-drawn obliquity, and has a fine, slightly twisted edge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For {{orthotropic}} {{steel bridge}} deck (OSD), principle tensile stresses {{near the end}} of joint of crossbeam web and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> and at the edge of crossbeam cutout are dependent on the shape of crossbeam cutout to a great extent. They are results of many factors, among which bending-shearing effect and in-plane supporting effect are in-plane factors, unsymmetrical loading effect and relative longitudinal deformation effect are out-of-plane factors. Comparison study on stresses at some fatigue sensitive regions of orthotropic steel deck with six types of crossbeam web cutout indicates that the top height of cutouts determines the distance between the end of joint and the neutral axis, which affects the bending effect seriously, and the area of cutouts determines the shearing effect. When OSD system is affected by bending-shearing effect, increasing the top height decreases the principle tensile stresses {{near the end of}} joint but increases the stresses at the edge of cutout, and increasing the area increases the principle tensile stresses both near the end and at the edge of cutout. When the top height of cutouts increases, the contact area between crossbeam web drops, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by in-plane supporting effect increases. When the side width of cutouts increases, the constraint effect of the crossbeam web to <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> decreases, then the principle tensile stresses near the joint produced by out-of-plane effects decreases. Generally, OSD system with stiff cutouts behaves well when affected by in-plane effects, and OSD system with flexible cutouts behaves well when affected by out-of-plane effects...|$|E
40|$|Ultrassonography is an {{important}} option to evaluate carcass composition and quality, {{as it is a}} non-invasive technique which quantifies different tissues in live animals. The objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the correlation between measurements taken in vivo, using ultrasound and skinfold thickness, in sheep carcasses from Santa Inês breed. Eighty-one males, aging 8 to 18 months, and weighting on average 31 kg live weight were used. The measures taken in vivo by ultrassonography were longitudinal diagonal length, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> eye area, transversal diagonal length, transversal rib eye area. Hot carcass weight, carcass yield, carcass fat thickness, carcass length, carcass rib eye area and commercial retail cut weight (leg, loin, shoulder, ribs and neck) were determined. The analyses of variance, main components, polynomial regression and correlation were carried out using SAS® statistical program. There was no difference between castrated and intact animals for carcass quality and components, indicating that castration does not provide better carcass quality. Animals with higher leg, shoulder and rib weights had lower skin weight, wither height and weight of abdominal organs, indicating a more desirable body type for selection. Body weight, body length and rib eye area by ultrasound (in vivo) can predict the rib eye area, leg weight, carcass length, hot and half carcass weight. However, loin, neck and rib weights, carcass yield and weight of abdominal organs cannot be predicted by these in vivo measurements. The measurements taken with skinfold showed no significant correlations with carcass measures, which indicates that they are not efficient for prediction of carcass components and therefore should not be used...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} {{osteoclast}} and osteoclast nuclear population kinetics within evolving secondary osteons was undertaken in young adult Beagle dogs. Autoradiographs of serial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rib</b> biopsy sections taken from 1 hour to 15 days after tritiated thymidine injection were analysed {{as to the}} time and the rate of appearance of the labelled nuclei within the osteoclasts and their nuclei. Such systems contained an average of nine osteoclasts, each containing an average of nine nuclei. Labelled osteoclast nuclei first appeared within 24 hours, peaked at 10 % at 4 days, and declined to 1 % or less after 11. 5 days more. Thus, the entry rate of new nuclei into (and their exit from) the population of osteoclast nuclei under steady state conditions approximates 8 % per day. Therefore, the total mononuclear osteoclast population may be viewed as divided into functional units, i. e. osteoclasts. From the ratio of the osteoclast nuclei in the cutting cone to the number of osteoblasts in the closing cone (as well as from their rates of resorption and formation), it was deduced that the osteoclast per nucleus is approximately 20 - 40 times more efficient than the osteoblast. Because of the intrinsically different efficiencies and life spans of these two cell types, the rates of resorption and formation within evolving Haversian systems and the amounts of bone ultimately resorbed and formed by the system, are determined by the rate and duration of the respective precursor cell proliferation. It is at this level that factors which control the bone remodelling and balance must operate...|$|E
