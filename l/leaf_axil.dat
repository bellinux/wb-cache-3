25|$|The {{flowers are}} unisexual, {{carried on the}} same {{inflorescence}} (i.e. the plant is monoecious). One (or occasionally two) inflorescences emerge from a <b>leaf</b> <b>axil,</b> with at least five inflorescence-bearing axils per fertile branch. The inflorescences have a unique structure among flowering plants. In the centre {{there is a single}} carpellate ("female") flower. This lacks obvious petals or sepals (although there are small bracts below the flower which some researchers have suggested may be the remnants of the perianth), and consists solely of a single-celled (unilocular) ovary, 5mm long by 2mm wide, surmounted by three curved 4mm long stigmas. On either side of the solitary carpellate flower there are two branches each with five or six staminate ("male") flowers arranged at 1–3mm intervals.|$|E
25|$|Each {{inflorescence}} may {{consist of}} usually {{between three and}} twelve flowers, but may occasionally contain as few as one {{and as many as}} seventeen flowers, usually on a flattened 1½−5mm wide common stem of up to 9cm long, and growing from a <b>leaf</b> <b>axil,</b> but in some forms on thick branches or the trunk (so-called cauliflory). Sometimes near the tip are one or two persistent leaf-like bracteoles of about 1cm, but mostly the small scale-like bracteoles fall off quickly. Individual flowers are on stems of up to 2mm long. Each flower has five sepals of about 2½×3½–4mm, the lower half of which are fused, the free tips short triangular with a rounded tip and an entire edge. The five fleshy petals are greenish or creamy white, 1¼–1¾ × ⅞–1¼cm, broadly inverted egg-shaped, with a blunt tip. The five stamens have filaments of about 1¼mm thick, and are topped by anthers of 5 × 2½mm. Alternating with the stamens are mostly unequally incised staminodes with three to five incisions. The superior ovary has five sides and is 8–10mm high including the style.|$|E
2500|$|The spirally-arranged {{leaves are}} [...] (leathery) in texture and lack a defined petiole. The laminae (leaf blades) are {{narrowly}} -oblong and {{measure up to}} 29 by 3.1cm. The laminar apex is [...] The leaf base gradually narrows towards the stem, where it is around 1.3cm wide. It clasps the stem for three-quarters to four-fifths of its circumference, having an angled insertion and forming wings 0.3–0.4cm wide. These wings are shortly , terminating 0.9–1.2cm below the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> Three to four longitudinal veins are present {{on either side of}} the midrib. These originate from the leaf base and along the midrib, and run through the outer three-quarters of the leaf blade. They are visible only on the [...] (upper) surface of the leaf. [...] veins are inconspicuous. The laminae, like the stem, are covered in sessile glands, these being distributed [...] "moderately densely". Tendrils supporting upper pitchers are coiled.|$|E
50|$|Male {{flowers are}} located in <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> or in spikelike inflorescences. Female flowers are {{generally}} held in small clusters below the male clusters in the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> The female inflorescence has spongy bracteoles up to a centimeter long and inflated around the flowers.|$|R
40|$|A {{sampling}} system {{was developed for}} monitoring population levels of woolly apple aphid, Eriosoma lanigerum (Hausmann), by counting colonies on half of each of 25 apple trees per 2 ha block. Sampling error was affected by whether the colonies were found in wounds or in <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> Parasitism of colonies in <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> had a slight effect on sampling error. Sampling error for colonies in <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> was high at just over 40 %. However, decisions regarding intervention were not markedly compromised by simply classifying the 25 trees as infested or uninfested, as opposed to counting colonies in <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> The presence-absence system greatly reduced the time spent monitoring E. lanigerum population levels, making it an attractive system for assessing woolly apple aphid infestations in commercial orchards.

50|$|Many {{species of}} this genus are characterised by having {{epiphyllous}} flowers, which {{emerge from the}} leaf itself, rather than the more usual site of a <b>leaf</b> <b>axil,</b> a plant axis, or its inflorescence.|$|E
5000|$|Flowers: {{male and}} female flowers are {{produced}} on the same inflorescence, averaging 20 male flowers to each female flower, or 10 male flowers to each female flower. The inflorescence can be formed in the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> Plants occasionally present hermaphroditic flowers.|$|E
50|$|The solitary flowers {{emerge from}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> and are purplish.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowering}} stems are 4 to 16 in high. Flowers {{are produced}} singly or in leafy racemes {{of two to}} four flowers, which means that there are leaves arranged alternately up the stems and flowers are in stems {{that come out of}} <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> On either side of the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> are two rounded stipules.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} {{inconspicuous}} growing from the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> of emerse plants.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most crownshafted species, the {{inflorescence}} in R. melanochaetes {{emerges from}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil</b> rather than beneath the shaft. The much-branched panicle is 1-2 m with unisexual flowers of both sexes. Fruit matures to a 1 cm red drupe with one seed.|$|E
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is {{a solitary}} flower {{at the tip}} of the stem, or arising from an upper <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> The flower has five white petals, each with a sharp, narrow notch in the tip. There are five long stamens with yellow anthers.|$|E
50|$|An {{individual}} plant of L. substrigosa typically has {{four to eight}} peduncles in each <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> They tend to be 2.5 to 6 cm long and are covered with long, rough, and coarse hairs. Pubescent hairs, arising from glands, also grow on the peduncle.|$|E

50|$|A shrub {{or a small}} tree, up to {{6 metres}} in height with a crooked trunk with brown bark. Small {{branches}} are pale with thin bark coming off in flakes. The sideways shoots arise from the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> Additionally, they form well above the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> Triangular stipules form between the leaf pairs, with a fine tip.|$|R
25|$|Paroicous bryophytes produce antheridia and archegonia in {{separate}} clusters in different <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of species are succulent shade-loving herbs or shrubs, which are easily distinguished from other Urticaceae by {{the combination of}} opposite leaves (with rare exceptions) with a single ligulate intrapetiolar stipule in each <b>leaf</b> <b>axil</b> and cymose or paniculate inflorescences (again with rare exceptions).|$|E
5000|$|... 2-lipped flowers {{occur in}} {{clusters}} of three in each <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> The tubular purple or blue corollas are {{between one and}} two centimeters long and are surrounded by calyces of spine-tipped sepals. The flowers on 1"-3" [...] spikes are partially hidden by tufts of wool.|$|E
5000|$|Shrub to four metres {{with many}} {{alternate}} branches, although lower ones may be sparse. Bright green leaves are divided {{in three to}} five in outline; margins are irregular, lobate to toothed; pubescent and strongly veined lobes are coarse in shape. The flowerstalk at the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil</b> is long, tilting at the single flower.|$|E
50|$|This is {{an annual}} herb growing 10 to 70 centimeters tall with oppositely arranged, {{stipulate}} oval leaves each a few centimeters long. The male flowers are borne in spikelike clusters sprouting from <b>leaf</b> <b>axils,</b> and female flowers grow at <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> in clusters of 2 or 3. The fruit is a bristly schizocarp 2 or 3 millimeters wide containing shiny, pitted seeds.|$|R
50|$|An indumentum {{of brown}} hairs (0.1 mm long) is {{present on the}} <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> and inflorescence.|$|R
5000|$|Inflorescences ramiflorous or {{arising from}} <b>leaf</b> <b>axils,</b> reduced thyrses with each node bearing usually 3 short cymes.|$|R
50|$|It {{is a very}} hairy annual plant {{forming a}} small patch of {{prostrate}} stems up to 10 centimeters long. It bears lance-shaped leaves up to 4 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a tiny solitary flower blooming from a <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> Each flower is white to purple-tinged, funnel-shaped, and just a few millimeters long.|$|E
50|$|Some orchids have single flowers, {{but most}} have a racemose inflorescence, {{sometimes}} {{with a large}} number of flowers. The flowering stem can be basal, that is, produced {{from the base of the}} tuber, like in Cymbidium, apical, meaning it grows from the apex of the main stem, like in Cattleya, or axillary, from the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil,</b> as in Vanda`.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{perennial}} herb with a branching, heavily glandular stem growing 30 to 60 centimeters tall. The leaves are palmately compound, each {{made up of}} usually three linear or lance-shaped leaflets borne on a short petiole. The inflorescence is a raceme of flowers emerging from a <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> Each flower is under a centimeter long with a pealike corolla in shades of light purple-blue to white. The fruit is a hairy, glandular, spherical legume.|$|E
5000|$|Solitary flowers {{occur in}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> Each is about 4 {{millimeters}} (0.16 inches) long, urn-shaped, and pink.|$|R
50|$|Flower: White to cream, {{occasionally}} pink-tinged, sweetly scented, bisexual, {{in small}} sprays in the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> Sept. - Dec.|$|R
50|$|Immatures {{develop in}} broken or cut bamboo internodes and {{have also been}} {{collected}} from <b>leaf</b> <b>axils</b> and bamboo stumps.|$|R
50|$|The flowers {{appear in}} spring, between September and November {{in their native}} range. These are orange-yellow with a red centre, with red {{markings}} in the centre, {{on the tip of}} the keel and {{on the back of the}} standard. and are supported by a long stalk which is covered by hairs and arises from the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil.</b> The pods which follow are flat, glabrous or hairy and about 2 to 4 cm in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} fast-growing and flowers prolifically, sending out 10 to 40 flowered one-sided racemes {{cascading}} pea-flower shaped purple to violet flowers from the <b>leaf</b> <b>axil</b> during its late spring to late summer flowering period. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees; when the flowers drop off and tiny bright green seed pods 10-20 mm long, start to form. Cow vetch {{is very similar}} to hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), but is distinguished from the latter by its smooth stem.|$|E
5000|$|It is a {{herbaceous}} perennial plant {{growing to}} 40-100 cm tall, with alternate, oblong-lanceolate leaves 5-14 cm long. The greenish-white flowers hang from axils on 1-2 cm thin kinked panicles, each flower with six white tepals, 9-15 mm long. The plants leaves completely encircle the stem, and the stems have a kink at each <b>leaf</b> <b>axil</b> giving the plants stem a [...] "twisted" [...] and wiry appearance. The plants grow in a creeping habit in moist, dense undergrowth.|$|E
50|$|Flowers {{open from}} May to June and are yellowish. They are {{produces}} singly or in a cluster from <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Small white-petalled flowers {{appear in}} the <b>leaf</b> <b>axils.</b> The fruit is a single or double {{follicle}} a few millimeters wide.|$|R
50|$|A rich {{literature}} in German summarised by Thienemann (1954) developed {{many aspects of}} phytotelm biology. Reviews of the subject by Kitching (1971) and Maguire (1971) introduced the concept of phytotelmata to English-speaking readers. A multi-authored book edited by Frank and Lounibos (1983) dealt in 11 chapters with classification of phytotelmata, and with phytotelmata provided by bamboo internodes, banana <b>leaf</b> <b>axils,</b> bromeliad <b>leaf</b> <b>axils,</b> Nepenthes pitchers, Sarracenia pitchers, tree holes, and Heliconia flower bracts.|$|R
