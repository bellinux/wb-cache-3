40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} {{in connection with}} a research project at IIASA designed to analyze and to compare the decision procedures followed in different countries for the siting of <b>liquefied</b> energy <b>gas</b> <b>installations.</b> Four <b>liquefied</b> energy <b>gas</b> facilities worldwide were identified for detailed case study, including Mossmorran-Braefoot Bay in the UK; other sites are in the USA, the Netherlands, and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). There are a number of features that distinguish the Mossmorran-Braefoot Bay developments from these others, including the following: (1) The substances to be handled at the Mossmorran installations are LPG's and not LNG; individual hazard properties are different and may lead to a different evaluation of hazard consequence. (2) The installations will represent export rather than import facilities for their host country. (3) The LPG facilities involved were considered within the decision and approval process {{as part of a larger}} package of petrochemical developments, involving an ethylene cracker and possible downstream industries at the same sites. The decision process for the LPG facilities alone cannot be easily separated from the package as a whole; the main objectors to the decision, moreover, emphasized that they regarded ethylene to be the most hazardous of the substances involved. (4) Site screening was undertaken by Shell and Esso, so that from the perspectives of all other parties, Mossmorran-Braefoot Bay can be considered as a one-site decision process. (5) The decision and participatory procedures involved are UK-specific. (6) Processing as well as storage and transshipment facilities are involved. (7) The installations are currently under construction...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Liquefied</b> <b>gases</b> such as ammonia or {{chlorine}} {{are often}} stored in cylinders or vessels at ambient temperatures and pressures well above atmospheric pressure. When such a <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> is {{released into the}} ambient atmosphere, the resultant reduction of pressure causes some of the <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> to vaporize immediately. This is known as [...] "adiabatic flashing" [...] and the following equation, derived from a simple heat balance, is used to predict {{how much of the}} <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> is vaporized.|$|R

40|$|This study {{endeavors to}} {{determine}} whether farmers adjust their consumption of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> in response {{to changes in the}} unit price of energy.

The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> petroleum <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To a {{great extent}} ， traffic {{accidents}} of <b>liquefied</b> <b>gas</b> tankers are caused by the defects inside the tankers themselves. Analyzing what causes the defects, and putting forward the corresponding prevention measures, to reduce accident risk, is of great significance.

The defects in actual transportation process containing weld joints defects and anti-wave plates are analyzed, and the corresponding solutions are put forward {{on the basis of}} the literature analysis. The results show that the main causes of the defects are that the manufacture and processing did not correspond with design data.
