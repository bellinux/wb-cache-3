Finally, on November 29, 1810, with the surveying season for that season over and only four months left before they were to report out their plan, they seemed to have arrived at a decision. On that date, Morris informed the Common Council that although more work was left to be done [...] "on the ground", the Commission itself had [...] "completed their work" [...] and would {{be able to make a}} report that would [...] "compl substantially, if not literally within the law, shewing [...] all the streets which to be laid out..."

[...] At Morris' suggestion, the Common Council hired Randel to actually do the extensive work involved in making the grid a physical reality [...] although city surveyor William Bridges (see below) also submitted a proposal to do the work [...] and Randel began this work even before the Commissioners' Plan was announced publicly.

This verdict was {{followed}} by two sets of appeals, which claimed that the restored and amended 1923 Constitution did not offer a framework for the People's Tribunals and prevented capital punishment during peacetime, while noting that, contrary to the armistice agreement, only one power represented within the Allied Commission had supervised the tribunal. They were both rejected within six days, in compliance with a <b>legal</b> <b>deadline</b> on the completion of trials by the People's Tribunals. King Michael subsequently received pleas for clemency from Antonescu's lawyer and his mother, and reputedly considered asking the Allies to reassess the case as part of the actual Nuremberg Trials, taking Romanian war criminals into foreign custody. Subjected to pressures by the new Soviet-backed Petru Groza executive, he issued a decree in favor of execution. Together with his co-defendants Mihai Antonescu, Alexianu and Vasiliu, the former Conducător was executed by a military firing squad on June 1, 1946. Ion Antonescu's supporters circulated false rumors that regular soldiers had refused to fire at their commander, and that the squad was mostly composed of Jewish policemen. Another apologetic claim insists that he himself ordered the squad to shoot, but footage of the event has proven it false. It is however attested that he refused a blindfold and raised his hat in salute once the order was given. The execution site, some distance away from the locality of Jilava and the prison fort, was known as Valea Piersicilor ("Valley of the Peach Trees"). His final written statement was a letter to his wife, urging her to withdraw into a convent, while stating the belief that posterity would reconsider his deeds and accusing Romanians of being [...] "ungrateful".|$|E
2500|$|Between 7:50p.m. and 8:00p.m. EST on {{election}} day, {{just before the}} polls closed in the largely Republican Florida panhandle, {{which is in the}} Central time zone, all major television news networks (CNN, NBC, FOX, CBS and ABC) declared that Gore had carried Florida's 25 electoral votes. They based this prediction substantially on exit polls. However, in the actual vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST the networks had retracted that prediction and placed Florida back into the [...] "undecided" [...] column. At approximately 2:30a.m., with some 85% of the votes counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore had been elected president. However, most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were located in three heavily Democratic counties—Broward, Miami-Dade, and Palm Beach—and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to under 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their predictions that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush, withdrew his concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead dwindled to just over 900 votes when it was completed the day after the election. On November 8, Florida Division of Elections staff prepared a press release for Secretary of State Harris that said overseas ballots must be [...] "postmarked or signed and dated" [...] by Election Day. It was never released. A count of the overseas ballots later boosted Bush's margin to 930 votes.

40|$|For {{the past}} 12 years, New Zealand has {{operated}} {{the most comprehensive}} and internationally admired regime for regulating {{the introduction of new}} organisms.

Over the same period the rate of introduction of biocontrol agents into other jurisdictions worldwide appears to have declined. This paper discusses why the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act has been an effective and efficient statute for managing the introduction of new organisms, including: founding documents that defined the initial standards for decision-making, the use of formal analysis to weigh the risks and costs of a proposed introduction against the benefits, <b>legal</b> <b>deadlines</b> that bind the regulator, the independence of the regulator, commitment to genuine public participation in decision-making, and the cooperative culture of the regulatory agency. Despite these successes, some practitioners claim that it may encourage a conservative approach, limiting investigation of agents to those that are sure to be approved. The regulations may also be limiting the types and number of biocontrol agents being introduced into New Zealand. This paper therefore discusses new developments that will facilitate the introduction of agents while still satisfying the regulatory requirements...|$|R

In Lithuania, Administrative Procedure Law provides one of {{the personal}} rights form - Institute of deadline for filing a complaint the right to justice is enshrined in the Constitution of Lithuania 30 article 1, based on that person whose constitutional rights and freedoms are violated {{has the right to}} go to court. The Jurisprudence of The Constitutional Court has ruled that violated human rights and legal interests have to be defended regardless their direct recognitions in the constitution. The institute of deadline for filing a complaint is a person's right to a judicial remedy in the form of implementation. Lithuania is regulated by the Law that has the short term for filing a complaint. That is why often there is a problem when a person who missed deadline for filing a complaint without good reason, has no right to go to court and defend their legitimate interests. Therefore based on regulation the question arises - as to whether complain filing period ensures the constitutional principle of the right to judicial protection and consistent implementation of the European Convention of Human Rights enshrined the principle – the right to a fair trial. Legislator has established a one-month time limit for lodging a complaint. Therefore, legal practice faces a problem when a person who has missed the deadline for filing a complaint, without good reason, loses the right to go to court and defend their legitimate interests. This raises questions about the complaint filing <b>deadline</b> <b>legal</b> nature, whether this term is similar to the civil law enshrined limitation Institute and what the similarities and differences between institutions are. Also there are questions regarding the Constitutional principle of right to the content of judicial protection, the Convention principle of right to a fair trial content and application. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} the subject is problematic. Any person, whose legitimate interests have been violated, has the right to legal defense. However, the question arises as how to protect the legitimate interests of the person affected, if a person misses time limit for lodging a complaint, without good reason, and is deprived of the right to legal defense. This right is guaranteed in the Constitution, it is therefore necessary to reveal whether or not the implementation of complaint filing deadline, which is a form of implementation of the right to judicial protection violates the right of constitutional principle to judicial protection and the of the right of Convention principle to a fair trial. Work hypothesis. The implementation of the Institute of Complaint filing deadline violates the Constitution enshrined the principle of the right to judicial protection and in the Convention enshrined the principle of the right to a fair trial. The analysis of Master's thesis did not prove a hypothesis, that the implementation of the Institute of complaint filing deadline violates the Constitution enshrined the principle of the right to judicial protection and the Convention enshrined the principle of the right to a fair trial. This conclusion follows from the analysis and interpretations of the Constitutional and Human Rights Courts, which established the constitutional right to a trial and the Convention enshrined the right to a fair trial is not absolute, therefore the legislator has the right to determine the procedure for applying to the courts, formal requirements. The job analysis showed that: 1. 	 The deadline for filing Complaint in its legal nature is a procedural deadline because its goal – is to ensure rapid and efficient proceedings, the real and guaranteed subjective rights and judicial defense of legally protected interests; limit for proceedings to carry out in connection with the protection of the violated or disputed substantive law to carry out; term has a mandatory attribute; the time limits specified by law or determined by the court; the term is short, since the aim is to ensure the timely judicial settlement of the dispute. 2. 	Administrative Proceedings Law Article 29, Paragraph 1, which has one month to file a complaint, is in compliance with the Constitution Article 30 Paragraph 1. Because based on the Constitutional Court's interpretation the legislator of procedural laws may establish a referral to a court order, the formal requirements to be met by the court for a procedural document. Such formal requirements shall not imply that the person is artificially restricted the constitutional right of access to a court or unduly burdened exercise of this right. 3. 	 Administrative Proceedings Law Article 29, Paragraph 1, which has one month to file a complaint, is in compliance with The Convention article 6 Paragraph 1. According to the European Human Rights Court's interpretation, the right to a trial is not an absolute right and national law may be introduced into the appeal court rules, e. g., the limitation, fines payment rules, etc. 4. 	 In Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and France, the complaint filing deadline falls within the procedural deadline. The deadlines are regulated in Latvia and Estonia by procedural law - Administrative Procedure Act. Complaint filing deadlines are short, Latvia and Estonia one month, France - two months. However, Latvia is provided with the case that if administrative act is in breach of the legitimate interests of the person who was not an administrative process party, then the person has the right to file a complaint within one month of becoming aware, but not longer than one year, from the time when an administrative act came into force...|$|R

During this time Hill reported that she had entered into an agreement with Sony that would allow her to release her own music. Upon the single's release, Ms. Hill posted an open letter on her official Facebook page: [...] "Here is a link to a piece that I was 'required' to release immediately, {{by virtue of the}} impending <b>legal</b> <b>deadline.</b> I love being able to reach people directly, but in an ideal scenario, I would not have to rush the release of new music... but the message is still there. In light of Wednesday's tragic loss (of former label mate Chris Kelly), I am even more pressed to YELL this to a multitude that may not understand the cost of allowing today's unhealthy paradigms to remain unchecked!" [...] Hill performed the song live {{for the first time on}} May 14, 2013 at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg.|$|E
