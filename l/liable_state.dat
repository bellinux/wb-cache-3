60|$|But, {{he was not}} {{destined to}} keep himself out of trouble long. The royal {{shuttlecock}} being three-and-twenty, the battledores were very anxious to get him married. The Duke of Gloucester wanted him to marry a daughter of the Count of Armagnac; but, the Cardinal and the Earl of Suffolk were all for MARGARET, {{the daughter of the}} King of Sicily, who they knew was a resolute, ambitious woman and would govern the King as she chose. To make friends with this lady, the Earl of Suffolk, who went over to arrange the match, consented to accept her for the King's wife without any fortune, and even to give up the two most valuable possessions England then had in France. So, the marriage was arranged, on terms very advantageous to the lady; and Lord Suffolk brought her to England, and she was married at Westminster. On what pretence this queen and her party charged the Duke of Gloucester with high treason within a couple of years, it is impossible to make out, the matter is so confused; but, they pretended that the King's life was in danger, and they took the duke prisoner. A fortnight afterwards, he was found dead in bed (they said), and his body was shown to the people, and Lord Suffolk came in for the best part of his estates. You know by this time how strangely <b>liable</b> <b>state</b> prisoners were to sudden death.|$|E

50|$|The {{publisher}} and the distributor did {{not object to}} jurisdiction in California.

The California Court of Appeal reversed, and the Supreme Court of California affirmed the appellate court's ruling. Calder appealed, as did the writer of the article, contending that the writer and editor of a magazine article were like welders of a boiler part.

5000|$|In {{the law of}} delict, O'Regan's {{contribution}} {{has been}} significant. In 2002, she wrote Khumalo v Holomisa, one of the Court's first judgments on defamation law and arguably its only judgment applying the Bill of Rights directly to private parties. In 2004, she delivered the Metrorail judgment, which holds that Metrorail {{has a duty to}} ensure the safety of commuters on its trains and is regarded as an [...] "exemplar" [...] by international commentators for its protection of the right to personal security. And in 2005, most famously, O'Regan gave judgment in K v Minister of Safety and Security, finding the <b>state</b> <b>liable</b> to compensate a plaintiff who was raped by a police officer. The judgment's radical expansion of the test for vicarious liability, following Bazley v Curry and Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd, was celebrated by women's rights groups but criticised by some academics. It has been approved and applied by the Court subsequently. The judgment is also still cited for its approach to the development of the common law and the use of comparative law. Finally, in Steenkamp NO v Provincial Tender Board, another case on the delictual liability of public authorities, O'Regan co-wrote a dissent (with Langa CJ) that would have held the <b>state</b> <b>liable</b> for pure economic loss caused to the winner of an unlawfully awarded tender.|$|R

40|$|Summary) The {{presented}} paper {{focuses on}} adjusting a state enterprise (state - owned enterprise) as a receding form of public enterprise. It sets upon itself a task of clarification, whether this legal form, {{which has been}} dominant in the past, is henceforth suitable {{for use in the}} present body of laws. Professional literature was studied to acquire relevant knowledge, legal provisions, judicial decisions, and other documents. State enterprise is a specific legal entity conducting business with national property, which has a unique public function and is supposed to generate net operating income. Its institutor can only be a state, that has a similar status as a sole partner of a business entity. Unlike other legal entities engaging in business, the state enterprise doesn't have a legal capacity to acquire assets for itself, but does acquire assets for the state. It is not <b>liable</b> for <b>state</b> obligations and <b>state</b> is not <b>liable</b> for obligations of the enterprise at the same time. This structure causes problems, because it is not consistent with a current legal rule. The paper examines general characteristics of state enterprise, historical development, effective legal enactment, property status of state enterprise, definition of sphere of authority between a founder and business bodies, and business [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|For example, Supreme Court {{decisions}} regarding the preemptive force of federal patent law confirm that individuals {{are free to}} copy any unpatentable article, such as a live farm animal, {{so long as they}} do not infringe a patented method of copying. Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. clarified that a state may not [...] "prohibit the copying of an article itself or award damages for such copying" [...] when that article is ineligible for patent protection. In Sears, the question was whether the defendant, Sears Roebuck & Co., could be held <b>liable</b> under <b>state</b> law for copying a lamp design whose patent protection had expired. The Court explained that [...] "when the patent expires the monopoly created by it expires, too, and the right to make the article—including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carried when patented—passes to the public." [...] The Court further clarified that [...] "an unpatentable article, like an article on which the patent has expired, is in the public domain and may be made and sold by whoever chooses to do so." [...] Roslin's claimed clones are exact genetic copies of patent ineligible subject matter. Accordingly, they are not eligible for patent protection.|$|R

There are many exceptions, however, in which federal courts, and occasionally federal agencies, may order the losing party to pay the attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party. The major common law exception authorizes federal courts (not agencies) to order a losing party that acts in bad faith to pay the prevailing party’s fees. This report discusses the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), which makes the United <b>States</b> <b>liable</b> for attorneys’ fees of up to $ 125 per hour in many court cases and administrative proceedings that it loses (and some that it wins) and fails to prove that its position was substantially justified...|$|R
