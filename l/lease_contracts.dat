25|$|Water supply, {{sewerage}} {{and wastewater}} treatment is a municipal responsibility in France. Many municipalities, {{in particular the}} smaller ones, have created municipal associations in order to benefit from economies of scale.

The main goal of the thesis is to analyze the institute of <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> and to highlight some problematic points of this legal regulation. The work is supplemented by judicial decisions of Czech courts and opinions of some authors. This work consists of three chapters. The Chapter one describes historical development of legislation of <b>lease</b> <b>contract,</b> especially in Roman law, legislation contained in General Civil Code of 1811 and the legislation included in the Czechoslovak Civil Code of 1950 and of 1964. The Chapter two is the main part of this work. It is subdivided into eight parts in which are discussed the general provisions of <b>lease</b> <b>contract.</b> First subchapter examines relevant Czech legislation, the second subpart is focused on concept of <b>lease</b> <b>contract.</b> The parties of <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> are described in the third part. The characteristic of creation of <b>lease</b> <b>contract</b> contains the fourth subchapter and the fifth subpart contains a detailed list of rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessee and their subsequent analysis.

25|$|Water {{privatization}} in France {{goes back}} to the mid-19th century when cities signed concessions with private water companies for the supply of drinking water. Today, according to the Ministry of Environment 75% of water and 50% of sanitation services in France are provided by the private sector, primarily by two firms, Veolia and Suez. In 1993 the Loi Sapin strengthened competition in the sector by limiting the duration of contracts to 20 years, among others. In 2010 the <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> for Paris with Suez and Veolia expired and the water system returned to public management.|$|E

The land amounted to , for which the Church asked $12,086,438.11 in March 1903. The purchase was completed on December 22, 1903 at a sale price of $7,239,784.66. The land redistribution program was stipulated in at least three laws: the Philippine Organic Act, the Public Lands Act and the Friar Lands Act. Section 10 of the Public Land Act limited purchases to a maximum of 16 hectares for an individual or 1024 hectares for a corporation or like association. Land was also offered for lease to landless farmers, at prices ranging from fifty centavos to one peso and fifty centavos per hectare per annum. Section 28 of the Public Lands Act stipulated that <b>lease</b> <b>contracts</b> may run for a maximum period of 25 years, renewable for another 25 years.|$|E

40|$|A {{monopolist}} {{selling a}} durable good cannot extract the whole amount of monopoly rents from consumers each period. This inefficiency {{is due to}} the incompleteness of contracts: The monopolist cannot credibly commit not to lower the price in future periods. By using <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> however the monopolist can solve this credibility problem, but then he is exposed to inefficiencies due to moral hazard. This leads many authors in the Durable Goods Literature to rule out <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts.</b> This paper's contribution is to show the invalidity of the moral hazard argument by using <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> that include an option to buy the good.

40|$|<b>Leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> are {{extensively}} used in {{durable goods}} markets. These contracts specify a rental rate and an option price {{at which the}} used good can be bought on termination of the lease. This option price cannot be controlled when the car is sold. We show that {{in a world in}} which quality is observable, this additional control variable is ineffective. Under adverse selection instead, <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> affect equilibrium allocations in a way that matches observed behavior in the car market. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that leased cars have a higher turnover and that off-lease used cars are of higher quality. Moreover, the model predicts that the recent increase in leasing can be explained by the observed increase in car durability. We show that <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> can improve welfare but that they are imperfect tools. We also show that a producer with market power can benefit from <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> for two reasons: market segmentation and better pricing of the option. Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection, we show that this is not in their interest. ...|$|R

We show that a social planner can use <b>leasing</b> <b>contracts</b> to improve welfare but they are imperfect tools; they cannot generally achieve first best while other mechanisms can.

Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection (by raising the option price so high that no lessee keeps the used good) we show that this is not in their interest; a keeping option will always be included in some contracts. ...|$|R
