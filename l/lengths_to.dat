5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films went to great <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers {{to take advantage of}} their built-in following.|$|E

After Earp's death on January 13, 1929, Josephine continued to try to persuade Lake to leave her and Earp's former wife, Mattie Blaylock, out of the book, even threatening legal action. Lake finally published Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal in 1931, two years after Earp's death.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, it was {{announced}} that Grint would star in the drama film Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon.

This film, like his next project, would involve him playing violent roles. Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, the film was initially unable to find a distributor.

5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel guilty about their behaviour, leading them to go to great <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E

2500|$|Like all Weatherby {{cartridge}}s, the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum cartridge has {{a double}} radius shoulder {{where the body}} and the neck are connected with a continuously curving shoulder; the curve of which reverses at the point of tangency. SAAMI defines the <b>length</b> <b>to</b> the shoulder as the demarcation point where the bottom of inside curvature radius (corresponding roughly to CIP's r1) [...] of the shoulder begins and the <b>length</b> <b>to</b> the neck as where the outside curvature radius (approximating CIP's r2) meets the neck. However, CIP does not define the location of the centers of the r1 and r2 whereas SAAMI provides this as being in inline with the <b>length</b> <b>to</b> the shoulder (inside radius) and <b>length</b> <b>to</b> neck (outside radius). This is due to the CIP treatment of r1 and r2 values as fillet radii as they do with many other cartridges.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{government}} of Bhutan goes to great <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> prevent outside influences from intruding on Bhutanese culture, Drukair is not immune to problems which affect the airline industry and the world community at large. In June 2008, citing hikes {{in the price of}} oil and the need to contain operational costs, the airline reduced frequencies across its network and announced an increase in airfares to offset the increased costs, whilst taking advantage of the lower cost of jet fuel at Delhi, Kolkata and Bangkok airports. Due to its small network which is reliant on fifth-freedom rights, Drukair regularly leases its aircraft to other airlines, such as Myanmar Airways International, Indian Airlines and Bangkok Airways in order to keep utilisation rates on its aircraft higher than they would under normal circumstances, whilst at the same time earning extra revenue.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the German {{invasion}} of Poland and subsequent outbreak of war in September 1939, the Yugoslav Intelligence Service was cooperating with British intelligence agencies on a large scale across the country. This cooperation, which had existed to a lesser extent during the early 1930s, intensified after the Anschluss in 1938. These combined intelligence operations were aimed at strengthening Yugoslavia and keeping her neutral while encouraging covert activities. In mid to late 1940, British intelligence became aware of coup plotting, but managed to side-track the plans, preferring to continue working through Prince Paul. The SOE office in Belgrade went to significant <b>lengths</b> <b>to</b> support the opposition to the anti-Axis Cvetković government, which undermined the hard-won balance in Yugoslav politics that government represented. SOE Belgrade was entangled with pro-Serb policies and interests, and disregarded or underestimated warnings from SOE and British diplomats in Zagreb, who better understood the situation in Yugoslavia as a whole.|$|E
