25|$|The first Angraecum hybrid {{was created}} by John Seden, an {{employee}} of Veitch Nurseries, and exhibited {{for the first time}} on January 10, 1899. It was named A. Veitchii, but it also commonly goes by the name King of the Angraceum hybrids. The cross was between A.sesquipedale and A.eburneum. The flowers somewhat resemble those of A. leonis. Additionally, the hybrid combines the traits controlling the flower's post-pollination changes. In the case of A.eburneum the flowers age such that the <b>labellum</b> curls inward with the sepals and lateral petals remaining mostly stationary whereas in the case of A.sesquipedale both the sepals and petals move except for the <b>labellum.</b> In the case of A. Veitchii both the petals, sepals, and <b>labellum</b> move inward. Another common cross involving A.sesquipedale is A. Crestwood, which is a cross between A. Veitchii and A.sesquipedale.|$|E
25|$|The {{two other}} species from Espírito Santo State are highly {{different}} from each other. Scuticaria kautskyi usually has more or less uniform orange color on its sepals and petals, with their bases slightly lighter and dotted of greenish yellow. Their <b>labellum</b> is white showing few colored drawings and narrow terminal lobe, slightly deflected. The other species from this state, Scuticaria novaesii presents flowers with green-yellow segments, intensely spotted with dark brown and wide and flat <b>labellum</b> terminal lobe, with clearly marked by radial multicolored lines.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the second}} {{subgroup}} {{there is only}} Bifrenaria aureofulva, easily identifiable because of its bright orange flowers with acute sepals, petals and <b>labellum,</b> which do not open well.|$|E
25|$|The {{last two}} Scuticariaare {{isolated}} in forests of Peru and Ecuador and {{are similar to}} each other. They are different from all other because of the proportions of floral segments. The <b>labellum</b> is much larger when compared to their sepals and petals than it is on other species. Moreover, their petals are striped of brown and {{much smaller than the}} sepals, showing a greater difference than it is found on the other species. From each other, they can be separated mostly by the shape of the <b>labellum.</b> Scuticaria salesiana presents more rounded intermediate lobe, and Scuticaria peruviana has it more rectangular, with the apex truncated, almost in a straight line.|$|E
25|$|The first {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by plants that show a pollinarium with entire stipe and a salient callus just on its anterior region. The species are two, Bifrenaria calcarata, That has the intermadiate lobe of the <b>labellum</b> approximately triangular and the lateral ones square, and B. mellicolor, {{which has more}} rounded lobes. These species are similar and preferably epiphytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{mouthparts}} {{of insects}} that feed on fluids are modified {{in various ways}} to form a tube through which liquid can be drawn into the mouth and usually another through which saliva passes. The muscles of the cibarium or pharynx are strongly developed to form a pump. In nonbiting flies, the mandibles are absent and other structures are reduced; the labial palps have become modified to form the <b>labellum,</b> and the maxillary palps are present, although sometimes short. In Brachycera, the <b>labellum</b> is especially prominent and used for sponging liquid or semiliquid food. The labella are a complex structure consisting of many grooves, called pseudotrachea, which sops up liquids. Salivary secretions from the labella assist in dissolving and collecting food particles {{so they can be}} more easily taken up by the pseudotracheae; this is thought to occur by capillary action. The liquid food is then drawn up from the pseudotracheae through the food channel into the esophagus.|$|E
25|$|The third {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by the four species with a bifurcated stipe: Bifrenaria atropurpurea, {{the only one with}} a cuneated viscidium; B. tyrianthina, the only to have rounded viscidium; B. inodora with greenish flowers and two lobed callus; and B. harrisoniae, highly variable species of several colors, that always has three lobed callus on the <b>labellum.</b> The species of this group are often or exclusively lithophytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{composed}} of three sepals and three petals that are seldom noticed by people, they are small and hidden under extravagant stamens. What appear to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1–) 3 (–4) (with at least one staminodal member called the <b>labellum,</b> always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower 'petal' is the pistil which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.|$|E
25|$|The last {{subgroup}} {{is formed}} by species that present petals oblique to the column. Two have petals and sepals marked with other colors: Bifrenaria clavigera, {{that has a}} calcar formed by the fusion of the lateral sepals bases, and Bifrenaria silvana where the calcar {{is a result of}} their superposition; Bifrenaria leucorhoda has white flowers with <b>labellum</b> veined of pink color. The two remaining species have highly similar yellow flowers, although of diverse sizes, the smaller and often paler is Bifrenaria stefanae, the larger and of brighter color is Bifrenaria vitellina.|$|E
25|$|All species {{remaining}} are ephiphytic with pendent habit. Scuticaria hadwenii, {{due to its}} {{several more}} or less isolated groups of populations along Serra do Mar, mostly {{on the west side}} of this chain of mountains, spreading throughout the interior highland in some states of Brazil, is the Scuticaria species that presents most variable colors. It can be separated from S. strictifolia because shows leaves always pending, flowers of more vivid colors and by the interior of the <b>labellum,</b> which ordinarily is more pubescent. There is a variety denominated dogsonii, native from Guyana, which is more floriferous.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} {{typically}} red, orange, or yellow or {{any combination of}} those colours, and are aggregated in inflorescences that are spikes or panicles (thyrses). Although gardeners enjoy these odd flowers, nature really intended them to attract pollinators collecting nectar and pollen, such as bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and bats. The pollination mechanism is conspicuously specialized. Pollen is shed on the style while still in the bud, and in the species and early hybrids some is also found on the stigma {{because of the high}} position of the anther, which means that they are self-pollinating. Later cultivars have a lower anther, and rely on pollinators alighting on the <b>labellum</b> and touching first the terminal stigma, and then the pollen.|$|E
25|$|Only {{two species}} present erect leaves {{and are the}} only ones {{frequently}} found as lithophytes, Scuticaria irwiniana, easily known recognized because of its flowers without any stains on the internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white <b>labellum,</b> striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer rhizome than any other species. Scuticaria strictifolia also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and slightly bent making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from S. hadwenii. The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later.|$|E
25|$|The species {{subordinated to}} genus Scuticaria are {{characterized}} by being plants of thick cylindrical roots covered by thick vellamen. Their stem is formed by an ordinarily short rhizome, slightly elongated in some species; and by cylindrical almost inconspicuous pseudobulbs of the same diameter or slightly thicker than the unique leaf born on their apexes, because they generally are covered by small dried scaling steaths. The leaves may be erect or pending up to one meter long. The inflorescences grow from the said steaths and almost always bear just one flower, exceptionally two in one species, and always is much longer than the pseudobulbs, bearing showy yellow, orange, purple or greenish flowers, with petals and sepals plain, stained or striped, usually by light brown but also by diverse combinations and shades of the other mentioned colors. Ordinarily the <b>labellum</b> presents contrasting colors, frequently with white areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} large, wide open, and last during about two weeks. They have sepals of similar sizes and form an almost {{invisible}} chin with the column foot. The petals may {{be similar to}} the sepals but smaller, or much smaller and with a much narrower base, occasionally showing different patterns or colors. The <b>labellum</b> articulates with the column, is trilobed, with comparatively small lateral lobes and larger terminal, which has variable shapes with diverse patterns and a callus under to column. The later is é semi-cylindrical, slightly arching, erect and thick, without any kind of appendix, ending in an apical anther and elongated in a small foot at the base. The flowers bear to pairs of pollinia of different sizes. The caudicle is narrow and the retinacle is small. The fruits resemble the ones of Maxillaria. There are no observation records of pollinators activities but Scuticaria are supposedly pollinated by Euglossini bees.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about {{pollination}} in Bifrenaria. Apparently the only existing records report the presence of some large species' pollinia observed {{on the back of}} male Eufriesea violacea bees (Euglossinae), and of Bombus brasiliensis (Bombini). Although there are no reports of flower pollination being directly observed, a paper published in 2006 studied the micromorphology of the <b>labellum</b> in Bifrenaria species, looking for substances useful to insects as food. The absence of such substances on the densely pubescent surface of most Bifrenaria labelli seems to indicate possible pollination by large bees as the major mean. Another indicator of this possibility is the strong smell emanated by species like B. tetragona which {{are similar to those of}} plants in other families which are also pollinated by these bees. The smaller pubescent species may be pollinated by smaller bees, while the smooth ones, which have strong colored flowers, as B. aureofulva, might be pollinated by hummingbirds.|$|E
25|$|Two species {{similar to}} Bifrenaria, but {{that showed a}} highly salient claw {{at the base of}} the <b>labellum</b> and lateral lobes {{abruptly}} divided were then classified under this genus. In 1914, Rudolf Schlechter suggested they should be classified under the genus Lindleyella, with Lindley's Bifrenaria aurantiaca (which presented the mentioned differences) as the type. However this genus name was already occupied (It is a synonym of Lindleya, in the Rosaceae). Just thirty years later, in 1944, Frederico Carlos Hoehne, working on the first revision of genus Bifrenaria, corrected the suggestion of Schlechter. Hoehne initially proposed the genus Schlechterella for these species but, coincidentally, this name was also taken, this time by African Asclepiadaceae. Finally a genus with an available name in homage to Schlechter was erected in the very next issue of the journal, Rudolfiella, by which time the number of species had increased to seven. On this revision, besides Rudolfiella, Hoehne divided Bifrenaria into two genera, accepting Lindley's Stenocoryne but calling attention to the existence of Rafinesque's Adipe, which should have nomenclatural priority, while also raising doubts about the identity of several described species. In 1990, Manfred Wolff formally resurrected the genus Adipe and transferred to it ten Bifrenaria species, besides the two already described by Rafinesque; his change was purely nomenclatural and he did not revisit the species.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} chapter Darwin {{described}} the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects. The first mechanism described is that of Orchis mascula, which serves as {{an introduction to the}} explanation of other Orchidaceae. In {{the upper part of the}} flower a petal shelters the male organ which has two packages of pollen grains, held together by thin elastic threads. These pollen masses stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the <b>labellum,</b> and pushes its head and proboscis into the centre of the flower and down to the nectary, it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the female organ, achieving cross fertilisation. Darwin envisaged: ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{subgroup}} also {{is formed}} by plants that show a pollinarium with entire stipe but the callus is entirely salient and fleshy. It is {{formed by the}} two species Senghas moved to genus Cydoniorchis, [...] Bifrenaria tetragona that presents a totally smooth <b>labellum</b> with rounded apex, and B. wittigii, that has a partially pubescent <b>labellum</b> of acute apex.|$|E
2500|$|Large species: is {{the group}} {{originally}} classified as Bifrenaria. They present four sided pseudobulbs, with relatively short and erect inflorescence bearing up to ten fleshy large flowers but generally less. Usually the flowers are grouped and are fragrant or exhale strong scent. The <b>labellum</b> has three or four lobes and an elongated low callus. They are epiphytes, or often lithophytes. All originated in the southeast of Brazil. This group can be split in three subgroups: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{appearance}} of the petals and sepals is similar, both are elongated although the petals are slightly more narrow. Flower colors are generally greenish, white or variable shades of pink and the <b>labellum</b> (a special petal attractive to pollinators) can be spotted in pale yellow, light purple or lilac. The <b>labellum</b> is located along the column and trilobed (three lobes). [...] The lateral lobes are small and raised beside the column, although never involving it. The intermediate lobe is much bigger and quite variable between species. They can have either lanceolate or obovate shape, occasionally be fleshy, flat or bending backwards; in some species they have denticulated edges but are smooth in others. Rarely, calli are present, with claws holding them attached {{to the sides of}} the column. The column is short, thick and erect, normally greenish, biauriculated, and bears six pollinia of different sizes, two larger in the center and four smaller in two pairs held by a short caudicle in an arrangement that is unique among orchids. Their fruits are rounded, succulent and have a perfume reminiscent of [...] vanilla.: The Cattleyas and Their Relatives, Vol. 3, pp.94-95. Timber Press, Oregon.|$|E
2500|$|Small species: {{is formed}} by the plants that once belonged to Stenocoryne, or more accurately, [...] Adipe, which {{normally}} are epiphytes. They present smaller and not as noticeably four sided pseudobulbs, and long and delicate inflorescence bearing a higher medium number of flowers than the large species, although also never surpassing ten. The flowers are smaller and not fleshy, with an entire <b>labellum,</b> or sometimes slightly lobed on the apex. These species take less luminosoty and more humidity than those and are not particularly fragrant. According to their morphology they can be split in four distinct subgroups: ...|$|E
2500|$|Almost one century {{passed before}} any {{important}} new information were published. In 1881 Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach described Scuticaria dogsonii, originated from Guyana, but in 1892, Berthold Stein, {{considering that the}} only difference it shows from Scuticaria hadwenii is the fact it bears two flowers each inflorescence, reduced it {{to a variety of}} the later.: Scuticaria hadwenii var. dogsonii in Orchideenbuch, 1892. In 1903, Célestin Alfred Cogniaux, when revising all orchids species from Brazil, cites two other varieties of Scuticaria hadwenii which, because just show color differences, can not be accepted as such today.: Scuticaria in Flora Brasiliensis Vol.3 Part.6: [...] pp. 78-81. K.F.P. von Martius Ed., 1903. [...] Finally, in 1947, Frederico Carlos Hoehne described a new species, Scuticaria strictifolia, yet similar to Scuticaria hadwenii, although showing some slight differences on the <b>labellum</b> structure, besides their normally lithophytic habit and erect leaves.: Scuticaria strictifolia in Arquivos de Botânica do Estado de Sao Paulo, n.s, f.n.2, pp. 88. Instituto de Botânica de São Paulo, 1947.|$|E
2500|$|Bifrenaria {{flowers are}} {{strongly}} scented, they have sepals {{slightly larger than}} the petals, with the lateral ones basally united to the column foot forming a calcar with truncated extremity.The column is slightly arching, generally without wings or any other appendages, bearing a foot [...] which the <b>labellum</b> is hinged to, whose shape varies, articulated to the column, with a longitudinal channeled callus often with a basal claw. Flowers show two elongated stipes, hardy ever one, at least twice longer than wide, with salient viscidium, visible caudicles and retinacle in inverted positions. The superposed pollinia number four, and are protected by a deciduous incumbent anther. Fruits are green, erect or pendulous; they take about eight months to ripe and hold hundreds of thousand yellowish or brownish elongated seeds up to 0.35mm long. Among all the mentioned, the main characteristic distinguishing Bifrenaria from its closest relatives {{is the presence of}} the calcar. Other important characters are the four-sided single-leaved pseudobulbs besides the raceme inflorescence with two to ten flowers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fertilization}} of A.sesquipedale {{has been}} observed to proceed as follows. The moth approaches the flower to ascertain by scent {{whether or not it}} is the correct orchid species. [...] Then the moth backs up over a foot and unrolls its proboscis, then flies forward, inserting it into a cleft in the rostellum which leads to the spur while gripping the <b>labellum.</b> After the moth has finished drinking the nectar, which usually takes about 6seconds, it instinctively raises its head while removing its proboscis from the spur, and in doing so causes the viscidium to adhere to its proboscis usually about [...] from its base. Attached to the viscidium via the caudicle is the pollinia. Upon removing its proboscis from the flower, the pollinarium stalk will be straight and parallel with the moth's proboscis. Then after leaving the orchid the caudicle will eventually dry out, causing its angle relative to the moth's proboscis to change by 90° so that it is at the correct angle to attach to the stigma of the next orchid the moth visits. The moth then repeats this process at another A.sesquipedale orchid and simultaneously fertilizes it. Once the flower has been fertilized, it quickly stops producing its powerful scent.|$|E
60|$|The {{flowers were}} white, with streaks of golden orange upon the petals; the heavy <b>labellum</b> was coiled into an {{intricate}} projection, {{and a wonderful}} bluish purple mingled there with the gold. He could see at once that the genus was altogether a new one. And the insufferable scent! How hot the place was! The blossoms swam before his eyes.|$|E
60|$|In some {{few cases}} the special {{movements}} of certain organs almost ensure pollen being carried from plant to plant. Thus with many orchids, the pollen-masses after becoming {{attached to the}} head or proboscis of an insect do not move into the proper position for striking the stigma, until ample time has elapsed for the insect to fly to another plant. With Spiranthes autumnalis, the pollen-masses {{cannot be applied to}} the stigma until the <b>labellum</b> and rostellum have moved apart, and this movement is very slow. (10/35. 'The Various Contrivances by which British and Foreign Orchids are fertilised' first edition page 128.) With Posoqueria fragrans (one of the Rubiaceae) the same end is gained by the movement of a specially constructed stamen, as described by Fritz Muller.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the most}} curious and {{beautiful}} case of alluring protection {{is that of}} a wingless Mantis in India, which is so formed and coloured as to resemble a pink orchis or some other fantastic flower. The whole insect is of a bright pink colour, the large and oval abdomen looking like the <b>labellum</b> of an orchid. On each side, the two posterior legs have immensely dilated and flattened thighs which represent the petals of a flower, while the neck and forelegs imitate the upper sepal and column of an orchid. The insect rests motionless, in this symmetrical attitude, among bright green foliage, being of course very conspicuous, but so exactly resembling a flower that butterflies and other insects settle upon it and are instantly captured. It is a living trap, baited in the most alluring manner to catch the unwary flower-haunting insects.[80] ...|$|E
6000|$|The buying of orchids {{always has}} in it a certain {{speculative}} flavour. You have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, {{and for the}} rest you must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste may incline. The plant may be moribund or dead, or it may be just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money, or perhaps--for the thing has happened again and again--there slowly unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after day, some new variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the <b>labellum,</b> or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry. Pride, beauty, and profit blossom together on one delicate green spike, and, it may be, even immortality. For the new miracle of Nature may stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as that of its discoverer? [...] "Johnsmithia"! There have been worse names.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is curious," [...] {{says the}} Duke of Argyll, [...] "to observe the {{language}} which this most advanced disciple of pure naturalism instinctively uses, {{when he has}} to describe the complicated structure of this curious order of plants (the Orchids). 'Caution in ascribing intentions to nature,' does not seem to occur to him as possible. Intention is the one thing which he does see, and which, when he does not see, he seeks for diligently until he finds it. He exhausts every form of words and of illustration, by which intention or mental purpose can be described. 'Contrivance'--'curious contrivance,'--'beautiful contrivance,'--these are expressions which occur over and over again. Here is one sentence describing the parts of a particular species: 'the <b>Labellum</b> is developed into a long nectary, in order to attract Lepidoptera, and we shall presently give reason for suspecting that the nectar is purposely so lodged, that it can be sucked only slowly in order to give time for the curious chemical quality of the viscid matter setting hard and dry.'" [...] Many other examples of similar expressions are quoted by the Duke, who maintains that no explanation of these [...] "contrivances" [...] has been or can be given, except on the supposition of a personal contriver, specially arranging the details of each case, although causing them to be produced by the ordinary processes of growth and reproduction.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would appear}} that either the taste or the odour of the nectar of certain flowers is unattractive to hive or to humble-bees, or to both; for there seems no other reason why certain open flowers which secrete nectar are not visited by them. The small {{quantity}} of nectar secreted by some of these flowers can hardly {{be the cause of}} their neglect, as hive-bees search eagerly for the minute drops on the glands on the leaves of the Prunus laurocerasus. Even the bees from different hives sometimes visit different kinds of flowers, as {{is said to be the}} case by Mr. Grant with respect to the Polyanthus and Viola tricolor. (11/9. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1844 page 374.) I have known humble-bees to visit the flowers of Lobelia fulgens in one garden and not in another at the distance of only a few miles. The cupful of nectar in the <b>labellum</b> of Epipactis latifolia is never touched by hive- or humble-bees, although I have seen them flying close by; and yet the nectar has a pleasant taste to us, and is habitually consumed by the common wasp. As far as I have seen, wasps seek for nectar in this country only from the flowers of this Epipactis, Scrophularia aquatica, Symphoricarpus racemosa (11/10. The same fact apparently holds good in Italy, for Delpino says that the flowers of these three plants are alone visited by wasps: 'Nettarii Estranuziali, Bulletino Entomologico' anno 6.), and Tritoma; the two former plants being endemic, and the two latter exotic. As wasps are so fond of sugar and of any sweet fluid, and as they do not disdain the minute drops on the glands of Prunus laurocerasus, it is a strange fact that they do not suck the nectar of many open flowers, which they could do without the aid of a proboscis. Hive-bees visit the flowers of the Symphoricarpus and Tritoma, and this makes it all the stranger that they do not visit the flowers of the Epipactis, or, as far as I have seen, those of the Scrophularia aquatica; although they do visit the flowers of Scrophularia nodosa, at least in North America. (11/11. 'Silliman's American Journal of Science' August 1871.) ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>labellum</b> of Corsia {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the <b>labellum</b> of some orchids, but is not homologous to them; in orchids the <b>labellum</b> is formed from an inner tepal (petal), but in Corsiaceae it forms from an outer tepal (sepal).
