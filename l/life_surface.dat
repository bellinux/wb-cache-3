The quality and cost are much related to tool <b>life,</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and cutting forces which they are functions of process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and tool nose radius). In this paper, empirical models for tool <b>life,</b> <b>surface</b> roughness and cutting force are developed for turning operations. The process parameters (cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut and tool nose radius) are used as inputs to the developed machineability models. Two data mining techniques are used; response surface methodology and neural networks. The data of 28 experiments {{have been used to}} generate, compare and evaluate the proposed models of tool life, cutting force and surface roughness for the selected tool/material combination. The resulting models are utilized to formulate an optimization model and solved to find optimal process parameters, when the objective is minimizing production cost per workpiece, taking into account the related boundaries and limitation of this multi-pass turning operations. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the suggested optimization models. King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabi...|$|E

For the cutting fluids, inedible vegetable oils are potential for minimum quantity lubrication machining. Castor oil was selected in this study as the cutting fluid for turning of hardened stainless steel (hardness of 47 – 48 [*]HRC). The hard turning was with minimum quantity lubrication (50 [*]mL/h flow rate and 5 [*]bar air pressure) at various cutting speeds (100, 135, and 170 [*]m/min) and feeds (0. 16, 0. 20, and 0. 24 [*]mm/rev). The machining responses were tool <b>life,</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, and cutting forces. Design of experiments was applied to quantify the effects of cutting parameters to the machining responses. Empirical models for tool <b>life,</b> <b>surface</b> roughness, and cutting forces were developed {{within the range of}} cutting parameters selected. All machining responses are significantly influenced by the cutting speed and feed. Tool life is inversely proportional to cutting speed and feed. Surface roughness is inversely proportional to cutting speed yet is proportional to feed. Cutting forces are more influenced by feed than by cutting speed. A combination of low cutting speed and feed was the optimum cutting parameters to achieve long tool life, low surface roughness, and low cutting forces...|$|E

40|$|Nickel-based alloy can {{be found}} in {{different}} industrial applications especially in aircraft engines and hot end components of various types of gas turbines with its high strength, strong corrosion resistance and excellent thermal fatigue properties and thermal stability compared to conventional materials. However, nickel-based alloy is one of the extremely difficult-to-cut materials. During the machining process, the interaction between the tool and the workpiece causes severe plastic deformation and intense friction at the tool-workpiece interface. Because of the increasing demands in industries, any improvement of conventional machining processes or any other deployment of additional technique is directly related to higher productivity. Thermal-assisted machining (TAM) has become an effective alternative to the conventional machining of these difficult-to-cut materials. Various types of heating methods and the beneficial effects on machining of nickel-based alloys are discussed in this chapter.

In this paper an attempt {{has been presented}} in order to study the influence of cutter geometry and cutter coating upon these three output parameters. Series of high-speed side milling experiments were done upon hardened AISI 4340 and AISI D 2 steels using coated and uncoated carbide cutters. Mechanisms of wear occurring in different tools have been described in the paper using SEM photographs and micro-analysis of the tool surface. The analysis of experimental data shows that the coated carbide cutters having high values of helix angle and small values of rake angle, in the negative range, provide the better optimization of high-speed milling of hardened steels. Results imply that tool geometry and coating are influential upon cutting forces and tool wear but not upon surface quality.
