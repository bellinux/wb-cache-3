50|$|A simple form of {{directional}} antenna is the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial.</b> This {{consists of an}} open loop of wire on an insulating former, or a metal ring that forms the antenna elements itself, where {{the diameter of the}} loop is a tenth of a wavelength or smaller at the target frequency. Such an antenna will be least sensitive to signals that are normal to its face and most responsive to those meeting edge-on. This is caused by the phase output of the transmitting beacon. The phase changing phase causes a difference between the voltages induced {{on either side of the}} loop at any instant. Turning the loop face on will not induce any current flow. Simply turning the antenna to obtain minimum signal will establish two possible directions from which the signal could be emanating. The NULL is used, as small angular deflections of the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> near its null positions produce larger changes in current than similar angular changes near the loops max positions. For this reason, a null position of the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> is used.|$|E
50|$|Dip (bank) angle : during turns, the {{horizontal}} {{part of the}} <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> {{will no longer be}} horizontal and detect a signal. This causes displacement of the null in a way similar to the night effect giving an erroneous reading on the indicator which means that the pilot should not obtain a bearing unless the aircraft is wings level.|$|E

40|$|During {{the period}} 1967 [...] 1970 the phase and {{amplitude}} of twelve LF and VLF radiowave transmissions were monitored at Leicester for periods ranging from {{three years to}} a few weeks; the path lengths varied between 27 km and 8, 600 km. The records taken were analyzed to extract the diurnal and seasonal behaviour of the signals. The horizontally polarized skywave of six local (U. K.) transmissions were isolated using <b>loop</b> <b>aerials</b> designed and built during the project, {{and the value of}} the ionospheric conversion coefficient R at noon and midnight throughout the year was obtained from the records. The apparent height of reflection was also measured. Full-wave calculations were performed to test several published models of the ionospheric D-region for consistency with the measurements. Modified models were also tested and new models for winter days, and for nights throughout the year were derived. TM mode propagation of VLF transmissions on eight long paths was examined, and TE mode propagation on three long paths was also examined at two receiving sites using orthogonal <b>loop</b> <b>aerials</b> to isolate the TE and TM modes. Measurements were found to be consistent with published predicted values of relevant ionospheric parameters. Disturbances resulting from solar flare activity were observed on all the paths and the anomalies present in the records were examined in detail. The contrasting response of the different paths was noted. Comparison of selected anomalies with the incident flux of X-radiation enabled an explanation for the different response of the various paths to be found. The effect of Polar Cap Disturbances and the influx of solar cosmic rays on transmission paths at different magnetic latitudes was also examined, and the anomalous response of a low latitude path during these geophysical disturbances was discovered...|$|R

50|$|University Radio Exeter {{was founded}} in 1976, under the stairs of Devonshire House {{on the campus of}} the University of Exeter. At that time, of course, the only means of {{broadcasting}} was very low power, using induction <b>loop</b> <b>aerials</b> to broadcast to Halls of residence. Initially the transmitter was installed in the studio. This meant feeding a coaxial cable, carrying the RF signal, just below ground level from Devonshire House to Lafrowda halls of residence. This probably only covered 500 people maximum but seemed to work adequately for around 6 months, until 6 months of gardeners' spade abuse had reduced the transmitter cable to shreds. A rethink resulted in the transmitters being moved to the halls of residence, with the feed from the studio to the halls using cables leased from British Telecom.|$|R

40|$|A {{telemetry}} {{system for}} studying decapod crustacean behaviour is described which uses low frequency, digitally encoded electromagnetic tags whose signals are detected with {{a grid of}} <b>loop</b> <b>aerials</b> on the seabed. Electromagnetic telemetry {{can be used to}} study short range movements of cryptic animals in topographically complex habitats that are not amenable to ultrasonic telemetry. Digital encoding allows many individuals to be monitored simultaneously and one or more behavioural, physiological or environmental variables to be telemetered. In the present system, tag signals convey identity and a measure of activity derived from an integral tilt switch. Translocational movements are indicated by detection of tags with different aerials. A central data logger located on the seabed decodes and records tag signals and environmental measurements. Design life of tags is > 1 year and the receiving system batteries are replaced by divers at intervals of up to 4 weeks. In field tests, crab (Cancer pagurus L.) and lobster (Homarus gammarus (L.)) activity was monitored at an artificial reef for 14 months. Examples of the type of information acquired are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the system and potential applications are discussed. Limitations of digital electromagnetic telemetry stem mainly from the short range of detection, the need for cables on the seabed and {{the size and shape of}} the transmitting tag...|$|R
50|$|To {{resolve the}} two {{direction}} possibilities, a sense antenna is used, the sense aerial has no directional properties {{but has the}} same sensitivity as the <b>loop</b> <b>aerial.</b> By adding the steady signal from the sense aerial to the alternating signal from the loop signal as it rotates, there is now only one position as the loop rotates 360° at which there is zero current. This acts as a phase ref point, allowing the correct null point to be identified, thus removing the 180° ambiguity. A dipole antenna exhibits similar properties, and {{is the basis for}} the Yagi antenna, which is familiar as the common VHF or UHF television aerial. For much higher frequencies still, parabolic antennas can be used, which are highly directional, focusing received signals from a very narrow angle to a receiving element at the centre.|$|E
5000|$|FuG 10 series: A {{family of}} {{transceivers}} for both R/T and W/T communications. The German FuG 10 panel, or rack, contained two transmitters and two receivers: One transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the MF or Longwave; 300 to 600 kHz (1,000 to 500 m) range {{and the other}} transmitter and its companion receiver operated in the HF or Shortwave range; 3 to 6 MHz (100 to 50 m). Most of the FuG 10 series used a fixed wire aerial between the fuselage and tailfin or a retractable trailing aerial wire. The FuG 10P replaced the standard E 10L longwave receiver with an EZ6 unit for a G6 direction finding set. The FuG 10ZY incorporated a fixed loop D/F aerial and a homing device for navigation to a ground station. This <b>loop</b> <b>aerial,</b> usually fitted on a small, [...] "teardrop" [...] shaped mounting, was standard equipment on most fighter aircraft from late 1943 on. Manufactured by Lorenz.

5000|$|Greenleaf Whittier Pickard (February 14, 1877, Portland, Maine- January 8, 1956, Newton, Massachusetts) was a United States radio pioneer. Pickard was a {{researcher}} {{in the early}} days of wireless. He was responsible for the development of the crystal detector, (cat's whisker detector), a radio wave detector which was the central component in early radio receivers called crystal radios, which were the most widely used radio receivers until about 1920 and continued to be used until World War 2. He also experimented with antennas, radio wave propagation, and noise suppression.On August 30, 1906 he filed a patent for a silicon crystal detector, which was granted on November 20, 1906. Pickard's detector was revolutionary in that he found that a fine pointed wire known as a [...] "cat's whisker," [...] in delicate contact with a mineral produced the best semiconductor effect. On June 10, 1907, he filed a patent for a Magnetic Aerial (a <b>loop</b> <b>aerial)</b> which was granted on January 21, 1908. Pickard's loop antenna had directional properties that could be used to reduce interference to the intended wireless communications. Greenleaf Whittier Pickard was named after his great-uncle, the American Quaker John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892). Pickard was president of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1913.|$|E

40|$|An active {{transponder}} system {{adapted for}} animal behaviour studies is described, {{and the potential}} of the system to facilitate patch scale monitoring of grazing cows is explored. A preliminary experiment examined the effect of presence and colour of <b>loop</b> <b>aerial</b> wires, on the activity of grazing cattle. Results from brown and white aerials pegged {{on the surface of the}} ground were compared with those from aerials buried at a depth of 5 cm. There was no effect of colour or burial of aerial on total number of contacts, or in time duration of cows within patches (P> 0. 001). Further experiments were conducted to examine potential sources of variation in the reading range of aerials. Reading range declined with reduction in aerial size and as the height of the transponder above ground level increased. Detection distance from a square aerial varied according to the transponder direction of approach, whereas direction of approach around the circumference of a circular aerial had little affect on detection distance. Reading range was greatest when orientation of the transponder tag to an aerial was vertical compared to horizontal. Implications of the results for studies of grazing activity are discussed and it is concluded that the field based active transponder system used in this experiment offers potential when recording patch level investigative behaviour of grazing animals. However, the effect of variability in reading range of aerials and potential variability in transponder height need to be considered when interpreting results from a field based active transponder system...|$|E

5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings fanning out wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an <b>aerial</b> <b>loop</b> or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|R
50|$|The {{mating season}} of the species varies {{geographically}} but is almost always {{in the first half}} of the year. In the northern reaches of the range, the breeding season is mid-April through July, whereas in Trinidad and Ecuador, it is February through June. Eggs have been found as late as August in Colombia, implying an only loose breeding season in the true tropics. The mating pair perform a courtship display, which may include engaging in <b>aerial</b> <b>loops,</b> dives and rolls with each other. The nest is typical of hawks: a big, bulky assemblage of sticks, lined with green leaves, usually built in the top or in the main fork of a tree, in this case at 7.5 to 30 m above the ground. Typically, tall trees such as a cottonwood or pine tree are selected, and the nest may be in the open or concealed by foliage. Occasionally, nests are found on cliffs.|$|R
