5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E

In the process, its name was changed to Auriscalpium vulgare.|$|E
5|$|Andrić {{initially}} had {{a precarious}} {{relationship with the}} communists because he had previously been an official in the royalist government. He returned to public life only once the Germans had been forced out of Belgrade. Na Drini ćuprija was published in March 1945. It was followed by Travnička hronika that September and Gospođica (The Young Lady) that November. Na Drini ćuprija came {{to be regarded as}} Andrić's magnum opus and was proclaimed a classic of Yugoslav <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> the communists. It chronicles the history of the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge and the town of Višegrad from the bridge's construction in the 16th century until the outbreak of World War I. The second novel, Travnička hronika, follows a French diplomat in Bosnia during the Napoleonic Wars. The third, Gospođica, revolves around the life of a Sarajevan woman. In the post-war period, Andrić also published several short story collections, some travel memoirs, and a number of essays on writers such as Vuk Karadžić, Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, and Petar Kočić.|$|E

5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
5|$|Dox wrote prolifically {{over the}} course of his career, {{yielding}} nine poem anthologies, numerous books in prose, and sixteen plays along Biblical themes or Malagasy history and folk tales. In addition, he wrote a number of plays on commission for various clients, with many commissioned by Boy Scout troupes, although these have since been lost. His translation from French to Malagasy of three major Western novels was significant because they enriched Malagasy <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> introducing elements of the novel form that had never before been attempted in Malagasy language. These efforts demonstrated to other Malagasy language writers the versatility of the language and the possibility that it could be used for any literary form.|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

5|$|Stropharia caerulea {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in the scientific <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> James Bolton in 1788, under the name Agaricus politus. This usage is not considered valid according to nomenclatural rules, because it was used by Christian Hendrik Persoon to refer to another species in his 1801 Synopsis methodica fungorum, which is a sanctioned work. Stropharia caerulea was officially described by mycologist Hanns Kreisel in 1979 from collections made near Woldegk, Germany. Machiel Noordeloos transferred the species to Psilocybe in 1995, but today this genus is mostly reserved for species that contain the psychoactive compounds psilocybin and psilocin. Although psilocybin had once been reported from S.caerulea, subsequent analyses have not revealed any traces of the substance in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English <b>Literature.</b> <b>By</b> exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and had mastered the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E

Identical in pattern to one at the Reindeer Inn in Banbury, of which the Victoria and Albert Museum has a plaster cast, it was presumably originally {{the work of the}} same craftsman. One of the state bedrooms has another survivor of the fire, a Jacobean stone fireplace with a plaster overmantel relief depicting Cain and Abel.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in the scientific <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> the Czech physician and mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz in 1828, under the name Morchella bohemica. The German naturalist Joseph Schröter transferred it to the genus Verpa in 1893. Ptychoverpa bohemica is a synonym that was published by Frenchman Jean Louis Émile Boudier in his 1907 treatise on the Discomycetes of Europe; the name is still occasionally used, especially in European publications. Boudier believed that the large, curved ascospores and the rare and short paraphyses were sufficiently distinct to warrant a new genus to contain the single species. Ptychoverpa has also been classified as a section of Verpa. The section {{is characterized by the}} presence of thick longitudinal ridges on the cap that can be simple or forked.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the age of}} the shatpadi metre, {{although}} only the most skilled of poets, such as Chamarasa, Kumara Vyasa, Kanaka Dasa and Bhaskara used it to the best effect. Mentioned {{for the first time in}} Kannada <b>literature</b> <b>by</b> NagavarmaI in his Chhandombudhi (c.990) and successfully used by the 12th century Hoysala poet Raghavanka, this hexa-metre style suited for narrative poetry found immense popularity throughout the Vijayanagara period. The shataka metre (string of 100 verses) was put to best use by the Veerashaivas who produced most of the didactic writings in this metre, although the Jain poet Ratnakaravarni is the most famous exponent of it. The writings of Ratnakaravarni and Kanaka Dasa in sangatya metre are considered masterpieces from this period.|$|E
