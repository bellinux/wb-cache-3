5|$|VERA is a <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactor {{simulation}} {{written at}} the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of <b>Light</b> <b>Water</b> Reactors (CASL) on Jaguar. VERA allows engineers {{to monitor the}} performance and status of any part of a reactor core throughout the lifetime of the reactor to identify points of interest. Although {{not one of the}} first six projects, VERA was planned to run on Titan after optimization with assistance from CAAR and testing on TitanDev. Computer scientist Tom Evans found that the adaption to Titan's hybrid architecture was more difficult than to previous CPU-based supercomputers. He aimed to simulate an entire reactor fuel cycle, an eighteen to thirty-six month-long process, in one week on Titan.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{improves}} total burnup. A {{fuel rod}} is reprocessed {{after three years}} of use to remove waste products, which by then account for 3% of the total weight of the rods. Any uranium or plutonium isotopes produced during those three years are left and the rod goes back into production. The presence of up to 1% gallium per mass in weapons-grade plutonium alloy has the potential to interfere with long-term operation of a <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactor.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{chemical}} process, PUREX (Plutonium–URanium EXtraction) reprocesses {{spent nuclear fuel}} to extract plutonium and uranium {{which can be used}} to form a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for reuse in nuclear reactors. Weapons-grade plutonium can be added to the fuel mix. MOX fuel is used in <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactors and consists of 60kg of plutonium per tonne of fuel; after four years, three-quarters of the plutonium is burned (turned into other elements). Breeder reactors are specifically designed to create more fissionable material than they consume.|$|E

5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system so one of those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial <b>light</b> <b>water</b> nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E
5|$|Ficus aurea is {{a fast-growing}} tree. As a hemi{{epiphyte}} it germinates in {{the canopy of}} a host tree and begin life as an epiphyte before growing roots down to the ground. F. aurea is also a strangler fig (not all hemiepiphytic figs are stranglers)—the roots fuse and encircle the host tree. This usually results {{in the death of}} the host tree, since it effectively girdles the tree. Palms, which lack secondary growth, are not affected by this, but they can still be harmed by competition for <b>light,</b> <b>water</b> and nutrients. Following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, F. aurea trees regenerated from root suckers and standing trees.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Weinberg coauthored {{the first}} nuclear reactor textbook, The Physical Theory of Neutron Chain Reactors, with Wigner. The {{following}} year, 1959, {{he was elected}} president of the American Nuclear Society and, in 1960, began service on the President's Science Advisory Committee under the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations. Starting in 1945 with Patent #2,736,696, Weinberg, usually with Wigner, filed numerous patents on the <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactor (LWR) technology that has provided the United States' primary nuclear reactors. The main LWR types are Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs), that serve in Naval propulsion and commercial nuclear power. In 1965 he was appointed vice president of Union Carbide's Nuclear Division.|$|E

5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the <b>light</b> <b>water</b> approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the riser, then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E
25|$|In RBMKs, <b>light</b> <b>water</b> {{was used}} as a coolant; {{moderation}} was mainly carried out by graphite. As graphite already moderated neutrons, <b>light</b> <b>water</b> had a lesser effect in slowing them down, but could still absorb them. This means that the reactor's reactivity (adjustable by appropriate neutron-absorbing rods) had to account for the neutrons absorbed by <b>light</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E

50|$|Midway City {{incorporates}} its {{chamber of}} commerce and homeowners association to act in concert like a city council. The council discusses municipal topics such as <b>lights,</b> <b>water</b> supply, zoning, and neighborhood watch. Monthly meetings {{take place at the}} Midway City Community Center in Stanton Park on Bolsa Avenue, where citizens often bring homemade cakes and other food dishes to be shared among the group to these potlucks meetings. The Midway City representatives typically discuss street <b>lights,</b> <b>water</b> supply, zoning, and neighborhood watch and their decisions usually are made final by the Orange County Board of Supervisors.|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>light</b> <b>water</b> {{reactors}} {{would require}} enriched uranium to be imported from outside North Korea, {{the amount of}} reactor fuel and waste could be more easily tracked, {{making it more difficult}} to divert nuclear waste to be reprocessed into plutonium. However, the Agreed Framework was mired in difficulties, with each side blaming the other for the delays in implementation; as a result, the <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactors were never finished. In late 2002, after fuel aid was suspended, North Korea returned to using its old reactors.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Iran's {{government}} {{announced it was}} planning the country's second nuclear reactor {{to be built in}} Khuzestan province. The 360 MW reactor will be a <b>light</b> <b>water</b> PWR Reactor.|$|E

5000|$|Close {{attention}} to the watering cycles is needed to avoid salinity build up in the soil. <b>Light</b> <b>watering</b> can leave salt residues behind as the water evaporates and leave little added moisture to the soil.|$|R
30|$|These {{transitional}} conditions potentially {{represent an}} ocean front where the denser <b>water</b> under-rides <b>lighter</b> <b>water,</b> {{giving rise to}} an inclined interface and a strong convergence at the surface, which can concentrate phytoplankton and pollutants (Klemas 2012).|$|R

25|$|Commonly-used moderators include regular (<b>light)</b> <b>water</b> (in 74.8% of the world's reactors), solid {{graphite}} (20% of reactors) {{and heavy}} water (5% of reactors).

25|$|The AGR was {{intended}} to be a superior British alternative to American <b>light</b> <b>water</b> reactor designs. It was promoted as a development of the operationally (if not economically) successful Magnox design, and was chosen from a multitude of competing British alternatives - the helium cooled High Temperature Reactor, the Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor and the Fast Breeder Reactor - as well as the American <b>light</b> <b>water</b> pressurised and boiling water reactors (PWR and BWR) and Canadian CANDU designs. The CEGB conducted a detailed economic appraisal of the competing designs and concluded that the AGR proposed for Dungeness B would generate the cheapest electricity, cheaper than any of the rival designs and the best coal-fired stations.|$|E
