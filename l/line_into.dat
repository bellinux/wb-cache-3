5|$|The eighth line to Preston was the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway, {{owned by}} the ELR and {{connected}} to its Blackburn <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Preston. It opened on 2 April 1849. From 1891, its trains used a new curve at Farington to enter Preston via the North Union line.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it had its}} own branch <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Brookwood Cemetery, most of {{the route}} of the London Necropolis Railway ran on the {{existing}} London and South Western Railway (LSWR). Consequently, a site was selected in Waterloo, near the LSWR's recently opened London terminus at Waterloo Bridge station (now London Waterloo). The building was specifically designed for the use of mourners. It had many private waiting rooms, which could also be used to hold funeral services, and a hydraulic lift to raise coffins to platform level. Existing railway arches were used for the storage of bodies.|$|E

5|$|Between May and July 1918, {{military}} stores from White City, Wormwood Scrubs and Baker Street {{were moved}} to the site, with items kept in the completed sheds.

5|$|Cannon Street Station {{was built}} on a site where the Hanseatic merchants' {{steelyard}} was based from the 10th century until 1598.

The SER had already made plans to extend their line towards , but decided that they should complement this with a terminus in the City.|$|E

5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Preston used its own station.

5|$|Faced with {{decreasing}} passenger {{numbers and}} intense {{political pressure to}} consolidate, the railroads operating into Grand Central Station re-routed their trains into other Chicago terminals, beginning with the Soo <b>Line</b> <b>into</b> Central Station in 1963.

Many of the state's major east–west roads intersect with Route22 just before crossing the state <b>line</b> <b>into</b> the neighboring New England states.|$|E
5|$|The Omaha Belt Line {{was formed}} in 1883 by the Union Pacific; some shady {{dealings}} by Jay Gould brought the Belt <b>Line</b> <b>into</b> {{the control of the}} Missouri Pacific Railroad by 1885, when it was constructed with Union Pacific materials {{under the control of the}} MoPac. Stations along with Line included the Florence Depot, Webster Street Station and the Ralston Station.

50|$|Beginning in the 1980s the US {{government}} began the Rail to Trails program {{across the nation}} to alter defunct railroad <b>lines</b> <b>into</b> public trails for recreational use.

In an effort to promote conservation, the government enacted a policy that would turn these <b>lines</b> <b>into</b> recreational trails for hiking, biking, or possibly other activities.|$|R
5|$|The sixth <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Preston {{was that}} of the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line {{immediately}} south of Farrington Station (respelt “Farington” from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) on 3 August 1846. Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the Ribble (which later became the dividing line between Avenham and Miller Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built {{on the east side of}} the North Union station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.|$|E

Gibson, US-62 begins to concur with State Highway 10, and the two routes stay joined through Tahlequah. US-62 starts to overlap State Highway 51 in Tahlequah as well; the two highways split up near Eldon. The route enters Adair County near Proctor. It intersects with US-59 in Westville before US-62 crosses the state <b>line</b> <b>into</b> Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track was needed to connect the <b>line</b> <b>into</b> the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch with electric components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
