5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was worse than any wound.|$|E

Don Quixote also tries to sleep, but is troubled by fantastic dreams.|$|E
25|$|Bob Log III often invites {{audience}} members to 'make' a Boob Scotch, asking them onstage to dip their breast in his scotch (usually ordered {{for him by}} a fan) after which he <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> helmet slightly and downs the drink. Log has also been known to dip his own breast in his scotch.|$|E
25|$|Boult is {{a useful}} {{right-handed}} tailender, having scored a half century against Bangladesh in a 2013 test. He tends to open his stance by stepping the left (front) foot {{off to the side}} for his back-foot cover drive, much akin to Shivnarine Chanderpaul. He is also known to have a Flamingo Back Defensive stroke (FBD) where he <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> left (front) foot up before the ball reaches the bat.|$|E

25|$|A large dog, {{stretched}} {{on its back}} on an operation board, is carried into the lecture-room by the demonstrator and the laboratory attendant. Its legs are fixed to the board, its head is firmly held in the usual manner, and it is tightly muzzled. There is a large incision {{in the side of}} the neck, exposing the gland. The animal exhibits all signs of intense suffering; in his struggles, he again and again <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> body from the board, and makes powerful attempts to get free.|$|E

He asks Johnson about [...] "Cobra" [...] and threatens to kill Johnson {{if he does not}} answer. Johnson unconsciously <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.|$|E
500|$|Up is {{the third}} Pixar film to be scored by Michael Giacchino, after The Incredibles and Ratatouille. What Pete Docter wanted most {{importantly}} out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At {{the beginning of the}} movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is [...] "Muntz's Theme", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70years later. [...] "Ellie's Theme" [...] is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that changes during a particular moment in the story.|publisher=Allmusic.

500|$|Before {{becoming}} involved with The Lion King, Deja had already {{developed a reputation}} for animating Disney villains. Prior to animating Scar, Deja had just recently served as the supervising animator of Gaston and Jafar, the villains in Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992), respectively. Initially, Deja had been considering the idea of animating a hero {{as opposed to a}} villain for a change, contemplating taking on the task of animating Simba instead. However, Deja soon relented upon learning that Scar would be voiced by Irons, feeling that it would be [...] "fun" [...] to animate a character voiced by such a prestigious actor. Meanwhile, Minkoff and Allers had already had Deja in mind for animating Scar long before the animator approached the directors about the position. The level anthropomorphism used in The Lion King exceeded that of any Disney animated film by which it was preceded. Because Scar is an animal as opposed to a human, Deja and the animators experienced certain challenges and limitations when it came to instilling movement in the character, and thus experimented with manipulating Scar's facial expressions, specifically the way in which he tilts his head condescendingly, raises his eyebrows and <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> chin. The animals were each drawn with certain human-like attributes and characteristics in order to help convey emotions and tell the story. Meanwhile, the studio recruited live lions for the animators to study while drawing. As the film's villain, Scar is the only lion drawn with claws.|$|E

[...] Bereft of all cash, Seagoon decides to head for Blackpool to earn some money doing his old stage act, the [...] "shaving routine", which was Secombe's own stock-in-trade.|$|E
2500|$|As the Phantom is {{composing}} {{music at}} his organ, Christine awakens {{to the sound}} of the monkey music box ("I Remember"). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture, as Christine hides in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to look normal, and to be loved by her ("Stranger Than You Dreamt It"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the Phantom's mask to him and the Phantom shepherds her back above ground.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Ellington's career {{was at a}} low point with his style being {{generally}} seen as outmoded, but his reputation did not suffer as badly as some artists. André Previn said in 1952: [...] "You know, Stan Kenton can {{stand in front of}} a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, Oh, yes, that's done like this. But Duke merely <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> finger, three horns make a sound, and I don’t know what it is!" [...] However, by 1955, after three years of recording for Capitol, Ellington lacked a regular recording affiliation.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Holden, {{becoming}} increasingly depressed {{and in need}} of personal connection, calls Sally Hayes, a familiar date. Although Holden claims that she is [...] "the queen of all phonies", they agree to meet that afternoon to attend a play at the Biltmore Theater. [...] Holden shops for a special record, [...] "Little Shirley Beans", for his 10-year-old sister Phoebe. He spots a small boy singing [...] "If a body catch a body coming through the rye", which <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> mood. Although Holden's date initially goes well, it soon sours after Sally introduces her friend George. After the play, Holden and Sally go ice skating at Rockefeller Center, where Holden suddenly begins ranting against society and frightens Sally. He impulsively invites Sally to run away with him that night to live in the wilderness of New England, but she is uninterested in his hastily generated plan and declines. The conversation turns sour, and the two angrily part ways.|$|E
2500|$|Florinda frets that Belvile did {{not come}} to her window as planned, and fears that the {{impending}} duel is between Belvile and Pedro. [...] Pedro enters, masked, and reveals that he will be fighting Antonio, relieving some of Florinda's fears. Belvile enters, disguised as Antonio. Pedro accuses [...] "Antonio" [...] of having [...] "the advantage of me in Angellica" [...] and the men start to fight. Florinda runs in to stop them. Belvile is confused as to why Florinda would defend his rival but they push her away and fight. [...] Florinda stops them again just as Belvile disarms Pedro. She begs him [...] "by her you love" [...] to spare Pedro. Belvile lays his sword at Florinda’s feet and swears his love to her. The action redeems him in Pedro’s eyes, so he gives his sister to the man he believes to be Antonio, demanding that they get married at once. Florinda protests, but Belvile secretly <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> mask to show her who he is.|$|E

2500|$|Golaud {{sits with}} his little son, Yniold, in the {{darkness}} before dawn and questions him about Pelléas and Mélisande. The boy reveals little that Golaud wants to know since he is too innocent to understand what he is asking. He says that Pelléas and Mélisande often quarrel about the door {{and that they have}} told Yniold he will one day be as big as his father. Golaud is puzzled when learning that they (Pelléas and Mélisande) never send Yniold away because they are afraid when he is not there and keep on crying in the dark. He admits that he once saw Pelléas and Mélisande kiss [...] "when it was raining". Golaud <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> son on his shoulders to spy on Pelléas and Mélisande through the window but Yniold says that they are doing nothing other than looking at the light. He threatens to scream unless Golaud lets him down again. Golaud leads him away.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon {{states that}} [...] "this {{adaptation}} of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, {{the kind of}} thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points– that's nothing new– but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town." ...|$|E
2500|$|Normally, {{a breath}} is taken every other stroke. This can be {{sustained}} over long distances. Often, breathing every stroke slows the swimmer down. (At a certain level, a breathing stroke becomes just {{as fast as a}} nonbreathing stroke; therefore, very experienced competitors, such as Michael Phelps, may breathe every stroke.) Other intervals of breathing practised by elite swimmers include the [...] "two up, one down" [...] approach in which the swimmer breathes for two successive strokes and then keeps their head in the water on the next stroke, which is easier on the lungs. Swimmers with good lung capacity might also breathe every 3rd stroke during sprints for the finish. Some swimmers can even hold their breaths for an entire race (assuming that it is a short one). To be able to swim with best results {{it is important to keep}} one's head down when taking a breath. If the swimmer <b>lifts</b> <b>his</b> or her head too high the swimmer's hips often drop, creating drag, thus slowing the swimmer down. The closer one's head is to the water the better one swim is the general technique used by swimmers.|$|E
