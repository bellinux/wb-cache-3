25|$|Steve Waugh (94 not out) {{continued}} his good {{work the next}} morning, adding another 59 with the tail, but were a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> not to post a bigger total. The England innings got off to an inauspicious start with Stewart forced to retired hurt after he received {{a blow to the}} hand from McDermott. Atherton (44) was again the early linchpin, adding 30 with Hick and another 79 with Thorpe (51), before the former was given out caught behind decision by Steve Randell, Atherton was adjudged leg before to Warne, and Thorpe was given out caught at silly point off the same bowler. England collapsed from 119/1 to 151/6 in short order, and then from 185/6 to 212 all out, with McDermott (3–72) and Warne (6–64) the main wicket-takers.|$|E
500|$|... "The Father, the Son, and the Holy Fonz" [...] {{finished}} 40th in {{the weekly}} ratings for the week of December 12–18, 2005, with a Nielsen rating of 8.26 million viewers. Ryan Budke, of TV Squad, said, [...] "This {{was one of the}} funniest episodes this year." [...] He added, [...] "I was cracking up from beginning to end on this one." [...] He was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> that Henry Winkler did not actually show up in the show".|$|E
500|$|Double Dash {{has also}} {{received}} {{criticism from the}} media. Considering the 7-year gap since Mario Kart 64, GameSpot's Ryan Davis stated that he was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the limited scope of the game". He {{also said that the}} repetition of the voice acting was [...] "unrelenting". IGN was also critical towards Double Dash for not progressing beyond its predecessor, calling the game a [...] "mediocre effort". The UK-based publication Edge accused the game of [...] "not being a racing game anymore." [...] Game Revolution criticized the game's single-player mode for lacking substance and the track design for being [...] "bland".|$|E

5000|$|In The New Yorker, Oliver Claxton {{wrote that}} the film was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing.</b> There are one or two moments when it is very funny, but there are long {{stretches}} when it is either mild or dull." ...|$|R
5000|$|..... I {{think most}} readers, {{and most of}} his fans, would find book {{surprising}} and perhaps even a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing.</b> It is a book as dull as he was creative, as plodding as he was fast, as conservative as he was liberal in the way that he played the game." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1987, he {{was chosen}} to captain the England B team in a match against the full {{national}} team of Malta, but {{it was to be}} his only appearance in an England shirt, and he has subsequently been described {{as one of the best}} defenders of his era never to be selected for the full England team. Bruce later stated, [...] "I bumped into former England manager Bobby Robson in Benfica (sic). He came up to me and said 'I should have capped you'. It was nice to hear but it still didn't get me one .... I'll always be a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> I didn't get one." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2006, Cates {{announced}} that actor, comedian, and {{talk show host}} Jon Stewart, who had previously hosted two consecutive Grammy Awards ceremonies in 2001 and 2002, was chosen as host of the 2006 telecast. Cates explained the decision to hire him saying, [...] "My wife and I watch him every night. Jon {{is the epitome of}} a perfect host — smart, engaging, irreverent and funny." [...] In a statement, Stewart expressed that he was honored to be selected to emcee the program, jokingly adding, [...] "Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out Billy Crystal." ...|$|E

His servant Ali shoots a new bird of paradise, Wallace's standardwing, [...] "a great prize" [...] and a [...] "striking novelty". He is a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> in the range of insects and birds, but discovers new species of roller, sunbird and is happy to see the racquet-tailed kingfisher. His house is burgled twice; a blacksmith manages to pick his locks and make him a new set of keys; and he discovers a new species of birdwing butterfly.|$|E
25|$|During his {{period with}} Northamptonshire he twice toured the West Indies; in 1910-11 and 1912-13. In 1910-11 he {{was second in}} the {{tourists}} first class batting averages and led their bowling averages, while 1912-13 his batting was a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> {{but he was still}} second in the tourists' bowling averages.|$|R

[...] {{cried the}} young man, [...] "I had not {{understood}} that, {{and it seems}} a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing.</b> But {{there is no doubt}} all is for the best; and in the meanwhile, I shall be obliged if you will help me to undo the evil I have brought on innocent persons." ...|$|R
5000|$|Following a 12th-place finish, Truex {{said that}} it was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> where we ended up. We {{definitely}} didn’t come in here saying we’d be OK with fourth. We tried our best, but it just wasn’t in the cards for us tonight. It’s frustrating to have a day like this because everything was on the line.” ...|$|R
500|$|There was {{debate about}} {{the merits of the}} producer's {{decision}} to avoid depicting the two battles between the Starks and Lannisters. Ryan criticized it and confessed being [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> that many of the major characters are caught up in a war and we're not seeing it." [...] Sims regretted not seeing the fight, and although he claimed to understand the budget constrictions, he felt that [...] "all this off-screen fighting is just getting my blood rushing for some on-screen fighting." [...] Sepinwall concludes: [...] "Ideally, we'd get a few epic, Braveheart-level battle scenes at some point, but I also respect the demands of time and budget here. Those kinds of sequences cost a fortune, and they eat up a lot of screen time, and I think ultimately I'd have rather had the time, say, that we spent in Tyrion's tent the night before the battle, with the mortifying story of his ex-wife, and then whatever it cost to make the execution sequence look as good as it did, than for the episode to have given us one or two long fight scenes." ...|$|E
500|$|For the {{knockout}} stages, England's first opponents were Argentina. Ramsey again {{showed his}} tactical awareness, and, {{now he was}} no longer using wingers, he decided to switch from 4–3–3 to 4–4–2. With Ball and Peters operating on the flanks, the midfield now boasted Nobby Stiles and Bobby Charlton in the centre. After a violent quarter-final (where the Argentine captain Antonio Rattín refused to leave the field after being sent off), England won 1–0 thanks to Geoff Hurst latching onto a cross from Martin Peters and heading home a goal. Ramsey came under fire when he stopped his players swapping shirts with the Argentinians in protest at their play and was then reported to have described Argentinian players as [...] "animals"; [...] "It seemed a pity so much Argentinian talent is wasted. Our best football will come against the right type of opposition—a team who come to play football, and not act as animals." [...] Jimmy Greaves in his 2009 autobiography, [...] "Greavsie", claims that Ramsey had said [...] "I've been a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> that the behaviour of some players in this competition reminded me of animals". The belief that he had referred directly to the Argentinians as animals damaged Ramsey's reputation and made successive England teams unpopular abroad, particularly in South America.|$|E
500|$|Mendelson {{called the}} trailer [...] "a {{textbook}} case for unnecessary second pitches...Is there anyone {{out there who}} watched that first teaser back in December and said 'Hmm, it looks good and all, but I need more evidence'?" [...] He added that he was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the big Spider-Man reveal," [...] having previously wondered, after a Spider-Man character poster was not released with the others, if Marvel would have the [...] "courage" [...] to not include the character in any marketing materials before the film's release, letting the [...] "Peter Parker scenes the film has to offer be something that is a surprise for theatrical moviegoers and/or something that drives post-opening weekend buzz". Mendelson's colleague at Forbes Mark Hughes felt differently, noting that the trailer was targeting the general audience rather than just fans by giving [...] "us more explanation [...] of why a clearly major battle is raging between Captain America and Iron Man", and by including Spider-Man since [...] "there are plenty of surprises in these movies, and since we all already know Spider-Man is in Civil War, refusing to let us see him would frankly be a bit weird and pointless ... it's common for average filmgoers to hear some final bit of information or see some final image and feel compelled, inspired, or otherwise driven {{to go out to}} the movies that day. There are any number of factors that can come into play...and the world needed to see [...] because it’s the sort of value-added element that can make [...] difference". Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter felt that the Spider-Man reveal [...] "alone makes the trailer", describing it as feeling [...] "like the comic book character come to life. That awkward, voice-cracking, 'hey everyone' was as humble, playing-it-cool and cocky as he should be." ...|$|E
5000|$|In his Allmusic review, critic Jim Smith {{wrote of}} the album [...] "There is some {{exceptional}} flatpicking here, but even the more manic passages are tempered by a softness that is striking, and perhaps even a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing,</b> in its modesty. Once the listener gets past the desire to hear hardcore chops, though, the album reveals its full beauty..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I've been {{praising the}} beauties of Indian Art all my days."

And yet accuracy is surely the touchstone of all Art.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lords are {{sometimes}} disappointing, Clementina," [...] Milray said, [...] "but then, so are other great men. I've seen politicians {{on our side}} who were disappointing, and there are clergymen and gamblers who don't look it." [...] He laughed sadly. [...] "That's the way people talk who are a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> themselves. I hope you don't expect too much of yourself, Clementina?" ...|$|R
500|$|Critical {{response}} to the episode was mostly positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote highly of the episode and awarded it an A–. Handlen praised the episode's exploration of Mulder's mind, noting that the entry allowed the audience to see Mulder's views of the world. He argued that [...] "Mulder's desperate need to understand {{what happened to his}} sister [...] drives him to expect betrayal, because at least with betrayal, the world makes some kind of sense." [...] He did write, however, that he was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> at how [...] "Demons" [...] doesn't really hold up in retrospect from a story perspective," [...] but noted that [...] "what does work here is great." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode continued to strip away, in methodical fashion, Mulder’s psychological support system. [...] While there are some plot contrivances that are troubling, the episode as a whole comes together very well." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that [...] "Demons" [...] works [...] "as a character study of Mulder" [...] and praised the episode's [...] "hyper-realistic flashback" [...] sequences. Vitaris, while calling the structure of the story [...] "not particularly imaginative", wrote that [...] "Mulder's condition is intriguing". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "the wrong episode at the wrong time." [...] The two argued that the attention given to Mulder's potential [...] "aneurysm" [...] are oddly juxtaposed next to Scully's real, life-threatening brain cancer. However, they did call the flashback sequences [...] "masterpieces of editing", but noted that their contents [...] "lack information".|$|E
2500|$|Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club {{rated the}} episode with a grade B−. She calls [...] "the {{structure}} familiar in outline, {{but just the}} slightest bit shoddy in execution" [...] and is a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the good episode {{because it is not}} at the same high level {{as the rest of the}} season.|$|E
2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, I'm now able to really tap into the fun part of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|E

5000|$|However, Tony Rayns {{felt that}} the film's climax was uninspired, saying that [...] "the generic pay off is a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> after the edgy, {{character}} based scenes of exposition". Empires Trevor Lewis questioned the skill of the film's inexperienced cast, saying that they [...] "lack the dramatic ballast to compensate for Nolan's erratic plot elisions." [...] In contrast, David Thompson was {{of the opinion that}} the [...] "unfamiliar cast acquit themselves well in a simple naturalistic style." ...|$|R
500|$|Trott made 1297runs {{and took}} 44wickets in {{first-class}} matches on the tour. Of his batting Wisden said [...] "Trott's average is a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing,</b> {{but when a}} special effort was required he was not often at fault." [...] and he bowled [...] "on a good many occasions with fair results". However it was as a captain that Trott earned most plaudits. [...] Wisden rated Trott as [...] "with the exception of ,...incomparably the best captain the Australians had ever had in this country".|$|R
2500|$|In 2001, Bob Costas {{claimed that}} despite still loving the game, he now felt a certain {{alienation}} from the institution. By {{the time that}} NBC lost Major League Baseball {{for the second time}} in twelve years, the sport endured a strike, realignment, the introduction of the wild card round, and NBC's complete loss of the regular season Game of the Week. Costas would add that since NBC only did a few games each year and he lacked the forum that he would eventually have (on HBO's On the Record with Bob Costas, Inside the NFL and Costas Now as well as Costas on the Radio) to express his views, he to some extent, started editorializing in games. When asked about whether or not the fact that NBC no longer had the baseball rights was disappointing, Bob Costas said [...] "I'm a <b>little</b> <b>disappointed</b> to lose baseball, but that's the way the business is. And it's not nearly as disappointing as it was when we lost it at the end of the '80s. Because then it was like baseball was the birthright for NBC. ... (Baseball is) not going to affect any decision that I have in the future. It's nowhere near as devastating as a decade ago. Different circumstances, different time. I miss it a little bit but not a lot. I am very philosophical about this stuff. I have had wonderful opportunities in my career and no one wants to hear me complain about anything." [...] In 2009, Costas would become a contributor and occasional play-by-play announcer for MLB Network.|$|E

50|$|Even if {{the result}} of Vicenza was a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> for VPPE, it led to an awkward {{federation}} with Christian Democracy and Liga Fronte Veneto. The pact between the three parties, which could become a major political actor in Veneto, was signed in October 2007 by Giorgio Carollo, Raffaele Grazia, Giuseppe Pizza and Fabrizio Comencini. Following this agreement, Carollo became leader of the Christian Democracy in the northeast, while Grazia received the mandate of coordinator of the coalition for Veneto. However, the coalition was soon disbanded.|$|R

40|$|When observing average NMR signals {{originated}} from a rapid equilibrium, the procedure {{to estimate the}} composition of the mixture is to use interpolation. To illustrate the difficulties of this approach, the much-studied case of the NH and OH tautomers of pyrazolinones will be reexamined. Calculated absolute shieldings and coupling constants were compared with experimental data. Although the large predominance of the OH tautomer in DMSO was confirmed, the result is a <b>little</b> <b>disappointing</b> because no consistency in the percentages was achieved using chemical shifts and coupling constants. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.
