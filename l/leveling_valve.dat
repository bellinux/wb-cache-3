Cabin air suspension system is a system which improves ride comfort of a heavy truck and it can reduce vibration between truck frame and cabin. The components of the system, air spring, shock absorber, <b>leveling</b> <b>valve</b> and full cabin system are mathematically modelled using AMESim software. Simulation results of components and full cabin system are compared with experimental data of components and test results of a cabin using 6 axis simulation table. It is found that the simulation results are in good agreements with test results, and the hydropneumatic model can be used well to predict dynamic characteric of heavy truck cabin air suspension system...|$|E

[...] "Snap-through" [...] or [...] "over-center" [...] NSM devices {{are used to}} reduce the stiffness of elastic suspensions and create compact six-degree-of-freedom systems with low natural frequencies. Practical systems with vertical and horizontal natural frequencies as low as 0.2 to 0.5 Hz are possible. Electro-mechanical auto-adjust mechanisms compensate for varying weight loads and provide automatic leveling in multiple-isolator systems, similar to the function of <b>leveling</b> <b>valves</b> in pneumatic systems. All-metal systems can be configured which are compatible with high vacuums and other adverse environments such as high temperatures.|$|R
