However, they are inferior with respect to temperature sensitivity, particularly at low ohmic values, {{and it is not}} practical to obtain tight resistance distribution by laser trimming.

40|$|Increased {{demands for}} small circuit feature sizes have {{provided}} incentives {{to the development}} of new photoformable thick film compositions. Previously the limited applicability of such materials meant that only gold (Au) and in some cases silver (Ag) based compositions were developed. Now, with strong interest being shown by automotive and wireless markets coupled with those who want to replace thin film with a lower cost process, activity in photoformable materials development has become very significant and the definition of what is needed and its priorities are becoming clearer. This paper describes the characteristics of some newly developed photoformable materials, including Au, Ag, and Ag-Pt (platinum) conductors, capable of 30 mm lines on a 60 mm pitch, a robust Ag compatible dielectric material, based on QM 44 technology, capable of forming vias as small as 50 mm on a 100 mm pitch, and blendable <b>low</b> <b>ohm</b> resistors also capable of very small sizes (50 mm* 50 mm).

40|$|AbstractA helium inlet and {{dummy joint}} between {{conductors}} {{are one of}} the most important elements of the winding pack of the ITER PF - 1 coil double pancakes. A helium inlet is used for letting liquid helium into the PF- 1 coil conductor. A full-scale helium inlet sample for fatigue tests and the respective tooling were designed and manufactured. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample were conducted in accordance with ITER requirements testing parameters in order to check the fatigue strength of the structure. Before the fatigue tests thermo-cycling of the helium inlet in the temperature range of 77  to 293  K was conducted. Before and after the fatigue tests the leak tightness of the full-scale helium inlet sample was validated by the vacuum chamber method. A <b>low</b> <b>ohm</b> electrical joint is used to connect two NbTi «CICC» conductors of PF- 1 coil into a single electrical loop. To qualify the design and technology of manufacturing of the electrical joint, a full-scale dummy joint sample was developed for fatigue tests at 77  K. The main design feature of the full-scale dummy joint sample for fatigue tests is a symmetrical model of two dummy joint samples with simultaneous loading to compensate the bending moment. Fatigue tests of the full-scale helium inlet sample at 77  K have been successfully conducted in 2013. Fatigue tests of the full-scale dummy joint sample will be conducted in 2014. This paper represents the results of calculating the stress-strain state of the symmetrical model of the full-scale dummy joint sample for fatigue tests with the prescribed loading and strain, the work on designing the symmetrical model of the dummy joint sample for fatigue tests and the test facility for conducting fatigue tests at 77  K.

The WISE magnitude data at the 3. 4, 4. 6, 12 and 22 mu m (W 1 to W 4) are collected for the OH maser sample and one control sample, which are non-detection sources. The color-color diagrams show that both OH megamaser (OHM) and non-OHM (ultra) luminous infrared galaxies ((U) LIRGs) are {{far away from the}} single blackbody model line and many of them can follow the path described by the power-law model. The active galaxy nuclei (AGN) fraction is about similar to 40 % for both OHM and non-OHM (U) LIRGs, according to the AGN criteria W 1 -W 2 >= 0. 8. Among the Arecibo survey sample, OHM sources tend to have a lower luminosity at short MIR wavelengths (e. g., 3. 4 mu m and 4. 6 mu m) than that of non-OHM sources, which should come from the <b>low</b> <b>OHM</b> fraction among the survey sample with large 3. 4 mu m and 4. 6 mu m luminosity. The OHM fraction tends to increase with cooler MIR colors (larger F- 22 (mu m) /F- 3. 4 (mu m)). These may be good for sample selection when searching OH megamasers, such as excluding extreme luminous sources at short MIR wavelengths, choosing sources with cooler MIR colors. In the case of the power-law model, we derived the spectral indices for our samples. For the Arecibo survey sample, OHM (U) LIRGs tend to have larger spectral index alpha(22 - 12) than non-OHM sources, which agrees with previous results. One significant correlation exists between the WISE infrared luminosity at 22 mu m and the color [W 1]-[W 4] for the Arecibo OHM hosts. These clues should provide suitable constraints on the sample selection for OH megamaser surveys by future advanced telescopes (e. g., FAST). In addition, the correlation of maser luminosity and the MIR luminosity of maser hosts tends to be non-significant, which may indirectly support the pumping of OHM emission that is dominated by the far infrared radiation, instead of the MIR radiation...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} image of the {{hydrothermal}} system of Merapi volcano based on results from electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), self-potential, and CO 2 flux mappings. The ERT models identify two distinct low-resistivity bodies interpreted as two parts of a probably interconnected hydrothermal system: {{at the base of the}} south flank and in the summit area. In the summit area, a sharp resistivity contrast at ancient crater rim Pasar-Bubar separates a conductive hydrothermal system (20 - 50 ohm m) from the resistive andesite lava flows and pyroclastic deposits (2000 - 50, 000. 0 m). The existence of preferential fluid circulation along this ancient crater rim is also evidenced by self-potential data. The significative diffuse CO 2 degassing (with a median value of 400 g m(- 2) d(- 1)) is observed in a narrow vicinity of the active crater rim and close to the ancient rim of Pasar-Bubar. The total CO 2 degassing across the accessible summital area with a surface of 1. 4. 10 (5) m(2) is around 20 t d(- 1). Before the 2010 eruption, Toutain et al. (2009) estimated a higher value of the total diffuse degassing from the summit area (about 200 - 230 t d(- 1)). This drop in the diffuse degassing from the summit area can be related to the decrease in the magmatic activity, to the change of the summit morphology, to the approximations used by Toutain et al. (2009), or, more likely, to a. combination of these factors. On the south flank of Merapi, the resistivity model shows spectacular stratification. While surficial recent andesite lava flows are characterized by resistivity exceeding 100, 000 ohm m, resistivity as <b>low</b> as 10 <b>ohm</b> m has been encountered at a depth of 200 m at the base of the south flank and was interpreted as a presence of the hydrothermal system. No evidence of the hydrothermal system is found on the basis of the north flank at the same depth. This asymmetry might be caused by the asymmetry of the heat supply source of Merapi whose activity is moving south or/and to the asymmetry in topography caused by the presence of Merbabu volcano in the north. On the basis of our results we suggest that stratified pyroclastic deposits on the south flank of Merapi screen and separate the flow of hydrothermal fluids with the gaseous part rising through the crater rims, while the liquid part is flowing downwards to the base of the edifice...|$|R
5000|$|The {{electromagnetic}} pulse {{was produced by}} a pair of Marx generators built by Maxwell Laboratories of San Diego, California. The generators were mounted on pedestals constructed of wood {{in the same manner as}} the main test platform, one on each side of a large wedge shaped steel structure which acted as a ground plane for the horizontally polarized pulse. Each Marx generator consisted of a stack of 50 trays, each containing two large capacitors and a plasma switch. A large peaking capacitor, used to adjust the shape of the resulting pulse, was also part of the design. Each generator was enclosed in a large fiberglass structure which was filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) acting as an insulating gas. The tray capacitors were slowly charged such that each tray had up to 100kV of potential. When discharged through the plasma switches, the 50 trays in series could (ideally) produce up to 5 megavolts of electrical potential in a pulse with a rise-time in the 100 nanosecond range. The generators on either side of the wedge were charged to opposite polarities and fired into twin transmission lines (antennas) mounted on either side of the test platform. When triggered simultaneously the resulting EM waves from each generator combined at the sharp point of the wedge building, adding to a total electrical potential of 10 megavolts. [...] The transmission lines were terminated into a 50 <b>ohm</b> <b>low</b> inductance resistive load mounted on a tall wooden tower at the far end of the platform. The result was a fast 200 gigawatt pulse of electromagnetic flux powerful enough to reliably reproduce (at short range) the deleterious effects of a thermonuclear detonation on electronic circuitry as created by such examples as the HARDTACK I, ARGUS and DOMINIC I (Operation Fishbowl) high altitude nuclear tests.Due to their higher flight altitude and nuclear payload, Strategic Air Command bombers were the primary object of the tests, but fighters, transport aircraft and even missiles were also tested for EMP hardness on Trestle. In addition to electronics survivability tests, numerous sensors located inside, beneath and to the sides of the aircraft would gather additional data on the airframe's EMP permeability to be used in design considerations for future Cold War aircraft and to identify areas which needed additional EM hardening.|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} sensing devices require {{significant improvements}} {{to satisfy the}} needs {{of a wide variety of}} applications in terms of sensitivity, specificity, cost, compactness, reliability and capacity of real-time measurements. Between the various types of sensors that may offer such characteristics two are of particular interest: sensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and sensors based on carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The first part of this thesis focuses on SPR based sensors. A novel SPR sensor is designed on a lithium niobate channel waveguide. Thissensor is able to analyse high index oxides and polymeric materials. Bydepositing a high index layer (matching layer) on top of the metal layer the sensor can be used for different analytes and, in particular, to analyse aqueous solutions. Though this solution produces a slightly more complex sensor with a reduced sensitivity, it leads to an important and more general conclusion. It demonstrates that it is possible to integrate many SPR sensors on the same substrate, each of them dedicated to a different analyte (multi-analyte sensor) by depositing different matching layers according to the materials we want to analyse. The second part of this thesis discusses the growth and the characterisation of CNTs for electrical interconnects and sensing applications. First, a novel method for growth of CNT interconnects is proposed. The method relies on the selective placement of Ni catalyst nanoparticles on the electrodesidewalls by electrochemical deposition. Second, as-grown CNT interconnects are electrically characterised by Kelvin probe force microscopy andby electrical transport measurements. The resistivity of the contact between two CNTs is demonstrated to be one order of magnitude smaller thanthe contact resistivity of a CNT touching the metal electrode surface with its outermost shell. The proposed growth method allows to form high density CNT-CNT contacts in parallel, with corresponding resistance values as <b>low</b> as 40 <b>Ohm.</b> Next, the Joule-heating induced breakdown ofas-grown CNT interconnects is investigated in order to evaluate and improve the electrothermal properties of the interconnects. A single CNT isable to carry electrical powers up to 0. 6 mW under vacuum, three times higher than in air, with a corresponding high maximum current density. The decoration with electrochemically deposited Ni particles allows to protect the CNT interconnects from oxidation and to further improve the electrothermal properties of the CNT interconnects. Finally, as grown CNTs are tested as resonators for sensing applications. A novel method to induce the mechanical resonances of the suspended CNTs is proposed. This method relies on the creation of a force gradient induced by an external inhomogeneous magnetic field on CNTs loaded with Ni nanoparticles when these particles are at ferromagnetic resonance. The quality factor and, consequently, the amplitude of the oscillations of such resonators are sensitive to the presence of helium gas in the surrounding environment. The study presented in this second part of the thesis indicates that our growth method can produce CNTs with appropriate properties for electrical interconnects and sensing applications. nrpages: 194 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Magnetotelluric {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in the Tamar lineament area of northern and central Tasmania to study subsurface electrical structure. These experiments have defined a high conductivity anomaly in the upper-middle crustal depth range and confirmed the presence of the anomaly suggested by previous authors (Buyung, 1980; Sayers, 1984; Hermanto, 1985; Parkinson, 1988). Other geophysical techniques such as de-resistivity, SIROTEM and two-dimensional gravity and magnetic modelling were also used. Results from these studies and other geophysical studies such as the seismic studies of Richardson (1985) and Vitesnik (1984) make a significant contribution {{to a better understanding of}} the shallow structure, nature, tectonic history and, most importantly, the setting of the conductivity anomaly. The measured apparent resistivities are interpreted in terms of inhomogeneous electrical structure using one- and two-dimensional modelling indicating that the top of the high conductivity anomaly is located about 500 to 700 metres from the surface. This is about the level of the basal Permian cover unconformity. The resisitivity of the anomaly ranges from 1 to 8 Ohm. m with a thickness of 13. 3 to 16. 3 kilometres. The shape and position of the anomaly which tapers with depth is consistent with the results suggested by the current density and two-dimensional gravity and magnetic modelling. The gravity and magnetic data indicate large fault or thrust bounded blocks of Lower Palaeozoic and Upper Precambrian rocks underlie the Permian cover. The gravity and magnetic models also show that the more magnetic Cambrian volcanic sequences, may account for the upper part (at least 5 kilometres) of the anomaly. The deeper part of the conductive structure underlies the more magnetic part of the Cambrian volcanics. This suggests that the formation of the volcanic piles may be associated with high conductivities deeper in the crust. It seems likely that the boundaries of the conductive block are marked by tectonic slices of ultramafics. The conductive anomaly does not extend west beyond the Tiers Fault which marks a fundamental structural limit affecting rocks from Cambrian to Tertiary in age. This zone is marked by a strong gravity gradient which extends SSE from Devonport to Sorell across central Tasmania. No such feature occurs along the line of the Tamar River or the Tamar Lineament of previous authors. The most likely cause of the high conductivity anomaly is a combination of the presence of high conducting fluids and graphite in pores, cracks, and or fractured rocks which provide a continuous conducting path. Geological and geophysical evidence showing a considerable tectonic histo:ry in this region support abnormal porosity and extensive fracturing of the deep crust providing an environment for deep fluid circulation and graphite precipitation. Black shales and sheared carbonates are to be expected in the Precambrian rocks implied to be present. The velocity-resistivity relation suggests that a resistivity as <b>low</b> as 2 <b>Ohm.</b> m may be obtained from the Tasmanian crust where the velocity is about 5. 8 to 6. 0 km s- 1. This is comparable with the resistivity associated with the high conductivity anomaly...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{electrical}} insulating {{properties of the}} nanocomposite materials based on poly(ethylene-co-butyl acrylate) filled with alumina nanoparticles are studied. The dielectric properties chosen for the evaluation are the dielectric permittivity and loss {{as well as the}} breakdown strength and the pre-breakdown currents. The reason for choosing these particular properties is partly due to the importance of these for the general electrical applications and partly due to the uncertainties involved for these particular properties of the nanocomposite materials. The importance of moisture absorption for the dielectric properties is outlined in this work. All measurements were performed in both dry conditions and after conditioning of the materials in humid environment until saturation. The data for moisture absorption was taken from the water absorption study performed at the Department of Fibre and Polymer Technology, KTH. The dielectric spectroscopy in frequency domain was employed for measuring dielectric permittivity and loss. Havriliak-Negami approximation was used for characterization of the measurement data {{and at the same time}} ensuring the fulfillment of the Kramers-Kronig relations. Results from the dielectric spectroscopy study in dry conditions suggest that dielectric spectroscopy can be used for evaluating nanoparticle dispersion in the host matrix, based on correlation between the morphology data obtained from SEM investigation and the scatter in the dielectric loss. The dielectric spectroscopy study performed on the nanocomposites after conditioning in humid environment showed that absorbed moisture has a distinct impact on the dielectric loss. Especially pronounced is its’ influence on the frequency behavior, when the dielectric loss peaks are shifted towards higher frequencies with increased moisture content. The nanocomposite materials characterized by higher specific surface area generally exhibit higher dielectric losses. Surface functionalization of the nanoparticles does not seem to have much influence on the dielectric loss in dry conditions. After conditioning in humid environment, however, the surface modification was shown to have a significant impact. Temperature is another significant factor for the frequency behavior of the dielectric loss: it was found that the studied nanocomposites can be characterized by Arrhenius activation. The breakdown strength and pre-breakdown currents study outlined the influence of moisture as well. The study indicated that surface treatment of the nanoparticles can enhance properties of the nanocomposite materials, namely aminopropyltriethoxy silane was an especially successful choice: • The highest breakdown strength was determined by the study for NDA 6 material formulation in dry conditions. • After conditioning in humid environment the NDA 6 material continued showing the best breakdown strength among the nanocomposite mate rials, as well as this value was close to the breakdown strength of the reference unfilled material. This study confirms the existence of the optimal nanofiller content or rather optimal specific surface area of the dispersed nanoparticles in the host matrix. The latter is supported by the comparison between the nanocomposites based on nanoparticles with two different specific surface areas, which shows that the dielectric properties worsen, i. e. the dielectric losses increase and the influence of absorbed moisture on the breakdown strength becomes more pronounced, for nanomaterials with larger specific surface area. The pre-breakdown currents were found to follow space-charge limited conduction mechanism reasonably well. The following conduction regimes were identified: constant region (likely due to measurement difficulties at <b>low</b> field strengths), <b>Ohm’s</b> regime, trap-filled-limit regime and trapfree dielectric regime. The breakdown usually occurred either during the trap-filled-limit regime, when the current increased dramatically for the small change in electric field, or during the trapfree dielectric regime. The threshold values between different conduction regimes seem to correlate well with the oxidation induction times (OIT), which in turn depend on the total specific surface area. The pre-breakdown currents tend to be highest for the materials filled with the untreated nanoparticles. Increased absorbed moisture content causes higher pre-breakdown currents for the nanocomposite materials, while for the reference unfilled material the pre-breakdown currents do not show such tendency. Generally it can be said that the repeatability in the measured data is higher for the nanocomposite materials in comparison to the unfilled host material, as was demonstrated by both dielectric spectroscopy and breakdown studies.
