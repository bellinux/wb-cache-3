5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} had drawn {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b>|$|E

Fumi Nakashima, the sub-character chief designer, concentrated on giving characters from different regions and cultures distinct styles of clothing. Nakashima wanted the machine-oriented society of the Al Bhed to stand out and had them wear masks and goggles to give them a strange and eccentric appearance.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 third edition was {{reviewed}} in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> {{in the new}} edition, which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, he worried that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} 4X games borrowed {{ideas from}} board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games {{were published in}} the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> that later became a staple of the genre.

5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her readers would understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Sid Meier {{released}} Civilization and popularized the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> {{that has}} become a staple of the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group {{published}} a phylogeny for flowering plants {{based on an}} analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As {{a result of this}} work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> studied and speed at which data can be analysed.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases his belief in the authenticity on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> {{and the fact that the}} account lacks all knowledge of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns can be explained by the late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors to creep in.|$|E
5|$|The opening beauty pass {{of the new}} Enterprise was the {{responsibility}} of visual-effects cinematographer Marty Rosenberg, who handled all the other miniatures, explosions, and some live-action bluescreen elements. Rosenberg had previously shot some of the Enterprise-D effects for Generations, but had to adjust his techniques for the new model; the cinematographer used a 50mm lens instead of the 35mm used for Generations because the smaller lens made the new Enterprises dish appear stretched out. Knoll decided to shoot the model from above and below as much as possible; side views made the ship appear too flat and elongated. Rosenberg preferred motion-control passes of ships over computer-generated versions, as it was much easier to capture a high <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> with physical models {{rather than trying to}} recreate it by computer graphics.|$|E

5|$|From 2006 to 2013, XV was {{developed}} by what was then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In the wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013, development of XV transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive {{was brought in to}} help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment helped with the design for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile helped with the design of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies to a <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, we see them as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of}} how they evolve.|$|E
5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal wiring diagram of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book Darwinism, which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail.</b> It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|To {{bring these}} areas to life, the level {{designers}} produced game mechanic elements using simple room layouts and shapes, while concept artists worked in tandem to create artwork for each location, following the art direction. Environment artists would then build 3D layouts {{based on those}} designs. Finding an appropriate color palette for the game world was difficult; browns and monochromatic colors could depict the desired dark and moody atmosphere, but the developers wanted the aesthetic to resemble the vibrant color schemes of a comic book. To this end, they used saturated colors for in-game lighting. Lighting was {{an important component of}} the game, being used to highlight points of interest and to draw the player onward in otherwise boring corridors. To maintain the intended <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>detail</b> and allow the game's console versions to fit into the devices' memory, each area had to be streamed in and out of memory seamlessly to free up memory for textures and geometry. All of the cutscenes were storyboarded by Rocksteady artists, being visualized in the game engine before the character performances were motion-captured. The design team decided that cutscenes should be used to advance character relationships, and that after each cutscene the player should have had their goal changed or the importance of their actions modified. Priority was given to keeping action scenes under the player's control rather than showing them in cutscenes.|$|E
