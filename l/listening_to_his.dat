5|$|The third story {{describes}} Parvati being banished by Shiva {{when she}} becomes momentarily distracted while <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> {{explanation of the}} Vedas. Parvati, now born as Kayarkanni, {{is the daughter of}} a fisherman. When playing with her friends, Shiva approaches {{in the guise of a}} fisherman and flirts with her, despite her disapproval. The fishermen often face problems due to a giant shark that disrupts their way of life. Shiva asserts that he alone can defeat the shark. After a long battle, Shiva subdues the shark (which is actually Nandi in disguise) and remarries Parvati.|$|E

5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they grew up <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only}} one who could help them capture the size and scope of what they wanted to accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|Walsh {{had three}} daughters, {{two sons and}} {{seventeen}} grandchildren. As late as 1997, he was still receiving awards for his marksmanship, winning the Outstanding American Handgunner of the Year. Until 2000 {{he served as a}} coach for the Olympic shooting team, able to see without the aid of glasses even at the age of 92. At the age of 100 he was present at a re-enactment of the Al Brady shoot out in Bangor, Maine. At this event, he was presented with a plaque and the key to the city. At the age of 101, he was the FBI's oldest living former agent and was in excellent physical shape, aside from some hearing and memory loss. He credited his longevity to luck, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> parents and blessings from God. At the 100th anniversary celebration of the FBI, it was noted that Walsh was older than the agency itself. In March 2013, at the age of 105, he surpassed American gymnast Rudolf Schrader to become the longest-lived Olympic competitor. He died at his home in Arlington, Virginia in April 2014, less than a week prior to his 107th birthday.|$|E

25|$|Many semi-miraculous mythical tales were woven around Hafez {{after his}} death.

At the same time, he is said to have known by heart the works of Rumi (Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Balkhi), Saadi, Farid ud-Din, and Nizami.|$|E

25|$|The applause, {{by which}} the orator had been {{frequently}} interrupted, at this point became so vociferous and long continued {{that it was impossible}} for him to proceed. He at last desisted from his attempts to do so and descended from the platform.

25|$|Fiercely {{territorial}} as some Indios fans are, {{a common}} practice {{for many of them}} is to turn the volume down on television broadcasts featuring the Indios, and turning a radio set on to the official Indios radio broadcast, which is aired on station WYEL-AM (600kHz) and streamcasted over the Internet. Soto's vocal inflections are so well recognized by fans that by just <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> voice many can identify the difference between a pop-up fly and a hit before the ball actually lands.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was one of}} {{the first}} artists to use {{recordings}} of his performances to improve himself. Armstrong was an avid audiophile. He had a large collection of recordings, including reel-to-reel tapes, which he took on the road with him in a trunk during his later career. He enjoyed <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own recordings, and comparing his performances musically. In the den of his home, he had the latest audio equipment and would sometimes rehearse and record along with his older recordings or the radio.|$|E
25|$|As {{an owner}} of a {{pioneering}} new school with the a need for original publications in Tamil prose to teach subjects for all grades, he felt {{a need for a}} printing press. He and his colleague Sadasiva Pillai went to Madras, India in 1849 to purchase a printing press. On the way they stopped at Tiruvatuturai Ateenam in Tanjavur, India, an important Saiva monastery. He was asked by the head of the monastery to preach. After <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> preaching and understanding his unusual mastery of the knowledge of Agamas, the head of the monastery conferred on him the title Navalar (learned). This honorary degree from a prestigious Saiva monastery enhanced his position amongst Saivas and he was known as the Navalar since then.|$|E
25|$|Later, Smith and Pocahontas {{meet with}} Grandmother Willow {{and plan to}} bring peace between the colonists and the tribe.

Enraged, Kocoum attacks and {{attempts}} to kill Smith, but Thomas intervenes with his musket and kills Kocoum, who destroys Pocahontas' necklace in the process. Smith commands Thomas to leave just before the tribesmen come and capture Smith while Kocoum's body is taken away. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan declares war on the English, beginning with Smith's execution at sunrise. Pocahontas tries to convince him otherwise, but Powhatan refuses to listen, as he is furious with Pocahontas for not <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> orders {{to remain in the}} village.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, Woods {{stated that}} he would remain with {{longtime}} agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, {{he announced that he}} would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he was very disappointed to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that he was <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott.|$|E
25|$|On Friday, May 3 around 8:50p.m. Virgil was {{relaxing}} {{in his chair}} {{in the sitting room}} just off of the kitchen and bedroom with a heating pad on his back. He was <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> favorite radio program and reading the Friday, May 3 edition of the Texarkana Gazette when he was shot from a closed double window, which faced the highway, three feet behind him. He was shot {{in the back of the}} head by two slugs and died almost instantly. His funeral, which his recovering wife could not attend, was held the following Monday at his church at 2:30p.m. More than 500 people attended his funeral; more than 60 which were his and his wife's relatives. He was buried in Hillcrest cemetery on Highway 67 West; same cemetery as Paul Martin. He was survived by his wife, parents, sister (Mrs. Millard Boyce, Jr.), brother (Charlie), two nieces, and one nephew.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Hesiod's {{complaints}} about poverty, life on his father's farm {{could not have}} been too uncomfortable if Works and Days is anything to judge by, since he describes the routines of prosperous yeomanry rather than peasants. His farmer employs a friend (Works and Days 370) as well as servants (502, 573, 597, 608, 766), an energetic and responsible ploughman of mature years (469 ff.), a slave boy to cover the seed (441–6), a female servant to keep house (405, 602) and working teams of oxen and mules (405, 607f.). One modern scholar surmises that Hesiod may have learned about world geography, especially the catalogue of rivers in Theogony (337–45), <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father's accounts of his own sea voyages as a merchant. The father probably spoke in the Aeolian dialect of Cyme but Hesiod probably grew up speaking the local Boeotian, belonging to the same dialect group. However, while his poetry features some Aeolisms there are no words that are certainly Boeotian. His basic language was the main literary dialect of the time, Homer's Ionian.|$|E
