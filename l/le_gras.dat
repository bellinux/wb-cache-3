The {{software was}} written in C-Hprogramming language, using the C- 1 - 1 - Builder 2007 for Windows 95 -XP and Linux operation systems. It handles desktop-scanned images. On the image analysed with the <b>GRA.</b> <b>LE.</b> D., the user has to determine 11 points. These points are then connected and the distances between them calculated. The <b>GRA.</b> <b>LE.</b> D. software supports standard ampelometric measurements such as leaf area, angles between the veins and lengths of the veins. These measurements are recorded by the software and exported into plain ASCII text files for single or multiple samples. Twenty-two biometric data points of each leaf are identified by the <b>GRA.</b> <b>LE.</b> D. It presents the opportunity to statistically analyse experimental data, allows comparison of cultivars and enables graphic reconstruction of leaves using the Microsoft Excel Chart Wizard. The <b>GRA.</b> <b>LE.</b> D. was thoroughly calibrated and compared to other widely used instruments and methods such as photo-gravimetry, LiCor L 0100, WinDIAS 2. 0 and ImageTool.

40|$|Abstract: Long chain {{fatty acids}} are biologically {{important}} molecules with complex and pH sensitive aggregation behavior. The carboxylic head group of oleic acid is ionizable, with the pKa shifting to larger values, even above {{a value of}} 7, in certain aggregate states. While experiments have determined the macroscopic phase behavior, {{we have yet to}} understand the molecular level details for this complex behavior. This level of detail is likely required to fully appreciate the role of fatty acids in biology and for nanoscale biotechnological and industrial applications. Here, we introduce the use of constant pH molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the coarse-grained MARTINI model and apply the method to oleic acid aggre-gates and a model lipid bilayer. By running simulations at different constant pH values, we determined titration curves and the resulting pKa for oleic acid in different environments. The coarse-grained model predicts positive pKa shifts, with a shift from 4. 8 in water to 6. 5 in a small micelle, and 6. 6 in a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer, similar to experimental estimates. The size of the micelles increased as the pH increased, and correlated with the fraction of deprotonated oleic acid. We show this combination of constant pH MD and the coarse-grained MARTINI model can be used to model pH-dependent surfactant phase behavior. This suggests a large number of potential new applications of large-scale MARTINI simulations in other biological systems with ionizable molecules. Key words: constant pH molecular dynamics, fatty acids, oleic acid, MARTINI model, coarse-grained model.

40|$|De nombreux essais réalisés chez l’homme et de {{multiples}} expérimentations animales ont montré que <b>les</b> acides <b>gras</b> poly-insaturés ω- 3 sont impliqués dans {{la mise en place}} et le maintien de divers organes (le cerveau en premier lieu), et qu’ils pourraient participer à la prévention de différentes pathologies (notamment les maladies cardiovasculaires ischémiques) et affections psychiatriques, dermatologiques ou rhumatologiques. Or, l’alimentation occidentale est déficiente en acides gras oméga- 3. L’enjeu alimentaire est donc d’identifier les aliments qui en sont naturellement riches (voir Tableaux I et II), mais aussi de préciser l’impact réel de formulations enrichies en acides gras oméga- 3 (ALA, EPA, DHA), utilisées dans les élevages, sur la valeur nutritionnelle des produits dérivés. Une synthèse des essais publiés montre que, en nourrissant {{par exemple}} les animaux avec des extraits de graines de lin ou de colza, la teneur en ALA est, dans les meilleures conditions, multipliée par environ 20 à 40 dans les oeufs, 10 dans le poulet, 6 dans la viande de porc et 2 dans celle de boeuf. En nourrissant les animaux avec des extraits de poissons ou d’algues sous forme d’huiles, la quantité de DHA est multipliée par environ 20 dans le poisson (saumon), 7 dans le poulet, 3 à 6 dans les oeufs et 2 dans la viande de boeuf. Le surcoût pour les consommateurs reste très faible par rapport au gain considérable en valeur nutritionnelle. As shown by {{huge amount of}} assays in human as well as in animal models, ω- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids play important role in the development and maintenance of different organs, primarily the brain, and could be useful in the prevention of different pathologies, mainly the cardiovascular diseases, and, as proposed recently, some psychiatric, dermatological or rheumatological disorders. For ALA, the major and cheapest source for human is rapeseed oil (canola oil), and walnut « noix de Grenoble » oil). The actual goal is first to identify which foods are naturally rich in ω- 3 fatty acids, and, second, to determine the true impact of the formulations (enriched in ω- 3 fatty acids) in chows used on farms and breeding centres on the nutritional value of the products and thus their effect on the health of consumers, thanks to quantities of either ALA, or EPA or DHA or both. This concern fish (in proportion of their lipid content, mainly mackerel, salmon, sardine and herring), eggs (wildly naturally rich in ω- 3 fatty acids, both ALA and DHA, or from laying hen fed ALA from linseed or rapeseed), meat from birds, mammals (from the highest concentration : rabbit, then pig and monogastrics, then polygastrics such as beef, mutton and goat)  ; in butter, milk, dairy products, cheese (all naturally poor in ω- 3 fatty acids) … Indeed, the nature of fatty acids of reserve triglycerides (found in more or less large amounts depending on the anatomical localisation, that is to say the butcher’s cuts) can vary mainly {{as a function of the}} food received by the animal. EPA and DHA are mainly present in animal’s products. The impact (qualitative and quantitative) of alterations in the lipid composition of animal foods on the nutritional value of derived products (in terms of EPA and DHA content) eaten by humans are more important in single-stomach animals than multi-stomach animals (due to their hydrogenating intestinal bacteria). The intestinal physiology of birds results in the relatively good preservation of their dietary ω- 3 fatty acids. The enrichment in eggs is proportional to the amount of ω- 3 fatty acids in the hen’s diet and can be extremely important. Including ALA in fish feeds is effective only if they are, like carp, vegetarians, as they have the enzymes required to transform ALA into EPA and DHA ; in contrast, it is probably less effective for carnivorous fish (75  % of the fish used for human), which have little of these enzymes : their feed must contain marine animals, mainly fish or fish oil. Analysis of the published results shows that, under the best conditions, feeding animals with extracts of linseed and rapeseed grains, for example, increases the level of ALA acid by 20 to 40 -fold in eggs (according to the low or high level of ALA in commercial eggs), 10 -fold in chicken, 6 -fold in pork and less than 2 -fold in beef. By feeding animals with fish extracts or algae (oils), the level of DHA is increased by 20 -fold in fish, 7 -fold in chicken, 3 to 6 -fold in eggs, less than 2 -fold in beef. In practise, the effect is considerable for fish and egg, interesting for poultry and rabbit, extremely low for beef, mutton and sheep. The effect on the price paid by the consumer is very low compared to the considerable gain in nutritional value...|$|R
