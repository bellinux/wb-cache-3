40|$|This letter {{reports about}} unpatterned {{ferromagnetic}} NiFe/AlN multilayer composites used as advanced magnetic core materials for on-chip and interposer integrated inductances. The proposed composite structure reduces RF induced currents and thus pushes the permeability cutoff to beyond 3. 7 GHz, which is {{by a factor}} of 7. 1 higher than for homogeneous NiFe layers of same thickness. To the best knowledge of the authors, we achieve the highest effective relative permeability of 28 at 1 GHz, highest ferromagnetic resonance frequency and highest inductance enhancement factor above 1 GHz ever reported for devices based on on-chip unpatterned NiFe magnetic cores. A single <b>loop</b> <b>inductor</b> is also implemented as a technology demonstrator, achieving an inductance enhancement of 4. 8 and a quality factor enhancement of 4. 5 at 400 MHz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} simple, and therefore cheap, planar resonators for building 3 D isotropic metamaterials. These resonators are: a broadside-coupled split ring resonator with a magnetic response providing negative permeability; an electric dipole terminated by a <b>loop</b> <b>inductor</b> together with a double H-shaped resonator with an electric response providing negative permittivity. Two kinds of 3 D isotropic single negative metamaterials are reported. The first material consists of unit cells {{in the form of}} a cube bearing on its faces six equal planar resonators with tetrahedral symmetry. In the second material, the planar resonators boxed into spherical plastic shells and randomly distributed in a hosting material compose a real 3 D volumetric metamaterial with an isotropic response. In both cases the metamaterial shows negative permittivity or permeability, according to the type of resonators that are used. The experiments prove the isotropic behavior of the cells and of the metamaterial specimens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In this paper, a novel duty {{phase control}} (DPC) for {{single-phase}} boost-type switching-mode-rectifier (SMR) is developed and implemented in DSP-based system. Compared {{to the conventional}} multi-loop control structure with inner current loop and outer voltage loop, noted {{that there is only}} one voltage loop tuning the phase of pre-defined duty pattern (i. e. duty phase) in the proposed DPC. Due to no current <b>loop,</b> <b>inductor</b> current sampling and tracking control are unnecessary when SMRs are operated to obtain sinusoidal current waveform and regulate the output voltage. It implies that the single-loop DPC is simple, current sensorless and loopless, and is very adaptable to the implementation with digital and analog integrated circuits. In this paper, first, the effect of the duty phase on the input current is analyzed and modeled. It shows that the sinusoidal current waveform can be naturally generated by the pre-defined duty pattern and the current amplitude is roughly proportional to the controllable duty phase. Then, a voltage controller is designed to regulate the dc output voltage by tuning this duty phase. Finally, some simulated and experimental results have been given to illustrate the performances of the proposed DPC. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{modified}} aperture coupled MicroStrip Antenna (MSA) and Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) for mobile {{applications are}} studied and {{presented in this}} dissertation. The designed antennas are improved multi-band and broad-band characteristics by the modification of radiating elements and/or the ground plane. The novel modified aperture coupling annular-ring antenna fed by stripline is the hybrid structure of the aperture coupling feed MSA and the proximity feed MSA. The proximity feed enable to concentrate the field strength toward {{the direction of the}} radiating element and the modified aperture layer contributes to provide the maximum coupling to the radiating element. The measurement bandwidths of the Aperture Coupling Proximity Feed Hybrid MSA # 1 (ACPF-HMSA# 1, design # 1) and ACPF-HMSA # 2 (design # 2) are 185 MHz (7 %) and 105 MHz (4. 1 %), VSWR in less than 2, respectively. Two layers Planar Inverted F Antenna (PIFA) with the modification of the ground and radiating element was studied. The inserted T-shaped or L-shaped ground and inserted a slot and slits on radiating elements help to adjust the resonant frequencies to the target applications. The result of PIFA # 3 (design # 3) is presented a significant board-band characteristic on the upper band by 910 MHz (from 1. 45 GHz to 2. 36 GHz) with VSWR less than 2. 5. It covers GPS, DCS, PCS, and UMTS bands. Novel internal loop planar inverted F antennas (L-PIFA) with Inserted Concentrated Annular Rings (ICAR) and Inserted <b>Loop</b> <b>Inductors</b> (ILI) are presented as design # 4 (ICAR-L-PIFA # 4) and design # 5 (ILI-L-PIFA # 5), respectively.

The Inserted annular-rings and <b>loop</b> <b>inductors</b> provide inductance values to the main loop antennas. Therefore, the impedance bandwidth of the design # 4 is 570 MHz (from 1. 69 GHz to 2. 26 GHz) with VSWR less than 2. 5.

30|$|As manual traffic data {{collection}} is deemed infeasible as discussed above, {{the need for}} automated traffic {{data collection}} for roundabouts arises. Unlike relatively developed systems/tools for automated data collection for highways, those for automated traffic data collection for roundabouts are relatively scarce in the literature. The most relevant work to automated traffic data collection for roundabouts is those for signalized/un-signalized intersections [5, 6, 19, 20]. In [5, 6], wireless sensors were designed and used for detection of individual vehicle passing similar to how the <b>loop</b> <b>inductor</b> works for detection and counting of highway traffic. A sensor is typically placed close to the stopping line of each lane (but {{in the middle of}} the lane), and a vehicle was detected and recorded when it drove past it. When a vehicle makes a turn, ideally it is first detected by the sensor from the source lane and then by the sensor from the destination lane. In this way, vehicle turning volumes, which are a very desirable type of traffic data for intersections, can be automatically collected. However, the sensor approach has a fundamental algorithm limitation in that a cross-turning (for instance from North to East) may not be distinguished from a right turn (for instance from South to East), which results in inherent counting errors [19]. Besides, the sensor approach may collect only turning volumes, not other types of traffic data such as vehicle speed, waiting time and accepted/rejected gap sizes. If extending the sensor approach for intersections to roundabouts, the situation would be similar that only vehicle volume from entrances/exits may be collected. Therefore, the senor approach for intersections is not considered acceptable for traffic data collection of roundabouts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In portable, {{battery-powered}} applications, {{integration of}} switching dc-dc converters {{is crucial to}} reap maximum benefits in size, cost, and design ease. The frequency compensation circuit, whose design varies with off-chip, passive filter (L-C) components, forms a critical hurdle to obtaining a fully integrated solution. Surveying state-of-the-art control techniques in literature, hysteretic control in buck converters, which in a single <b>loop,</b> controls <b>inductor</b> current ripple indirectly while regulating the output voltage, is observed to be the simplest, fastest, and needing no compensation circuit, thus being best suitable for integration. However, the technique is not readily applied to boost converters. This paper proposes a novel technique to harness voltage-mode hysteretic control in boost converters by controlling inductor current and output voltage through separate loops. The proposed circuit designed for VIN= 1. 2 V (nom), VOUT= 3. 3 V ± 5 %, IOUT= 0. 1 to 1 A shows excellent voltage regulation and transient response (± 150 mV), {{without the use of}} any compensation circuit.

40|$|Strong {{demands for}} smaller, cheaper, and {{multifunction}} wireless systems have put very stringent requirements on passive devices, such as inductors and capacitors. This {{is especially true}} considering the size and weight of most radio frequency (RF) transceivers are mainly due to passives. RF micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) passives are addressing this issue by offering lower power consumption and losses, higher linearity and quality (Q) -factors, potential for integration and miniaturization, and batch fabrication. These advantages position RF MEMS passives as good candidates to replace conventional passives. Further, they also open an opportunity for using the passives as building blocks for lumped element-based RF circuits (e. g. Flters, couplers, etc.) which could replace the more-bulky distributed-element circuits. This thesis presents the design, simulation, fabrication using the deep X-ray lithography process, and testing of thick-metal RF inductors and their applications to lumped-element low-pass Filter (LPF) circuits. The 70 -um tall single-turn <b>loop</b> <b>inductors</b> are structurally compatible to a pre-existing RF MEMS capacitor concept and allow the two device types to be fabricated together. This compatibility issue is crucial {{if they would be}} used to construct more complex RF circuits. At a 50 -Ohm inductive reactance point, test results show Q-factors of 17 - 55, self-resonant frequencies (SRF) exceeding 11 GHz, and nominal inductances of 0. 4 - 3 nH for 1 -loop inductors and Q-factors of 11 - 42, SRFs of 4 - 22 GHz, and inductances of 0. 8 - 5. 5 nH for 2 -loop inductors. Further, test results reveal that high conductivity metals improve the Q-factors, and that low dielectric-constant substrates increase the SRFs. In terms of LPFs, measurements show that they demonstrate the expected third-order Chebyshev response. Two nickel Filters on a quartz glass substrate show a 0. 6 -dB ripple with 3 -dB frequencies (f- 3 dB) of 6. 1 GHz and 11. 9 GHz respectively. On an alumina substrate, they exhibit a 1. 4 -dB ripple with f- 3 dB of 5. 4 GHz and 10. 6 GHz respectively. The filters are 203 - 285 um tall and feature 6 - 6. 5 um wide capacitance air gaps. These dimensions are different than the original designs and the filter performances were shown to be somewhat sensitive to these discrepancies. Compared to a distributed approach, the lumped-element implementations led to an area reduction of up to 95 %...|$|R

40|$|Active {{tracking}} of passive integrated transponder (PIT) -tags using portable antennae {{is becoming an}} increasingly common technique in fish habitat studies in shallow rivers. We carried out “blind testing” to test the efficacy (% tags found) and accuracy (distance between predicted and true tag location) of a portable antenna system (Texas Instruments) in winter conditions using 23 -mm PIT-tags. Up to 90 cm reading range was achieved and signals penetrated ice, rock, wood and water. In the “blind test” trials, {{a majority of the}} hidden tags (N = 12 – 30) were found indicating high tracking efficacy. PIT-tags that were oriented with their cylindrical axis parallel to the plane of the antenna coil <b>inductor</b> <b>loop</b> resulted in a bimodal detection field that had low detection range in the centre of the loop. The utilization of this bimodal detection field proved to be a very accurate method for identifying tag position (mean ± SE distance from predicted to true tag location 10. 9 ± 1. 4 cm) and thus well suited for microhabitat and activity studies in winter conditions. Aggregations of tags (multiple tags within 1 m 2) and obstacles for the antenna maneuvering (e. g., boulders, logjams) reduced the pinpointing accuracy (mean ± SE 13. 3 ± 1. 8 cm), but the reduction in accuracy was statistically non-significant between the single and aggregated tags...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{operation}} of current mode control is covered, including DC and AC {{characteristics of the}} modulator gain. Feed-forward methods show how the slope compensation requirement for any operating mode is easily met. Sampling-gain terms are explained and incorporated into the design approach. Switching models for the buck, boost and buck-boost {{are related to the}} equivalent linear model. This facilitates the practical design using simplified, factored expressions. Design examples show how the concepts and methods are applied to each of the three basic topologies. Current-Mode Control For current-mode control there are three things to consider: 1. Current-mode operation. An ideal current-mode converter is only dependent on the dc or average inductor current. The inner current <b>loop</b> turns the <b>inductor</b> into a voltagecontrolled current source, effectively removing the inductor from the outer voltage control loop at dc and low frequency. 2. Modulator gain. The modulator gain is dependent on the effective slope of the ramp presented to the modulating comparator input. Each operating mode will have a unique characteristic equation for the modulator gain. 3. Slope compensation. The requirement for slope compensation is dependent on the relationship of the average current to the value of current at the time when the sample is taken. For fixed-frequency operation, if the sampled current were equal to the average current, there would be no requirement for slope compensation...|$|R
40|$|Current-mode {{control is}} the most popular scheme used for the {{operation}} of SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supplies). Current-mode control, also known as current-programmed mode or current-injected control is a multi-loop control scheme that has an inner loop and an outer voltage loop. The current <b>loop</b> controls the <b>inductor</b> peak current while the voltage loop controls the output voltage. The inner loop follows a set program by the outer loop. Some of the most popular small-signal models that predict the small-signal characteristics of current-mode control scheme have been analyzed and compared in this thesis. A PWM dc-dc buck converter in CCM(Continuous Conduction Mode) has been chosen to explain the phenomenon of current-mode control in all these models. Small-signal characteristics are generated in MATLAB using the simplified analytical transfer functions. Some of the important small-signal characteristics include the current loop gain, control-to-output gain with the current-loop closed and outer loop open, audio susceptibility, and output impedance. The two most important models in consideration are: 1) Continuous-Time Model and 2) Peak Current-Mode control Model. Despite the fact that both these models predict the instability of current-mode control at a duty ratio of 0. 5, these models differ significantly in deriving the expression for the sampling gain. As a result, their small-signal characteristics differ over a wide frequency range. Also, a very less explored average current mode control is compared with the peak-current mode control based on the similar small-signal characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{overreaching}} goal of {{this thesis}} research is to analyze liquid metal plug actuation in microfluidic channels and to exemplify this actuation in a tunable inductor design using liquid metal as a switching material, and to demonstrate the feasibility of liquid metal in other devices. A gallium and indium based alloy, EGaIn, which is liquid at room temperature is the liquid metal type chosen for this research. Although it owns some advantages such as high vapor pressure, non-toxicity and good conductivity, there are some crucial factors that we should pay attention to move the liquid metal in microchannels {{as a result of}} oxidation with contact to air and stickiness of oxidized skin to any surface. One of them is to determine the right coating material for coating the channel and the best surfactant to carry the liquid metal plug without leaving residues with sufficient amount of pressure. So far, liquid metals have been used in some RF applications, but EGaIn could not be implemented properly in a microfluidic channel as a separate liquid metal plug because of the oxidation issue. Our aim is here to verify that there are ways to handle the actuation of based liquid metals in microchannels. In this thesis, we have used EGaIn in the experiments conducted, but the acquired results are also applicable to galinstan, which is another gallium based alloy. Right after the liquid metal actuation is exhibited in microfluidic channels, this actuation is exemplified in tunable <b>loop</b> and spiral <b>inductors</b> on both PCB and glass slides using lithography technique. A closed loop channel with peristaltic pumping valves has been designed with the help of LabVIEWTM and proper channel designing technique. Therefore, moving the liquid metal in a desired way with an expected speed is achieved. At the end of the study, tunability in an RF inductor using liquid metal as a switching part is provided, once a solution to the nagging oxidation problem of liquid metals is offered, and thus the feasibility of liquid metals to the electrical device applications is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Congestion is {{a problem}} that {{nowadays}} is facing people all over the world. It affects (in different degrees) developed countries as well as undeveloped. Congestion and queues on freeways cost money due to loss of time and therefore productivity. As a result it is considered important to assess it, {{in order to determine the}} severity of the problem faced. In the case of the Netherlands, a clear and accurate review of the causes of congestion and their contribution to vehicle loss hours is missing. For that reason, Rijkswaterstaat [RWS] proposes to investigate this topic. As a result, the main matter of this project is to differentiate diverse types of congestion. Hence the main research objective is to design a method to automatically identify the recurrent and (the most common) non-recurrent delays during single occurrences, on Dutch motorways. To achieve this objective the research question is posed: “Which part of single event delays on the Dutch motorways is caused by the following non-recurrent elements: roadworks, incidents, and adverse weather conditions?”. Besides that, the intention is to answer a set of subquestions and sub researching objectives, which are naturally related with the main research question. To accomplish these goals, it was necessary first to have a clear definition of congestion, which in this study was used travelling below a reference speed. It is also required to have a clear differentiation between recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. These are the elements that will be measured in this report. Reviewing the existing methodologies to assess different congestion, it was found that exist two main approaches to assess different congestion components: simulation-based and data driven. They both were examined in order to determine which would be the most suitable approach to be used in this study. Taking into account several factors, it was decided that the most promising approach is data driven, and thus it is the used in this report. During the checking process it was noticed some gaps in the existing methodologies to assess congestion, which are: explicit assessment of various causes of non-recurrent congestion, possibility to add in the model new causes of non-recurring congestion, different to those originally considered, lack of a structured methodology, and lack of considering network effects. Hence the new proposal fills all these gaps. Bearing in mind these facts and based on the existing methodologies, a new method was proposed to assess and to distinguish the different parts of the congestion: recurrent and non-recurrent, expressed in terms of delays. Given that the data collection process in the Netherlands uses <b>inductor</b> <b>loop</b> sensors spaced approximately 500 m, then the input data are speeds and flows measured by these sensors per motorway sections (space between these detectors) aggregated every 5 min. The remaining inputs are network configuration and databases containing time and locations of the mentioned nonrecurrent events. The outputs are the delays, classified in total, recurrent, non-recurrent with known and unknown (other) causes. The methodology was validated to show that its outcomes are realistic, and they are properly measuring the field conditions. The methodology was applied to a case study with real data. It was chosen a zone in the Randstad area including the A 4, A 13, A 20, and A 12 motorways in the Netherlands. The resulting delays data were analyzed and some conclusions were derived from the case study. It was found that in this area the A 13 and the A 20 present the higher congestion levels. It was also found that recurrent delays represent more than 50 % of the total delays and among the considered causes of non-recurrent congestion, incidents is the one that occur more often. In addition to the goal of measuring non-recurrent delays, it was also considered the existing policies and measures created in the Netherlands to handle them. It was found that they are the result of several years of investments and developments. Therefore, the existing policies and measures to tackle non-recurrent congestion (mainly Incidents Management IM and roadworks planning) have high quality. Nevertheless it is considered that it is required further integration of the above mentioned measures with ITS services, in terms of traffic management measures and an extensive use of the providing information services. The last is especially evident in handling adverse weather conditions, as one of the considered sources of non-recurrent congestion. It was found in the results of non-recurrent delays classified as ‘other causes’ are higher than expected. Part of it is originated in bottlenecks whose cause is not among the databases. Therefore it is considered that although the quality of the existing information is high, it is still necessary more information about different kinds of occurrences, different from those considered in this study. The case study results are promising, however the developed methodology requires more data (in more motorways and considering more time) in order to derive more generic conclusions.
