5|$|Simakis {{praised the}} book for having more depth of {{character}} than Grisham's novels customarily do. She compares the protagonist to Mitch McDeere from The Firm and Rudy Baylor from The Rainmaker. Memmott says {{that most of the}} claimants that they find are unsympathetic, but a few are from somewhat sympathetic immigrant families. Simakis notes that Wally trades sex for legal services with one claimant. Harshaw says that the book is a bit sentimental and comparatively lacking in terms of secondary character development for Grisham. Larry Orenstein of Canada's Globe and Mail notes that on the dramatic scale this book has instances of <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud humor that make it more like Boston Legal than The Practice, which Boston Legal was spun off from.|$|E

500|$|Although Nancy Churnin of the Dallas Morning News {{considered}} the film inferior {{to those of}} Pixar and DreamWorks, she still gave it a B and wrote, [...] "it's got an upstart charm, a clever premise, appealing characters voiced by a terrific cast and a script that should make you <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud more than once." ...|$|E
5000|$|On August 22, 2003, U.S. District Judge Denny Chin denied Fox's {{request for}} an {{injunction}} to block the publication of Franken's book, characterizing the network's claim as [...] "wholly without merit, both factually and legally." [...] During the judge's questioning, spectators in the court's gallery frequently laughed at Fox's case. Franken later joked, [...] "Usually when you say someone was literally <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> of court, you mean they were figuratively <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> of court, but Fox was literally <b>laughed</b> <b>out</b> of court." [...] Three days later, Fox filed to dismiss its lawsuit.|$|R

500|$|Even if {{the subject}} of the film is political, Weingartner said, [...] "the whole idea of 'Edukating' is playful. The movie is full of jokes. And happiness. I read somewhere that kids <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud more than 150 times a day. Adults laugh only 10 times a day. Well, I want people to laugh.

500|$|Response to MOBA's {{opening and}} {{continued}} success is, for some, evocative {{of the way}} art is treated in society. MOBA works {{have been described as}} [...] "unintentionally hilarious", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood. Visitors—and even MOBA staff—often <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters [...] contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Dan Iverson gave a mixed review, commenting that [...] "it is only passable" [...] {{and that}} [...] "it {{did not have}} that <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud funny" [...] concept. However, Iverson {{positively}} comments that the voice of Jillian by Drew Barrymore was perfect. Iverson added that it's [...] "pretty humorous in this episode was how they made fun of mediocre films." [...] In conclusion, Iverson gave the episode a final rating of 6.9/10. The press release for this episode commented that Jillian is a [...] "very attractive but intellectually challenged," [...] giving no negative comments. The entire scene of Buzz Killington discussing bridges to Peter and his friends in a flashback is Barrymore's favorite scene.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{comments from}} TV Squad, with Brett Love commenting that [...] "the suspended license plot {{was a little}} thin, but that's forgivable given {{that this was the}} b-story for the episode, and there are only 22 minutes to work with." [...] Love comments positively on the Stewie and Brian relationship in the episode, commenting that, [...] "the Stewie and Brian story is what made the episode for me. It was very well done, right down to the goofy little details." [...] IGN commented that, [...] "...for Family Guy to have a great episode, it takes a good story and humorous [...] "manatee" [...] gags. [...] "Road to Rupert" [...] was able to deliver on both these fronts, with the majority of the episode's attention focused on Stewie and Brian's road story, meshed with many <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud gags." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Richard Keller of TV Squad thought the finale's theme of Will and Grace's connection {{to each other}} was well-presented by director James Burrows. Keller added, [...] "While not as satisfying as, say, the Friends finale or as crushing as the Seinfeld finale, the series finale to Will & Grace did have its moments {{and came back to}} the original concept of friendship among a close group of people. There were some moments where I did <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud, but they were few." [...] CHUD.com's David Oliver praised the finale for not having characters [...] "go on wild tangents that betray who they were during the entirety of the show's run." [...] He also commented that Messing and McCormack are [...] "affecting in their performances" [...] and the episode [...] "nicely summarizes [...] friendship {{over the course of the}} entire show." ...|$|E
50|$|Rekatu means <b>laughing</b> <b>out</b> loud {{with your}} friends. Derived from the root katu, from Afan Oromo, a Latin based {{language}} of Cushitic origin.

Also, when used within the Latin based context, many Hispano-American countries prefer the verb form rekatuir.|$|R

500|$|Writing for Variety, Brian Lowry {{opined that}} with [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] Archer [...] "gives FX {{something}} that the drama-heavy channel hasn't enjoyed for awhile — namely, a sharp comedic arrow in its quiver." [...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad applauded the character development in the [...] "Mole Hunt," [...] as it [...] "was fairly impressive." [...] Moreover, though, Toomey praised the dialogue, saying [...] "The {{back and forth between}} Archer and Figgis and Archer and Lana were <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud funny," [...] and noted that he wished he could incorporate the phrase [...] "baby town frolics" [...] from the episode into a conversation. Toomey did, however, say that he felt that the plotting was [...] "a bit of a stretch," [...] and noted that the realization that Krenshaw was actually a Russian spy named Kremenski was [...] "out of nowhere" [...] and [...] "a bit confusing." ...|$|E
500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness." [...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo!

500|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

[...] It was a welcome return to form chockablock with quotable lines and <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud moments." [...] He was complimentary towards Fey here, noting that she [...] "illustrated [...] chops as a physical comedian". Sean Gandert, a contributor for Paste magazine, said that Tracy's plot was [...] "pretty awesome". Gandert, {{who has not been}} a fan of the [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, appreciated it in this episode, opining it had [...] "good writing even by the show's outsized standards." [...] Entertainment Weekly contributor Margaret Lyons was positive about this episode, writing [...] "Last night's 30 Rock was legitimately one of the best episodes ever [...] 'Dealbreakers Talk Show #0001' was one for the record books".|$|E

500|$|Buddy TV {{senior writer}} Oscar Dahl remarked, [...] "It didn't make me <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud and, yet, I still loved it." [...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying {{and not that}} funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode as I did watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chris and Ann {{was described by}} Sundermann as [...] "one {{of the most interesting}} parts of the show and the reason, specifically, is Chris". Likewise, Porter said Lowe and Rashida Jones had developed a [...] "fantastic dynamic". Joel Keller of TV Squad said he found Chris [...] "a little two-dimensional", and believed the relationship was poorly handled because it made Ann too passive. Lowe received particularly strong praise for his role in [...] "Flu Season", in which Chris became extremely ill and hallucinatory when infected with the flu. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said Lowe's character seemed well-integrated into the cast by the episode [...] "Flu Season", and added [...] "If you've never believed Lowe can make you <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud, pay attention to that episode." [...] Steve Kandell said Lowe stole the show from the usual Parks powerhouses of Nick Offerman and Chris Pratt, and called one scene, when Lowe tries to will away his flu by yelling to himself in the mirror [...] "Stop...pooping!", the [...] "single greatest self-effacingly comic moment of his long, handsome career".|$|E
500|$|Kath Skerry of Give Me My Remote called Dwight's groveling [...] "hilarious," [...] but {{was unsure}} about Jim and Karen's ending scene, {{explaining}} that it [...] "was adorable.

I’m still a JAM shipper all the way, but it’s nice to see Jim smile again." [...] Skerry concluded that [...] "there were some seriously funny, <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud moments tonight, but I don’t think this episode {{is going to make}} my favorites list. But even when The Office isn’t at its best, it’s still hands down the best comedy on TV." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A-. In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{made his}} debut {{with the band}} on Friday, 18 October 1957 at a Conservative Club social held at the New Clubmoor Hall in the Norris Green section of Liverpool. Lennon and McCartney wore cream-coloured sports jackets, which were {{paid for by the}} whole group—Walley {{collected}} half a crown per week from each member until they were paid for—and the others wore white shirts with tassels and black bootlace ties. To the irritation of the other group members, McCartney endlessly practised the lead guitar intro to [...] "Raunchy" [...] (by saxophonist Bill Justis) and a solo from [...] "Guitar Boogie Shuffle", for days before the engagement, but on the night (after being specially introduced by Lennon as a new member of the group) he missed his cue on [...] "Raunchy", played all the wrong notes, and stepped back in embarrassment between Hanton and Garry. Everyone expected Lennon to say something sarcastic, but the sight of the always overconfident McCartney looking so crestfallen made Lennon <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud so much that he [...] "almost pissed himself".|$|E
500|$|Claire Zulkey of The Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "In {{some ways the}} episode almost felt too comfortable, with the {{familiar}} story lines and even the obligatory fantasy featuring Baldwin as a former president.

[...] Ann Oldenburg of USA Today said that [...] "As always, [...] 30 Rock was filled with fast one-liners." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Even for the always politically astute 30 Rock, last night's episode was unusually so." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] " [...] episode of 30 Rock had more jokes and one-liners - the kind where you actually smile and <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud" [...] and that [...] "There's no other comedy that's running on all cylinders like 30 Rock is right now." [...] Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that [...] " [...] was filled not with just great laughs, but also some heart.

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Daniel Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter said Parks and Recreation {{appears to be}} a [...] "genuinely funny and engaging comedy" [...] and that inevitable comparisons to The Office are not fair; he also said Poehler [...] "proves instantly she's got the comic intelligence to carry a series like this one". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Pilot" [...] lacked the [...] "snap and clear character delineation" [...] of The Office, but pointed out that show also appeared flat in early episodes; Tucker said he liked the performances, attitude and atmosphere of the show, although it had few <b>laugh</b> <b>out</b> loud moments. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the show has the potential to become a [...] "flip, witty political allegory" [...] and praised Poehler and the supporting cast. Los Angeles Times television critic Robert Lloyd praised the show for providing strong female leads, which he said was rare on television. He also said, [...] "It has a kind of sunny charm, a premise fit for a novel... Poehler and Jones have a nice, [...] rhythm. I stamp this show: approved." ...|$|E
