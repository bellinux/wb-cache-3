The matrix (the soil from a suspected archaeological feature) is slowly added to agitated water. The soil, sand, and other heavy material, known as heavy fraction, will sink to the bottom. The less dense organic material such as charred seeds, grains and charcoal will tend to float to the surface. The material that floats to the top, called <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> is poured into a sieve (usually 250-500 µm). The <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> is then dried and later examined under a low power microscope. Samples of the heavy fraction are also gathered for later analysis. Flotation can be undertaken manually with buckets, [...] or by machine-assisted flotation where water is circulated through a series of tanks by a pump.Waterlogged plant remains are separated from the matrix by a combination of wet-sieving and/or small-scale flotation in a laboratory. [...] Desiccated plant remains are usually recovered by dry-sieving, using a stack of different sieves to separate larger items such as cereal straw and fruit stones from smaller items such as weed seeds.|$|E

Mineralized remains and remains from extremely dry contexts can usually be separated from soil and roots with careful dry sieving alone. Although flotation systems differ in size, design, and number of components {{in order to meet the}} needs of the assemblage and the restrictions of the site, each system accomplishes the same basic task. Passing water over a soil sample separates the remains into light and heavy fractions. The heavy fraction weighs more than water and, thus, sinks to the bottom and is collected in a screen. The <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> which contains the plant remains, floats above the water and is sorted onto another, finer screen. Residual dirt and water are drained out of the unit through an output valve. Light and heavy fractions are then dried to prepare them for analysis.|$|E

Even though large fluctuations were observed in the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions,</b> this {{did not affect the}} total THC removal as the initial concentrations were low. In general, higher removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> (C 8 –C 10 and C 10 –C 12) were observed, in line with results of an EK study of diesel polluted soil, in which the highest degradation of the C 10 –C 16 fraction was reported (Kim et al. 2010). In the present study, degradation of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> appears to be related to stirring rate; the highest removal efficiencies observed at medium–high stirring rates (experiments 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12). In experiments 6, 7 and 10 removal efficiencies of the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions</b> were lower compared to the total removal. In experiments 6 and 7 the low stirring rates and low L/S ratios were applied indicating that not enough aeration was provided to remove the <b>lighter</b> <b>fractions.</b> The difference in removal efficiencies between experiment 10 and the other 3 experiments conducted in the centre point of the continuous variables may indicate an inhomogeneous distribution of the oil pollution in the soil.|$|R

The mineral matter {{in each of the}} <b>light</b> coal <b>fractions</b> was compared to that of the relevant raw coal. The DTF ash from <b>light</b> coal <b>fractions</b> was analysed using hydrochloric acid separation. The acid-soluble aluminium fractions of DTF ash samples were used to determine changes in the amorphous aluminosilicate products with increasing combustion temperature. The results show that the clay mineral contents in the mineral matter of both <b>light</b> coal <b>fractions</b> were higher than those in the respective raw coals. For the coal with a high ash melting point, clay minerals in the <b>light</b> coal <b>fraction</b> thermally transformed more dehydroxylation products compared with those in the raw coal, possibly contributing to solid-state reactions of ash particles. For the coal with a low ash melting point, clay minerals in the <b>light</b> coal <b>fraction</b> produced more easily-slagging material compared with those in the raw coal, playing {{an important role in the}} occurrence of slagging. Additionally, ferrous oxide often produces low-melting substances in coal ash.

We conducted a field manipulative experiment which used a Latin square design with six N addition levels of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) since 2003 in a semiarid grassland in northern China.

We measured C and N concentrations in soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction,</b> microbial biomass, extractable organic matter, heavy fraction, and total soil C and N. The results showed that total soil C and N, and heavy fraction C and N were not significantly affected by N addition after 9 years of treatments. In contrast, different N enrichment levels changed soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N, ranging from 4. 3 to 27. 7 % and 3. 3 - 30. 0 %, respectively. Moreover, both <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N had a nonlinear relationship with N addition rates, and the threshold for N-induced change in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N was near 16 g N m(- 2) year(- 1) in this semiarid grassland. Increases of soil <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> C and N primarily resulted from changes in biotic (N-stimulated aboveground biomass) and abiotic (soil temperature, moisture and pH) factors under N enrichment. Soil microbial biomass exponentially declined with increasing N, but extractable organic C showed a positive linear response to N enrichment rates. Changes in microbial biomass C and extractable organic C were primarily due to the reduced soil pH under N addition.

Three types of organic carbon were determined: <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon, heavy fraction organic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon. The results show that variations in <b>light</b> <b>fraction</b> organic carbon are significantly larger between upstream and downstream locations than they are between the two wetland types; however, the opposite trend is observed for the dissolved organic carbon. There are no significant differences in the distribution of heavy fraction organic carbon between the discrete variables (e. g., between the two depths, the two locations, or the two wetland types).
