25|$|Public Health Emergency Preparedness {{initiatives}} are {{managed by the}} CDC via the Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response. Funds aim to support communities in preparing for public health emergencies, including pandemic influenza. Also managed by the CDC, the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) consists of bulk quantities of medicines and supplies for use during such emergencies. Antiviral stockpiles prepare for shortages of antiviral medications in cases of public health emergencies. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009-2010, guidelines for SNS use by <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> was unclear, revealing gaps in antiviral planning. For example, <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> that received antivirals from the SNS did not have transparent guidance {{on the use of}} the treatments. The gap made it difficult to create plans and policies for their use and future availabilities, causing delays in treatment.|$|E
25|$|Guidelines {{regarding}} viral diagnoses {{and treatments}} change frequently and limit quality care. Even when physicians diagnose older patients with influenza, use of antiviral treatment can be low. Provider knowledge of antiviral therapies can improve patient care, especially in geriatric medicine. Furthermore, in <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> (LHDs) {{with access to}} antivirals, guidelines may be unclear, causing delays in treatment. With time-sensitive therapies, delays could lead to lack of treatment.|$|E

One aspect of NTSIP is a national database of information related to chemical spills.

These teams interview people who were exposed to the hazardous substances and collect samples to test the level of contamination in the environment and in people.|$|E
25|$|A {{major focus}} of the work ATSDR does {{involves}} interacting with communities. ATSDR often establishes partnerships with state and <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> to assist them with their public health duties. In 2008, ATSDR had cooperative agreements with 29 states and one tribal government, providing technical assistance to help those partners address local environmental health concerns. ATSDR also creates community assistance panels to solicit feedback and community health concerns from local residents when the agency works at sites to evaluate health effects resulting from exposure to toxic substances.|$|E
25|$|ATSDR has a {{computational}} toxicology laboratory that conducts research and modeling {{on the effects}} of toxic substances on human health. The agency's toxicology work involves pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship methods, and benchmark dose modeling, as well as establishing minimal risk levels for human exposure to hazardous substances. One model developed by the toxicology laboratory showed that children were much more susceptible than adults to chemical exposure from inhalation and oral exposure. In the aftermath of chemical spills and emergencies, the laboratory also conducts research for state and <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> on the health effects of the chemicals involved.|$|E

[...] Several local public health departments in the United States have initiated pharmaceutical take-back programs.

Currently, take back programs are funded by state or <b>local</b> <b>health</b> <b>departments</b> or are volunteer programs through pharmacies or health care providers. In recent years, the proposition that pharmaceutical companies should be responsible for their products “from the cradle to the grave,” has been gaining traction.
