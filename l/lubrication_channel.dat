The investigation included an extensive analysis of the con-rod material as well as the fracture zone. The investigation involved the following experimental procedures and testing techniques: visual inspection, fractography, magnetic particle inspection, chemical analysis, tensile and hardness testing, metallography, and microanalysis. The connecting rod was fabricated from an AISI/SAE 4140 low alloy steel; chemical composition, mechanical properties and microstructure were appropriate for the application. The connecting rod fractured at the body in a section close to the head; the origin of the fracture was located at the con-rod <b>lubrication</b> <b>channel.</b> The <b>lubrication</b> <b>channel</b> exhibited an area containing a tungsten based material, presumably from a machining tool, embedded in its surface {{as a result of a}} deficient manufacturing process. This area acted as nucleation site for cracks that propagate through the connecting rod section by a fatigue mechanism, reducing its section and finally producing its catastrophic failure...|$|E

In the process, aluminum alloy (Al 6063) was heated at 350 °C for one hour, machined and cut to billets size of 11. 95 m x 11. 95 m x 40 m (l × b × h). The billets were extruded through die of 12 mm x 12 mm channel cross-section area, the channel angle was 60 °. Four vegetable based lubricants namely jatropha, neem, castor and cotton seed oils were used. The die was centrally located on the bed of vertical hydraulic testing machine and the billet was inserted into the entrance <b>channel.</b> <b>Lubrication</b> was applied to the billet to decrease its friction and with the channel inner wall. The ram displacement per plunger speed was 1 mm per 1 second respectively. For each lubricant, four samples were extruded through ECAE die to confirm the repeatability of the results and the average values of the extrusion pressure were computed. The results were compared to the sample extruded via conventional lubricants. It was discovered of all the extruded samples, jatropha oil gave the least extrusion pressure of 83 kN, cottonseed oil extruded at 104 kN and castor oil at 151. 4 kN while neem oil require the highest pressure at 220. 9 kN. The chemical based lubricants that serve as the control from the literature gave the extrusion pressure of 81 kN. It can be concluded that the oil from jatropha seed is the best in terms of extrusion pressure and can effectively replace the chemical based lubricants...|$|R
