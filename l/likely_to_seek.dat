5000|$|Adult river frogs have a {{home range}} of about 16 m2. They are largely nocturnal and feed on insects and other invertebrates, as well as small vertebrates, {{including}} frogs. They {{spend much of their}} time in water and are relatively bold. During hot weather they are normally found sitting in moist or wet places, presumably to avoid desiccation.

25|$|Agoraphobia occurs {{about twice}} as {{commonly}} among women {{as it does in}} men. The gender difference may be attributable to several factors: sociocultural traditions that encourage, or permit, the greater expression of avoidance coping strategies by women (including dependent and helpless behaviors), women perhaps being more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> help and therefore be diagnosed, and men being more likely to abuse alcohol in reaction to anxiety and be diagnosed as an alcoholic. Research has not yet produced a single clear explanation for the gender difference in agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{study showed}} that among churchgoers, those who go to {{segregated}} or primarily white churches {{are more likely to}} exhibit racist behaviors or to have prejudiced ideas about African Americans. Those who attend integrated churches are about equal in racial attitudes to those who do not attend church at all, but those who attend racially segregated churches {{are more likely to be}} both covertly and overtly racist than either group. It is difficult to posit whether this intolerance is caused by attending a segregated church, or if those who hold prejudiced views are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> out a segregated church.|$|E
25|$|This {{is below}} the {{replacement}} rate of 2.1, and also lower than in previous years. A 2002 study reported that urban women averaged 2.1 children per woman, with women living in rural areas having more children, at 2.9. As of the 1990s, both urban and rural women were averaging fewer children than previously. For those women who do have children, after former president Michelle Bachelet's childcare mandates, childcare centers that provide free services are four times more numerous. Nursing mothers also have {{the legal right to}} breastfeed during the workday. Women are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> divorces and marriage annulments.|$|E
50|$|The {{social value}} of {{self-reliance}} has diminished {{over time as}} modern society has moved more toward interdependence. Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against mental health, as they make it less <b>likely</b> for men <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> psychological help or to possess the {{ability to deal with}} difficult emotions. Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them <b>to</b> be less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> discuss health problems with their physicians.|$|R
50|$|Men who are of {{a younger}} age {{at the time of}} having a vasectomy are {{significantly}} more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> regret and <b>seek</b> a reversal of their vasectomy, with one study showing men for example in their twenties being 12.5 times more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> undergo a vasectomy reversal later in life (and including some who chose sterilization at a young age); prevasectomy counseling is therefore of particular importance in younger patients.|$|R
40|$|Literature {{suggests}} that lawyers report experiencing psychological distress {{in excess of}} the general population. Epidemiological research has identified an under utilization of mental health services by those in need of mental health treatment. This study investigated the attitudes and beliefs lawyers have about seeking professional mental health services to ascertain the determinants related to their intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify factors that influence lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> psychological services. The Attitudes and Belief about Seeking Professional Mental Health Treatment Questionnaire was sent to l, 429 lawyers in Wisconsin. Four hundred eleven surveys were returned with 405 analyzed in this study. The determinants of intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> mental health treatment were isolated using the Theory of Reasoned Action and Theory of Planned Behavior. Multiple regression analyses indicated that attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control predicted lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment. Attitude toward seeking mental health services was found to contribute more to the prediction of intention than subjective norm or perceived behavioral control. Lawyers who reported an intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> psychological treatment were contrasted with lawyers who reported an intention not <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment. Lawyers who intended <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a favorable attitude toward seeking psychological treatment, believe they would want to comply with important referents that would want them <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment, and have confidence they could seek treatment. Lawyers who intended <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> accept negative consequences that may result from seeking services. Lawyers who intended <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment also found it easier to admit they had a problem, decide that treatment may help, decide <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment, and make an appointment, than those who did not intend <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment. Lawyers with prior treatment experience were found <b>to</b> be more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> intend <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment than those who did not have prior treatment experience. This study isolated factors that influence lawyers 2 ̆ 7 intention <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment that can be used to design interventions that increase the number of lawyers who seek professional mental health services...|$|R
25|$|A 2007 {{study of}} 1,000 {{households}} in rural Bangladesh found that direct payments to {{formal and informal}} healthcare providers and indirect costs (loss of earnings because of illness) associated with illness were deterrents to accessing healthcare from qualified providers. A community survey of 6,183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment than to men. The use of skilled birth attendant (SBA) services, however, rose from 2005 to 2007 among women from all socioeconomic quintiles except the highest. A health watch, a pilot community-empowerment tool, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh to improve the uptake and monitoring of public-health services.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{women as}} a whole {{tend to be less}} {{assertive}} and confrontational. One of the factors contributing to the higher proportion of raises going to men is the simple fact that men tend to ask for raises more often than women, and are more aggressive when doing so. Women, and men, are socialized at young ages into these roles. School-age boys and girls have been noted as enacting the same aggressive and passive characteristics, respectively, in educational settings that we see in adults in the workplace. Boys {{are more likely to be}} pushed competitively in school, and sports, to be dominant. The idea that “winning is everything” is not emphasized to the same extent for girls and therefore they are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> recognition for their work.|$|E
25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

5000|$|Socioeconomic {{background}} is {{another source of}} inequality in healthcare. Poverty significantly influences the production of disease since poverty {{increases the likelihood of}} having poor health in addition to decreasing the ability to afford preventative and routine healthcare. Lack of access to healthcare has a significant negative impact on patients, especially those who are uninsured, since they are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have a regular source of care, such as a primary care physician, and are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> delay <b>seeking</b> care until their condition becomes life-threatening. [...] Studies show that people with health insurance receive significantly more care than those who are uninsured, the most vulnerable groups being minorities, young adults, and low-income individuals. The same trend for uninsured versus insured patients holds true for children as well.|$|R
25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls {{are much more likely to}} drop out of school than their male peers, and women are less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E
25|$|A wave of Polish {{immigrants}} {{came to the}} United States following World War II. They {{differed from}} the first wave in {{that they did not}} want to, and often could not, return to Poland. They assimilated rather quickly, learned English and moved into the American middle class with less of the discrimination faced by the first wave. This group of immigrants also had a strong Polish identity; Poland created a strong national and cultural identity during the 1920s and 1930s when it gained independence, and immigrants carried much of this cultural influx to the United States. Poles in the second wave were much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> white-collar and professional positions, took pride in expressing Poland's cultural and historical successes, and did not submit to the low status American Poles had taken in previous generations. The background of these immigrants varied widely. Historically, 5 or 6 million Poles lived in territories annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II. Many were aristocrats, students, university graduates, and middle-class citizens who were systematically categorized by the Soviet police; Polish military officers were killed in Katyn, the civilians were deported to remote territories in Central Asia or Nazi concentration camps. During the War, Poles attempted to seek refuge in the United States, and some were allowed in. Following the War, many Poles escaped Soviet oppression by fleeing to sympathetic Western nations such as the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.|$|E
25|$|While {{most of the}} Millennium Development Goals face a {{deadline}} of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, {{it will be impossible}} to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths. Women with some formal education are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>seek</b> medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children’s nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths. Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year.|$|E
50|$|Uninsured Americans {{are less}} <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have regular {{health care and}} use {{preventive}} services.

A 2007 study published in JAMA concluded that uninsured people were less likely than the insured to receive any medical care after an accidental injury or the onset of a new chronic condition. The uninsured with an injury were also {{twice as likely as}} those with insurance to have received none of the recommended follow-up care, and a similar pattern held for those with a new chronic condition. Uninsured patients are twice as <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> visit hospital emergency rooms as those with insurance; burdening a system meant for true emergencies with less-urgent care needs.|$|R
