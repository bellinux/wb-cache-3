5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release from Görlitz in May 1941, Messiaen was {{appointed}} a professor of harmony at the Paris Conservatoire, where he taught {{until his retirement in}} 1978. He compiled his Technique de mon <b>langage</b> musical ("Technique of my musical language") published in 1944, in which he quotes many examples from his music, particularly the Quartet. Although only in his mid-thirties, his students described him as an outstanding teacher. Among his early students were the composers Pierre Boulez and Karel Goeyvaerts. Other pupils included Karlheinz Stockhausen in 1952, Alexander Goehr in 1956–57, Tristan Murail in 1967–72 and George Benjamin during the late 1970s. The Greek composer Iannis Xenakis was referred to him in 1951; Messiaen urged Xenakis to take advantage of his background in mathematics and architecture in his music.|$|E

25|$|Petipa {{was offered}} the {{position}} of Premier danseur to the Grand Théâtre in Bordeaux in 1841. There, he studied further with the great Vestris, all the while dancing the leads in such ballets as La Fille Mal Gardée, La Péri and Giselle. While performing with the company his skills as not only a dancer but as a partner were much celebrated. His partnering of Carlotta Grisi during a performance of La Péri was much celebrated, particularly his almost acrobatic lifts and catches of the ballerina that dazzled the audience. While in Bordeaux, Petipa began mounting his own original full-length productions. Among these works were La Jolie Bordelaise (The Beauty of Bordeaux), La Vendange (The Grape Picker), L'Intrigue Amoureuse (The Intrigues of Love) and Le <b>Langage</b> des Fleurs (The Voice of the Flowers).|$|E

500|$|As {{an object}} of {{linguistic}} study, [...] "language" [...] has two primary meanings: an abstract concept, and a specific linguistic system, e.g. [...] "French". The Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, who defined the modern discipline of linguistics, first explicitly formulated the distinction using the French word <b>langage</b> for language as a concept, langue as a specific instance of a language system, and parole for the concrete usage of speech in a particular language.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, Takemitsu met Messiaen in New York, {{and during}} [...] "what {{was to be}} a one-hour 'lesson' [...] lasted three hours... Messiaen played his Quartet for the End of Time for Takemitsu at the piano", which, Takemitsu recalled, was like {{listening}} to an orchestral performance. Takemitsu responded to this with his homage to the French composer, Quatrain, for which he asked Messiaen's permission to use the same instrumental combination for the main quartet, cello, violin, clarinet and piano (which is accompanied by orchestra). As well as the obvious similarity of instrumentation, Takemitsu employs several melodic figures that appear to [...] "mimic" [...] certain musical examples given by Messiaen in his Technique de mon <b>langage</b> musical, (see ex. 4). In 1977, Takemitsu reworked Quatrain for quartet alone, without orchestra, and titled the new work Quatrain II ...|$|E

500|$|In 1912 Ravel {{had three}} ballets premiered. The first, to the orchestrated and {{expanded}} version of Ma mère l'Oye, {{opened at the}} Théâtre des Arts in January. The reviews were excellent: the Mercure de France called the score [...] "absolutely ravishing, a masterwork in miniature". The music rapidly entered the concert repertoire; it was played at the Queen's Hall, London, within weeks of the Paris premiere, and was repeated at the Proms later in the same year. The Times praised [...] "the enchantment of the work... the effect of mirage, by which something quite real seems to float on nothing." [...] New York audiences heard {{the work in the}} same year. Ravel's second ballet of 1912 was Adélaïde ou le <b>langage</b> des fleurs, danced to the score of Valses nobles et sentimentales, which opened at the Châtelet in April. Daphnis et Chloé opened at the same theatre in June. This was his largest-scale orchestral work, and took him immense trouble and several years to complete.|$|E
500|$|Clotted {{cream is}} an {{essential}} part of a cream tea, a favourite with tourists particularly in Cornwall and Devon. It is served on scones—or the more traditional [...] "splits" [...] in Cornwall—with strawberry jam (other flavours are generally less acceptable), along with a pot of tea. Traditionally, there are differences in the way it is eaten in each county: in Devon, the cream is traditionally spread first on the scone, with the jam dolloped on top. In Cornwall the jam is spread first with a dollop of cream. Cream teas, known as Devonshire Teas, spread to southern Australia as early immigrants from Cornwall and Devon took their traditional recipes with them. In 2010, <b>Langage</b> Farm in Devon started a campaign for [...] "Devon cream tea" [...] to have protected designation of origin similar to [...] "Cornish clotted cream". One variation on a cream tea is called [...] "Thunder and Lightning" [...] which consists of a round of bread topped with clotted cream and golden syrup, honey, or treacle.|$|E
