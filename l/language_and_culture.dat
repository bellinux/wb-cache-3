5|$|During the Iron Age, a Celtic <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> {{emerged in}} Ireland. How {{and when the}} island of Ireland became Celtic has been debated for close to a century, with the migrations of the Celts {{being one of the}} more {{enduring}} themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, {{there is more than one}} school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The Turkic {{soldiers}} and generals that {{worked in the}} Chinese garrisons of Central Asia spurred Turkic migration into the area. The Turkic <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> of the Tang soldiers there gradually displaced the indigenous Indo-European languages. The native languages of Sogdian and Tokharian disappeared as the Turkic languages spread in the Tarim Basin.|$|E

5|$|Away {{from the}} urban centre, the tribal people of Chamba are divided into two major groups; the Gujjars and the Gaddis. The Gujjars, mainly nomads, came to Chamba across the state border from Kashmir along the trade routes. They belong to nomadic herdsmen of the Islamic community, and travel to lowland Punjab in the autumn with their {{livestock}} to avoid the harsh winter of the Chamba hills. Their features are Turkic and have a distinct <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> aloof from the main town.|$|E
5|$|First Nations peoples have lived, hunted, and {{traveled}} across {{the area for}} at least 10,000 years, as shown by archaeological evidence on Walpole Island. These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture,</b> developing a self-sufficient society where tasks and responsibilities were equally shared among all members.|$|E

5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their quarter {{to be part}} of the Christian Quarter. The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian Quarter is the miaphysitism and distinct <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian Quarter are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN). They have faced many of the same restrictions on their lives as have the Palestinians.|$|E

5|$|Between 1916—when the {{university}} introduced a Doctorate of Philosophy for research—and 1939, {{there were few}} post-graduate students, and {{only one or two}} undergraduates took Arabic in final examinations each year. The subject grew in popularity after the Second World War: Gibb had an international reputation that attracted foreign students, while others from the United Kingdom who had spent time in the Middle East during the war were interested in studying Arabic <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> Julia Bray, the current holder , was appointed in 2012.

5|$|Following Alexander's {{death in}} 323 BC, Anatolia was {{subsequently}} divided {{into a number}} of small Hellenistic kingdoms, all of which became part of the Roman Republic by the mid-1st century BC. The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated under Roman rule, and by the early centuries of the Christian Era, the local Anatolian languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely replaced by ancient Greek <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century CE, large parts of modern-day Turkey were contested between the Romans and neighbouring Parthians through the frequent Roman-Parthian Wars.|$|E
5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture,</b> Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba {{territory}} in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks to make his way further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E

5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture.</b> The movement was publicly supported by Great Britain during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.|$|E

In the Orange Free State Reitz {{played an important role}} in the modernisation of the legal system and the state's administrative organisation.

5|$|Result {{from the}} {{expansion}} of the British Empire, British cultural influence can be observed in the <b>language</b> <b>and</b> <b>culture</b> of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E
