50|$|The Eastern <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (Euthynnus affinis) {{has been}} {{available}} for decades as a low-mercury, less expensive canned tuna. However, of the five major species of canned tuna imported by the United States it is the least commercially attractive, primarily due to its dark color and more pronounced 'fishy' flavor.

5000|$|Commonly called false {{albacore}} or <b>little</b> <b>tuna,</b> it resembles the Atlantic bonito, skipjack tuna, and species of mackerel. The little tunny feeds primarily on pelagic fish. It is best {{identified by the}} dark spots appearing between its pectoral and ventral fins and [...] "worm-like" [...] markings on its back. Commercially, the fish is used as bait for sharks and marlin due to its high oil content and hook retention. It {{is considered by many}} to be a trash fish because of its limited nutritional value; ciguatera poisoning related to its consumption has even been reported. However, the little tunny is commercially important in many locations, including the West Indies. It is marketed fresh, dried, canned, smoked, and frozen. It is sought-after as a sport fish due to its line-stripping 64 km/h runs and hard fighting ability when hooked. By trolling with lures near reefs, it can be caught on hook and line.|$|E
50|$|The 2004 marine {{production}} in Thailand was composed of: pelagic fish 33 percent, demersal fish 18 percent, cephalopod 7.5 percent, crustaceans 4.5 percent, trash fish 30 percent and others 7 percent. Trash fish refers to non-edible species, edible species of low commercial value and juveniles, which are {{released to the}} sea. Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular. So, the mollusk production has decreased from 27,374 tonnes in 1999 to 318 tonnes in 2004. While crustaceans composed only 4.5 {{percent of the total}} marine products in 2004 by volume, they accounted for 21 percent of the total value. They were dominated by banana prawn, tiger prawn, king prawn, school prawn, bay lobster (Thenus orientalis), mantis shrimp, swimming crabs and mud crabs. The total catch in 2004 was 51,607 tonnes for squid and cuttlefish and 36,071 tonnes for crustaceans.|$|E

A total of 286 larvae were analyzed for this study, of which 72 larvae corresponded to bluefin, 57 to albacore, 81 to bullet tuna and 76 to <b>little</b> tunny. <b>Tuna</b> larvae were separated into the pre-flexion and post-flexion developmental stages. Within the size 3 – 9 mm standard length (SL), the stable isotope of nitrogen (δ 15 N) showed significant differences between species where bluefin tuna larvae ranked highest. Pre-flexion bluefin <b>tuna</b> and <b>little</b> tunny larvae showed significantly higher δ 15 N signatures than the post-flexion larvae. This effect is attributed to a biochemical trace of maternal δ 15 N signatures. However, neither albacore nor bullet tuna larvae showed this pattern in δ 15 N signatures, possibly owing to a compensation effect between lower maternal δ 15 N values transmitted to pre-flexion larvae and the early increase of δ 15 N values in post-flexion stages. One way ANOVA showed significant differences between species in the stable isotope ratio of carbon (δ 13 C) values, which suggests specific differences of carbon sources. Furthermore, a similar significant ontogenic effect between δ 13 C signatures of pre-flexion and post-flexion larvae is also evidenced in all four species. At pre-flexion stages, all species except bullet tuna larvae showed significant negative relationships between δ 15 N and larval standard length. At post-flexion stages, a significant linear relationship with larval size was only observed in albacore and bullet tuna larvae indicating a possible trophic shift towards early piscivory. With respect to δ 13 C values with larval size, all four species showed significant linear decreases. It {{may be explained by}} the metabolism of growth of somatic mass subject to modification of the relative carbon isotopic sources.

Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), leerfish (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), blue butterfish (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely.

Germ cell transplantation (GCT) is an innovative technology {{for the production of}} inter-species surrogates, capable of revolutionizing the aquaculture industry by facilitating easy handling, shorter generation time and a more economical management of large bodied broodstock, such as the SBT. This study aimed at developing the specific methods, molecular tools and knowledge to establish SBT surrogates for the SBT. Yellowtail kingfish (YTK, Seriola lalandi), was assessed as a potential surrogate host for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to produce SBT donor-derived gametes upon sexual maturity. In order to achieve this objective, germ cell populations were described in testis of donor SBT males using basic histology and the molecular markers vasa and dead-end genes. The peripheral area of SBT testis was found to contain the highest proportions of dead-end-expressing transplantable type A spermatogonia (ASG). Percoll-enriched SBT testicular germ cells preparations were then transplanted into the coelomic cavity of 7 - 9 days post hatch YTK larvae. Fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis have detected presence of SBT cells in the gonads of the transplanted YTK fingerlings at 18, 28, 39 and 75 days post transplantation (dpt), indicating that the transplanted cells migrated to the genital ridge and had colonized the developing gonad. However, further PCR and in situ hybridization analyses of YTK gonads at 165 dpt and PCR analysis of semen collected from sexually mature transplanted YTK males at 1. 5 years post transplantation, were not able to detect SBT germ cell-derived DNA or RNA, suggesting that the donor cells were not maintained in the hosts’ gonads. This study demonstrates that YTK larvae can support migration and colonization of transplanted SBT spermatogonial cells, despite the phylogenetic distance between the two species. Other species from the Scombridae family (which are phylogenetically closer to SBT) were considered as potential surrogate hosts for GCT of SBT spermatogonial cells, to increase the chances of successful development of the transplanted cells. A method for capture and transport of live pelagic Scombrid fish using “tuna tubes” was developed and optimized. Eight mediumsized mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis, also known as eastern <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> or kawakawa) and leaping bonito (Cybiosarda elegans) were captured and transported alive to the holding tank at the Bribie Island Research Centre (BIRC), 3 of them acclimatized to the tank conditions. Twenty-eight additional small-sized blue mackerels (Scomber australasicus) were captured and transported alive to BIRC, using a 300 L rectangular transport tank, and were treated to induce spawning. None of the captured fish spawned in captivity, but the methods and equipment that were developed and optimized, proved useful for small-scale capture and transport of live Scombrids, as a preliminary step {{for the establishment of a}} potential surrogate host broodstock for the SBT. Key genes involved in the reproductive molecular pathway and specifically, germ cell development in the gonads, were described using transcriptome analysis of male and female SBT gonad cells, acquired by next-generation RNA-sequencing. Expression profiles of transcripts from ovary and testis cells were compared, as well as Percoll-enriched cell preparations (as used in GCT) to crude testis cells. ASG-specific genes were identified for the first time in SBT, and were used to develop molecular markers to allow specific identification and localization of different germ cell populations in SBT gonads. These SBT germ cell-specific molecular probes were used to distinguish between transplanted SBT germ cells and the YTK host endogenous cells in a GCT experiment. The methods, experience, tools and knowledge acquired in this study present for the first time the exciting possibility of GCT to produce inter-species surrogates for the SBT. The tools established in this research will enable the Australian aquaculture industry to continue and pursue surrogate technology for the SBT, as well as to other hard-to-breed, large and late-maturing highvalued species.
