5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou.

In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.|$|E
