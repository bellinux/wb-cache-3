The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study {{influences}} of applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile top {{on the negative}} skin friction behaviors of piles, field investigations of negative skin friction behaviors of three identical piles with different <b>loads</b> <b>on</b> pile top {{are made in the}} same site. Test results show that applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile top affects negative skin friction behaviors evidently. Additional settlement of pile induced by negative skin friction becomes larger, negative skin friction induced by the settlement of soil surrounding the pile becomes smaller with the increase of <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile top. Dragload induced by negative skin friction decreases and position of neutral point in pile moves up while applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile top increases. While there is no applied <b>load</b> <b>on</b> pile top, additional settlement induced by negative skin friction is minimum, dragload induced by negative skin friction is maximum and the neutral point is the farthest from the top of piles. The field investigation results may be useful to the further research for negative skin friction behaviors of pile...|$|R

5|$|After work on UB-10 was {{complete}} at the Weser yard, she was readied for rail shipment. The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down {{into what was}} essentially a knock down kit. Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded onto eight railway flatcars. In early 1915, the sections of UB-10 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three-week process. After UB-10 was assembled and launched on 20 February, she was <b>loaded</b> <b>on</b> a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials.|$|E

On discovering the deserted village, the soldiers not only reclaimed the looted merchandise but also took animal pelts and twocanoes.

5|$|Jerome made news in 1917, when strikes {{involving}} the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) {{led to the}} expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were <b>loaded</b> <b>on</b> a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, rose again, then fell again {{during and after the}} Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21stcentury, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.|$|E

By the time the ghetto was liquidated, 8,000 Jews remained. They were <b>loaded</b> <b>on</b> a train to Auschwitz concentration camp, but less than half survived the journey. Most of the survivors were deemed unsuitable for forced labour and were murdered immediately on their arrival at Auschwitz. According to testimony of several witnesses as recorded in his 1946 indictment for war crimes, Göth personally shot between 30 and 90 women and children during the liquidation of the ghetto.|$|E

The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned.

The A Squadron vehicles were unloaded near Wadi Bei el Chebir, east of the expected German rearguard near Wadi Temet, and the regiment caught up on 14 January. The following day, A Squadron crossed the road and withstood shelling by anti-tank guns and artillery until the afternoon. B Squadron probed south, also encountering German anti-tank guns. After one of its Stuart tanks knocked out an anti-tank gun, B Squadron advanced through the German line, dislodging anti-tank guns and destroying a Sd.Kfz. 250 half-track. During the afternoon, C Squadron failed to break through the German centre but that night the Germans withdrew. On 16 January, the regiment advanced to high ground above the airstrip at Sedada, losing a tank and carrier. C Squadron advanced down the plateau in the darkness, losing a carrier to a mine on the trail. The regiment found an alternate route, ending the day in Wadi Merdum. On 18 January, Div Cav advanced through rugged country to Beni Ulid. The regiment advanced towards Tarhuna the following day, bivouacking halfway there, before discovering a route through the hills north of the road.|$|E

The barrels were collected and transported to Marseille, where they were <b>loaded</b> <b>on</b> a ship bound for the United States. During the loading process a barrel fell into the water and had to be retrieved by a Navy diver. In Marseilles, the Alsos Mission detachment also met up with the detachment that had been sent to Italy, which now rejoined them.

5|$|There are {{two main}} kinds of freight, bulk cargo and break bulk or general cargo, most of which is now transported in containers. Commodities {{in the form of}} liquids, powder or {{particles}} are carried loose in the holds of bulk carriers and include oil, grain, coal, ore, scrap metal, sand and gravel. Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal. The use of containers has greatly increased the efficiency and decreased the cost of moving them with most freight now traveling in standard sized, lockable containers <b>loaded</b> <b>on</b> purpose-built container ships at dedicated terminals. Freight forwarding firms book cargo, arrange pickup and delivery, and manage documentation. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization, based in London and first convened in 1959. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.|$|E
