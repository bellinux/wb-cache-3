5|$|On Baldwin's {{death the}} castle was {{inherited}} by his daughter, Adeliza, {{but the family}} appear to have taken <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the property. Okehampton Castle {{does not seem to}} have played a part in the civil war from 1139 and 1153 known as the Anarchy.|$|E
5|$|Artificial trees made of goose {{feathers}} were {{in use in}} American homes {{since the}} 1880s. In the 1930s, however, The Addis Brush Company, an American toilet bowl brush manufacturer, began making artificial trees of green-dyed bristles and then supplied the British (who suffered a dearth of wild trees) with thousands of artificial trees in the post-War years. Americans took <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Addis artificial trees and remained loyal to real trees.|$|E

5|$|Banned from competition, Chambers sought {{alternative}} commercial {{outlets for}} his athletic prowess. He had an unsuccessful American football try-out with the San Francisco 49ers, hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah. He drifted {{on to the}} celebrity circuit, appearing on British reality television series Hell's Kitchen in May 2004. However, Chambers had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the show and soon chose to leave. He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} Prince of Wales, and took <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the Prince of Wales died {{unexpectedly}} from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited {{one of his}} father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George Prince of Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{paid for}} his middle nephew's {{business}} classes at the Academy of Commerce until his 1912 graduation, and arranged his hiring by the stock exchange soon after. Unlike his older brother Imre, {{who worked at the}} exchange in Budapest for all his life, Kertész had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the field. He was drawn to illustrated magazines and to activities like fishing and swimming in the Danube River near his uncle's property.|$|E
50|$|With {{the title}} Visitatore generale del Regno, he {{surveyed}} {{the state of the}} kingdom, and proposed agricultural and economic reforms. A critic of the top layers of Neapolitan society, he considered them too <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> commerce.|$|R

2500|$|In 1807 Dumont was {{admitted}} to the Naval Academy at Brest where he presented himself as a timid young man, very serious and studious, <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> amusements and much more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> studies than in military matters. [...] In 1808, he obtained the grade of first class candidate.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, there was <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{preserving}} the wall {{due to the}} negative memories associated with the Nazi occupation. One of the best preserved parts is the Todt Battery. In 2011, renewed efforts to preserve the wall were spearheaded by organisations in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Some of the beach fortifications have toppled or are underwater, while the ones further inland are still mainly extant due to their location.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Nalder {{reported}} after {{a survey}} of his province {{that there was a}} general lack of tribal cohesion. Governor-General Sir Stewart Symes at Khartoum had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> development of the south of Sudan and he advised the local officials that chiefs should have territorial rather than ethnic authority. In 1936 Mongalla and the Bahr al-Ghazal provinces were incorporated into the Equatoria province, with headquarters at Juba, with parts of Upper Nile province detached.|$|E

60|$|He made no answer; indeed, {{he seemed}} <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> my mother's words. He turned, instead, {{to me and}} read in my face all the enthusiasm which hers lacked. I would have spoken, but {{he held up his}} hand and checked me.|$|R

Trifles [...] "Our educators, panting after professionalism, are <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> being {{known for}} a picayune concern with trifles like {{spelling}} and punctuation.

60|$|I was too <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{the vague}} {{symbolism}} of this fresco {{to examine it}} with care--the rather that the subject beneath, the literal contest of the Church with the world, needed more time for study in itself alone than I had for all Florence.|$|R
5|$|In his youth, William Wilberforce showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> women, {{but when}} he was in his late thirties his friend Thomas Babington {{recommended}} twenty-year-old Barbara Ann Spooner (1777–1847) as a potential bride. Wilberforce met her two days later on 15 April 1797, and was immediately smitten; following an eight-day whirlwind romance, he proposed. Despite the urgings of friends to slow down, the couple married at the Church of St Swithin in Bath, Somerset, on 30 May 1797. They were devoted to each other, and Barbara was very attentive and supportive to Wilberforce in his increasing ill health, though she showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> his political activities. They had six children in fewer than ten years: William (b. 1798), Barbara (b. 1799), Elizabeth (b. 1801), Robert Isaac Wilberforce (b. 1802), Samuel Wilberforce (b. 1805) and Henry William Wilberforce (b. 1807). Wilberforce was an indulgent and adoring father who revelled in his time at home and at play with his children.|$|E
5|$|James and Henrietta Townsend's son, Henry Hare Townsend, showed <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{the area}} {{or in the}} {{traditional}} role of the Lord of the Manor. After leasing the house to a succession of tenants, the house and grounds were sold in 1792 to Thomas Smith of Gray's Inn as a country residence.|$|E
5|$|Olga Rudge, {{pregnant}} with Pound's child, followed them to Italy. She had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> raising a child, but {{may have felt}} that having one would maintain her connection to him. In July 1925 {{she gave birth to}} their daughter, Mary. Olga placed the child with a German-speaking peasant woman whose own child had died, and who agreed to raise Mary for 200 lire a month.|$|E
50|$|Film expert Rajesh Subramanian {{elucidates}} that Rajendra who was <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> studies quit {{college and}} landed in Bombay to work in films like his brother. He did some plays at Prithvi theatre like Pathan and Shakuntala. It was here that he became close to Shammi Kapoor.|$|R
50|$|Losev was {{schooled in}} the {{classics}} at gymnasium {{from the age}} of ten. He was <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> his studies until he was introduced to philosophy.

5000|$|Stuart Yarworth Blanch, Baron Blanch [...] (2 February 1918 - 3 June 1994) was an Anglican priest, {{bishop and}} archbishop. <b>Little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{religion}} in his youth, {{he became a}} committed Christian {{at the age of}} 21, while serving in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.|$|R
5|$|Suharto's {{upbringing}} {{contrasts with}} that of leading Indonesian nationalists such as Sukarno in that he {{is believed to have}} had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> anti-colonialism, or political concerns beyond his immediate surroundings. Unlike Sukarno and his circle, Suharto had little or no contact with European colonizers. Consequently, he did not learn to speak Dutch or other European languages in his youth. He learned to speak Dutch after his induction into the Dutch military in 1940.|$|E
5|$|William Kenrick MP; {{she died}} when he was a small boy. Joseph Chamberlain had had another son, Austen Chamberlain, by his first marriage. Neville Chamberlain was educated at Rugby School. Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College (the future University of Birmingham). Neville Chamberlain had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> his studies there, and in 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants. Within six months he became a {{salaried}} employee.|$|E
5|$|William {{excluded}} George {{from active}} military service, and neither George nor Anne wielded any great influence {{until after the}} deaths of Mary and then William, at which point Anne became queen. During his wife's reign, George occasionally used his influence {{in support of his}} wife, even when privately disagreeing with her views. He had an easy-going manner and <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> politics; his appointment as Lord High Admiral in 1702 was largely honorary.|$|E
60|$|Bailey did. His father, of whom {{he stood}} in the {{greatest}} awe, was very <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> any subject except the financial affairs of the firm of Bannister & Son. It required greater courage than Bailey possessed to place this matter before him. He had an uneasy feeling that Ruth knew it.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lynn {{stopped short}} upon the {{pavement}} {{and looked at his}} companion in amazement. The latter had the air of one very <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the subject of conversation. He was watching approvingly a barrowful of lilac and other spring flowers being wheeled along by a flower-seller {{in the middle of the}} road.|$|R
50|$|In {{conditions}} of isolation, as Furman himself remarked, Russian thinkers {{of his generation}} were inevitably in some degree autodidacts, always liable to reinvent the bicycle. Furman was also, as his friend and best commentator Georgi Derluguian noted, by temperament a pragmatic researcher, <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> intellectual genealogies or engagement with parallel bodies of work.|$|R
5|$|According to Jim Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H. Jones Center for Economic and Demographic Forecasting at Rice Center, a Rice University-affiliated urban research center, {{the development of these}} apartment complexes was not well planned or coordinated. There was often <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> building a quality product as developers were primarily concerned with generating quick revenue and capitalizing on the deregulation of financial institutions, tax laws favoring apartment construction, inflation, and a housing shortage in the Houston metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences. However, he had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> sports or the Olympic games (unlike his father), seeking only the Homeric ideals of honour (timê) and glory (kudos). He had great {{charisma}} and force of personality, characteristics {{which made him}} a great leader. His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death—only Alexander {{had the ability to}} do so.|$|E
5|$|Although he had <b>little</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> formal {{education}} and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 {{at the age}} of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and beehive hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5000|$|O2TV is {{positioned}} as [...] "one {{of the first}} TV projects which aren't devoted to housewives". Instead, it's [...] "television for youth, those who are <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the traditional TV stuff, those who live a full life". The major principle of the channel is live communication with the viewers. O2TV doesn't buy any content, but produces its own.|$|R
50|$|The main {{years of}} the {{controversy}} were 1608 to 1614, but publications directly connected with it appeared until 1620. Subsequently it remained a topic of polemics, but Charles I was <b>little</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> continuing his father's patronage of writers who addressed it. By the 1630s authors such as Du Moulin and David Blondel on these topics could expect no reward.|$|R
