5|$|At {{first light}} a {{clearing}} patrol from D Company, 3 RAR swept {{the area with}} tanks and APCs in support, killing and capturing a number of attackers that had been pinned down in old B-52 bomb craters {{to the north of}} Balmoral. The daylight revealed that the North Vietnamese had once again been soundly defeated leaving 42 dead and seven prisoners, while Australian losses were one killed and eight wounded. Quantities of weapons, clothing, ammunition and equipment were also recovered by the Australians. Phillips was subsequently awarded the Military Cross for his leadership during the battle. Many of the North Vietnamese dead were teenagers of 16 or 17 years, evidence that the PAVN had begun drafting 15-year-old boys into its combat units; as had happened after the earlier fighting, their bodies were collected by a bulldozer and buried in a mass grave. Later, a large number of shell scrapes were discovered to the north-east of Balmoral during an aerial reconnaissance by a Sioux <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter,</b> and they were thought likely to have been used by the North Vietnamese as an assembly area before being engaged by artillery firing defensive fire tasks early in the battle. The successful defence of Balmoral and the high ratio of North Vietnamese killed had confirmed the judgement of MacDonald and Dunstan and validated the decision to adopt an aggressive defence with strong static positions and forceful patrolling. The failed assault proved to be the final attempt to remove 1 ATF from AO Surfers, and there were no further attacks by the North Vietnamese against either Coral or Balmoral.|$|E

25|$|On October 14, 1960, the United States Navy {{solicited}} {{response from}} 25 aircraft manufacturers {{to a request}} for proposals (RFP) {{on behalf of the}} Army for the <b>Light</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Helicopter</b> (LOH). Bell entered the competition along with 12 other manufacturers, including Hiller Aircraft and Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Division. Bell submitted the D-250 design, which would be designated as the YHO-4. On May 19, 1961, Bell and Hiller were announced as winners of the design competition.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, {{prior to}} {{full-time}} production, Hughes provided five preproduction Model 269 examples to the U.S. Army for evaluation as a <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> {{to replace the}} aging OH-13 Sioux and OH-23 Raven. Designated as the YHO-2HU the helicopter was eventually turned down. 9 April 1959, the 269 received certification from the FAA and Hughes continued to concentrate on civil production. With some design changes, deliveries of the Model 269A version began in 1961. By mid-1963 about 20 aircraft were being produced a month and {{by the spring of}} 1964, 314 had been built.|$|E
25|$|The first Bell 206A flew on January 10, 1966, and the {{aircraft}} was revealed later that {{month at the}} Helicopter Association of America (HAA) convention. On October 20, 1966, the JetRanger received FAA certification. Delivery of the JetRanger to customers began on January 13, 1967, with the first aircraft being purchased by Harry Holly, CEO of the Hollymatic Corporation and previous owner of a Bell Ranger. In 1968, the United States Navy selected the 206A as its primary trainer, the TH-57 Sea Ranger. The Army also eventually selected the 206A for a <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> as the OH-58 Kiowa.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, light {{aircraft}} {{such as the}} Auster were used as air observation posts. Officers from the British Royal Artillery were trained as pilots to fly AOP aircraft for artillery spotting.The air observation role was generally taken over by <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopters,</b> such as the Hughes OH-6 Cayuse, from the mid-1960s.|$|R
500|$|Over the {{following}} days 1 ATF continued patrolling, although these operations resulted in only small-scale {{contact with the}} North Vietnamese. On 27 May an Australian Sioux <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> was damaged by ground fire during a reconnaissance flight [...] outside AO Newport, and air strikes on the area exposed several bunkers which were {{likely to have been}} used by the North Vietnamese as a headquarters; they were subsequently destroyed by artillery fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Bell 206 is {{a family}} of two-bladed, single- or twin-engined helicopters, {{manufactured}} by Bell Helicopter at its Mirabel, Quebec plant. Originally developed as the Bell YOH-4 for the United States Army's <b>Light</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Helicopter</b> program, it was not selected by the Army. Bell redesigned the airframe and successfully marketed the aircraft commercially as the five-place Bell 206A JetRanger. The new design was eventually selected by the Army as the OH-58 Kiowa. Bell also developed a seven-place LongRanger, which was later offered with a twin-engined option as the TwinRanger, while Tridair Helicopters offers a similar conversion of the LongRanger called the Gemini ST. The ICAO-assigned model designation [...] "B06" [...] is used on flight plans for the JetRanger and LongRanger, and the designation [...] "B06T" [...] {{is used for the}} twin-engined TwinRangers.|$|E
2500|$|The Gazelle {{originated}} in a French Army requirement for a lightweight observation helicopter intended {{to replace the}} Aérospatiale Alouette III; {{early on in the}} aircraft's development, the decision was taken to enlarge the helicopter to enable greater versatility and make it more attractive for the export market. [...] In 1966, Sud Aviation began working on a <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> to replace its Alouette II with seating for five people. [...] The first prototype SA 340 flew {{for the first time on}} 7 April 1967, it initially flew with a conventional tail rotor taken from the Alouette II. [...] The tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive fenestron tail on the second prototype. Four SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm Westland Helicopters. On 6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight. [...] On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307km/h over 3 kilometres and 292km/h over 100 kilometres.|$|E
25|$|In comparison, allied {{losses were}} light. US forces lost 72 killed and 337 wounded while South Vietnamese {{casualties}} amounted to 11 killed and 8 wounded. U.S. equipment lost included two tanks and five {{armored personnel carriers}} destroyed; damage was sustained by three tanks, nine APC's, one tankdozer, two jeeps and two <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopters.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The M27 system {{provides}} a mount for one M134 7.62×51mm machine gun (Minigun) {{for either the}} OH-6 or OH-58 <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopters.</b> The system is provided with an XM70/E1 sight and a MAU-56/A delinking feeder with 2000 rounds of ammunition.

50|$|In 2006, the {{squadron}} was strengthened with {{the delivery of}} 11 A109 Hirundo <b>Light</b> <b>Observation</b> <b>Helicopters</b> (LOH). 5 of the A109s were delivered in December 2005 with {{the balance of the}} delivery made during 2006. Pasukan Udara Tentera Darat becomes the first operator of the A109 LOH in Asia. These helicopters replace the retired SA 316 Alouette III.|$|R
2500|$|The rest of 6 RAR {{continued}} the search, with A Company discovering {{a series of}} freshly built and recently abandoned hides along the Viet Cong withdrawal route which were {{believed to have been}} prepared as delay positions. An older defensive position of approximately 40 pits was also found, while C Company located a makeshift hospital close by containing 14 graves. Both had recently been occupied. Later an Australian <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter</b> reported the presence of scattered groups of civilians, with the largest numbering 30 to 40 people—mostly women with baskets and bags, while others had ox carts—who were believed to be carrying medical supplies. These reports were followed up by the 1st APC Squadron and a number of military age males were detained for questioning. The infantry companies completed their search by midday, moving {{to the edge of the}} rubber plantation, [...] north-east of Long Tan. Smithfield concluded at 17:00 with the Australians returning to Nui Dat by helicopter and APC by 17:30. They had hoped to catch the remnants of the Viet Cong force before they could reach their mountain sanctuaries, but the operation proved unsuccessful in preventing their withdrawal. A number of Australian officers later questioned the caution with which it was conducted. Yet Jackson had been unable to mount a pursuit due to the continued threat posed by the 274th Regiment, which was still believed to be in the area. With 1 ATF lacking the resources required for such an operation, the opportunity to trap and destroy the Viet Cong while they were still vulnerable was lost and they made good their escape.|$|E
2500|$|On May 16, Associated Press {{correspondent}} Jay Sharbutt {{learned of}} the ongoing battle on Hill 937, traveled to the area and interviewed Zais, in particular asking why infantry, rather than firepower, {{was used as the}} primary offensive tool on Hill 937. More reporters followed to cover the battle, and the term [...] "Hamburger Hill" [...] became widely used. The U.S. brigade commander ordered a coordinated two-battalion assault for May 18, [...] 1/506th attacking from the south and 3/187th attacking from the north, trying to keep the 29th NVA Regiment from concentrating on either battalion. Fighting to within [...] of the summit, Delta Company 3/187th nearly carried the hill but experienced severe casualties, including all of its officers. The battle was one of close combat, with the two sides exchanging small arms and grenade fire within [...] of one another. From a <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopter,</b> the battalion commander attempted to coordinate the movements of the other companies into a final assault, but an exceptionally intense thunderstorm reduced visibility to zero and ended the fighting. Unable to advance, 3/187 again withdrew down the mountain. The three converging companies of 1/506th struggled to take Hill 900, the southern crest of the mountain, encountering heavy opposition {{for the first time in}} the battle. Because of the heavy casualties already sustained by his units and under pressure from the unwanted attention of the press, Zais seriously considered discontinuing the attack but decided otherwise. Both the corps commander and the MACV commander, General Creighton W. Abrams, publicly supported the decision. Zais decided to commit three fresh battalions to the battle and to have one of them relieve the 3/187th in place. The 3/187th's losses had been severe, with approximately 320 killed or wounded, including more than sixty percent of the 450 experienced troops who had assaulted into the valley. Two of its four company commanders and eight of twelve platoon leaders had become casualties. The battalion commander of the 2/506th, Lt. Col. Gene Sherron, arrived at Honeycutt's CP on the afternoon of May 18 to coordinate the relief. 3/187th was flying out its latest casualties, and its commander had not yet been informed of the relief. Before any arrangements were made, Zais landed and was confronted by Honeycutt, who argued that his battalion was still combat effective. After a sharp confrontation, Zais relented, although he assigned one of Sherron's companies to Honeycutt as reinforcement for the assault.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedEfforts {{to establish a}} helicopter research program in structural dynamics at NPS were greatly enhanced when the U. S. Army donated two OH- 6 A <b>light</b> <b>observation</b> <b>helicopters.</b> One of the helicopters is reserved for ground vibration testing and dynamics research. Vibration measurements are extremely important in predicting and understanding an aircraft's dynamic behavior and durability. A comparison of a helicopters natural frequencies and those frequencies transmitted to the airframe through the rotor system can alert the designer/evaluator to possible dynamic problems. This thesis establishes a baseline vibration test program on the OH- 6 A helicopter for future testing and comparison to analytic models. The goal of the research is to establish natural frequencies (eigenvalues) principal mode shapes (eigenvectors), and damping characteristics of the OH- 6 A and to compare these values to test and analytical data obtained from the McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company.
