25|$|Bunthorne, heartbroken by Patience's rejection, {{has chosen}} to raffle himself off among his lady {{followers}} ("Let the merry cymbals sound"), the proceeds going to charity.

Just as Bunthorne is handing the bag to the unattractive Jane, ready for the worst, Patience interrupts the proceedings and proposes to unselfishly sacrifice herself by loving the poet ("True Love must single-hearted be"). A delighted Bunthorne accepts immediately, and his followers, their idol lost, return to the Dragoons to whom they are engaged ("I hear the soft note of the echoing voice").
