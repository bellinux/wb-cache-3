"Lubricating the Transmission, About {{once every}} five thousand miles the gear lubricant should be drained from the transmission {{by removing the}} drain plug {{at the bottom of}} transmission case. The interior of the trans-mission case should then be thoroughlt flished with kerosene and refilled with fresh gear lubricant. The new lubricant is poured into the transmission through the filler hole, located at the right hand side of the transmission tcase. Pour sufficient lubricant in unti lit reaches the level of the filler hole.; Lubricating the Differential, Every 5000 miles the lubricant in the differential should be drained and the housing flushed with kerosene. New lubricant should then be added until it reaches the level of the oil filler hole in the housing. In the truck the lubricant in the differential must be kept up {{to the level of the}} filler plug oppening at all times.; Engine Lubrication, All parts of the engine are lubricated from the oil reservoir in the oil pan by the Ford Pump, Splash and Gravity Feed. Only high grade engine oil should be used in the engine. Oil of this kind reaches the bearing surfaces with greater east and cuts down frictional heat. It should have sufficient body so that the pressure between the two bearing surfaces will not force out the oil and allow the metal to come in actual contact. Inferior oils have a tendency to carbonize quickly, also "gu m up" the piston rings, valve stems and bearings. In cold weather a light grade of oil having a <b>low</b> <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> is absolutely essential for the proper lubrication of the car. In general an oil having the body S. A. E. viscosity No. 40 will prove satisfactory for summer use. While for winter use oil having specifica-tions of S. A. E. No. 20 should be used. It is essential, however, that this winter oil have a low cold test.; Draining the Oil Pan, It is advisable to clean out the oil pan by draining off the old oil when the new car has been driven five hundred miles, and thereafter to repeat this operation every 500 miles. The oil should be warm before draining.; Lubricating Shock Absorber Connections, The ball joints are made in unit with the instrument arm and spring perches. They are hardened and ground. The ball joint seats are enclosed in the shock absorber connecting links, which should be lubricated every 500 miles with the compressor gun. In order to secure maximum riding comfort, it is important that the spring hangers be free in the bushings and kept well greased. " [...] on instructions...|$|E

Plants store inorganic phosphate (Pi) in seeds as phytic acid (PA). Phytic acid chelates essential macro and micronutrients in developing seeds forming phytate, which is nutritionally unavailable to monogastric livestock. Composition changes to lower the PA content of seeds may affect seed viability and seedling performance. This project was conducted in 2006 and 2007 to test the viability, vigor, and field performance of a high phytase activity, transgenic soybean line, CAPPA compared to its progenitor, Jack. CAPPA seeds contain increased phytase activity, a > 90 % reduction in PA, and a concomitant increase in Pi. A seedling dry mass study measured dry mass gain for each entry from 8 days after planting (DAP) through 21 DAP. A yield component study measured the vegetative and reproductive dry mass gain for each entry from the R 5 -R 8 stages. Laboratory vigor experiments involving standard germination, accelerated aging, <b>cold</b> <b>test,</b> electrical conductivity, and tetrazolium testing were conducted. Field emergence of all entries was low in 2006 and 2007. There {{was no significant difference in}} field emergence between CAPPA and Jack in 2006, but in 2007 Jack field emergence was significantly higher than CAPPA. There was no significant difference between CAPPA and Jack in seedling dry mass 8 - 21 DAP. Jack vegetative dry mass was significantly greater than CAPPA in 2006 and 2007, but CAPPA seeds per plant, seed weight, and yield did not differ significantly from Jack over the two study years. There was no significant difference between Jack and CAPPA standard germination. Germination following accelerated aging was low but did not differ significantly between Jack and CAPPA. Jack seed germination was <b>low</b> following <b>cold</b> <b>testing,</b> but was significantly higher than CAPPA. Tetrazolium testing indicated no significant difference in viability between Jack and CAPPA. Electrolyte leakage of both entries was high, but did not differ significantly. CAPPA vigor appears to be lower than Jack, but due to high variability in the field environment over the study years, field emergence results are not conclusive. Further research is needed to indicate CAPPA's potential as a commercially released low PA soybean line. Emerged CAPPA plants grew to be competitive, high yielding plants...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: The {{vitality}} pulp {{tests are}} necessary for diagnosis of pulpal disease and differentiation between endodontic and non-endodontic diseases. Thermal and electrical tests are conventional methods for evaluation of pulp vitality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of thermal changes on the toothresponse to the electric pulp tester. Materials and Methods: In this study, 160 intact maxillary central incisors of 40 voluntaries were evaluated. After isolation, electric pulpal response threshold in patients were recorded. After heat and <b>cold</b> <b>tests,</b> the electrical pulp test was repeated. The degree of response was recorded. The data were analyzed using pair T-test and independent T-test. Results: The result of this study demonstrated that the average of teeth response to the electric pulp tester before and after <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> was 1. 3 and 1. 7, respectively. The average was 1. 4 and 1. 7 before and after heat test,respectively.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growing demand}} for high quality soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] seeds {{requires}} a precise seed quality control system from the seed industry. One way to accomplish this is by improving vigor <b>testing.</b> <b>Cold</b> <b>test</b> has been traditionally employed for corn seeds. However, {{it has also been}} used for other seed crops such as cotton (Gossypium spp.), soybean (Glycine Max), dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (Pisum sativum). This study was carried out with the objective of adjusting an alternative procedure for the <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> to determine soybean seed vigor. Six commercial soybean seed lots of the cultivar BRS 133 were used. The physiological potential of the seed lots was evaluated by germination on paper towel and sand box, seedling field emergence, tetrazolium, accelerated aging and electrical conductivity tests. Seed moisture content was also determined. The temperature used for the <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures was 10 °C during five days. Four <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures were evaluated: i) plastic boxes with soil; ii) rolled paper towel with soil; iii) rolled paper towel without soil, and iv) an alternative procedure, using rolled paper towel without soil under cold water. A completely randomized experimental design with eight replications was used and the means were compared by the Tukey test (p = 0. 05). To verify the dependence between the alternative test and others single linear correlation was used. All <b>cold</b> <b>test</b> procedures had similar coefficients of variation (CV), highlighting that rolled paper towel with soil and the alternative procedure had the best performance, with an average of 94 % and 93 % normal seedlings and CV of 3. 2 % and 3. 6 %, respectively.
