40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the unknown parameters of a nonlinear (plant) model for an unstable, <b>limit</b> <b>cycling</b> system is considered. A feedback linearizing control is used {{that aims to}} cancel the nonlinear terms in the plant model and to alter the linear terms such that the closed-loop plant model matches with a specified linear reference model. The controller parameters are unknown and are evolved, starting from zero, by an adaptive law that aims to drive them towards their ideal values that would provide perfect model matching between the reference model and the closed-loop plant model. The converged controller parameters would then provide good estimates for the unknown plant parameters. An external forcing signal is considered, common to both the reference model and the plant, and an adaptation law {{in the presence of}} this forcing function is derived using Lyapunov methods. Significantly, the same stability analysis is used both to derive a controller for the <b>limit</b> <b>cycling</b> system and also to provide {{a solution to the problem}} of parameter estimation.

Since 1965, bikesharing has grown across the globe on four continents including: Europe, North America, South America, and Asia (including Australia). Today, there are approximately 100 bikesharing programs operating in an estimated 125 cities {{around the world with}} over 139, 300 bicycles. Bikesharingâs evolution is categorized into three generations: 1) White Bikes (or Free Bike Systems); 2) Coin-Deposit Systems; and 3) IT-Based Systems. In this paper, the authors propose a fourth-generation: âDemand-Responsive, Multi-Modal Systems. â A range of existing bikesharing business models (e. g., advertising) and lessons learned are discussed including: 1) bicycle theft and vandalism; 2) bicycle redistribution; 3) information systems (e. g., real-time information); 4) insurance and liability concerns; and 5) pre-launch considerations.

The deposition of poly(acrylonitrile) and poly(poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate) has been monitored using cyclic voltammetry and an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM). It was determined that the polymerisation reaction may be initiated either by direct reduction of the monomer or via a separate reactive intermediate such as the superoxide anion. Furthermore, it was established that film thickness was easily controlled under cyclic voltammetry conditions, for example by varying the number of cycles.

This electropolymerisation technique was adapted to achieve the single step electrodeposition of a gel polymer electrolyte based on poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). Modification of the polymer to improve the mechanical properties and ionic conductivity was achieved by the incorporation of silica nanoparticles and plasticising monoacrylates into the polymer matrix.
