25|$|Flight {{testing was}} resumed on 7 September 2014, after the engine problem had been {{identified}} as a fault in the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> where a failure of a Teflon seal resulted in failure of the low pressure turbine causing heat soaking of the oil feed tube to the number 4 bearing.

25|$|The design {{featured}} a horizontally opposed, four-cylinder layout {{with a single}} camshaft operating poppet valves through pushrods that were hollowed to save weight. The crankshaft was supported on ball bearings which allowed a simple 'splash' <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> to be used. Cooling was by water with the cylinders being encased in copper jackets. Although the engine ran well, it was not placed into production. The only order was a small contract from the British Government for use in airships.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{starboard}} engine ran normally {{after it was}} decoupled from the reduction gear, a likely reason for the sudden drop of engine speed from 1,000 to 270 rpm and subsequent stalling when reconnected was increased load in the propulsion system due to damaged shaft bearing or a foreign object, perhaps something that had fallen from the deck, wedged in the propeller duct, although malfunction in the fuel supply and <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> due to the violent pitching of the vessel were not ruled out.|$|E
25|$|Cutting fluids degrade {{over time}} due to {{contaminants}} entering the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system.</b> A {{common type of}} degradation is the formation of tramp oil, also known as sump oil, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid.

In extreme cases {{it can be seen}} as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, the {{original}} order to specification N.22/43 {{was reduced to}} 100 aircraft; as such the manufacturing agreement with Boulton-Paul was ended and all work on the Sea Fury transferred to Hawker Aircraft's facilities at Kingston. This included the construction of what {{was intended to be}} a Boulton-Paul built Sea Fury prototype, VB857, which was transported to Kingston in January 1945; this aircraft, built to the same standard as SR666, first flew on 31 January 1946. Immediately upon completion of the first three airframes, the flight testing programme began at Kingston. It was soon discovered that the early Centaurus engine suffered frequent crankshaft failure due to a poorly designed <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> which led to incidents of the engine seizing while in mid-flight. The problem was resolved when Bristol's improved Centaurus 18 engine replaced the earlier engine variant.|$|E

25|$|Supercharging {{was used}} to force the charge into the cylinder, rather than {{crankcase}} compression, as on most two-stroke engines. This allowed {{the use of a}} conventional <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> instead of the total-loss type found in many two-stroke engines. Stratified charge was used: the fuel was injected into a bulb-like extension of the combustion chamber where the twin spark plugs ignited the rich mixture. Operable air-fuel ratios of from 15 to 23:1 were available to govern the power produced between maximum and 60%. The rich mixture maintained near the spark plugs reduced detonation, allowing higher compression ratios or supercharger boost. Supercharger throttling was used as well to achieve idling. The supercharger throttles were novel vortex types, varying the effective angle of attack of the impeller blades from 60 to 30 degrees. This reduced the power required to drive the supercharger when throttled, and hence fuel consumption at cruising power.|$|E
25|$|An {{investigation}} was opened into the accident by the Accidents Investigation Branch. Under directions from Sir Sefton Brancker, a Public Inquiry was held, chaired by Sir Arthur Colefax, with Professor B M Jones and James Swinburne as assessors. The enquiry opened on 23 January 1925 at the Royal Courts of Justice, Strand, London. This {{was the first}} Public Inquiry into a civil aviation accident in the United Kingdom. The inquiry was held under the Air Navigation (Investigation of Accidents) Act, 1920, as amended in 1922. Evidence was given that the aircraft had a valid certificate of airworthiness and {{that at the time}} of the accident it was operating in an unmodified form. The aircraft was not overloaded and had been inspected on the morning of the day the accident occurred. Reported problems with the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> on the Napier Lion engine had been rectified. Failure of the aircraft to reach its intended destinations in the week before the accident had been entirely due to weather conditions, and not as the result of any mechanical defect. The pilot, David Stewart, had served with the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force, having been awarded the Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross and Air Force Cross. He had been a pilot since 1917. Evidence was given that a petrol pipe recovered from the wreckage was discovered to be partially obstructed internally. The possibility of this occurring before the crash could not be dismissed, although the obstruction could also have been as a result of the post-crash fire. The inquiry was then adjourned until 25 January.|$|E
500|$|The early Super Cubs used a 6 volt {{ignition}} magneto {{mounted on the}} flywheel, with a battery to help maintain power to the lights, while later ones were upgraded to capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) systems. The <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> did not use an oil pump or oil filter, but was a primitive splash-fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox, with a non-consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil. Both {{the front and rear}} brakes were drums. On both the front and rear wheels were 2.25" [...] × 17" [...] wire spoke wheels, with full-width hubs.|$|E

40|$|Manufacturing {{industries}} have been pressured to use less power and reduce pollution {{by the development}} of power-efficient and pollution-preventing policies from the government. However, quality and cost are of main concern in this agenda. In machining, the key solution for this issue is by increasing the effectiveness of existing <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> as this reduces the power required to overcome the friction component in machining processes for less fuel consumption and pollution. In machining processes, in particular, improved <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> will increase batch production rates with better product quality. Introducing nanolubrication reduces power consumption as the rolling action of a billion units of nanoparticles in the tool chip interface decreases the cutting forces significantly. Additionally, using nanolubrication in machining minimizes the consumption of the lubrication oil, which decreases pollution. Detailed analysis and implementation of nanolubrication in machining process with the proper parameter setup are mandatory to ensure the efficiency of implementing nanolubrication. In this research, SiO 2 nanoparticles are mixed with ordinary mineral oil having 0. 2 weight concentration. A proper sonification method is used to mix and suspend the particles thoroughly and efficiently. The results show a reduction in the coefficient of friction in the tool/chip interface. Hence, the cutting force and working power are reduced considerably compared with conventional <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems.</b> Consequently, considerable power savings, less oil consumption, and less pollution are achieved...|$|R

500|$|Several {{in-flight}} shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, {{engine failure}} on a Cathay Pacific flight forced {{it back to}} Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the oil filter. As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. [...] Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine's master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> to resolve the problem.|$|E
