6000|$|Belonging to the {{generation}} which has {{lived to see}} the Age of Hurry, and has no sympathy with it, Mrs. Presty entered the sitting-room at the hotel, {{two hours before the}} time that had been fixed for leaving Sandyseal, with her mind at ease on the subject of her luggage. [...] "My boxes are <b>locked,</b> <b>strapped</b> and labeled; I hate being hurried. What's that you're reading?" [...] she asked, discovering a book on her daughter's lap, and a hasty action on her daughter's part, which looked like trying to hide it.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{opened his}} trunk again {{to put the}} other things in, and then <b>locked</b> and <b>strapped</b> it. A porter then took it and carried it on board the tender. Rollo and Jennie {{followed}} him.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two chairs}} in the chancel with moulded and twisted legs, front rail, and back-uprights, of c. 1700. A 16th-century chest is in the north {{transept}} and is plain with coped lid, two <b>locks,</b> iron <b>straps</b> and three strap¬hinges, all terminating in fleurs-de-lis.|$|R
50|$|Chris Perrotta invented and {{patented}} the world's first all-leather <b>locking</b> guitar <b>strap,</b> U.S. Patent number 7,818,815. He is {{the founder}} of Texas-based company, Lock-It Guitar Straps. His innovative straps help prevent guitars from falling during performance. Chris also started a gold record business, Celebrity Records, with the Jacksons' family attorney, Martin Cooper. Later, they sold it to Steve Goodale.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{produced}} from 1992 onwards the first Corvette models were called Corvette Proline and made in Germany. Later these configurations became the Corvette Standard. The early versions had <b>strap</b> <b>locks</b> that were recessed {{into the body}} and two <b>strap</b> <b>locks</b> on the bridge side of the body. The picture below shows a 5-String Corvette Proline (Ser.: G 000122 92) from 1992 (according to Warwick) with Wenge neck and fingerboard combined with a 2-piece ash body and passive electronics with MEC pickups. It features bronze frets and an adjustable brass nut.|$|R
50|$|All {{models have}} neck-through construction, 24 frets, a 15 in {{fingerboard}} radius, and a 24+3/4 in scale.The hardware included a Kahler Spyder double locking tremolo bridge and Schaller <b>strap</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Where {{there are}} an even number of cavities, two {{concentric}} rings can connect alternate cavity walls to prevent inefficient modes of oscillation. This is called pi-strapping because the two <b>straps</b> <b>lock</b> the phase difference between adjacent cavities at pi radians (180°).|$|R
50|$|A <b>strap</b> <b>lock</b> is {{a device}} that {{prevents}} the guitar strap from slipping off the strap peg. Several companies make these, and players also improvise various devices that fit over {{the part of the}} strap peg that protrudes through the strap end—rubber washers, plastic bag closures, etc.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Blackmore used {{a number}} of {{different}} Stratocasters; one of his main guitars was an Olympic white 1974 model with a rosewood fingerboard that was scalloped. Blackmore added a <b>strap</b> <b>lock</b> to the headstock of this guitar as a conversation piece to annoy and confuse people.|$|R
25|$|On August 3, 2007, a new {{wrist strap}} was {{discovered}} {{to be in}} circulation. The <b>strap</b> featured a <b>lock</b> clip instead of a slide {{to ensure that the}} clip would not slide away from a player's wrist during frequent play. The <b>lock</b> clip wrist <b>strap</b> is now included with all new Wii Remotes.|$|R
60|$|Biddy was astir {{so early}} {{to get my}} breakfast, that, {{although}} I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea {{that it must be}} late in the afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go down stairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and <b>locking</b> and <b>strapping</b> it up again, until Biddy called to me that I was late.|$|R
6000|$|While {{the girl}} slept those two, {{the woman of}} forty, an age in itself terrible, and that hopeless young [...] "wrong 'un" [...] of twenty-three (also well {{connected}} I believe) {{had some sort of}} subdued row in the cleared rooms: wardrobes open, drawers half pulled out and empty, trunks <b>locked</b> and <b>strapped,</b> furniture in idle disarray, and {{not so much as a}} single scrap of paper left behind on the tables. The maid, whom the governess and the pupil shared between them, after finishing with Flora, came to the door as usual, but was not admitted. She heard the two voices in dispute before she knocked, and then being sent away retreated at once-- the only person in the house convinced at that time that there was [...] "something up." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{letter-box}} was scooped in an oak gate-post {{about a foot}} square. There was no slit for inserting the letters, {{by reason}} of the opportunity such a lonely spot would have afforded mischievous peasant-boys of doing damage had such been the case; but at the side was a small iron door, kept close by an iron reversible <b>strap</b> <b>locked</b> across it. One side of this strap was painted black, the other white, and white or black outwards implied respectively that there were letters inside, or none.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle-sensitive lock {{is based}} on a {{pendulum}} swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a pawl is engaged, the reel <b>locks</b> and the <b>strap</b> restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|The Squier {{model of}} Deryck Whibley's guitar was {{released}} in 2007. This model is based on Whibley's original Telecaster Deluxe with only one pickup. This model is slightly different though. This model has an additional tone knob, 1 pickup, a side input jack, a Squier neckplate, a Squier headstock with Whibley's signature at the end, and no <b>strap</b> <b>locks.</b> This model comes either black on black or olympic white on black. This model can be bought online (in either colors) unlike the Telecaster Deluxe model. The Squier {{can be seen in}} music videos for [...] "Underclass Hero" [...] (Black), [...] "With Me" [...] (Black), and [...] "Walking Disaster" [...] (White). The Squier can also be seen in live performances in the studio for the album [...] "Underclass Hero" [...] all in Olympic White.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} Rollo and Jennie were both asleep--for the chambermaid, {{thinking}} {{that they must be}} tired from having been up so late the night before, concluded to let them sleep as long as possible. While they were sleeping, the waiters on board the ship were all employed in carrying up trunks, and boxes, and carpet bags, and bundles of canes and umbrellas, from all the state rooms, and spreading them about upon the decks, where the custom-house officers could examine them. The decks soon, of course, presented in every part very bustling and noisy scenes. Passengers were hurrying to and fro. Some were getting their baggage together for examination; some were unstrapping their trunks; and others, having unstrapped theirs, were now fumbling in their pockets, in great distress, to find the keys. It is always an awkward thing to lose a trunk key; but the most unfortunate of all possible times for meeting with this calamity is when a custom-house officer is standing by, waiting to examine what your trunk contains. Those who could not find their keys were obliged to stand aside and let others take their turn. As fast as the trunks were inspected, the lid of each was shut down, and it was marked with chalk; and then, {{as soon as it was}} <b>locked</b> and <b>strapped</b> again, a porter conveyed it to the tug, where the owner followed it, ready to go on shore.|$|R

5000|$|It has a 1972 Telecaster {{body with}} 2 humbucking pickups, one volume knob, a Fender neckplate, and a Telecaster Deluxe headstock. At first the Telecaster {{had only one}} pickup in the bridge, the Seymour Duncan SH-4 JB Humbucker. This model was first used during the tour for Sum 41's third album [...] "Chuck". A second pickup was later on, the Antiquity JB Model Humbucker but then was {{replaced}} by a Wide Range Humbucker pickup in the neck while leaving the bridge pickup the same. His current model is with Seymour Duncan and Wide Range pickups. The input jack is custom made onto the pickguard rather than a side input jack. The body is featured without the traditional pickup selector switch. The neck's tuning machines are Fender American Standard Series Tuning Machines. The guitar also features red X's that Whibley states [...] "Are there for good luck and design". Whibley uses a Get'm Get'm Sergeant guitar strap with chrome Schaller <b>Strap</b> <b>Locks.</b> There is only one color for the Telecaster Deluxe model (Black body with Black pickguard) but comes either black on black or Olympic White body with Black pickguard for the Squier models.|$|R
