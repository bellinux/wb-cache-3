25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the need to}} uphold constitutional supremacy and the principle of rigidity, the Constitution is also a <b>living</b> <b>document</b> that can be amended where necessary. As the Constitution does not appear to place restrictions {{on the extent to which}} its provisions may be amended, the question of whether there are any implied restrictions on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution arises. If such limitations exist, they would serve as a safeguard against unrestrained amendment by the legislature and protect the essential constitutional features and structure. India takes this stand – the Supreme Court held in Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala (1973) that there are certain implied basic features of the Indian Constitution that are not amenable to changes and amendment by Parliament. On the other hand, in Singapore it has been established that there are no implied limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Notations {{are central}} for {{understanding}} mathematical dis-course. Readers {{would like to}} read notations that transport the meaning well and prefer notations that are familiar to them. Therefore, authors optimize the choice of notations with respect to these two criteria, {{while at the same}} time trying to remain consistent over the document and their own prior publications. In print media where notations are fixed at pub-lication time, this is an over-constrained problem. In <b>living</b> <b>documents</b> notations can be adapted at reading time, taking reader preferences into account. We present a representational infrastructure for notations in <b>living</b> math-ematical <b>documents.</b> Mathematical notations can be defined declara-tively. Author and reader can extensionally define the set of available notation definitions at arbitrary document levels, and they can guide the notation selection function via intensional annotations. We give an abstract specification of notation definitions and the flexible rendering algorithms and show their coverage on paradigmatic exam-ples. We show how to use this framework to render OpenMath and Content-MathML to Presentation-MathML, but the approach extends to arbitrary content and presentation formats. We discuss prototypical implementations of all aspects of the rendering pipeline. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Mines {{with metal}} {{leaching}} and {{acid rock drainage}} (ML/ARD) often require long-term mitigation, monitoring and operator vigilance to ensure environmental protection. One {{of the biggest challenges}} to meeting long-term environmental protection goals is retaining the collective corporate, regulatory and community memory of site conditions, history of mining activities and mitigation requirements for the site. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) can help ensure successful management by documenting key aspects of a mine site, as well as its mitigation, monitoring and maintenance requirements. EMPs are intended to be <b>living</b> <b>documents</b> that track important changes for the purpose of guiding site management decisions. EMPs are being developed for several mines in British Columbia, Canada and include items such as active chemical treatment and cover maintenance. ______________________...|$|R

40|$|Expertise {{modeling}} {{has been}} the subject of extensive research in two main disciplines: Information Retrieval (IR) and Social Network Analysis (SNA). Both IR and SNA approaches build the expertise model through a document-centric approach providing a macro-perspective on the knowledge emerging from large corpus of static documents. With the emergence of the Web of Data there has been a significant shift from static to evolving documents, through micro-contributions. Thus, the existing macro-perspective is no longer sufficient to track the evolution of both knowledge and expertise.

Practical solutions with ontologies, our first knowledge-exchange workshop for project partners, brought together ontology experts with domain experts who had little or no previous experience of using ontologies. 	Computational aspects of high-throughput screening; planning and analysis enabled us to disseminate one of the BioMedBridges’ early deliverables, the UniChem resource, to EU-OPENSCREEN and others working on chemical screening. During both workshops we used "living documents", which could be simultaneously edited by all the participants, to capture information on the delegates’ needs and expectations, and to address these. Subsequent work on these <b>living</b> <b>documents</b> is converting them into openly available documentation on the BioMedBridges website...|$|R
