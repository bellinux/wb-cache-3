25|$|A broad {{distinction}} is made between general and specialized dictionaries. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, {{rather than a}} complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, {{although there is no}} consensus whether <b>lexicology</b> and terminology are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed to be semasiological, mapping word to definition, while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be onomasiological, first identifying concepts and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types. There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance bilingual (translation) dictionaries, dictionaries of synonyms (thesauri), and rhyming dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose monolingual dictionary.|$|E

2500|$|Finally, Dacoromania {{appeared}} from 1921 to 1948, in eleven enormous volumes totaling some 9,000 pages. The magazine contained studies, articles, notes and reviews, mainly on linguistics (<b>lexicology,</b> dialectology, linguistic geography, language history, onomastics, general linguistics, grammar, phonetics and phonology) and philology, {{as well as}} research on history and literary criticism, cultural history and folklore. Each edition included a bibliography that systematically recorded writings on linguistics, philology, folklore, ethnography and literature, connected to Romanian language, culture and literature, both domestically and abroad. Three generations of scholars worked on the magazine, with most articles presented at weekly meetings. Pușcariu, in an obituary for Nicolae Drăganu, commented on these sessions' usefulness, noting how the members would benefit from constructive criticism, [...] "sometimes pointed, mainly intelligent, but never bitter, for the critical spirit never originated from a pleasure to destroy, but from a desire to complete, while the joy in another's discovery was always greater than the temptation to persist in a mistake".|$|E

50|$|Computational <b>lexicology</b> {{emerged as}} a {{separate}} discipline within computational linguistics {{with the appearance of}} machine-readable dictionaries, starting with the creation of the machine-readable tapes of the Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster New Pocket Dictionary in the 1960s by John Olney et al. at System Development Corporation. Today, computational <b>lexicology</b> is best known through the creation and applications of WordNet. As the computational processing of the researchers increased over time, the use of computational <b>lexicology</b> has been applied ubiquitously in the text analysis. In 1987, amongst others Byrd, Calzolari, Chodorow have developed computational tools for text analysis. In particular the model was designed for coordinating the associations involving the senses of polysemous words.|$|E

50|$|An allied {{science to}} <b>lexicology</b> is lexicography, which also studies words, but {{primarily}} in relation with dictionaries - it {{is concerned with}} the inclusion of words in dictionaries and from that perspective with the whole lexicon.

Some consider this a distinction of theory vs. practice.|$|E
