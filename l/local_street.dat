5|$|In 2011, Robert Hallman, a local Hadleigh resident, {{suggested}} that the community should memorialise Murrell in some way, either by naming a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> after him or erecting a statue in {{the centre of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>local</b> <b>street</b> names {{were derived from}} the {{presence}} of St John's. Church Street, which ends directly opposite the church entrance, was originally the track used by Burwood residents to reach the church, using a conveniently located fallen tree across Iron Cove Creek.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Wessex Trains, {{the company}} {{managing}} the {{station at the}} time, introduced car parking charges. It was noted that this resulted in less use of the car parks, more <b>local</b> <b>street</b> parking and caused people to drive to Nailsea and Backwell railway station, where parking was still free. Following local pressure, the charges were reduced in July 2005.|$|E
50|$|Route 152 begins near Route 1 as {{a series}} of <b>local</b> <b>streets</b> that run through {{downtown}} Watsonville: East Lake Avenue carries it to the intersection of Casserly Road. This point marks the start of a winding two-lane highway that crosses the Santa Cruz Mountains through Hecker Pass to reach Gilroy. In Gilroy, it is again carried on a series of <b>local</b> <b>streets,</b> then overlapped onto U.S. Route 101 for a small stretch before it separates again a short distance to the south and returns to heading east/west on more <b>local</b> <b>streets</b> in Gilroy.|$|R

5|$|In November 2009, a <b>local</b> <b>street,</b> Durant Avenue, {{was renamed}} to Detective Russel Timoshenko Way in the detective's honor. Incidentally, {{following}} the controversial decision to rename a street to Sean Bell Way for police shooting victim Sean Bell, some community members had recommended {{doing the same}} for Timoshenko. However, the latter case had attracted much less media attention.|$|E
5|$|During {{a school}} check for mobile phones, Tom is caught with a pornographic VCD. As his teacher confiscates it, Chengcai makes a cheeky remark that provokes the teacher into {{slapping}} him, {{leading to an}} exchange that escalates into a massive scuffle. The principal decides to expel Chengcai, while Tom receives a public caning {{for his part in}} the scuffle. Tom and Chengcai later join a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> gang; as their initiation, they are forced to shoplift an iPod. However, they are caught by two conmen with connections to the street gang posing as police detectives, who demand that they pay the fine $2000 within two days or be arrested.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, County Route 507 {{turns away}} from Route 7, {{becoming}} concurrent with Route 17. by heading north on River Road, while Route 7 continues along Bellevill Turnpike for another half mile, Route 7 continues another half mile west, crossing the Passaic River on a lift bridge, known as the Belleville Turnpike Bridge or Rutgers Street Bridge, into Belleville, Essex County, where the <b>local</b> <b>street</b> name changes from Belleville Turnpike to Rutgers Street. The first section of Route 7 ends at an intersection with Main Street underneath Route 21.|$|E

5|$|To learn whether errors {{actually}} {{existed in}} Lilienthal's data tables, the brothers used a bicycle {{for a new}} type of experiment. They made a model-size airfoil and a counter-acting flat plate, both according to dimensions Lilienthal had specified, and attached them to an extra bicycle wheel, which they mounted horizontally in front of the handlebars. Pedaling strenuously on a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> to create airflow over the apparatus, they observed that the third wheel rotated against the airfoil instead of remaining motionless as Lilienthal's formula predicted. The experiment confirmed their suspicion that either the standard Smeaton coefficient or Lilienthal's coefficients of lift and drag–or all of them–were in error.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of Dunedin, {{which was}} settled by Scots, many early {{settlers}} in Caversham were English. This {{led to some}} degree of antagonism by the councils {{of the city and}} Caversham borough {{in the early days of}} settlement; Dunedin had been settled by the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of this distinction in modern Caversham, other than the origins of <b>local</b> <b>street</b> names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.|$|E
5|$|When the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western {{expanded}} the Kingsland Shops in 1903, a new station depot was constructed of brick {{along with a}} cut and cover tunnel. The tunnel itself cost $71,500 (1903 USD) and permitted the <b>local</b> <b>street,</b> Schuyler Avenue to cross over the rail line. The new station depot was built on Ridge Road over the tracks, with platforms crossing over the new bridge. The design of the station depot located above the tracks was later replicated by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western's Montclair Branch for its Watsessing Avenue station in Bloomfield, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Pekin, Route98 {{passes through}} {{farmland}} in unincorporated Groveland Township. The highway meets Cole Hollow Road and California Road at successive intersections {{in a residential}} area. Past a creek, the road heads into a rural area with sections of farmland and forest. As it enters Groveland, the highway intersects County Route1, which runs south through the community. Route98 leaves Groveland to the east, running through another farmed area. The route curves into Morton and takes the name Birchwood Street, traversing a creek before entering an industrial district. In this area, Route98 briefly becomes a divided highway before terminating at exit 31 on I-155. The road continues past the terminus as a <b>local</b> <b>street,</b> still carrying the name Birchwood Street.|$|E
5|$|At Lexington Avenue, NY92 {{begins to}} turn to the {{southeast}} as it heads through more residential areas of the city. At East Avenue, a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> just west of Nottingham Senior High School, a center lane begins, enabling left turns from both directions. The route passes north of the school and St. Mary's Cemetery and south of LeMoyne College before exiting the city limits. At this point, maintenance of the route shifts from Syracuse to the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Now in DeWitt, NY92 continues past several blocks lined with homes to an intersection with Erie Boulevard, a six-lane divided highway that carries NY5 through eastern Syracuse. The boulevard ends here, however, and NY5 turns to join NY92 eastward along Genesee Street.|$|E
5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 {{the local}} Morris dancer John Byfleet made {{a replica of}} the {{original}} Ooser, which he carved from a log using a penknife. This replica is on display at Dorset County Museum in Dorchester. It is taken from the museum twice a year, on May Day and St. George's Day, when it is used by the Wessex Morris Men as part of their seasonal festivities. In 2005, a journalist from The Guardian reported on a dawn ceremony performed by the troupe on May Day atop Giant Hill near Cerne Abbas. The ceremony involved one member carrying the Dorset Ooser replica atop his head, with other Morris men dancing around him; after the rite they proceeded, still dancing, to a local pub, the Red Lion. In summer 2006, the Wessex Morris Men took the replica to Melbury Osmond for the first time, where they performed a dance in a <b>local</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maintenance of NY32 {{is split}} between the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the highway {{departments}} of several different jurisdictions. Within the cities of Newburgh and Watervliet, the route is entirely city-maintained. In four other cities—Albany, Cohoes, Glens Falls, and Kingston—NY32 is mostly locally maintained. The piece of the route {{in the city of}} Mechanicville, meanwhile, is city-maintained north of Frances Street, a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> four blocks south of NY67. One last locally maintained section exists in the Albany suburb of Bethlehem, where the route is county-maintained between Feura Bush Road and the Delmar Bypass. This section is co-signed as County Route52 (CR52), which continues northwest of NY32 to a junction with NY140 near Slingerlands.|$|E
5|$|Manek Chowk {{is an open}} square {{near the}} centre of the city that {{functions}} as a vegetable market in the morning and a jewellery market in the afternoon. However, it is better known for its food stalls in the evening, which sell <b>local</b> <b>street</b> food. It is named after the Hindu saint Baba Maneknath. Parts of Ahmedabad are known for their folk art. The artisans of Rangeela pol make tie-dyed bandhinis, while the cobbler shops of Madhupura sell traditional mojdi (also known as mojri) footwear. Idols of Ganesha and other religious icons are made in huge numbers in the Gulbai Tekra area. The shops at the Law Garden sell mirror work handicraft.|$|E

5|$|State {{maintenance}} begins {{again on}} the Terminal Island Freeway, which is also signed as State Route 103. After a partial interchange with New Dock Street, only allowing access {{to and from the}} north, SR 47 crosses the Cerritos Channel on the Schuyler Heim Bridge, a lift bridge opened in 1948. Just beyond the bridge, SR 47 leaves the freeway, which continues northeast as SR 103, onto Henry Ford Avenue, and state maintenance ends. The remainder of what is signed as SR 47, along Henry Ford Avenue and Alameda Street to the Redondo Beach Freeway (SR 91), is locally maintained. Henry Ford Avenue quickly crosses the Dominguez Channel and Anaheim Street, and merges with Alameda Street, which continues southwest into Wilmington as a <b>local</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new <b>local</b> <b>street</b> network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together the survey of lands in the proposed alignment. Some of these funds for the survey were originally intended to go towards the removal of the Flemington Circle.|$|E
5|$|Krekeler's text {{uses the}} National Society for the Preservation of Covered Bridges' {{numerical}} system for recording covered bridges. The {{system is a}} collection of three sets of two digits used to represent the state, the county and the designated bridge respectively. The book includes detailed information on each state's historic bridges before providing an individual listing of surveyed bridges. A typical page includes two entries on a single page. Each entry includes a description of the bridge, its history, a black and white photograph, and a <b>local</b> <b>street</b> map with directions. Interspersed throughout the book {{is a collection of}} color photographs ranging from a full page to a quarter page in size. Krekeler states that construction dates prior to 1850 are often questionable because of an absence of records and that these early sources would often contradict one another. Krekeler's bibliography cites an extensive collection of state maps, numerous local newspaper sources and works like World Guide to Covered Bridges by Richard Donovan. The information and sources used are cited {{at the end of each}} entry listing in the book, directly following the directions to the bridge. The book does not contain a typical index and instead favors a listing of bridges after the introduction of the state. The book was published in 1989 by Daring Books.|$|E
