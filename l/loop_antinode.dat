40|$|High tension {{transmission}} conductors vibrate {{as light}} breezes blow across a line. This 'aeolian ' vibration {{can lead to}} fatigue damage which may be severe enough to cause the conductor to fail. Aeol ian vibration levels on the conductor will increase in amplitude until the power input from the wind is balanced by the power dissipated by the conductor self-damping and any external damping devices. This paper uses quantif ications of wind power input and conductor self-damping power dissipation, which {{have been published in}} recent papers, to solve iteratively for the vibration levels at which a power balance will occur. The paper also examines the effect of external vibration dampers on these vibration levels.
