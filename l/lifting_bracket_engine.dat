40|$|Aluminium {{die-casting}} {{is widely}} used in the automotive industry. <b>Brackets,</b> <b>engine</b> blocks, wheels and suspension arms etc. are typical applications. Due to the gases contained in the melt, more or less spherical pores arise in the cast components during the cooling procedure, usually with a higher concentration in the middle. The distribution of the pores depends both on the casting condition and on {{the form of the}} components and is stochastic. In the past, the simple way is often chosen for the fatigue life estimation of aluminium die-casting: The fatigue strengths of the material, e. g. in the form of S-N curves, are determined by an unnotched specimen which are then used in the fatigue calculation. However, the application of these data to real components with notches leads in many cases to fatigue life estimations which are by far too conservative. In the present paper a simple geometrical model of pores is presented. Using this model, the notch stress caused by a pore can be estimated. The behaviour of pores in a real component with notches will be treated. It will be shown that the mentioned conservative nature of the fatigue life prediction and the apparent notch insensitivity of aluminium die-casting {{can be explained by the}} facts that the stress distribution in a real component, contrary to an unnotched specimen, is inhomogeneous and that the porosity density on the surface is often low...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Scale-resolving {{simulations}} such as hybrid RANS/LES methods (HRLM) {{are considered}} as promising approaches for improved numerical predictions of aeronautical flows near the boarder {{of the flight}} envelope. Due to the requirement to locally resolve turbulent fluctua-tions, these methods rely on an accurate spatial discretization, {{both in terms of}} the grid reso-lution and the numerical scheme for the flow equations. For this reason, most scale-resolving flow solvers apply structured grid metrics, which provide regular mesh cells and allow for rather easy implementation of higher-order schemes. However, with the increasing demand for simulations of complex geometries, e. g., high-lift wings with <b>brackets</b> and in-stalled <b>engines,</b> the generation of purely structured grids becomes infeasible and is often abandoned in favour of unstructured methods, such as the widely-used DLR-TAU code. To qualify the TAU code for accurate scale-resolving simulations, a low-dissipation low-dispersion (LD 2) scheme suitable for unstructured solvers has recently been developed [1]. While the LD 2 -scheme has already been shown to improve HRLM predictions on structured grids [2], the present work comprises first systematic studies on the applicability and accura-cy of the LD 2 -scheme on industry-relevant unstructured or hybrid grids...|$|R

40|$|Al-Si-Mg casting alloys {{are being}} used in {{automotive}} applications, aerospace applications and other applications requiring heat-treatable permanent mould castings that combine good weldability with high strength and toughness (ASM). These casting alloys are also known for their excellent castability, corrosion resistance and, in particular,. a range of mechanical properties in the heattreated condition. A 357 aluminum alloy has been extensively used for semi-solid processing {{for more than three}} decades, and a large amount of components like fuel rails, <b>engine</b> mounts, <b>engine</b> <b>brackets</b> and suspension parts have been produced. This alloy is also included in the Statement for Work between the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and Boeing Co, USA. F 357, a hypo-eutectic aluminium alloy, Al- 7 %Si- 0. 6 %Mg without beryllium, was processed with CSIR-Rheo technology to the Semi-Solid Metal (SSM) state and cast in plates with a 50 Ton High Pressure Die Casting machine. The castings were either left in the as-cast (F) condition or subjected to T 4, T 4 + or T 6 heat treatments prior to laser welding. Welding of aluminium alloys poses many problems like porosity, loss of alloying elements, poor bead geometry and softening of the heat affected zone. Laser welding is however widely used in industrial production owing to the advantages such as low heat input, high welding speed and high production rate. Due to these unique advantages, the potential of autogenous Nd: Y AG laser welding as manufacturing process for this cast aluminium alloy was evaluated. A welding operating window was established and the optimum parameters were found to be a laser power of 3. 8 kW at the workpiece and a welding speed of 4 m/min with a twin spot laser light configuration. These laser welding parameters were applied for the welding of the heat treated plates and resulted in very low weld joint porosity and almost no loss of alloying elements. The mechanical properties of age-hardenable Al-Si-Mg alloys are dependent on {{the rate at which the}} alloy is cooled after the solution heat treatment Because of the high cooling rate during laser welding, the possibility of producing weld seams through deep penetration laser welding, with mechanical properties matching those of the T 6 temper condition, but without a post-weld solid solution heat treatment, was investigated. The quench rate after laser welding was measured and compared well with that measured after solution treatment. The resulting mechanical properties of F 357 aluminium welded in the T 4 condition and only artificially aged after welding (T 4 + condition), compares very well with the T 6 base material properties. The strengthening mechanisms obtained during laser welding and the different heat treatments were studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and are consistent with the expected precipitation hardening processes in Al-Si-Mg alloys. The quench sensitivity of SSM F 357 aluminium alloy is thus sufficiently low to obtain such an increase in strength values during laser welding, that no postweld solution heat treatment is necessary to achieve mechanical properties to the T 6 performance specification...|$|R
40|$|During {{test and}} {{verification}} of the Norwegian Navy’s {{fast patrol boat}} KNM Storm some problems with the lift fan machinery have been experienced. The problem observed is that occasionally, triggered by the firing of the 76 mm cannon, the port fan diesel engine is set into vibrations. In order to investigate the possible causes and the transient dynamic behavior of the system, several models have been explained, built and simulated throughout the master thesis. The bond graph notation and the computer software program 20 Sim have been used. A non linear rigid body model of the diesel engine is built. The rigid body model is connected to {{a model of the}} complete drive train, including the fan load. Excitation models for the inertial force and moments from crank kinematics, counteracted torque loading of the fan, displacement of foundation and air pressure pulse propagation into the fan compartment are built and simulated. The eigenfrequency calculation of the rigid body (diesel engine and gear) has been reviewed. The inherit physical properties of the rigid body show that we can expect amplification and phase shifts in the frequency range of approximately 4. 5 - 25 Hz. Installing snubbers at the <b>engine</b> <b>brackets</b> may lead to increased transverse stiffness and eigenfrequencies within the diesel engine operating speed range. A velocity pulse, in transverse direction based on SKF measurements, to the diesel engine and gear foundation, reveals a 0. 7 mm transverse displacement contribution of the diesel engine and gear at the center of gravity. The pseudo bond graph model of the air blast pressure pulse propagation from deck through the fan compartment reveals that the pressure pulse will flatten out, with a decrease in pressure amplitude and an increase in pulse length, at the fan volute intake. The effects on pressure pulse at fan inlet have been investigated. Disturbance in the fan inlet flow field by a pressure pulse causes a negative torque loading transient as well as a positive engine speed transient. This affects the inertial forces from crank kinematics excitation vector and the counteracting torque fan loading excitation vector, which results in a diesel engine displacement. The potential of diesel engine displacement from the counteracting torque loading is greater than the velocity pulse to the engine foundation. The governor engine speed set point has been given a 2 Hz oscillation at 2100 rpm. This results in a 2 Hz oscillation of the fan load, counteracted torque loading, displacement in y-direction and angular displacement around the x-axis. The 2 Hz transverse displacement of the diesel engine is in accordance with the observations by crewmembers and yard. We can also observe the phase delay between the engine speed regulator and the actual engine speed and fan load. In order to create a continuation of the oscillation, a phase difference of 180 degree is required. A further model implementation of the physical effects of the gas dynamic processes together with the actual speed governor properties and exact physical data of the diesel engine are needed in A non linear rigid order to possible recreate this phenomena, and increase the accuracy of the simulation results.    </p...|$|R

Industries {{taking advantage of the}} design freedom and complexity offered by AM have exploded the growth of the technologies. Specifically, technologies that process metals using electron and laser beams have been recognized by the aerospace industry as a promising avenue for re-engineered components leading to reduced weight and improved engineering efficiencies for components like <b>engine</b> <b>brackets</b> and nozzles. However, the direct implementation of AM has not been straightforward primarily because AM processes are not fully trusted to produce reliable and reproducible parts. Continued research, including the subject of this thesis, is aimed at better understanding process variations in the AM of metals via powder bed fusion. ^ Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is an AM is a technology in the category of powder bed fusion that is seeing increased adoption by a variety of industries for part production. EBM was the focus of this study for the fabrication of solid and porous parts using precursor powder composed of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. This research is centered on evaluating mechanical properties, analyzing microstructures, and correlating the fabrication process to inherent characteristics of solid and porous parts fabricated utilizing EBM. For dense parts, data were documented on the effects on mechanical and microstructural properties from neighboring parts and building location. In the case of porous, or lattice structures, data were documented on the effect of parameter modifications, such as processing currents and number of scan passes, on the final part mechanical response and microstructure. Solid and lattice components were mechanically tested and microstructural features were obtained by the use of computer software MATLAB. Microstructural and factographic analyses were performed on samples prepared for such analysis and the prepared surfaces were used for hardness testing. ^ Several variables in part production exist for AM, including, but not limited to, part orientation, part location, processing parameters, and geometry. For the solid components fabricated for this thesis, the core objective was to determine the effect that surrounding parts have on mechanical properties. The study was expanded to also determine how part location within a build area affects the mechanical properties. ^ The fabrication of generic structures provided the information on features produced using the standard commercial methodology, which would generally be used by industry. One of the benefits provided to Arcam users is the ability to access the process menu for customize build parameters. The previous deigns presented a study on features for solid structures fabricated without processing parameter variations. This furthering task presents for modification of processing parameters on lattice structures. The area that has been studied adds to improvements on features by additive manufacturing in general, enabling sophisticated designs with tailored properties while optimizing material and weight. ^ A particular focus of this research was the study of lattice structures fabricated by EBM. Mechanical information of a material was obtained through compression testing, which provided values for the following properties: young’s modulus of elasticity (E), ultimate compression strength (UCS), the fracture load, and the displacement seen at such. Twenty-seven total lattice specimens were fabricated and tested. A correlation between microstructure and properties was explored using metallography analysis. Samples that displayed considerable property differences within a single build were chosen for analysis and consequently subjected to hardness testing. Fractography analysis was also performed on selected specimens to examine the potential cause(s) contributing to the bimodal failure mode. ^ Overall, the research outcome of this thesis provided further characterization of the EBM fabrication process and presented some potential improvements to unique lattice structures. The mechanical response obtained by increase of surface area and varying locations showed that certain variations are present and users {{need to be aware of}} these part-to-part differences. In the case of components containing lattice structures, the mechanical response obtained by variation of the processing current within a single build and increasing scan passes suggested that detrimental martensite phase that typically occurs in the standard build process can be removed from in-process modifications.
