5|$|<b>Lameness</b> in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. <b>Lameness</b> can also be caused by abnormalities in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop <b>lameness,</b> trauma, infection and acquired abnormalities are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is <b>lameness</b> caused by abnormalities in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of <b>lameness</b> is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. <b>Lameness</b> in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} <b>lameness</b> from between six and twelve months of age, with this <b>lameness</b> subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs {{and the dog}} may require them to be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} issues {{that can occur}} with horses' legs that may not necessarily cause <b>lameness.</b> Stocking up {{is an issue that}} occurs in horses that are held in stalls for multiple days after periods of activity. Fluid collects in the lower legs, producing swelling and often stiffness. Although it does not usually cause <b>lameness</b> or other problems, prolonged periods of stocking up can lead to other skin issues. Older horses and horse with heavy muscling are more prone to this condition. A shoe boil is an injury that occurs when there is trauma to the bursal sac of the elbow, causing inflammation and swelling. Multiple occurrences can cause a cosmetic sore and scar tissue, called a capped elbow, or infections. Shoe boils generally occur when a horse hits its elbow with a hoof or shoe when lying down. Windpuffs, or swelling {{to the back of the}} fetlock caused by inflammation of the sheaths of the deep digital flexor tendon, appear most often in the rear legs. Soft and fluid-filled, the swelling may initially be accompanied by heat and pain, but can remain long after the initial injury has healed without accompanying <b>lameness.</b> Repeated injuries to the tendon sheath, often caused by excessive training or work on hard surfaces, can cause larger problems and <b>lameness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause <b>lameness,</b> or movement at an abnormal gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without <b>lameness,</b> or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome, {{also called}} Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head, {{is where the}} ball section of the femur in the hip joint deteriorates {{following}} interruption of the blood flow and is the same condition as in humans. In dogs, this causes <b>lameness</b> of the hind-legs, the thigh muscles to atrophy and pain in the joint. It usually occurs between 6–12 months of age and has been documented {{in a variety of}} other terrier breeds including the Border terrier, Lakeland terrier, and Wheaten terrier.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{develops}} in puppyhood although often subclinically, {{and there may}} be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute <b>lameness.</b> Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause <b>lameness</b> and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. Bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers can {{be subject}} to a genetic defect of the femur and knee called luxating patella. This {{condition}} is most often observed when a puppy is 4 to 6 months old. In the most serious cases, surgery may be indicated. The grading system for the patella runs from 1 (a tight knee), to 4 (a knee so loose that its cap is easily displaced). If a cavalier has a grade 1–2, physical rehabilitation therapy and exercise may reduce the grading and potentially avoid surgery. The grades 3–4 are most severe where surgery will most likely be needed to correct the problem to avoid the development of arthritis and <b>lameness</b> in the limb.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling <b>lameness</b> and arthritis. The cats most commonly affected with hip dysplasia tend to be males of the larger, big-boned breeds such as Persians and Maine Coons. The relatively smaller size and weight of cats frequently results in symptoms that are less pronounced. X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic. The Maine Coon is the only cat breed listed in the database.|$|E
5|$|Olga's {{final years}} {{were marked by}} ill health. <b>Lameness</b> {{restricted}} her to a wheelchair, and she stayed in Paris several times to undergo treatment for her eyes. Her poor eyesight caused George V much laughter when she mistook a statue of a naked Lady Godiva for one of Queen Victoria. Increasingly dependent, Olga finally settled with her youngest son, Prince Christopher, shortly {{after the death of}} his first wife, Princess Anastasia, in 1923. Olga died on 18 June 1926 either at Christopher's Villa Anastasia in Rome, or at Pau, France.|$|E
5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial <b>lameness</b> would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain I often suffered.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed is {{uncertain}} prior to the mid-19th century with two theories being prevalent. Clumber Spaniels have been kept and bred by various British Monarchs, including Prince Albert, King Edward VII and King George V. They were introduced into Canada in 1844, and in 1884 {{became one of the}} first ten breeds recognised by the American Kennel Club. The breed can suffer from a variety of breed-specific ailments varying in severity from temporary <b>lameness</b> due to bone growth whilst young to hip dysplasia or spinal disc herniation.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is {{not common}} in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog {{has a number of}} inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, <b>lameness</b> and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.|$|E
5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food {{appears to have a}} significant influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and <b>lameness.</b> Other large plains animals, including the mountain zebra, may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E
25|$|In {{many cases}} <b>lameness</b> worsens, {{becoming}} more obvious and consistent. Advanced cases {{may have a}} bony swelling on the hock, typically {{on the inside of}} the joint. <b>Lameness,</b> although usually worse in one leg, is commonly bilateral.|$|E
25|$|Signs {{of acute}} {{tendinitis}} include swelling, heat, and pain when {{the affected area}} is palpated. If mild, swelling may not be readily apparent, although {{there will still be}} heat and pain in the area, as well as mild <b>lameness.</b> If more severe, the injury is usually accompanied by moderate <b>lameness</b> (2-3 on a scale of 5) with obvious swelling.|$|E

25|$|High ringbone: The horse {{will have}} a bony growth around the pastern area, and the pastern will have less mobility. The horse will show pain when the pastern joint is moved or rotated. Early cases {{will have a}} <b>lameness</b> score of 1-2 out of 5, {{with little or no}} bony {{swelling}} seen, although possibly felt when compared to the opposite pastern. <b>Lameness</b> will worsen to a grade 2-3 on a scale of 5 as the ringbone worsens.|$|E
25|$|When the tendon is healed, it {{will still}} have a thickened, bowed {{appearance}} that feels firm and woody. However, all heat, <b>lameness,</b> and pain should disappear.|$|E
25|$|Grace finally {{dropped out}} of the Gloucestershire first team in 1896, aged 54, but he {{continued}} playing club cricket for Thornbury until 1909, despite increasing <b>lameness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{signs of}} bone spavin may include {{sporadic}} and vague hindlimb <b>lameness.</b> Some horses may become uncomfortable in one lead, or may demonstrate stiffness walking downhill.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lameness</b> {{is usually}} mild (1–2 {{on a scale}} of 5). It can be made worse when the horse is worked on a hard surface or on a circle.|$|E
25|$|Four {{recognised}} species infect pigs: S. medusiformis, S. meischeriana (S. suicanis), S. porcifelis and S. suihominis. S. porcifelis is pathogenic for pigs causing diarrhea, myositis and <b>lameness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Panosteitis is {{a common}} disease of unknown cause that causes pain and a {{shifting}} leg <b>lameness</b> in medium and large breed dogs. It affects the long bones of the hind and forelimbs.|$|E
25|$|Fusion of {{the joint}} with bone may end the <b>lameness,</b> as the joint has then become stable. However, this may take several years, or never occur. In these cases, surgery may be an option.|$|E
25|$|Bone spavin is a bony growth {{within the}} lower hock joint of horse or cattle. It {{is caused by}} osteoarthritis, {{and the degree of}} <b>lameness</b> that results can be serious enough to end a horse's {{competitive}} career.|$|E
25|$|The horse lands {{first with}} the {{trailing}} (non-leading) foreleg, {{and then with the}} lead foreleg. The hind limbs follow suit. The landing places a great deal of strain on the forelegs, which can lead to injuries or <b>lameness</b> over time.|$|E
25|$|A stone bruise {{affects the}} sole of the horse's foot. It is often caused by a horse {{treading}} on a stone or sharp type of object, landings from high jumps and excessive exposure to snow. A major symptom is <b>lameness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Low ringbone: The horse {{will have}} {{moderate}} <b>lameness</b> (grade 2-3), even in early cases, {{because of the}} closeness of the ringbone to the other structures in the hoof. When severe or very advanced, the bony growth will be able to be seen on the coronet.|$|E
25|$|Bony {{changes of}} the lower hock joint are irreversible. It is possible, however, to manage the problem and thereby slow the {{progression}} of the bone spavin, ease the pain, and control the <b>lameness.</b> Surgery is an option for horses that {{do not respond to}} conventional treatments.|$|E
25|$|A flexion test of an {{affected}} limb often {{produces a}} temporary worsening of the <b>lameness.</b> Such {{a response to}} a flexion test would support the diagnosis of bone spavin. A flexion test involves holding the hock in forced flexion {{for a period of time}} before trotting the horse away immediately.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fibers}} are torn, the tendon hemorrhages and {{collects}} fluid (edema), creating swelling and <b>lameness</b> {{in the area}} as well as increasing the pressure. The increase in pressure may damage the tendon further by destroying the cross-linking of undamaged collagen fibers and preventing {{the flow of blood}} to the area.|$|E
25|$|Some animals also develop foot lesions, {{beginning}} with coronitis, with consequent <b>lameness.</b> In sheep, this {{can lead to}} knee-walking. In cattle, constant changing of position of the feet gives bluetongue the nickname The Dancing Disease. Torsion of the neck (opisthotonos or torticollis) is observed in severely affected animals.|$|E
25|$|In dogs, hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormal {{formation of the}} hip socket that, in its more severe form, can eventually cause crippling <b>lameness</b> and painful arthritis of the joints. It is a genetic (polygenic) trait that is affected by environmental factors. It is common in many dog breeds, particularly the larger breeds.|$|E
25|$|Heel pain is {{very common}} in horses with navicular syndrome. <b>Lameness</b> may begin as mild and intermittent, and {{progress}} to severe. This {{may be due to}} strain and inflammation of the ligaments supporting the navicular bone, reduced blood flow and increased pressure within the hoof, damage to the navicular bursa or DDF tendon, or from cartilage erosion.|$|E
25|$|NSAIDs, or non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs, {{may help}} improve the <b>lameness</b> in the horse. However, {{it is important}} to note that high doses of NSAIDs given over several days can cause kidney damage, as well as ulcers. NSAIDs may also be illegal in competition, so it may be necessary to stop treatment with NSAIDs several days before the horse competes.|$|E
