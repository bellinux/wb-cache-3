25|$|The {{hallmark}} of Khosrow's bureaucratic reform {{was the creation}} of a new social class. Before, the Sasanian Empire consisted of only three social classes, magi, nobles, and peasants/commoners. Khosrow added a fourth class to this hierarchy between the nobles and the peasants, called the deghans. The deghans were small <b>land</b> <b>owning</b> citizens of the Sasanian Empire and were considered lower nobility.|$|E

Ashipa's son, Ado, built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from Iddo island.

25|$|However, the Swedes {{began to}} resent the {{monopoly}} trading {{position of the}} Hansa (mostly German citizens) and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or Gustav I broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he {{was regarded as a}} hero to the Swedish people. History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustave would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop and freed itself from the Hanseatic League and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class. This was not the case in other countries of Europe like Poland were the peasantry was still bound by serfdom and a strong feudalistic <b>land</b> <b>owning</b> system.|$|E

2500|$|The {{number of}} large <b>land</b> <b>owning</b> private-Tharavad-owned schools in North Malabar {{expanded}} {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century partly due to the availability of government grant-in-aid for such enterprises from 1939 onwards. [...] Furthermore, corporate expansion of <b>land</b> <b>owning</b> Tharavads and a decrease in European engineered proletysing of the depressed classes also contributed to the growth pattern. These schools often had teaching staff from educated families. [...] In democratic Kerala however, many of these schools evolved as public and government enterprises, which led to the recruitment of teachers from the southern provinces and the subsequent immigration of teaching staff of all ethno-religious backgrounds, many of whom preferred to settle in the area permanently.|$|E

The use of the word [...] "Andriana" [...] to denote nobility occurs among numerous other Malagasy ethnic groups such as the Betsileo, the Betsimisaraka, the Tsimihety, the Bezanozano, the Antambahoaka and the Antemoro. [...] Andriana often traditionally formed part of the names of Malagasy kings, princes, and nobles. Linguistic evidence suggests its origin is traceable back to an ancient Javanese nobility title, although alternate theories have been proposed.|$|E

At first the compulsory surrender of an acre of choice land to each labourer who claimed it was resisted by the new <b>land</b> <b>owning</b> farmers. In due course they too reaped the benefits, gone the days when a farmer never knew when or where to find labour to work his fields. Either they were migrants or drink ridden. Now occupying their own proud family home and vegetable patch at the corner of his farm, they worked cooperatively for him all year round. This had enormous long-term consequences for rural Irish society.|$|E

6000|$|Oh! {{if those}} who rule the destinies of nations would but {{remember}} this--if they would but think {{how hard it}} is for the very poor to have engendered in their hearts, that love of home from which all domestic virtues spring, when they live in dense and squalid masses where social decency is lost, or rather never found--if they would but turn aside from the wide thoroughfares and great houses, and strive to improve the wretched dwellings in bye-ways where only Poverty may walk--many low roofs would point more truly to the sky, than the loftiest steeple that now rears proudly up from the midst of guilt, and crime, and horrible disease, to mock them by its contrast. In hollow voices from Workhouse, Hospital, and jail, this truth is preached from day to day, and has been proclaimed for years.
