5|$|After Paul Nemenyi died in 1952, Regina Fischer wrote {{a letter}} to Nemenyi's first son, Peter, asking if Paul had left money for Bobby in his will:Bobby was sick 2 days with fever and sore throat and of course a doctor or {{medicine}} was out of the question. I don't think Paul would have wanted to leave Bobby this way and would ask you most urgently to <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> Paul left anything for Bobby. On one occasion, Regina told a social worker that the last time she had ever seen Hans-Gerhardt Fischer was in 1939, four years before Bobby was born. On another occasion, she told the same social worker she had traveled to Mexico to see Hans-Gerhardt in June 1942 and that Bobby was conceived during that meeting. According to Bobby Fischer's brother-in-law, Russell Targ, who was married to Bobby's half-sister, Joan, for 40 years, Regina concealed the fact that Nemenyi was Bobby's father because she wanted to avoid the stigma of an out-of-wedlock birth.|$|E
500|$|... "Anticipating" [...] is a teen pop and dance-pop {{that lasts}} {{for three minutes}} and 16 seconds. Corey Moss of MTV noted the song also has a 1970s disco sound, while Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe {{compared}} it to early Madonna tracks such as [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983). Glenn Gamboa of Newsday compared the song to Janet Jackson's [...] "All for You", calling it [...] "pleasant, shimmering R-styled pop". According to the sheetmusic published at musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, the song is composed in the key of F major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 112 beats per minute. Spears vocal range spans from the low-key of F3 to the high-note of A4. The song has a basic sequence of B(9)–C–Dm7–B(9) as its chord progression. Lyrically, it talks about friendship and camaraderie between women. During the bridge, Spears sings, [...] "Gotta really <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> you want me / You gotta turn me on and make me feel sexy". During {{the time of the}} album's release, her official site stated that [...] "the girl-power anthem 'Anticipating' proves that Britney is, now more than ever, {{a force to be reckoned}} with." ...|$|E

His email to her read: [...] "Hi Dede, Congratulations {{and the best of}} luck in your candidacy. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there is anything I can do to help. Doug." [...] Shortly thereafter, however, he contacted Conservative Party leaders, seeking support for his own candidacy. One Republican leader said that Hoffman, while seeking the Republican nomination, had [...] "repeatedly" [...] pledged to support the nominee.|$|E

2500|$|In his Curentul Nou period, Sanielevici {{focused his}} {{attention}} on the young novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, whose work he considered the main manifestation of Sămănătorism. To his critic's dismissive remarks, Sadoveanu replied with a violent article in the political gazette Voinţa Naţională: [...] "I promise you a stern comeback, and do <b>let</b> <b>me</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there is any clean spot on your body that may yet receive it." [...] The first fissures between Sanielevici and his Poporanist colleagues began to show {{at roughly the same}} time. Emerging as one of the Poporanist ideologues around 1905, Ibrăileanu defended Sadoveanu against Sanielevici's observations. This stance probably helped Sadoveanu to make up his mind about leaving the Sămănătorists and joining the Viaţa Românească group, while the controversy only increased his exposure.|$|E

One is “No litter”; anyone caught littering, {{and that includes}} cigarette butts, will not be invited back to hunt on Bradley 3 land. She insists that guests treat her as a friend, not as a business associate, and that they stay in communication: “We have a busy ranch, so I like to have hunters call {{ahead of time and}} let me know when they’ll be there.
