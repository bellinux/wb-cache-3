50|$|Note on <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> size:The 2 cm <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> {{has been}} in use from 2007. Previously the <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> was 3 cm and before that 5 cm,and before that 10 cm. The reason for {{reducing}} {{the size of the}} <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> is to have more separation between the top competitors. If two or more competitors have the same score they do re-jumps until a winner is found. Smaller <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> makes it more difficult and less likely to many with the same score.|$|R

The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke {{the angle of the}} connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|R

50|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> (one {{that does}} not turn freely, i.e., dead) {{may be used to}} support the {{workpiece}} at either the fixed or rotating end of the machine. When used in the fixed position, a <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> produces friction between the workpiece and center, due to the rotation of the workpiece. Lubrication is therefore required between the center and workpiece to prevent friction welding from occurring. Additionally the tip of the center may have an insert of cemented carbide which will reduce the friction slightly and allow for faster speeds. <b>Dead</b> <b>centers</b> are typically fully hardened to prevent damage to the important mating surfaces of the taper and to preserve the 60° angle of the nose. As tungsten carbide is much harder than steel, a carbide-tipped center has greater wear resistance than a steel center.|$|R
5000|$|A soft <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> is frequently replaced by a live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a <b>dead</b> (stationary) half <b>center.</b> A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|R

50|$|Gasoline engines take in {{a mixture}} of air and {{gasoline}} and compress it by the movement of the piston from bottom <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> to top <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> when the fuel is at maximum compression. The reduction {{in the size of the}} swept area of the cylinder and taking into account the volume of the combustion chamber is described by a ratio. Early engines had compression ratios of 6 to 1.

5000|$|Because jumpers usually land {{on their}} feet, most try {{to touch the}} <b>dead</b> <b>center</b> mark {{with the heel of}} their shoe.

Based on this score the best half of the remaining skydivers make it to the last and final round. If the 3 first places are shared between skydivers with the same score, there are re-jumps to [...] "sudden death".

5000|$|The hot bulbs {{started to}} develop cracks and breakups and were {{gradually}} replaced by water cooled cylinder heads {{with a flat}} hot spot.
