5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{involved in}} the accident was a Boeing 707–465 registered G-ARWE (manufacturer's serial number 18373, Boeing <b>line</b> <b>number</b> 302). First flown on 27 June 1962, the aircraft was originally to have been operated by Cunard Eagle Airways, but before it entered service it was sold to BOAC-Cunard and was delivered on 7 July 1962. On 21 November 1967 the aircraft suffered an engine failure on take off from Honolulu International Airport. The take off was aborted, {{and there were no}} injuries to any of the passengers or crew. At the time of the Heathrow accident, the aircraft had flown for a total of 20,870 hours. The aircraft was insured for £2,200,000 with Lloyd's of London.|$|E

5|$|On April 9, 1994, {{the first}} 777, <b>line</b> <b>number</b> WA001, was rolled {{out in a}} series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to {{accommodate}} the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at Edwards Air Force Base in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly Fairbanks International Airport. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's nondestructive testing campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) on April 19, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} involved was a Boeing737-8HG(SFP) {{was one of}} the few 737's with Short Field Performance {{package to}} use for landing in an airports with short runways, with the aircraft registration VT–AXV and manufacturer's serial number 36333, <b>line</b> <b>number</b> 2481. The aircraft first flew on 20 December 2007 with the Boeing test registration N1787B and was delivered a month later. The crew consisted of Captain Zlatko Glušica, First Officer Harbinder Singh Ahluwalia and four flight attendants. Glušica {a former employee of Jat Airways of Serbia}, aged 55, a British and Serbian national with over 10,000 hours of flying and over 7,500 hours of command experience, and Ahluwalia (a former employee of Jet Airways who joined Air India Express in 2009). Both pilots were based in Mangalore and they were both killed in the crash.|$|E
25|$|The {{panel system}} was {{designed}} to interconnect the offices of a city or a local calling area. Each office was assigned a two- (later three) digit office code. Callers dialed the office code followed by the station number. In most situations this led to six-digit (later seven) numbers. But from the beginning the panel system handled seven-digit numbers (later eight), for two reasons. Party line numbers were listed {{with one of the}} letters J, M, R, and W following the <b>line</b> <b>number.</b> The caller dialed the office code, the <b>line</b> <b>number,</b> and the digit corresponding to the letter. The panel system {{was designed to}} work with manual offices of up to 10,500 lines. To call a line in a manual office, callers dialed the office code followed by the <b>line</b> <b>number,</b> just as they would when calling a number in a fully automatic office. For lines 10,000 and up, callers therefore dialed the office code and a five-digit <b>line</b> <b>number.</b>|$|E
50|$|For filing {{the regular}} tax return, in {{addition}} to the standard Form 1040, there are also two variants: the 1040A and 1040EZ. Form 1040 and 1040A use the same <b>line</b> <b>numbering</b> up to and including line 9; Form 1040EZ uses completely different <b>line</b> <b>numbering.</b> <b>Line</b> <b>numbering</b> {{is important to keep in}} mind since many state income tax returns reference <b>line</b> <b>numbers</b> on the 1040. The variants can only be used if a filer wants to take only the standard deduction: if a filer wants to itemize deductions then the 1040 must be used.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Line</b> <b>numbers</b> were a {{required}} element of syntax in some older programming languages such as GW-BASIC. [...] The {{primary reason for}} this is that most operating systems at the time lacked interactive text editors; since the programmer's interface was usually limited to a <b>line</b> editor, <b>line</b> <b>numbers</b> provided a mechanism by which specific lines in the source code could be referenced for editing, and by which the programmer could insert a new line at a specific point. <b>Line</b> <b>numbers</b> also provided a convenient means of distinguishing between code to be entered into the program and direct mode commands to be executed immediately when entered by the user (which do not have <b>line</b> <b>numbers).</b>|$|R

Class SS trams were introduced that year, accelerating the retirement of the Class A stock until they were completely retired in 1914. Line numbered were introduced on 4 September 1909.

However programs that contained <b>line</b> <b>numbers</b> were able to run; the <b>line</b> <b>numbers</b> were simply treated as labels {{for the purpose of}} flow control.
