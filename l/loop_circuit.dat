50|$|The dorsolateral {{striatum}} {{is associated}} with the acquisition of habits and is the main neuronal cell nucleus linked to procedural memory. Connecting excitatory afferent nerve fibers help in the regulation of activity in the basal ganglia circuit. Essentially, two parallel information processing pathways diverge from the striatum, both acting in opposition {{to each other in the}} control of movement, they allow for association with other needed functional structures One pathway is direct while the other is indirect and all pathways work together to allow for a functional neural feedback <b>loop.</b> Many <b>looping</b> <b>circuits</b> connect back at the striatum from other areas of the brain; including those from the emotion-center linked limbic cortex, the reward-center linked ventral striatum and other important motor regions related to movement. The main <b>looping</b> <b>circuit</b> involved in the motor skill part of procedural memory is usually called the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex loop.|$|R

40|$|During {{recent years}} {{it has been shown}} that hidden oscillations, whose basin of {{attraction}} does not overlap with small neighborhoods of equilibria, may significantly complicate simulation of dynamical models, lead to unreliable results and wrong conclusions, and cause serious damage in drilling systems, aircrafts control systems, electromechanical systems, and other applications. This article provides a survey of various phase-locked <b>loop</b> based <b>circuits</b> (used in satellite navigation systems, optical, and digital communication), where such difficulties take place in MATLAB and SPICE.

50|$|Pulse dialing is a {{signaling}} {{technology in}} telecommunications {{in which a}} direct current local <b>loop</b> <b>circuit</b> is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.|$|E

50|$|In {{scanning}} applications, {{a control}} system applies an electric current {{proportional to the}} desired location of {{a beam of light}} to a high speed, sensitive, limited rotation motor called a galvanometer (commonly referred to as a galvo).

50|$|Crystal {{oscillators}} can {{be manufactured}} for oscillation {{over a wide}} range of frequencies, from a few kilohertz up to several hundred megahertz.

50|$|The autocross event {{involves}} an open <b>loop</b> <b>circuit</b> designed with chicanes, speed traps and slaloms. In 2007, the autocross competition {{was held in}} the parking lot next to the Turn 1 grandstands. In 2008 and 2009, the autocross competition was on a circuit built on the NASCAR oval track on turn 4. The competition event is designed to test the ability of the car to go around the circuit at maximum speed and drive around the tight bends and turns. The objective of the competition is to set the fastest time from the starting point and the ending point of the circuit. As with Formula SAE, the course is marked with orange traffic cones. Hitting a cone incurs a 2 sec penalty, while failure to follow the course results in a 20 sec penalty.|$|E
50|$|Loop {{signaling}} {{was offered}} {{in two different}} configurations for Western Union Telex in the United States. The first option, sometimes called local or loop service, provided a 60 milliampere <b>loop</b> <b>circuit</b> from the exchange to the customer teleprinter. The second option, sometimes called long distance or polar was used when a 60 milliampere connection could not be achieved, provided a ground return polar circuit using 35 milliamperes on separate send and receive wires. By the 1970s, and {{under pressure from the}} Bell operating companies wanting to modernize their cable plant and lower the adjacent circuit noise that these telex circuits sometimes caused, Western Union migrated customers to a third option called F1F2. This F1F2 option replaced the DC voltage of the local and long distance options with modems at the exchange and subscriber ends of the telex circuit.|$|E
50|$|Like other cesium clocks {{the chip}} keeps time with an ultraprecise 9.192631770 GHz {{microwave}} signal produced by electron transitions between two hyperfine energy levels in atoms of non-radioactive cesium-133 (the only stable isotope of cesium). This signal is divided down by digital counters to give 10 MHz and 1 Hz clock signals provided to output pins. On the chip, liquid metal cesium {{in a tiny}} 2 mm capsule is heated to vaporize the cesium. A semiconductor laser shines a beam of infrared light modulated by a microwave oscillator through the capsule onto a photodetector. When the oscillator is at the precise frequency of the transition, the cesium atoms absorb the light, reducing {{the output of the}} photodetector. The output of the photodetector is used as feedback in a phase locked <b>loop</b> <b>circuit</b> to keep the oscillator at the correct frequency.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently, a new {{technique}} called the method of approximations has been developed for proving lower bounds {{on the size of}} circuits computing certain Boolean functions. To obtain a lower bound on the size complexity size(f) of a certain function f by the method, an appropriate legitimate model M for the function f is chosen, and then a lower bound on the distance ρ(f, M) from f to M is derived. The lower bound on ρ(f, M) becomes a lower bound on size(f) {{in view of the fact}} that size(f) ≥ ρ(f, M). Razborov gave a legitimate monotone model, Mmon(Fmax), and showed that ρ(f, Mmon(Fmax)) = Ω(size 1 / 3 (f)), so there remains a gap between the size size(f) and the distance ρ(f, M). Employing his method, the following statements are established: (i) Razborov′s model Mmon(Fmax) is generalized to obtain model M(Fmax), and it is established that ρ(f, M(Fmax)) = Ω(size 12 (f)). (ii) Allowing the underlying graphs of circuits to have cycles, a new notion of apparently more powerful <b>circuits,</b> called <b>loop</b> <b>circuits,</b> is introduced, and it is proved that ρ(f, M(Fmax)) = Θ(sizeloop(f)), where sizeloop(f) denotes the size complexity of f based on <b>loop</b> <b>circuits...</b>|$|R

50|$|Typically {{these are}} caused by poor design. Where there is mixed signal {{technology}} on a printed circuit board, e.g. analogue, digital and possibly RF, it is usually necessary for a highly skilled engineer to specify the layout of where the grounds are to be interconnected. Typically the digital section will have its own ground plane to obtain the necessary low inductance grounding and avoid ground bounce which can cause severe digital malfunction. But digital ground current must not pass through the analog grounding system, where voltage drop due to the finite ground impedance would cause noise to be injected into the analogue <b>circuits.</b> Phase lock <b>loop</b> <b>circuits</b> are particularly vulnerable because the VCO <b>loop</b> filter <b>circuit</b> is working with sub-microvolt signals when the loop is locked, and any disturbance will cause frequency jitter and possible loss of lock.|$|R
