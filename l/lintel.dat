5|$|The sanctum door, with {{a flight}} of stairs, leads down to the jagamohana. The <b>lintel</b> has the Gaja Lakshmi figurine in the centre {{surrounded}} with apsaras (celestial maidens). The Navagraha (deities of the classical planets) are carved above the <b>lintel.</b> The doorjambs are decorated scrollwork, creepers, flowers and boys playing. Two gate-keeper sculptors surround the door.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lintel</b> 3 from Temple IV {{was taken}} to Basel in Switzerland in the 19th century. It was in almost perfect {{condition}} and depicts Yik'in Chan K'awiil seated on a palanquin.|$|E
5|$|The carving on the {{projecting}} <b>lintel</b> on {{the doorway}} to the sanctum has the image of a linga or sometimes of Ganapati (Ganesha), the son of Shiva in the case of Shaiva temples or of a seated or upright Jain saint (Tirthankar) in the case of Jain temples.|$|E
5000|$|Lady Xoc donated three <b>lintels</b> to hang {{above the}} doors of a {{building}} in Yaxchilan’s plaza. In the <b>lintels,</b> she is depicted performing central roles in ritual life. The fact that a woman appears in the <b>lintels</b> as the central figure is what makes them so unique. Also, the <b>lintels</b> were meant to show the hopes Shield Jaguar had for the kingdom. Putting up the <b>lintels</b> was a way for Shield Jaguar to pay respect to Lady Xoc, whose lineage made him king.|$|R
50|$|Structure 12 {{is a small}} {{structure}} in the Central Acropolis, close to the river. It contained eight <b>lintels</b> dating to the early 6th century. The structure {{is located in the}} Central Acropolis close to one of the ballcourts. The <b>lintels</b> record nine generations of rulers of the city. The <b>lintels</b> were commissioned by K'inich Tatb'u Skull II, their original location is unknown, being reset into Structure 12 in the 8th century by king Bird Jaguar IV. Some of the <b>lintels</b> remain in place.|$|R
50|$|Windows: The {{earliest}} {{windows were}} set into opening {{topped by a}} low brick arch. Later these were replaced by cast stone <b>lintels</b> that were balanced {{in the same way}} as the bricks. The next generation of <b>lintels</b> had square ends and were wider than the window opening, changing the thrust from horizontally to vertically. Cast stone was used for <b>lintels,</b> door and window surrounds, arch sets, bay window sets, cills and quoins with sharp moulds and decoration. Windows <b>lintels</b> often displayed a false keystone.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} does demonstrate {{elements of}} Classical Revival architecture {{but they are}} minimal and concentrated around the front entrance. Below the front entrance hood there are two stone pilasters and a stone <b>lintel,</b> as well as relief work adorning the pediment; leading to the front entrance are seven concrete stairs. The entire entry facade is a gable-front, temple style design and on the library's east wing there are stone-capped modified buttresses. Each of these elements demonstrates the Classical Revival style.|$|E
5|$|The {{nineteenth century}} porch {{has a big}} ashlar triple-chamfered pointed arch, hoodmould and stone voussoirs. There is a boarded {{segmental}} pointed roof, stone side benches and a quarry tiles floor. There are three {{steps up to the}} fine oak double doors by Seddon, with wrought iron hinges and cambered <b>lintel</b> under an oak tympanum with roundel pierced with three leaded trefoils and a trefoil each side.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) and now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was inscribed on the <b>lintel</b> of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E
50|$|Structure 23 {{has been}} {{identified}} as Lady Xoc's quarters because of the <b>lintels</b> found adorning the doorway. It has been suggested that the rituals depicted on these <b>lintels</b> may have occurred in Structure 23 - given that Lady Xoc is pictured in the <b>lintels</b> performing ritual sacrifices with her husband, this would mean Shield Jaguar entered the space of women with power.|$|R
5|$|At Tikal, {{beams of}} {{sapodilla}} wood were placed as <b>lintels</b> spanning the inner doorways of temples. These {{are the most}} elaborately carved wooden <b>lintels</b> to have survived anywhere in the Maya region.|$|R
50|$|The hieroglyphic {{inscriptions}} on the sculpted <b>lintels</b> {{indicate that}} the temple was built in 741 AD, and radiocarbon dating of the <b>lintels</b> and wooden beams in the vaulting confirmed this, giving a result of 720±60 AD.|$|R
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, {{on the outer}} walls, the sculptures are not overdone, yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (<b>lintel</b> with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|From the 11th century, {{architectural}} articulation included icons between pilasters, miniature towers {{supported by}} pilasters in {{the recesses of}} walls, and, on occasion, the use of wall pillars to support these towers. These miniature towers were of the southern dravida and northern bhumija and sekhari types and were mostly used to elaborate dravida types of articulation. The miniatures on single pilasters were decorated with a protective floral <b>lintel</b> on top, a form of decoration normally provided for depiction of gods. These elaborations are observed in the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri. These miniatures became common in the 12th century, {{and the influence of}} this northern articulation is seen in the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi and in the nearby Nannesvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was stolen. The <b>lintel</b> of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E
50|$|In the art world, the <b>lintels</b> are {{numbered}} 24, 25, and 26 and {{are estimated to}} have been created in A.D. 725. In these <b>lintels</b> Lady Xoc is seen performing a bloodletting ritual {{in the presence of}} Shield Jaguar, communicating with a dead ancestor, and preparing the King for battle. By looking at these <b>lintels</b> in order, we can see the role Lady Xoc played in war and in the ancient rituals of the Maya.|$|R
50|$|Inscribed stone <b>lintels</b> {{discovered}} {{at the town}} helped in studying and dating the Christianization process of Emesa and its surrounding countryside. <b>Lintels</b> from the Palladis household, dated to 449/450 attest to clear pagan traditions. The first waves of Christianization came in the 460s, when <b>lintels</b> bearing crosses were discovered with increasing numbers alongside pagan ones. The full Christinization of the village is dated to 508/510 {{at the time when}} the village's first church was built.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{particularly}} {{known for its}} well-preserved sculptured stone <b>lintels</b> set above the doorways of the main structures. These <b>lintels,</b> together with the stelae erected before the major buildings, contain hieroglyphic texts describing the dynastic history of the city.|$|R
5|$|Islamic {{reverence for}} the site {{is derived from the}} belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge <b>lintel</b> is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a <b>lintel.</b> These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and <b>lintel</b> type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way to divide up the spaces.|$|E
50|$|Examples of the {{ornamental}} use of <b>lintels</b> {{are in the}} hypostyle {{halls and}} slab stelas in ancient Egypt and the Indian rock-cut architecture of Buddhist temples in caves. Preceding prehistoric and subsequent Indian Buddhist temples were wooden buildings with structural load-bearing wood <b>lintels</b> across openings. The rock-cut excavated cave temples were more durable, and the non-load-bearing carved stone <b>lintels</b> allowed creative ornamental uses of classical Buddhist elements. Highly skilled artisans were able to simulate the look of wood, imitating the nuances of a wooden structure and the wood grain in excavating cave temples from monolithic rock.In freestanding Indian building examples, the Hoysala architecture tradition between the 11th and 14th centuries produced many elaborately carved non-structural stone <b>lintels</b> in the Southern Deccan Plateau region of southern India. The Hoysala Empire era was an important period {{in the development of}} art and architectural the South Indian Kannadigan culture. It is remembered today primarily for its Hindu temples' mandapa, <b>lintels,</b> and other architectural elements, such as at the Chennakesava Temple.|$|R
50|$|Kala are {{particularly}} {{prominent in the}} <b>lintels</b> of the temple. They are the best available aid in dating the structure, but the mix of styles (Khleang and Baphuon) makes accurate dating impossible. Several of the <b>lintels</b> on the outer gopuras are unfinished.|$|R
25|$|The eastern {{houses have}} more {{elaborate}} enframements. Their main entrances are enframed with deep <b>lintels</b> on angular brackets. The windows are fully enframed {{and have more}} complex <b>lintels.</b> There have been no major changes {{to any of these}} houses. Some of the dwellings have fireplaces.|$|R
5|$|The {{domestic}} dwellings {{of elite}} and ordinary Egyptians alike were constructed from perishable {{materials such as}} mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, {{such as those in}} Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs. Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, Djoser's mortuary complex, include post and <b>lintel</b> supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.|$|E
5|$|There is a glyphic {{record that}} {{sometime}} before 731 a lord of Motul {{was captured by}} a lord (Ruler B) of Machaquilá. In 740, Machaquila attacked Motul de San José. Hieroglyphic Stairway 3 at Dos Pilas records that in 745 a lord of Motul was captured by K'awiil Chan K'inich of Dos Pilas. In {{the middle of the}} 8th century AD, Motul de San José was closely allied with the important city of Yaxchilan on the Usumacinta River, as demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} king of Yaxchilan Yaxun B'alam IV ("Bird Jaguar IV") who ruled from 752 to 768, took two wives from Motul de San José. They are named in inscriptions at Yaxchilan as Lady Wak Tuun and Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw. Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw is shown preparing her husband for a battle that took place in 755 on Yaxchilan <b>Lintel</b> 41, now in the British Museum in London. In fact, the alliance with Yaxchilan may date further back to the early 8th century since Yaxchilan <b>Lintel</b> 25 (dedicated in AD 723) used the so-called X-ray style of imagery that is closely associated with the Motul de San José polity. However, relations with Yaxchilan were not always peaceful and Hieroglyphic Stairway 5 at Yaxchilan records that Itzamnaaj B'alam III of Yaxchilan defeated the lord of Motul some time in the latter part of the 8th century.|$|E
5|$|Wheelhouses are stone {{buildings}} {{from the}} later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which {{a circle of}} stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) {{form the basis for}} <b>lintel</b> arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.|$|E
50|$|This -story brick {{structure}} displays some of {{its early}} exterior features; brownstone sills and <b>lintels,</b> and two corbelled chimneys. The windows on the west facade were lengthened, the brownstone <b>lintels</b> removed and replaced by segmental-arched brick <b>lintels.</b> The cupola was replaced. The wing, attached to its south wall, probably dates deom the late 19th century. More decorative, it displays corbelled brick work and an unusual arched window on the west facade. A large mural of a clipper ship is painted on the south wall.|$|R

5|$|Other {{important}} contributions are the Jain basadis' whose towers have gradually receding stories (talas) ornamented with small models of temples. These tiny shrines have in them engravings of tirthankars (Jain saints). Semicircular windows connect the shrines and decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) are {{used at the}} top. The Chavundaraya basadi built in the 10th or 11th century, Chandragupta basadi built in the 6th century and the monolithic of Gomateshwara of 982 {{are the most important}} monuments at Shravanabelagola. Some features were added to the Chandragupta basadi by famous Hoysala sculptor Dasoja in the 12th century. The decorative doorjambs and perforated screen windows which depict scenes from the life of King Chandragupta Maurya are known to be his creation. The Panchakuta Basadi at Kambadahalli (five towered Jan temple) of about 900 with a Brahmadeva pillar is an excellent example of Dravidian art. The wall niches here are surmounted by torana (<b>lintel)</b> with carvings of floral motifs, flying divine creatures (gandharva) and imaginary monsters (makara) ridden by Yaksas (attendants of saints) while the niches are occupied by images of tirthankars themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Western Chalukya {{decorative}} inventiveness {{focused on}} the pillars, door panels, lintels (torana), domical roofs in bays, outer wall decorations such as Kirtimukha (gargoyle faces common in Western Chalukya decoration), and miniature towers on pilasters. Although the art form of these artisans {{does not have any}} distinguishing features from a distance, a closer examination reveals their taste for decoration. An exuberance of carvings, bands of scroll work, figural bas-reliefs and panel sculptures are all closely packed. The doorways are highly ornamented but have an architectural framework consisting of pilasters, a moulded <b>lintel</b> and a cornice top. The sanctum receives diffused light through pierced window screens flanking the doorway; these features were inherited and modified by the Hoysala builders. The outer wall decorations are well rendered. The Chalukyan artisans extended the surface of the wall by means of pilasters and half pilasters. Miniature decorative towers of multiple types are supported by these pilasters. These towers are of the dravida tiered type, and in the nagara style they were made in the latina (mono aedicule) and its variants; the bhumija and sekhari.|$|E
5|$|The three-story {{brick house}} {{includes}} a full elevated basement and a mansard roof with steeply pitched gabled dormers. Projecting from the roofline are plain corbeled chimneys and iron gillwork, the original roofing material was slate. The 1879 {{version of the}} Ellwood House featured dormer ornamentation with finial work. The original windows were all double-hung and of modest size, occurring both singly and in pairs while showing a variety of <b>lintel</b> designs. The original front (east) facade appeared much different than it does at present. The front entryway has been completely altered, due to Perry Ellwood's 1911 remodeling. The original entryway featured a one-story stone porch supported with two pilasters and two granite columns. The square projecting porch bay {{was connected to the}} ground via 12 stone stairs. In the southeast corner of the house was a full three-story projecting tower set at a 45° angle {{to the rest of the}} front facade.|$|E
