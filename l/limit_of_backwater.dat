While most of these islands are too small and flood prone to have ever been inhabited, one larger island just west of downtown Prairie du Chien formed the city's fourth ward until a 1965 flood prompted a mandatory relocation of the island's residents to higher ground. During the relocation project, most buildings with no special historical significance were removed. Now called [...] "St. Feriole Island", the island serves as a [...] city park.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} daily temperature regimes and food availability on {{growth rates of}} Colorado squawfish (Ptychocheilus lucius) were determined using field and laboratory experiments. Daily temperature and food gradients were observed in river backwaters (important nursery habitat for juvenile Colorado squawfish). High fluctuating temperatures (+- 5 - 8 C) were observed daily in the shallow, terminal ends <b>of</b> <b>backwaters.</b> Where backwaters were {{in contact with the}} river (mouth), daily temperature fluctuations decreased (+- 2 C). Food availability also varied spatially between the mouth and end <b>of</b> each <b>backwater.</b> To test whether Colorado squawfish growth rates varied in different areas <b>of</b> <b>backwaters</b> along these gradients, a series of cage experiments was performed. Cages were placed in each backwater at the end (high temperature fluctuation), middle (moderate temperature fluctuation), and mouth (low temperature fluctuation). Colorado squawfish growth rates were significantly higher near the mouth <b>of</b> the <b>backwater</b> where temperatures were more constant. In laboratory aquaria, Colorado squawfish growth rates were observed at three different temperature regimes, similar to those found in backwaters (+- 0, +- 3, and +- 7 C). As with field experiments, growth rates were high in the low fluctuating temperature treatment; however, they were not significantly different from the highly fluctuating temperature treatment. Behavioral observations of Colorado squawfish movement performed using a large (5 m x 1 m x 0. 5 m) Plexiglas tank with a temperature regime similar to that found in backwaters suggested that Colorado squawfish spent the majority of their time in the deeper part of the tank where the least amount of temperature fluctuation occurred...|$|R

40|$|The investigation, {{analysis}} and experimental research on bridge backwater started {{from the end}} of last cen-tury in foreign countries with a starting point of cal-culation formula <b>of</b> <b>backwater</b> at bridge piers proposed by D’Aubuisson in 1840, and its history is more than 170 years. Later, Weisbach (1848), Ruhlmann (1880), et al. respectively proposed the weir flow formula <b>of</b> <b>backwater</b> at bridge piers; Naglar (1917), Lane (1920) adopted experimental data to revise D’Aubuisson formula and Weisbach formula. Then, Rehbock and Yarnell respectively carried out a large number of systematic laboratory experiments, thus pushing ahead previous research based on distinguishing flow state. Since the 1960 s, the electronic computer has been used for calculation of bridge and river water in for-eign countries. From the late 1960 s to the early 1970 s, the Geological Engineering Center of United States Army Corps of Engineers and other departments pre-pared calculation procedures for bridge river hydrau-lics and culverts hydraulics. In 1974, the United States J. T. Franques and D. W. Yannitell prepared the first finite element model in two-dimensional flow analysis <b>of</b> <b>backwater</b> before the bridge. Until recently, with the improvement of calculation methods and model discrete methods, there were many calculation proce-dures with more accuracy, such as PHOENICS, CFX, STAR-CD, MIKE, FLUENT and other commercial CFD software.
