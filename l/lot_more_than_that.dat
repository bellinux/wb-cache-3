I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music.

2500|$|This {{statistic}} {{was somewhat}} disputed in a 2006 article about {{poverty in the}} slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, [...] "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically {{because of the fact}} that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because 'it's none of your business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".|$|E

50|$|Pyunik's main two rivals are Ararat and Banants, {{however, the}} rivalry with Ararat is a <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> fierce <b>than</b> <b>that</b> of Banants.

Another category Banants and Pyunik compete is their youth academies, which are considered to be the two best academies in the country.|$|R

It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something that is pretty much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her.
