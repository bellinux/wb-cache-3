Each timber legality assurance system must have the following five components: a <b>legality</b> <b>definition,</b> supply chain controls, verification of compliance, FLEGT licensing and independent audit of the whole system.|$|E
40|$|A {{major focus}} of {{software}} transaction memory systems (STMs) has been to felicitate the multiprocessor programming and provide parallel programmers an abstraction for speedy and efficient development of parallel applications. To this end, different models for incorporating object/higher level semantics into STM have recently been proposed in transactional boosting, transactional data structure library, open nested transactions and abstract nested transactions. We build an alternative object model STM (OSTM) by adopting the transactional tree model of Weikum et al. originally given for databases and extend the current work by proposing comprehensive <b>legality</b> <b>definitions</b> and conflict notion which allows efficient composability of. We first time show the proposed OSTM to be co-opacity. We build OSTM using chained hash table data structure. Lazyskip-list is used to implement chaining using lazy approach. We notice that major concurrency hotspot is the chaining data structure within the hash table. Lazyskip-list is time efficient compared to lists in terms of traversal overhead by average case O(log(n)). We optimise lookups as they are validated at the instant they execute {{and they have not}} validated again in commit phase. This allows lookup dominated transactions to be more efficient {{and at the same time}} co-opacity. Comment: 46 pages, 27 figure...|$|R

The underground economy, tax evasion and corruption are state of the economy, of the economic and social behavior of individuals. In a market economy, the tax authorities face an acceleration of tax evasion phenomenon, a phenomenon that has proportions increasingly higher due to "temptation" of avoiding the imposition of taxable income more substantial. Tax evasion is characterized by a high imprecision, this phenomenon associating several meanings and assessments regarding the <b>legality.</b> The <b>definition</b> of this phenomenon can be simplified by the following phrase: willful failure by the taxpayers of their tax obligations imposed by tax authoritie...|$|R
40|$|Issues {{of public}} trust in justice and {{institutional}} legitimacy {{are becoming increasingly}} salient in debate about criminal justice across Europe. Legitimate authority {{can be defined as}} having three interlinked elements: (a) legality (acting according to the law); (b) shared values (values that are shared by those with authority and those subject to that authority); and (c) consent (the sense amongst the policed of a moral obligation to obey the authority). According to this definition, legitimacy is present not only when individuals recognise the authority of institutions and feel a corresponding duty of deference to them (consent); it is also present when individuals believe that justice institutions have a proper moral purpose (shared values), and that justice institutions follow their own rules as well as the rules that govern everyone in society (<b>legality).</b> With this <b>definition</b> in mind, we analyse in this chapter data from the fifth European Social Survey on relationships between public trust in justice institutions and public perceptions of the legitimacy of these institutions...|$|R
40|$|Illegal {{logging in}} Indonesia {{has been raised}} as a key driver in {{deforestation}} and degradation, leading to biodiversity loss, increased climate emissions, and poor forest governance. This paper explores the pathways through which strategists might travel to combat illegal logging. This paper will focus on one proposed mechanism for combating illegal logging in Indonesia: <b>legality</b> verification. Problem <b>Definition</b> With 98. 7 million hectares of forest cover (Indonesian Ministry of Forestry 2012), Indonesia has the third-‐largest expanse of tropical forests in the world after Brazil and the Democratic Republic of Congo. However, high rates of illegal logging in Indonesia (Seneca Creek Associates 2004) and {{hundreds of millions of}} cubic meters of illegal exports (Obidzinski et al. 2007) have combined to cause extensive deforestation and cost the Indonesian economy from $ 1 billion to $ 5 billion (U. S.) per year (Seneca Creek Associates 2004; Human Rights Watch 2009). Although it is estimated that rates have declined from 80 percent in the early 2000 s (Environmental Investigation Agency EIA and Telapak 2002) to 40 percent in 2009 (Lawson and MacFaul 2010), illegal logging remains one of the key challenges facing the Indonesia forest sector. In response, the Indonesia government in 2009 created a new national legality verification system, Sistem Verifikasi Legalitas Kayu (SVLK), which domestic and international organizations now view {{as one of the most}} promising mechanisms for addressing illegal logging in Indonesia (Cashore and Stone 2013). However, the degree and extent of successful implementation of legality verification will depend on the decisions made by policy makers and environmental practitioners in the coming years.
