25|$|Scotland had no cities by royal charter or {{letters patent}} before 1889. The nearest {{equivalent}} in pre-Union Scotland was the royal burgh. The term city {{was not always}} consistently applied, and there were doubts over the number of officially designated cities. The royal burghs of Edinburgh and Perth anciently used the title civitas, but the term city {{does not seem to}} have been used before the 15th century. Unlike the situation in England, in Scotland there was no link between the presence of a cathedral and the title of city. Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh were accepted as cities by ancient usage by the 18th century, while Perth and Elgin also used the title. In 1856, the burgh of Dunfermline resolved to use the title of city in all official documents in the future, based on <b>long</b> <b>usage</b> and its former status as a royal capital. The status was never officially recognised.|$|E

50|$|In 1630 Charles I granted one-third {{part of the}} Forest or Chace of Malvern to Sir Robert Heath, then Attorney-General, and Sir Cornelius Vermuyden. In the {{meantime}} many rights or claims of right had arisen by grant or <b>long</b> <b>usages</b> in the lapse of several centuries. When the grantees began to enclose the Chace the commoners and other persons interested disputed their right to do so. Several riots and disturbances took place in consequence.|$|R

60|$|Near the {{old woman}} was a child playing upon the deck. Perhaps it was her grandchild. The child had a small wagon, which she was drawing about the deck. The wagon looked very much worn and soiled by <b>long</b> <b>usage,</b> but in other respects it resembled very much the little wagons that are drawn about by {{children}} in America.|$|E
60|$|In a moment, {{with the}} {{swiftness}} born of <b>long</b> <b>usage,</b> the demeanour {{of the three}} gentlemen underwent a quick and sudden change. They seemed to pull their gorgeous figures together; with practised fingers each readjusted the lace of his cravat, reëstablished the correct set of his waistcoat, and flickered the last grain of dust or snuff from the satin-like surface of his coat.|$|E
60|$|She {{clung to}} Ursula, who, through <b>long</b> <b>usage</b> was inured to this {{violation}} of a dark, uncreated, hostile world. But all the time her heart was crying, as if {{in the midst of}} some ordeal: 'I want to go back, I want to go away, I want not to know it, not to know that this exists.' Yet she must go forward.|$|E
40|$|Gestural {{controllers}} in {{the musical}} arts provide a unique perspective on human-computer interaction. Given the novelty of the field, there is little research into the <b>long</b> term <b>usage</b> of gestural controllers. In the course of comparing the Buchla Lightning and the Mathews Radio Baton, the authors questioned users of these interfaces with over 10 years experience. The answers can help performers understand the implications of using gestural controllers, as well as designers {{who are interested in}} the <b>long</b> term <b>usage</b> patterns of their interfaces. 1...|$|R

60|$|Another {{thing was}} the fact that the Judge was the first to follow his pastor's example, and prove by deeds that he indorsed his words. It was hard for the hospitable old gentleman to banish wine from his table, and forego the {{pleasant}} customs which <b>long</b> <b>usage</b> and many associations endeared to him; but he made his sacrifice handsomely, and his daughter helped him.|$|E
60|$|It was not, after all, {{strange that}} the white man's ways should have been so much more nearly related {{to those of the}} beasts than were the savage blacks.

50|$|King Charles I {{engaged in}} sale of Royal forests and chases during the 1620s and 30s {{in an attempt}} to provide himself with income without {{recourse}} to Parliament. In 1630 he granted one-third part of the Forest or Chace of Malvern to Sir Robert Heath, then Attorney-General, and Sir Cornelius Vermuyden. In the meantime many rights or claims of right had arisen by grant or <b>long</b> <b>usages</b> in the lapse of several centuries. When the grantees began to enclose, the Chace the commoners and other persons interested disputed their right to do so. Several riots and disturbances took place in consequence. Such riots were common in these processes, elsewhere being known as the Western Rising.|$|R

60|$|From {{this side}} of the house and right through the silence that hung over it, Louisa could hear very faintly rising from the servants' {{quarters}} below, the sound of women's voices chattering and giggling. The nurses then had not returned to their post. With the indifference born of <b>long</b> <b>usage</b> they were enjoying every minute of the brief respite accorded them, content to wait for the doctor's call if the patient had immediate need of them.|$|E
60|$|He {{proceeded}} to dress, {{a matter of}} moments, slipping into duck trousers and blouse, dirty and frayed from <b>long</b> <b>usage.</b> Two fingers {{of his left hand}} were doubled into a permanent bend, and, to an expert, would have advertised that he was a leper. Although he belonged to Dag Daughtry just as much as if the steward possessed a chattel bill of sale of him, his owner did not know that his anaesthetic twist of ravaged nerves tokened the dread disease.|$|E
60|$|The {{minister}} {{began to}} turn over the leaves of his little Bible, which it impressed Somerset to observe was bound with a flap, like a pocket book, the black surface of the leather being worn brown at the corners by <b>long</b> <b>usage.</b> He turned on till he came {{to the beginning of the}} New Testament, and then commenced his discourse. After explaining his position, the old man ran very ably through the arguments, citing well-known writers on the point in dispute when he required more finished sentences than his own.|$|E
50|$|Small-craft sails are sails {{designed}} to be attached to watercraft not conventionally equipped with sails, such as kayaks, canoes, or dinghies.

60|$|Etiquette, if I {{understand}} rightly the term, {{which in}} any extent is of modern usage, had its original application to those ceremonial and formal observances practised at courts, {{which had been}} established by <b>long</b> <b>usage,</b> {{in order to preserve}} the sovereign power from the rude intrusion of licentious familiarity, as well as to preserve majesty itself from a disposition to consult its ease at the expense of its dignity. The term came afterwards to have a greater latitude, and to be employed to signify certain formal methods used in the transactions between sovereign states.|$|E
60|$|As sudden shiftings of the scene, {{and rapid}} changes {{of time and}} place, are not only sanctioned in books by <b>long</b> <b>usage,</b> but are by many {{considered}} as the great art of authorship: an author's skill in his craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters {{at the end of}} every chapter: this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.|$|E
60|$|It seemed incredible, {{and yet it}} was true, for as {{they drew}} nearer they saw that it was indeed a beaten track across the desert, {{hollowed}} out by <b>long</b> <b>usage,</b> and so covered with bones that they gave the impression of a continuous white ribbon. Long, snouty heads were scattered everywhere, and the lines of ribs were so continuous that it looked in places like the framework of a monstrous serpent. The endless road gleamed in the sun as if it were paved with ivory. For thousands of years this had been the highway over the desert, and during all that time no animal of all those countless caravans had died there without being preserved by the dry, antiseptic air. No wonder, then, that it was hardly possible to walk down it now without treading upon their skeletons.|$|E
5000|$|The TVS Television Network, or TVS for short, is a syndicator of American sports programming. It was one {{of several}} [...] "occasional" [...] {{national}} television networks that sprang up in the early-to-mid-1960s {{to take advantage of the}} establishment of independent (mostly UHF) television stations and relaxation of the AT&T <b>Long</b> Lines <b>usage</b> rates.|$|R
50|$|For voice DS1 lines, the {{calculation}} is mostly the same, {{except that the}} port (required for Internet access) is replaced by LDU (otherwise known as <b>Long</b> Distance <b>Usage).</b> Once {{the price of the}} loop is determined, only voice-related charges are added to the total. In short, the total price = loop + LDU x minutes used.|$|R

60|$|The bed {{itself was}} {{decorated}} with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity; and at the upper end, upon the side nearest to the door, hung a scanty curtain of blue check, which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in Kingsgate Street, from visiting Mrs Gamp's head too roughly. Some rusty gowns and other articles of that lady's wardrobe depended from the posts; and these had so adapted themselves by <b>long</b> <b>usage</b> to her figure, {{that more than one}} impatient husband coming in precipitately, at about the time of twilight, had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself. One gentleman, coming on the usual hasty errand, had said indeed, that they looked like guardian angels 'watching of her in her sleep.' But that, as Mrs Gamp said, 'was his first;' and he never repeated the sentiment, though he often repeated his visit.|$|E
60|$|After a time, with {{a greater}} clashing of steel-shod feet on rock, he returned. The green screen was tremendously agitated. It surged {{back and forth in}} the throes of a struggle. There was a loud grating and clanging of metal. The man's voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness. A large body plunged and panted. There was a {{snapping}} and ripping and rending, and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen. On its back was a pack, and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers. The animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been precipitated, then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to graze. A second horse scrambled into view, slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow. It was riderless, though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle, scarred and discolored by <b>long</b> <b>usage.</b>|$|E
60|$|Four {{times in}} the year, however, the Boers indulge in a general wash before {{starting}} with their wives and families {{for four or five}} days' stay at the nearest town to attend the services of the church and to do their quarter's marketing. In dress the Boer is almost universally slovenly, his clothes hang about him stained and discoloured by <b>long</b> <b>usage.</b> In the majority of cases he is altogether without education, and very many Boers are scarcely able to sign their names. Most of them wear beards and long unkempt hair. But in point of physique they are fine men, tall and powerfully, though loosely, built, but capable of standing great fatigue if necessary, although averse to all exercise save on horseback. All are taught to shoot from boyhood, and even the women in the country districts are trained in the use of firearms, for it is not so long since they lived in dread of incursions by the Zulus and Swazis.|$|E
50|$|The Eppley Fine Arts Building {{was built}} in 1966 by Chris Hansen Construction from designs by a local {{architectural}} firm called W.L. Beutler and Son.

5000|$|One {{cause of}} {{nephropathy}} is the <b>long</b> term <b>usage</b> of pain medications known as analgesics.
