This research is conducted by testing samples with some mixtures of Portland cement, <b>milled</b> <b>stone</b> sand and tras (sand with a little cement content). There are ten mixtures which are tested. The result of the research shows that the best mixture is those of cement, <b>milled</b> <b>stone</b> sand and water, since they are having characteristic more elastic. Hence, to make better result of floor tile by replacing <b>milled</b> <b>stone</b> sand as sand substitution is suggested. The mixture composition of 1 Portland Cement: 1 ½ <b>milled</b> <b>stone</b> sand: 2 ½ sand + tras could be a better mixture to get the best quality of floor tile.

40|$|Of {{interest}} to D. L. True {{throughout his career}} was the California <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> Horizon, the artifact complex dominated by handstones, millingslabs, and crude core tools most frequently associated with the early Holocene in southern California. The basic <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> pattern, identified in 1929 by David Banks Rogers in the Santa Barbara Channel and formally defined by Treganza (1950) and Wallace (1955), {{was brought to the}} attention of American archaeologists outside of California by Wallace (1954) and True (1958). Over the next 30 years, D. L. True authored a number of articles and reports on <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> (Basgall and True 1985; True 1980; True and Baumhoff 1982, 1985; True and Beemer 1982; True et al. 1979) in which he described regional variants and refined the typological definitions of important artifacts. Also during this period, D. L. was not shy about bringing <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> into the seminar room, often forcing theoretically-oriented archaeology students of the 1960 s, 70 s, and 80 s to acknowledge their inability to distinguish artifacts from non-artifacts. Not surprisingly, nearly every significant synthetic treatment of <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> in the last two decades was authored by either one of True 2 ̆ 7 s students (Basgall and True 1985; Hildebrandt 1983; McGuire and Hildebrandt 1994; Jones 1996) or a student of his students (Fitzgerald in Fitzgerald and Jones 1999; Fitzgerald 2000). As a result of these papers, and several by True 2 ̆ 7 s contemporaries (e. g., Wallace 1978; Warren 1967), <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> has emerged as one the best known early complexes in western North America and it has been discussed in reference to a series of different issues raised by a succession of theoretical paradigms. One issue that developed with the emergence of processual archaeology concerns the basic organizational foundation underlying the <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> complex. D. L. True (at least early in his career) and his contemporaries felt that <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> represented an archaeological culture - a patterned imprint in the material record that might reflect a cultural system of beliefs, values and other ideas shared by members of a society or societies. This notion was all but buried by the ecological theories put forth by the new archaeology that grew and flourished concurrently with D. L. True 2 ̆ 7 s career. With the paradigm of the New Archaeology in place, <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> became an adaptation - a rational, logical adjustment of technology and subsistence made by terminal Pleistocene/early Holocene peoples to the environment of southern California. As someone who has contributed to the notion of <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> as adaptation (e. g., Jones 1991 : 435 - 436, 1992, 1996), I 2 ̆ 7 d like to revisit this issue and argue, contrary to my earlier writings, there are compelling reasons to consider <b>Milling</b> <b>Stone</b> as an archaeological culture...|$|R
