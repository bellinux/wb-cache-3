5|$|Most European names {{came during}} the 1840s to the 1910s and were given by {{surveyors}} who worked for colonising associations or provincial governments. Names acknowledged the colonising associations sponsors (Hutt Valley, Wakefield, Port Chalmers, Ashburton), ships (Bombay), government officials (Featherston, Rolleston, Invercargill), politicians (Foxton, Fox Glacier, Gisborne) and church leaders (Selwyn). Military heroes and famous battles were popular place names, with Auckland, Napier, Hastings, Havelock, Wellington, Picton, Marlborough, Nelson and Blenheim. British politicians and royalty lent their names to Russell, Palmerston, Cromwell, Queenstown and Alexandra, while Franz Josef is named after the Austrian emperor. Royal names are more popular for streets than towns or geographical features, although both Auckland and Wellington have Mount Victoria. Gore is named after governor Thomas Gore Browne and George Grey's name is used for Greytown, Greymouth, Grey <b>Lynn</b> <b>and</b> many natural features. Relatively few names are derived from United Kingdom towns, with Dunedin (after Edinburgh—Dùn Éideann in Scottish Gaelic), New Plymouth and the Canterbury Province among the most notable.|$|E

5|$|On December 9, Alabama was {{selected}} as an at-large BCS participant {{to play in the}} Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma. Against the Sooners, the Crimson Tide were upset 45–31 against an upstart Oklahoma squad. Alabama opened the game with a four play, 75-yard touchdown drive that saw AJ McCarron complete a 53-yard pass to Amari Cooper and T. J. Yeldon score on a one-yard run for a 7–0 lead. On the first Oklahoma possession of the game, Landon Collins intercepted a Trevor Knight pass that halted the Sooners' drive. However, on the Alabama play that ensued, McCarron threw an interception to Gabe <b>Lynn,</b> <b>and</b> Oklahoma responded on their next play with a 45-yard Knight pass to Lacoltan Bester that tied the game 7–7. Alabama retook a 10–7 lead on a 27-yard Cade Foster field goal, but the Sooners again responded and took a 14–10 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter when Knight threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Saunders.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{sheltered}} the Glaven ports, Blakeney, Cley-next-the-Sea and Wiveton, {{which were}} important medieval harbours. Blakeney sent ships to help Edward I's war efforts in 1301, {{and between the}} 14th and 16th centuries {{it was the only}} Norfolk port between King's <b>Lynn</b> <b>and</b> Great Yarmouth to have customs officials. Blakeney Church has a second tower at its east end, an unusual feature in a rural parish church. It has been suggested that it acted as a beacon for mariners, perhaps by aligning it with the taller west tower to guide ships into the navigable channel between the inlet's sandbanks; that this was not always successful is demonstrated by a number of wrecks in the haven, including a carvel-built wooden ship.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age Le Mesurier had been {{interested}} in acting and performing; as a child he had frequently been taken to the West End of London to watch Ralph <b>Lynn</b> <b>and</b> Tom Walls perform in the popular series of farces at the Aldwych Theatre. These experiences fuelled an early desire {{to make a career}} on the stage. After leaving school he was initially persuaded to follow his father's line of work, as an articled clerk at Greene & Greene, a firm of solicitors in Bury St Edmunds; in his spare time he took part in local amateur dramatics. In 1933 he decided to leave the legal profession, and in September of that year enrolled at the Fay Compton Studio of Dramatic Art; a fellow-student was Alec Guinness, with whom he became close friends. In July 1934, the studio staged their annual public revue in which both Le Mesurier and Guinness took part; among the judges for the event were John Gielgud, Leslie Henson, Alfred Hitchcock and Ivor Novello. Le Mesurier received a Certificate of Fellowship, while Guinness won the Fay Compton prize. After the revue, rather than remain at the studio for further tuition Le Mesurier took an opportunity to join the Edinburgh-based Millicent Ward Repertory Players at a salary of £3.10s (£3.50) a week.|$|E
