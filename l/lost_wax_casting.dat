50|$|There are {{two main}} {{processes}} of <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> casting: solid <b>casting</b> and hollow casting. While the former is predominant {{in the south of}} India the latter is more common in Central and Eastern India. Solid casting does not use a clay core but instead a solid piece of wax to create the mould; hollow casting is the more traditional method and uses the clay core.|$|R

Bronze castings were sold with a certificate of authenticity stating each to be one of 996 castings, which were available in three different applied patinas and in silver. They were at sale for $25,000-35,000 each. The plan to cast up to 1000 statues however never reached fruition. Some of the replicas have since been for sale with the option of joint ownership to the 2012 bronze cast.|$|R
40|$|In this {{creative}} project I explored carving in <b>wax</b> and <b>casting</b> in the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> {{method to}} create rings with characteristics from ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, medieval Europe, {{as well as}} contemporary designs. It was important to my work {{for me to understand}} the history and significance of symbolic rings, and how they have changed over time in design. After studying these time periods, I made numerous sketches of the rings. These designs were finalized, carved in <b>wax,</b> and then <b>cast</b> in metal. Measurements of the metal needed to cast each ring were taken and recorded. Experimenting with various tools I achieved a method that produced quality and satisfying results in the carving of the wax. Other traditional metal smith techniques were used, such as prong settings and post settings for stones in the completion of the rings.

50|$|Born in 1966 Ducrot {{set out in}} tempera {{painting}} and black-white drawings. During his military-service he painted a portrait series of his comrades. After a time of experimenting, among others within the workshops of the figurative painter Giovanni Colacicchi and the sculptor Vito Cipolla, Ducrot dedicated himself entirely to the plastic arts. Despite some approaches to abstraction the majority of Ducrot's oeuvre emulates Imperial Roman and Hellenistic art {{as well as the}} dynamics of Baroque sculpture. He works in terracotta, glazed ceramics, marble and <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> bronze <b>casting.</b> Apart from numerous bozzetti Ducrot's works comprise both projects within the range of heritage conservation and private as well as Church commissions.

50|$|Dhokra (ଡୋକରା, ডোকরা) (also spelt Dokra) is non - {{ferrous metal}} casting using the lost-wax casting technique. This sort of metal casting {{has been used}} in India for over 4,000 years and is still used. One of the {{earliest}} known <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> artefacts is the dancing girl of Mohenjo-daro. The product of dhokra artisans are in great demand in domestic and foreign markets because of primitive simplicity, enchanting folk motifs and forceful form. Dhokra horses, elephants, peacocks, owls, religious images, measuring bowls, and lamp caskets etc., are highly appreciated. The <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> technique for <b>casting</b> of copper based alloys has also been found in China, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria, Central America, and other places.|$|R

50|$|When {{the first}} version of Forest Idyl was made, it was created using the <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> <b>casting</b> process, in which Polasek sculpted a model that was then cast in bronze by a foundry in New York called Roman Bronze Works.

40|$|In the {{conventional}} method for design and production in jewellery industry, {{it is difficult}} to create new designs due to lack of modern technology and intelligent equipment and software. The development of a jewellery design system is presented for a modern ornament industry by adopting new technologies and modem equipment in CAD/CAM. The technique is verified by the examples of actual jewellery design by the system and then producing it by <b>lost</b> <b>wax</b> investment <b>casting</b> method using <b>wax</b> pattern created by a rapid prototyping system instead of the traditional method of mould injection. This CAD based system of development of modern jewellery design offers advantages of flexibility in creating more variety of design and the ability to produce intricate shape conveniently.

Shahid held a solo exhibition of wood and bronze sculptures at the Karachi Arts Council in 1974 and won the first prize in sculpture at the National Exhibition in Islamabad in 1977.
