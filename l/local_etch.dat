40|$|Large {{areas of}} {{electrically}} active regions of in-homogeneities have been {{revealed by the}} electroless photo-etching (PEC) method in GaN layers grown by the hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) technique. Variations in the <b>local</b> <b>etch</b> rate have been correlated with the variations in the free-carrier concentrations as determined by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The etch rate decreased linearly with the log of the carrier concentration. The latter could change by more than two orders of magnitude on the same sample...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â€” We {{demonstrate}} the coupling of Monte Carlo sputter simulation with feature-scale simulation of profile evolution during sputter etching. With the Monte Carlo sputter simulation, {{the dependence of}} the sputter yield on the angle of incidence and on the energy of ions impinging onto the surface is determined. The yield curves obtained thereby are fed into a feature-scale etching profile simulator which predicts the <b>local</b> <b>etch</b> rates based on these sputter yield curves and on ion fluxes which are calculated for a substrate placed in a sputter reactor. For validating the simulations, a process sequence consisting of deposition and back etching (in an argon plasma) of silicon oxide between metal lines has been studied. Assuming an ion energy of 250 eV allows us to consistently reproduce profiles observed experimentally. I...|$|E
40|$|Profile etching {{experiments}} made on InP in solutions of Br 2 -HBr {{revealed that}} the profile shape is strongly dependenton the resist orientation and on whether SiO 2 or photoresist {{is used as a}} mask. It was found that the <b>local</b> <b>etch</b> rate of the(111) In crystallographic planes can be significantly enhanced near the resist edges. In the extreme case the dissolution ratewas found to be controlled by Br 2 diffusion in solution which resulted in rounded profiles. A model is proposed which canaccount for this apparently anomalous etching behavior. The anisotropic etching of thin surface layers is essential in thismodel. Experimental results can be explained if it is assumed that native oxide layers covering the monocrystalline InPsubstrates play this role. The local etching kinetics of crystallographic facets and, consequently, the profile shape arestrongly determined by the lateral etch rate of these oxide layers...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} the Etch/TEM and Etch/AFM methods to obtain quantitative 2 -D dopant profiles for the ultra shallow p-n junctions of the next generation of metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs). For these methods, thin foil (TEM) or bulk (AFM) cross-sectional specimens were etched using a dopant selective chemical so that local areas of the dopant implanted source/drain (S/D) regions were etched to different depths. The surface topography of the S/D regions was determined from the thickness fringes for the TEM method and by the direct measurement for the AFM method. The <b>local</b> <b>etched</b> depths were converted to etch rates, and these were then converted to corresponding 1 -D and 2 -D dopant profiles by the experimentally independent etch rate calibration curves. Shallow junction MOSFET samples were designed and fabricated with junction depths 60 nm (n"+/p), 80 nm (n"+/p) and 120 nm (p"+/n) using 0. 25 #mu#m process technology. A new method using SOG (Spin-on-Glass) contributed to the high quality XTEM thin foil specimens. Controlled stirring of the etchant increased the dopant concentration selectivity and etching consistency. Computer modelling simulated the isotropic etching behaviours, which can introduce the significant error in dopant profiling for shallow and abrupt junction samples. Comprehensive quantitative results enabled the optimum etching time to be determined for the first time. Etch/TEM method gave 1 -D dopant profiles that showed good agreement with 1 -D Spreading Resistance Probe (SRP) dopant profiles for determining junction depths. 2 -D dopant profiles gave L_e_f_f, i. e. the shortest lateral distance between the S/D junctions, of major importance for MOSFET performance. Values for L_e_f_f of 161, 159 and 123 nm were determined from 60, 80 and 120 nm junction depth samples respectively, compared with the 215 nm MOSFET gate length. The resolution and accuracy of the Etch/TEM method are estimated as 2 and 10 nm respectively. For the Etch/AFM method, to overcome the artefact induced by tip size, {{for the first time a}} detailed investigation was made of the convolution occurring for the etched MOSFET structures and a double deconvolution method was developed. The resulting 2 -D dopant profiles for n"+/p 80 nm deep junction sample showed reasonable agreement with Etch/TEM method demonstrating the advantage of the developed deconvolution method. For the first time, the present work successfully achieved quantitative 2 -D dopant profiles for sub- 100 nm deep junctions. The developed dopant profiling methods are expected to contribute to the research and development for next generation devices.

40|$|A {{combined}} simulator linking gas flux {{data from}} a plasma reactor (experimental or simulated) to the feature profile evolution during etching/deposition processes is described. This combined simulator results from the coupling of surface <b>etch,</b> <b>local</b> flux calculation, and profile evolution modules. It is a modular tool, {{in the sense that}} different phenomena, surface models, and structures can be incorporated. In this work the combined simulator is applied in two processes: (a) in SiO 2 feature etching to simulate reactive ion etching (RIE) lag and inverse RIE lag and (b) in etching of high aspect ratio Si trenches using the Bosch process. The profile evolution algorithm of the combined simulator, namely, the level set method, is applied to a process where etching and deposition occur, and tracking of two materials (Si and polymer formed during the Bosch deposition step) is needed.

40|$|Uniformity and {{predictability}} are {{the principal}} qualities sought for all wet chemical etches. The establishment of these qualities, however, is hindered {{by a number of}} factors, such as nonuniformities in the starting material and random fluctuations in the local temperature and reactant concentration, which can lead to variations in etch rate across the surface of a wafer. The effects of variations in the <b>local</b> <b>etch</b> rate on the morphological development of an etching surface and on the overall etch rate of the semiconductor are discussed. The system studied was an Al 0. 4 Ga 0. 6 As/GaAs heterostructure photodissolved in nitric acid using 730 -nm laser light. Defects in the AlGaAs layer, which etched faster than the surrounding material, were responsible for variations in the etch rate. The defects also exhibited a degree of photosensitivity that has not been previously observed. It was also found that not all of the defects spanned the AlGaAs epilayer. A model for the overall etch rate was based on a system of noninteracting cylindrical defects with a distribution in depths...|$|E
40|$|A new Surfactant-based Removal Probability Function (S-RPF) is {{proposed}} to perform Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of anisotropic etching of silicon in alkaline solutions containing additives, such as {{tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide}} (TMAH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) with small amounts of surfactants (e. g. Triton) and/or alcohols (e. g. Isopropanol = IPA). The S-RPF is built {{as the product of}} (i) a Modified Removal Probability Function (M-RPF), for pure etchants, and (ii) an additive inhibition term (I-RPF), which describes the orientation-dependent reduction in certain etch rates due to the selective adsorption of the additive on particular silicon surfaces. By construction these functions depend only on a few parameters, whose values are determined by an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), which minimizes the differences between the experimental and simulated etch rates for a small set of silicon surfaces. In this respect, the paper introduces a transformation matrix to constrain the evolutionary search space, thus accelerating the convergence for both the M-RPF and I-RPF parameters. The simulated etch rates for numerous silicon orientations in TMAH+Trion at different temperatures as well as KOH+IPA show good agreement with the experimental data. Compared to previous studies, the new S-RPF model describes the anisotropy at <b>local</b> <b>etch</b> rate maxima and minima around Si(100) and Si(110) with much better accuracy. The simulation of three-dimensional microstructures confirms the validity of the new S-RPF model for MEMS fabrication in alkaline etchants containing additives...|$|E
