40|$|Part 5 : Enterprise Modelling and Information SystemsInternational audienceWe {{present an}} {{approach}} {{for the joint}} design of organizational regulatory spaces (ORS). The approach was validated through action research, integrating the components of context, people, process, information, and IT. The design of the ORS is usually performed by distinct teams, with unconnected viewpoints, using different vocabularies and tools. Similarly to information systems, there are business experts that define the regulatory goals and rules. The ORS modeling is problematic, and is fragmented. We have adopted the O 2 framework to provide a common level of abstraction for the design. The result is a comprehensive and <b>layered</b> <b>map</b> of the ORS. This approach has proved to offer an effective representation of the ORS for external auditors and business associations. Internally, we provide organizations with new ways to model, communicate, and improve the regulatory space...|$|E
40|$|This {{graduation}} {{project is}} part of the band published by the atelier 2 ̆ 6 apos;Berlin as model 2 ̆ 6 apos;. The atelier reopens the discussion on the relationship between dwelling and city form. Within the theme of 2 ̆ 6 apos;dwelling as building stone of the city 2 ̆ 6 apos; it focuses on the secondary space of Berlin. This type of city space, that forms {{a large part of the}} present-day metropolis, is underexposed in the debates about the development of the city. The investigation begins exactly there, where the discussion on how to develop a city is still very much unclear. The project tries to determine the secondary space of Berlin in order to get a clear image on what characteristics and potentials of this type of city are. The 2 ̆ 6 apos;Zwischenstadt 2 ̆ 6 apos;, a term introduced by Thomas Sieverts, provides a clear analogy with the space looked for in Berlin. The term addresses the decentralization of the compact historical European city and shows the development of a form of urbanity which he describes as the urbanised landscape or the landscaped city. The polycentric character of the metropolis of Berlin has led to a a similar kind of character. The expansion of the different centers within the region has resulted in a cityform where the characteristics, investigated under the term 2 ̆ 6 apos;in-between city 2 ̆ 6 apos;, are evidently useful to determine secondary space. These different characteristics are projected on the city of Berlin. It creates a <b>layered</b> <b>map</b> of the investigated space and thereby forms the first step into this project. A closer look on the uncovered city type shows a remarkably distinctive structure of a peripheral type of building block. This block has come to exist of a large diversity of different building types as a result of the different development phases it went through. The adapted building block is omnipresent in the secondary space. The blocktype is being analyzed by means of two case studies. This forms the basis for a strategy which envisions the evolution of the block with a collective type of dwelling. The strategy is being formed by analyzing bourgeoisie multi-family homes, from the period of 1895 until 1918, which are able to create a high quality living environment within this allotment type. The typology, developed just before modernism became the leading paradigm, is able to house this higher class in the city with very refined housing plans. As a result of the rationalization and standardization of the plans in subsequent periods this refinement is nowadays less and less present. This graduation project aims to overcome the resulted gap in the development of the upper middle class multi-family home by learning from the refinement of the bourgeoisie apartments from around 1900. This is being used to give an insight in the possible evolution of the block type and results in the design of three multi-family homes within an adapted building block in Berlin.

40|$|Anovel {{stereoscopic}} object segmentation method {{based on}} disparity and temporal-spatial cues is proposed in this paper. First, a foreground <b>layer</b> <b>map</b> is generated from a patched disparity image and a motion object map is produced using an adaptive reference frame selection method. Then {{the intersection of}} these two maps is used to extract the foreground motion objects. In the foreground <b>layer</b> <b>map</b> generation stage, two intensity image sequences of the input stereo videos are separately mapped to the rank space by a rank transform to eliminate the parameter deviation of binocular cameras, and reduce the interference of the environment fluctuation and noises. A fast multi-window matching strategy is proposed {{to speed up the}} stereo matching process. Then, a disparity patching process is performed to bridge the disparity discontinuity in the smooth region to improve the accuracy of the disparity map. In the motion object map generation stage, an adaptive reference frame selection method is introduced to obtain salient motion and produce the motion mask of each view. Experimental results have indicated the good performance and the practicability of the proposed stereo segmentation algorithm...|$|R
