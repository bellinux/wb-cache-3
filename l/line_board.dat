The results highlight practical opportunities and challenges for optimizing rate-power-stability tradeoffs in DSL access systems, complementing simulation-based studies focused on energy reduction through spectral optimization. We validate models for <b>line</b> <b>board</b> consumption that can be tied with line driver consumption based on the aggregate transmit power of each line, and demonstrate that near-optimal rate-power-stability tradeoffs can be obtained through external line management of data rate, Signal-to-Noise-Ratio margin and power spectral density parameters. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

30|$|The {{reviewed}} intervention {{literature that}} focuses on whole-body movement as an embodied way to improve numerosity is small and more work is needed to evaluate the potential of an embodied training approach in this domain. The current evidence of efficacy is based on relatively small sample sizes per study – {{with the exception of}} Ruiter et al. (2015) – and only one to three training sessions per condition. It is conceivable that longer interventions would result in more pronounced effects, assuming that more training leads to better learning. The reviewed studies demonstrate that participants got better in the condition of interest but this improvement was not always superior than the improvement in the control condition. Additionally, there is inconsistent support that participants also improve in tasks that were not part of the intervention such as verbal counting and mental arithmetic. With that it seems that other approaches, such as playing linear number games (Ramani, Jaeggi, Daubert, & Buschkuehl, 2017; Ramani & Siegler, 2008; Ramani, Siegler, & Hitti, 2012), are currently more effective as they not only lead to improvements in the trained task but also consistently result in improvements in untrained mathematics-related tasks. However, there are large procedural differences between the linear number <b>line</b> <b>board</b> game studies and the whole-body movement studies such as group versus one-on-one administration and number of training sessions to name only a few, that do not allow a straightforward comparison of the two intervention approaches. In sum, the available whole-body movement studies that aim to enhance mathematics learning are inconsistent and a clear advantage of the embodied approach is not yet fully established.|$|E

Using appropriate materials and consisting new wall system should considered in energy saving design.

Comparing with gypsum board and green timber <b>lining</b> <b>board</b> as interior sheathing material, temperature difference of Green timber wall system was bigger than temperature difference of gypsum board wall system. This aspects indicate that Green timber wall system was revealed higher thermal insulation property than gypsum board wall system. Gypsum board portion transfer heat easily because temperature difference gradient of gypsum board wall system was smaller than OSB wall system. Total temperature variation shape of G- 4 -S and G- 6 -S show similar model but, temperature variation shape in green timber wall portion assume a new aspect. The {{purpose of this study}} was that possibility of thermal insulation variation and new composition of wall system identify to improve thermal insulation performance. In the temperature case, this study shows possibility of improving thermal insulation performance. Humidity, sunshine and wind etc. should considered to determine building adiabatic properties...|$|R

40|$|Highlights - Investigated {{the fire}} {{performance}} of calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> cold-formed steel stud walls. - No integrity failure {{was observed in}} the 20 mm thick calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lining.</b> - Fall-off and cracking of calcium silicate boards were not observed in the fire tests. - Insulation failure occurred in calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> non-load bearing walls. - Compared the fire performance of calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> walls with gypsum plasterboard and magnesium oxide <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> walls. Abstract Light gauge Steel Frame (LSF) wall systems are made of cold-formed steel studs and tracks, and lined with wall lining materials. Conventionally, gypsum plasterboards are used as wall lining material in LSF wall systems. The fire performance of LSF walls is mainly dependent on the type and configuration of wall lining material, which delays the heat transfer through the wall and protects the steel studs from being heated rapidly. Recently, calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lining</b> is increasingly used in LSF wall systems because of its improved physical and thermal properties while being lightweight, cost effective, impact and moisture resistant. However, their fire performance has not been investigated in detail. Hence two full scale fire tests were conducted on non-load bearing LSF walls lined with calcium silicate boards. For comparison purposes two fire tests were also conducted on conventional gypsum plasterboard lined LSF walls. This paper presents {{the details of this}} experimental study on the fire performance of LSF walls and the results including fire resistance levels and time-temperature profiles across the wall panels. Effects of using calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lining</b> are discussed by comparing the fire test results of LSF wall lined with gypsum plasterboards and previously conducted studies on magnesium oxide <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> LSF walls. The results showed that the fire performance of calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> walls was similar to that of conventional gypsum plasterboard lined walls, but was superior to that of magnesium oxide <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> walls. The failure criterion of these calcium silicate <b>board</b> <b>lined</b> walls was found to be insulation as opposed to being the integrity failure observed in previous studies...|$|R
