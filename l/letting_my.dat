500|$|On September 16, 2005, Culbreth was {{involved}} in a dispute with pitcher Randy Johnson of the New York Yankees. At the time, the Yankees were contending for a playoff spot. After Johnson expressed his displeasure with some of the umpire's calls on balls and strikes, Culbreth ejected Johnson in the second inning. Johnson said that he was [...] "deeply regretful" [...] and acknowledged, [...] "I was wrong for <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> emotions get away from me." [...] Prior to Johnson's apology, Culbreth was criticized by Yankees announcers John Sterling and Suzyn Waldman, neither of whom was aware of what had been said on the field.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

At 06:01, the fifth salvo by Bismarck, fired at a range of about , was seen to hit Hood abreast her mainmast. It is likely that one [...] shell struck somewhere between Hood's mainmast and 'X' turret aft of the mast. A huge jet of flame burst out from Hood from the vicinity of the mainmast. This was followed by a devastating magazine explosion that destroyed the aft part of the ship. This explosion broke the back of Hood, and she sank in only three minutes, her nearly vertical bow last to descend into the water.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} themes within Lynch's work, leading film critics Le Blanc and Odell {{to state that}} [...] "his films are so packed with motifs, recurrent characters, images, compositions and techniques that you could view his entire output as one large jigsaw puzzle of ideas". One of the key themes that they noted was the usage of dreams and dreamlike imagery and structure within his works, something they related to the [...] "surrealist ethos" [...] of relying [...] "on the subconscious to provide visual drive". This {{can be seen in}} John Merrick's dream of his mother in The Elephant Man, Agent Cooper's dreams of the red room in Twin Peaks and the [...] "dreamlike logic" [...] of the narrative found in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. Discussing his attitude to dreams, Lynch has stated that [...] "Waking dreams {{are the ones that are}} important, the ones that come when I'm quietly sitting in a chair, <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> mind wander. When you sleep, you don't control your dream. I like to dive into a dream world that I've made or discovered; a world I choose... right there is the power of cinema." [...] His films are known for their use of magic realism.|$|E
2500|$|Once, when Jiang Qin was {{stationed}} in Xuancheng County (宣城縣) and was out fighting rebels in Yuzhang Commandery, Xu Sheng, {{who was then the}} Prefect (令) of Wuhu, arrested an officer under Jiang Qin and requested for permission from Sun Quan to have the officer executed. As Jiang Qin was away at that time, Sun Quan denied the request. Xu Sheng had since estranged himself from Jiang Qin. Later, during the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and Lü Meng were put in charge of military discipline. Xu Sheng was constantly worried that Jiang Qin would find fault with him, but, much to his surprise, Jiang praised him instead, and Xu was very impressed by Jiang's virtuous behaviour. Jiang Qin became more highly regarded after this incident. Sun Quan later asked Jiang Qin, [...] "Xu Sheng offended you earlier on, but yet now you praise him. You wish to emulate Qi Xi, don't you?" [...] Jiang Qin replied, [...] "I heard that one should not let his personal feuds affect his official duties. Xu Sheng is loyal and hardworking, possesses both courage and talent, and is capable of leading thousands of troops. Now, we've yet to accomplish our great task, so I should help to scout for and recommend talents to serve the state instead of <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> private problems cloud my judgment." [...] Sun Quan was very pleased.|$|E

The Germans sighted the smoke stacks of two ships at 05:45, which triggered the alarm on Bismarck. Schneider initially reported them as two heavy cruisers. The first British salvo revealed them as battleships, but not until the British task force turned to port were their precise identities revealed. The British ships started firing at the German force at 05:53. Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland planned on targeting Bismarck first, but due to the reversed battle order, Prince of Wales and Hood opened fire on the Prinz Eugen instead. The commander of the Prince of Wales, Captain John Leach, detected this error and directed his guns to fire on Bismarck. The German task force was {{still waiting for the}} order to commence firing. The commander of the German task force, Admiral Lütjens, did not give this order immediately. Two minutes into the battle and after multiple inquiries by Schneider, [...] ""? (Question. Open fire?) an impatient Lindemann responded: [...] ""!. (I'm not <b>letting</b> <b>my</b> ship get shot out from under my arse. Open fire!). This Lindemann quotation is cited by Burkard Freiherr von Müllenheim-Rechberg who at the time was in the after gun director keeping a watch out for Suffolk and Norfolk and listening to Schneider's commands over the gunnery intercom. This conversation most likely was passed down by a surviving crew member who overheard the conversation between Schneider and Lindemann. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg, Lindemann's personnel adjutant, would become the highest-ranking officer to survive the Bismarcks last battle on 27 May 1941. A lot of what we know today about the final days of Bismarck is attributed to his account as a witness.|$|E
