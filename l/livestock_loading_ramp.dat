50|$|The station {{buildings}} {{dated to}} 1890, but interchange of goods traffic between the branch and main line was handled at Wangaratta, six kilometres to the south. In 1927, the station became a three-way junction, when {{the line to}} Peechelba East was opened. Freight facilities included bulk grain storage, <b>livestock</b> <b>loading</b> <b>ramps,</b> and a fertiliser store. Passenger facilities were not provided until 2 February 1891, and was closed to passenger traffic on 1 October 1972. Bowser closed entirely on 13 April 1987, when the line from Everton (the {{last part of the}} Beechworth line) closed. The signal box was abolished during the same year, along with all points and signals, the former grain storage, and the disestablishment of the station as a staff station. Despite the line from Everton closing on 13 April, the standard gauge crossing was dismantled in February of that year. The Peechelba East line had closed a year earlier, in 1986.|$|R
50|$|The station {{building}} that {{stood on the}} platform at Somerville was portable, meaning that it was delivered in sections and bolted together. The building contained an office and a safe working area, from which the staff and ticket system was operated. There was a van shed for small goods and parcels, two waiting rooms, one for the ladies and a general waiting room, and toilets. This building existed until February 1986, when it was replaced with the current aluminium building. In the station yard, {{there was a general}} goods shed, a <b>loading</b> <b>ramp,</b> a crane, and a <b>livestock</b> <b>loading</b> facility. Later, two sidings were built for the Somerville Co-operative Cool Stores.|$|R

50|$|Apart from an {{entrance}} building, {{which was built}} as a typically Saxon rectangular building, a freight shed was built. There was also a <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> and a side <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> for freight transport. A private siding branched off within the station. The station tracks have now been dismantled except for the two main tracks and a crossover.

2500|$|The {{defensive}} armament {{system for}} the USAF's H-3E helicopters is described as standard to the HH-3E, and capable of being fitted as required to the CH-3E. [...] The basic system comprises three M60 machine guns, one each at the forward door, the opposite emergency window, and the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp.</b> The forward two positions comprise pintle mounts on skate rails, while the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> station comprises a pedestal mount on an armored floor plate. The floor plate slides on two tracks, forward and back, to and from its firing position {{at the edge of}} the ramp. Either the standard infantry M60 can be used, with standard 200-round ammunition boxes attached, or the M60D variant, feeding via flexible ammunition chutes from 750-round boxes fixed to the floor (or to the armored floor plate for the rear <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> position).|$|R
40|$|Larvae of Hermetia illucens fly (Linnaeus) is an {{important}} source of alternative protein and can be used as pellets for feeds. Currently the production of H. illucens larvae is still limited because its rearing depends on palm kernel meal. The objective of the research is to explore alternative media for rearing, i. e. using <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> waste from crude palm oil factory. The study was conducted using physical-chemical analysis of the media. Evaluation of potential rearing media of <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> was done by studying the suitability of <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> fermented by EM 4 ®, rumen microbes, and organic liquid fertilizer and without fermentation. Treatment media was develop with an enrichment ratio of 1 : 0. 25, 1 : 05, and 1 : 1 (v/v) for bran and husk, and 1. 25, 2. 5, and 5 % (w/w) for coconut sugar. Each experiment was arranged in complete randomized design using 20 larva of the 2 nd instar. Larvas were incubated in plastic with tube with diameter of 10 cm and 20 cm in height containing of media 300 g. Response differences in growth and mortality were analyzed by ANOVA and least significant differences test at 0. 05 levels. Preference and analysis suitability of the media were conducted using material enrichment. Results show that the <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> waste contain 9. 80 % protein and 10. 32 % fat. Although the media are could support growth and development of the larvae at different degree, media from waste fermentation POC <b>loading</b> <b>ramp</b> with bran enrichment 1 : 0. 5 (v/v) is the best media for rearing larva...|$|R

40|$|I. The {{encoding}} {{of force}} amplitude and force rate by human periodontal mechanoreceptive afferents was studied. Recordings {{were obtained from}} 19 single periodontal afferents in the inferior alveolar nerve {{with the use of}} tungsten microelectrodes. Loads consisting of a force increase (<b>loading</b> <b>ramp),</b> a phase of main-tained force (static phase), and a force decrease (unloading ramp) were applied to the receptor bearing tooth, which was most often an incisor. The static forces applied ranged between 0. 05 and 5 N, and the rate of force applied during the <b>loading</b> <b>ramps</b> ranged between 0. 4 and 70 N/s. The forces were primarily applied in one of six directions (lingual, labial, mesial, distal, upward, or down-ward) that evoked the greatest discharge activity. 2.
