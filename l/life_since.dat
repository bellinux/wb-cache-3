5|$|When Sherwood's {{father died}} in 1795, her family retired from its active social <b>life,</b> <b>since</b> her mother {{preferred}} seclusion, and moved to Bridgnorth, Shropshire. At Bridgnorth Sherwood began writing sentimental novels; in 1802 she sold Margarita for £40 to Mr. Hazard of Bath, and The History of Susan Grey, a Pamela-like novel, for £10. During this time she also taught at a local Sunday school.|$|E

5|$|A {{nephew of}} the last Emperor, Constantine XI, Andreas Palaiologos claimed to have {{inherited}} the title of Byzantine Emperor. He lived in the Morea until its fall in 1460, then escaped to Rome where he lived {{under the protection of}} the Papal States for the remainder of his <b>life.</b> <b>Since</b> the office of emperor had never been technically hereditary, Andreas' claim would have been without merit under Byzantine law. However, the Empire had vanished, and Western states generally followed the Roman-church-sanctioned principles of hereditary sovereignty. Seeking a life in the west, Andreas styled himself Imperator Constantinopolitanus ("Emperor of Constantinople"), and sold his succession rights to both Charles VIII of France and the Catholic Monarchs.|$|E
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human <b>life.</b> <b>Since</b> 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There have been at least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|At 24, she won {{the role}} of the title {{character}} in UPN's drama Veronica Mars, which was launched in the fall of 2004. Created by Rob Thomas, the series starred Bell as the seventeen-year-old anti-establishment high school student/detective. Bell drew on the parallels between the character of Veronica and her own <b>life,</b> <b>since</b> Bell's parents had divorced and her best friend had also died. The series earned acclaim from television critics, as did Bell's performance. Some critics asserted that her performance was overlooked, and deserved consideration for an Emmy Award.|$|E

5|$|David Suzuki: The Autobiography is the 2006 {{autobiography}} of Canadian science writer and broadcaster David Suzuki. The book focuses mostly on his <b>life</b> <b>since</b> the 1987 {{publication of his}} first autobiography, Metamorphosis: Stages in a Life. It begins with a chronological account of his childhood, academic years, and broadcasting career. In later chapters, Suzuki adopts a memoir style, writing about themes such as his relationship with Australia, his experiences in Brazil and Papua New Guinea, {{the founding of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, and his thoughts on climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. Throughout, Suzuki highlights the continuing impact of events from his childhood.|$|E

When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien <b>life</b> <b>since</b> the last time they met.

Cornell admitted to writing his most personal songs ever on this album, influenced by the positive changes in his <b>life</b> <b>since</b> 2002.

5|$|Pacino {{was born}} in the East Harlem {{neighborhood}} of New York City, to Sicilian-American parents Salvatore and Rose (née Gerardi) Pacino. His parents divorced when he was two years old. His mother then took him to The Bronx to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named Corleone. His father, who was from San Fratello of Sicily, moved to Covina, California to work as an insurance salesman and restaurateur, and had not been in his <b>life</b> <b>since</b> then.|$|E

He described the two years following the forced apology as the worst in his life, marked by self-destructive behavior that ultimately led him to disclose his sexual abuse to his wife and seek help. LeMond also described how being a victim of molestation had impacted both his racing career and his <b>life</b> <b>since.</b>|$|E

Mark's name came from having a Nigerian-born father. His parents met while at boarding school in London. His brothers are named Victor and Vincent and his sister is named Special. In high school, he often stayed with his godmother, Jamie Garza, who lived nearer to the school.|$|E
5|$|At the {{prenatal}} and neonatal {{stages of}} life, {{the presence of}} antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother. Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies, and usually appear within {{the first years of}} <b>life.</b> <b>Since</b> antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream, they are said {{to be part of the}} humoral immune system. Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen (an example is a virus capsid protein fragment). Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways: They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway. Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens (helminths, allergens).|$|E

5|$|Characteristic of Marko was his reverence {{and love}} for his mother, Jevrosima; he often sought her advice, {{following}} it even when it contradicted his own desires. She lived with Marko at his mansion in Prilep, his lodestar guiding him away from evil and toward good {{on the path of}} moral improvement and Christian virtues. Marko's honesty and moral courage are noteworthy in a poem in which he was the only person who knew the will of the late Tsar Dušan regarding his heir. Marko refused to lie in favour of the pretenders—his father and uncles. He said truthfully that Dušan appointed his son, Uroš, heir to the Serbian throne. This almost cost him his <b>life,</b> <b>since</b> Vukašin tried to kill him.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with <b>life.</b> <b>Since</b> sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand is a {{developed}} country and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance, such as health, education, economic freedom {{and quality of}} <b>life.</b> <b>Since</b> the 1980s, New Zealand has transformed from an agrarian, regulated economy to a market economy.

Queen Elizabeth II is the country's head of state and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency, which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.
