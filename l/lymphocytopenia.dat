25|$|A general {{increase}} in the number of lymphocytes is known as lymphocytosis, whereas a decrease is known as <b>lymphocytopenia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like neutropenia, {{symptoms}} {{and treatment of}} <b>lymphocytopenia</b> are directed at the underlying cause {{of the change in}} cell counts.|$|E
25|$|Defined as total {{lymphocyte}} count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, <b>lymphocytopenia</b> may be acquired or intrinsic {{and there are}} many causes. This is not a complete list.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} {{disorders}} can cause decreases in {{white blood cell}}s. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called <b>lymphocytopenia</b> or lymphopenia) may be seen.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of helper T cells {{can be seen}} from HIV, a virus that primarily infects CD4+ T cells. In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4+ T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). When the HIV virus is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, continuous therapy can delay the time at which this fall happens. Therapy can also better manage the course of AIDS if and when it occurs. There are other rare disorders such as <b>lymphocytopenia</b> which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4+ T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.|$|E
2500|$|Causes of T cell {{deficiency}} include <b>lymphocytopenia</b> of T cells and/or defects on {{function of}} individual T cells. [...] Complete insufficiency of T cell function {{can result from}} hereditary conditions such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Omenn syndrome, and cartilage–hair hypoplasia. [...] Causes of partial insufficiencies of T cell function include acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and hereditary conditions such as DiGeorge syndrome (DGS), chromosomal breakage syndromes (CBSs), and B-cell and T-cell combined disorders such as ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia</b> is a frequent, {{temporary}} {{result from}} {{many types of}} chemotherapy, such as with cytotoxic agents or immunosuppressive drugs. Some malignancies that have spread to involve the bone marrow, such as leukemia or advanced Hodgkin's disease, also cause <b>lymphocytopenia.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia</b> that {{is caused}} by {{infection}}s tends to resolve once the infection has cleared. Patients with idiopathic CD4+ <b>lymphocytopenia</b> may have either abnormally low but stable CD4+ cell counts, or abnormally low and progressively falling CD4+ cell counts; the latter condition is terminal.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia,</b> but not {{idiopathic}} CD4+ <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> {{is associated}} with corticosteroid use, infections with HIV and other viral, bacterial, and fungal agents, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, severe stress, intense or prolonged physical exercise (due to cortisol release), [...] rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and iatrogenic (caused by other medical treatments) conditions.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia</b> {{caused by}} Feline Leukemia Virus and Feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus retroviral infections is treated with Lymphocyte T-Cell Immune Modulator.|$|E
50|$|Large {{doses of}} radiation, {{such as those}} {{involved}} with nuclear accidents or medical whole body radiation, may cause <b>lymphocytopenia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like neutropenia, {{symptoms}} {{and treatment of}} <b>lymphocytopenia</b> are directed at the underlying cause {{of the change in}} cell counts.|$|E
5000|$|In NK <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> {{there are}} too few natural killer cells, but normal numbers of other lymphocytes. This is very rare.|$|E
5000|$|In T <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> {{there are}} too few T lymphocytes, but normal numbers of other lymphocytes. It causes, and manifests as, a T cell deficiency. This is usually caused by HIV {{infection}} (resulting in AIDS), but may be Idiopathic CD4+ <b>lymphocytopenia</b> (ICL), {{which is a very}} rare heterogeneous disorder defined by CD4+ T-cell counts below 300 cells/μL {{in the absence of any}} known immune deficiency condition, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or chemotherapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia</b> may {{be present}} {{as part of a}} pancytopenia, when the total numbers of all types of blood cells are reduced.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia</b> is {{diagnosed}} when the {{complete blood count}} shows a lymphocyte count lower than the age-appropriate reference interval (for example, below 1.0 x 10(9)/L in an adult).|$|E
50|$|In some cases, <b>lymphocytopenia</b> can {{be further}} {{classified}} according to which kind of lymphocytes are reduced. If all three kinds of lymphocytes are suppressed, then the term is used without further qualification.|$|E
50|$|This {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} an increased susceptibility to disseminated nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, viral infections, especially with human papillomaviruses, and fungal infections, primarily histoplasmosis, and molds. There is profound monocytopenia, B <b>lymphocytopenia</b> and NK <b>lymphocytopenia.</b> Patients have an increased chance of developing malignancies, including: myelodysplasia/leukemia vulvar carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, cervical carcinoma, Bowen disease of the vulva, and multiple Epstein-Barr virus(+) leiomyosarcoma. Patients may also develop pulmonary alveolar proteinosis without mutations in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor or anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies. Last, patients may develop autoimmune phenomena, including lupus like syndromes, primary biliary cirrhosis or aggressive multiple sclerosis.|$|E
50|$|Defined as total {{lymphocyte}} count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, <b>lymphocytopenia</b> may be acquired or intrinsic {{and there are}} many causes. This is not a complete list.|$|E
5000|$|In B <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> {{there are}} too few B lymphocytes, but {{possibly}} normal numbers of other lymphocytes. It causes, and manifests as, a humoral immune deficiency. This is usually caused by medications that suppress the immune system.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects {{reported}} during clinical trials in men receiving 223Ra were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and {{swelling of the}} leg, ankle or foot. The most common abnormalities detected during blood testing were anemia, <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lymphocytopenia,</b> or lymphopenia, is the {{condition}} of having an abnormally low level of lymphocytes in the blood. Lymphocytes are a white blood cell with important functions in the immune system. The opposite is lymphocytosis, which refers to an excessive level of lymphocytes.|$|E
50|$|A {{range of}} {{disorders}} can cause decreases in {{white blood cell}}s. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called neutropenia or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called <b>lymphocytopenia</b> or lymphopenia) may be seen.|$|E
50|$|Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is {{intended}} {{as an aid}} {{in the treatment of}} cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the associated symptoms of <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> opportunistic infection, anemia, granulocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia. The absence of any observed adverse events in several animal species suggests that the product has a very low toxicity profile.|$|E
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the CD4+ cell depletion caused by HIV, in general, patients with idiopathic CD4 <b>lymphocytopenia</b> have a good prognosis. [...] The decline in CD4+ T-cells in patients with ICL is generally slower than that seen in HIV-infected patients. The major risk to people with ICL is unexpected infections, including cryptococcus, atypical mycobacterial and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). The condition may also resolve on its own.|$|E
5000|$|Idiopathic CD4+ <b>lymphocytopenia</b> (ICL) {{is a rare}} medical {{syndrome}} {{in which}} the body has too few CD4+ T lymphocytes, which {{are a kind of}} white blood cell. ICL is sometimes characterized as [...] "HIV-negative AIDS" [...] by AIDS denialists, though in fact its clinical presentation differs from that seen with HIV/AIDS. People with ICL have a weakened immune system and are susceptible to opportunistic infections, although the rate of infections is lower than in people with AIDS.|$|E

50|$|Corticosteroids are {{administered}} through IV or orally. They cause <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> a condition where {{white blood cell}} levels are abnormally low. Corticosteroids cause white blood cell death, lowering their numbers throughout the body. They also cause white blood cells to recirculate away from the area of damage (the retina). This minimizes damage caused by the antibodies produced by the white blood cells. Often, this is treatment is combined with plasmapheresis. Instead of treating the plasma and blood cells, they are replaced with a healthy donor mixture. Patients who respond positively show improved visual fields and an almost complete disappearance of anti-retinal antibodies.|$|E
50|$|Resistance is {{the second}} stage and {{increased}} secretion of glucocorticoids play a major role, intensifying the systemic response—they have lipolytic, catabolic and antianabolic effects: increased glucose, fat and amino acid/protein concentration in blood. Moreover, they cause <b>lymphocytopenia,</b> eosinopenia, neutrophilia and polycythemia. In high doses, cortisol begins {{to act as a}} mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and brings the body to a state similar to hyperaldosteronism. If the stressor persists, it becomes necessary to attempt some means of coping with the stress. Although the body begins to try to adapt to the strains or demands of the environment, the body cannot keep this up indefinitely, so its resources are gradually depleted.|$|E
