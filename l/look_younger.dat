5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character go {{through a series of}} levels of infection of a number of diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Rurouni Kenshin kanzenban, {{published}} in Japan in July 2006, Watsuki included a draft page featuring a redesign of Kenshin's character. To make his X-shaped scar more notable, Watsuki made {{it long enough}} to cross his nose. Kenshin's hair is tied in two tails, which are flowing to make him <b>look</b> <b>younger,</b> and shorter, and less androgynous. Watsuki also added a Habaki to Kenshin's sword {{to make it easier}} to draw by simplifying its structure, while also emphasizing strength. Kenshin's hitokiri look was also redesigned slightly, by making his clothes more worn and giving him Yukishiro Tomoe's neck scarf.|$|E
5|$|She is a {{supporter}} of the United States Democratic Party and the British Labour Party. Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987 she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age, but has stated that she has not had surgery to make her face <b>look</b> <b>younger.</b> During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery.|$|E

25|$|Glitter {{spent the}} next decade mostly as an in-demand live performer, and his back {{catalogue}} of recordings proved durable enough for several compilations to be successfully released. He appeared in billboard and poster advertisements for British Rail, in one {{of which he was}} shown attempting to <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> in order to obtain a Young Persons Railcard. He also released a new studio album Leader II in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Simulated child {{pornography}} produced without the direct involvement {{of children in}} the production process itself includes modified photographs of real children, non-minor teenagers made to <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> (age regression), and fully computer-generated imagery or adults made to look like children. Drawings or animations that depict sexual acts involving children but are not intended to look like photographs may also be regarded as {{child pornography}}.|$|E
25|$|Halfway to Sanity is {{the tenth}} studio album by American punk band the Ramones. It was {{released}} on September 15, 1987 by Sire Records and was produced by Daniel Rey. Recording sessions began in April 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, and the band began recording instruments before vocals as a method to learn songs more quickly. Band members tended to disagree on many things at this time, and Rey described them to be impatient. The album's front cover was shot by previous Ramones' photographer George DuBose in Chinatown, New York City. The short lasted session resulted in a dimly lit album cover which guitarist Johnny Ramone said was good because it helped make them <b>look</b> <b>younger.</b> The band toured around the world following the album's release, but certain show dates were cancelled after drummer Richie Ramone left the band due to financial conflicts with the band. Clem Burke of Blondie was hired as Elvis Ramone to fill the drummer's spot for two shows, then was replaced the band's ex-member Marky Ramone, and the tour would continue with him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: After {{traveling}} from outer space, the elder twin <b>looks</b> <b>younger</b> than his brother {{waiting on the}} earth based on the calculation from the formula of Special Relativity. There is no absolute reference coordinate in the universe. Theoretically, the younger twin could describe the motion of his brother flying forward, vice versa, the elder twin could describe the motion of his brother flying backward. If the younger twin felt his brother <b>looking</b> <b>younger,</b> the older twin should also felt his brother <b>looking</b> <b>younger.</b> It is hard to comprehend that in reality the elder twin actually <b>looks</b> <b>younger</b> than the younger twin. The motion of an object described in a three-dimension space-time frame by embedding time into space could be drawn using the graph-command of MATLAB. It leads a better understanding the paradox of twins based on the calculation from the graphic method in the 3 -d s-t frame. 1...|$|R
500|$|The {{production}} team created several new sets {{to represent the}} space station itself, as well as re-using some from [...] "Borderland" [...] to represent the Klingon starship. The make-up team were required to make Brent Spiner <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> for flashbacks and to show the progression of a character's exposure {{to a number of}} pathogens. The story-arc has been considered one of the best seen in Enterprise, and critics praised [...] "Cold Station 12", specifically for the special effects and character development, but felt that the death scene crossed the line. On first broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.1 percent of the population according to Nielsen ratings, placing it in fifth position for the timeslot.|$|E
500|$|Nomura was {{responsible}} for the character designs, which changed much of the look and style of Yoshitaka Amano's illustrations. Working in the Final Fantasy and Final Fantasy IX designs brought no difficulties since in for the former game, Nomura based his designs on Amano's illustrations while he had already been involved in handling his illustrations in the latter. On the other hand, Nomura had difficulties making Onion Knight as it ended being too cartoony and requested advice from Amano. Nomura's own original illustrations were also redesigned for Dissidia; Nomura commented to the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu that Tidus was designed to <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> than he was in Final Fantasy X to [...] "match the design touch {{of the rest of the}} Dissidia" [...] cast.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Bollywood Hungama, Chopra was quoted saying [...] "when people play multiple characters, they have structures, they are {{from different parts of}} the world, sometimes they are a twenty-year-old and then become a forty-year-old in the same film, some with eyes small, etc. I have no clutches [...] All the girls I play in the film are in the age group of eighteen and twenty-four." [...] Additionally, she found playing the Capricorn girl, a teenager, very tough, saying: [...] "To play a 15-year-old girl without make-up or special effects to make me <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> was the most challenging role for me. I had to look fifteen years old just through my body language. I didn't want any of the twelve girls to be caricatures." [...] Chopra also read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs and Love Signs to prepare for the parts. Initially, it was planned to film one character at a time, however, that did not happen.|$|E

500|$|The plan to {{eliminate}} the Syndicate and relaunch the series' mythology {{in a new direction}} was originally conceived in September 1998. Director Kim Manners stated [...] "I've said for years that the show really resolved itself, if you will, by accident. The whole story line of the Syndicate and the bees and the aliens and the chips in the neck, they all seemed to just accidentally fall into place and create an intriguing, mysterious storyline that eventually got so mysterious and so intriguing that Chris had to blow it up, because he couldn't deal with it anymore." [...] The original script featured various flashback sequences to the actors Peter Donat, William B. Davis and Veronica Cartwright, all from scenes around twenty-to-thirty years earlier in the show. They did various makeup jobs on the actors to make them <b>look</b> <b>younger.</b> However, the writers eventually {{came to the conclusion that}} it [...] "just didn't [...] work", so they cut out most of that storyline, which ultimately led to the creation of a whole new direction in which the Cigarette Smoking Man provided a monologue explaining the history of the project instead. The first scene was shot in Long Beach, California.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to <b>look</b> <b>younger.</b> Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some people would say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge because I was so used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E
2500|$|.....since 1800, the U.S. Census {{generally}} shows {{far more}} 39-year-olds than 40-year-olds. Furthermore, the costume of men switched from a design clearly {{intended to make}} the young look older to one that was clearly intended to make the old <b>look</b> <b>younger.</b> [...] For example, this era saw {{the decline of the}} wig {{and the rise of the}} toupée.|$|E

2500|$|... "So here is Michelle's third solo album, {{though the}} first since the ending of Destiny's Child. After {{previously}} showing her gospel colours, she has come full circle back to what Destiny's Child has become well known for: smooth and glossy R songs with a dance edge, laced with lyrics about relationships (such as the opener [...] "Hello Heartbreak"), parties ("We Break The Dawn") and teen love (for example, hear the closing song [...] "Too Young For Love"). Though the production quality is undoubtedly extremely high, the lyrical focus {{will be a big}} disappointment to anyone looking for some gospel inspiration. The teen girl audience would appear to be the target once again, and much digital trickery has been brought into play to help Michelle sound (and <b>look)</b> <b>younger.</b> It's a great R pop record musically, but with songs such as [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] and [...] "Hungover" [...] it's unexpectedly shallow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, on {{the other}} hand, thought it was [...] "the best of the recent {{roadshow}} musicals... Since The Sound of Music, musicals have been... long, expensive, weighed down with unnecessary production values and filled with pretension... Finian's Rainbow is an exception... it knows exactly where it's going, and is getting there as quickly and with {{as much fun as}} possible... it is the best-directed musical since West Side Story. It is also enchanting, and that's a word I don't get to use much... it is so good, I suspect, because Astaire was willing to play it as the screenplay demands... he... created this warm old man... and played him wrinkles and all. Astaire is pushing 70, after all, and no effort was made to make him <b>look</b> <b>younger</b> with common tricks of lighting, makeup and photography. That would have been unnecessary: He has a natural youthfulness. I particularly want to make this point because of the cruel remarks on Astaire's appearance in the New York Times review by Renata Adler. She is mistaken." ...|$|E
