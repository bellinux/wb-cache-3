40|$|With {{the advent}} of intra ocular lens {{implantation}} {{at the time of}} cataract extraction, especially by intracapsular method, it has become very important to prevent the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> during surgery. This can be achieved by lowering the intraocular pressure by various methods. In order to find out the best method to achieve a soft &#x 0026;amp; safe eye before surgery, a study was conducted on 90 patients, undergoing intracapsular cataract extraction. The patients were divided into 9 groups of 10 each, &#x 0026;amp; different methods of lowering intraocular pressure were tried and results compared.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} vitreous gel structure after lens extirpation combined with anterior vitrectomy in rabbit eyes. METHODS: Twenty-eight chinchilla rabbits were divided into three groups. The control group (Group I) included 16 eyes from eight rabbits who did not receive any treatment. Group II included 20 eyes from 10 rabbits that underwent lens aspiration only. Group III included 20 eyes from 10 rabbits that underwent lens aspiration combined with posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy. Eyes were harvested on the 30 th and 60 th day postoperatively, respectively. Changes in vitreous gel stretch length due to gravity and the rate <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> liquefaction were observed. The collagen content in the vitreous body was examined using the L-hydroxyproline test. Electronic microscopic images were obtained from each eyeball. RESULTS: On both the 30 th and 60 th day postoperatively, the <b>vitreous</b> gel length <b>of</b> group III was significantly shorter than group I and group II (P< 0. 05), while the rate of liquefaction <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> body in group III {{was significantly higher than}} group I and group II (P< 0. 05). The collagen content in group III was also higher than that in group I and group II (P< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: <b>Loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> gel mass is more likely to occur in the eyes of rabbits receiving anterior vitrectomy. Lensectomy combined with anterior vitrectomy may damage the stable three-dimensional mesh structure of collagen, which could aggravate vitreous gel liquefaction...|$|R
40|$|The {{traumatic}} cataract {{constitutes a}} challenge for the surgeon of the previous segment. It can be presented {{as a consequence of}} any type of ocular trauma or -penetrating traumatism with bigger frequency correlated to corneal injuries that they can implicate the iris. It was made a descriptive retrospective observacional study of all of the patients with this diagnosis who went to Oftalmology's consultation during the period of 1 ro of January 2005 to September 30, 2009 at Sancti Spíritus's Hospital General, with the objective to describe the surgical treatment results of it with the implantation of intraocular lens and the most frequent complications of traumatic cataract. The population and sample was: 14 patients, totality. Datas were processed in tables and inferential statistics. In 85. 7 % of patients were implanted intraocular lens, and it was used Blumenthal's surgical technique. The more frequent trans-operative complication was the <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> and the more frequent postoperative complications were the moderate corneal edema and the ocular hypertension.

40|$|Acute {{vitreous}} haemorrhage {{presents to}} the patient as a sudden onset of black spots, followed by rapid clouding of vision as the blood disperses through the media.

40|$|Retinal {{detachment}} {{results in}} visual loss and requires surgical treatment. The risk of retinal detachment depends, among other factors, on the vitreous rheology, which varies with age. To date, the viscoelasticity <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> body {{has only been}} measured in cadaver eyes. However, the ex vivo and in vivo viscoelasticity may differ {{as a result of}} the effect of intravitreal membranes. Therefore, an MRI method and appropriate postprocessing tools were developed to determine the vitreous deformation and viscoelastic properties in the eyes of living humans. Nineteen subjects (eight women and 11 men; mean age, 33 [*]years; age range, 14 - 62 [*]years) gazed at a horizontal sinusoidal moving target during the segmented acquisition of complementary spatial modulation of magnetization images. The center of the lens and the scleral insertion of the optic nerve defined the imaging plane. The vitreous deformation was tracked with a dedicated algorithm and fitted with the commonly used viscoelastic model to determine the model parameters: the modified Womersley number a and the phase angle b. The vitreous deformation was successfully quantified in all 17 volunteers having a monophasic vitreous. The mean and standard deviation of the model parameters were determined to be 5. 5 [*]±[*] 1. 3 for a and - 2. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 2 for b. The correlation coefficient (- 0. 76) between a and b was significant. At the eye movement frequency used, the mean storage and <b>loss</b> moduli <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> were around 3 [*]±[*] 1 [*]hPa. For two subjects, the vitreous deformation was clearly polyphasic: some compartments <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> were gel-like and others were liquefied. The borders of these compartments corresponded to reported intravitreal membrane patterns. Thus, the deformation <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> can now be determined in situ, leaving the structure of the intravitreal membranes intact. Their effect on vitreous dynamics challenges actual vitreous viscoelastic models. The determination <b>of</b> the <b>vitreous</b> deformation will aid in the quantification <b>of</b> local <b>vitreous</b> stresses and their correlation with retinal detachment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vitreous {{haemorrhage}} {{is one of}} {{the causes}} <b>of</b> visual <b>loss</b> and arises from a number of risk factors. This study aims to expose the causes <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> haemorrhage in our environment and evaluate the pattern <b>of</b> visual <b>loss.</b> Methods: A 3 year retrospective review of medical records of patients presenting in the outpatient clinic of the eye department in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital was carried out between 2007 and 2009. Demographic data and causative factors <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> hemorrhage were amongst the information culled from the records and analysed.

40|$|Purpose. To {{compare the}} stages <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> {{degeneration}} {{in patients with}} vitreomacular traction (VMT) and macular holes (MH). Methods. A retrospective study was performed analyzing stages <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> degeneration <b>of</b> eyes with VMT or MH using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). An analogous review was performed on a control group of eyes with contralateral posterior vitreous detachments. Thirty-four eyes with VMT/MH and 39 control eyes were reviewed. Results. Twenty-seven VMT/MH eyes and 31 control eyes were included.

40|$|Abstract: Vitreous {{constitutes}} about 80 % of {{the volume}} of the human eye. It is an extended extracellular matrix that is composed of collagen, hyaluronan, and other extracellular matrix molecules, but mostly water. In both health as well as disease, especially diabetic retinopathy (DR), special attention should be drawn to the posterior vitreous cortex and its re-lation to the retinal surface. The important role <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> in the pathogenesis of proliferative DR has already been dem-onstrated by several experimental and clinical studies. Thus, vitreoretinal separation by pharmacologic vitreolysis and/or removal by surgical means are appropriate approaches to interrupt the pathogenic contribution <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> and prevent progression of diabetic retinopathy to more advanced stages. This review describes various aspects of the molecular mor-phology and structural anatomy <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> and the vitreoretinal interface, as well as the role <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> in the patho-physiology of DR. Lastly, this treatise provides a comprehensive analysis <b>of</b> novel <b>vitreous</b> modulators for pharmacologic vitreolysis in the treatment of DR. Microplasmin is currently the most promising approach to treat vitreoretinal traction by pharmacologic vitreolysis...|$|R

40|$|AIMS To {{demonstrate}} the potential use of in vitro poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles {{in comparison with}} triamcinolone suspension to aid visualisation <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> during anterior and posterior vitrectomy. METHODS PLGA microparticles (diameter 10 - 60 microm) were fabricated using single and/or double emulsion technique(s) and used untreated or following the surface adsorption of a protein (transglutaminase). Particle size, shape, morphology and surface topography were assessed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and compared with a standard triamcinolone suspension. The efficacy of these microparticles to enhance visualisation <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> against the triamcinolone suspension was assessed using an in vitro set-up exploiting porcine vitreous. RESULTS Unmodified PLGA microparticles failed to adequately adhere to porcine vitreous and were readily washed out by irrigation. In contrast, modified transglutaminase-coated PLGA microparticles demonstrated a significant improvement in adhesiveness and were comparable to a triamcinolone suspension {{in their ability to}} enhance the visualisation <b>of</b> <b>vitreous.</b> This adhesive behaviour also demonstrated selectivity by not binding to the corneal endothelium. CONCLUSION The use of transglutaminase-modified biodegradable PLGA microparticles represents a novel method <b>of</b> visualising <b>vitreous</b> and aiding vitrectomy. This method may provide a distinct alternative for the visualisation <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> whilst eliminating the pharmacological effects of triamcinolone acetonide suspension...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} residentûs {{phacoemulsification}} learning curve as {{a risk factor}} for vitreous loss and to determine the incidence <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>loss</b> among the residents performing phacoemulsification. Design: Retrospective matched case-control study Material and Method: A case-control study comparing all consecutive cases of attempted phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation from January 1 st, 1998 to December 31 st, 1999. The surgeon variable will be categorized into two groups, the third year ophthalmology residents, representing residentûs phacoemulsification learning curve, and faculty staffs. The study group consisted of eyes that had had intra-operative complication <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>loss.</b> The control group consisted of eyes that had not had vitreous loss. Continuous variables were compared with the 2 -sided unpaired t-test. Categorical variables were compared between groups using analytical matched case-control study with relative risk or odd ratio, Mc Nemarûs (Marginal) o ^ 2 test and 95 % confident interval of relative risk. Results: The odds that the eyes in the resident group would have an intraoperative complication <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>loss</b> were 4 times the odds that the eyes in the faculty staff group would have such complication (P = 0. 0052, 95 % confidential interval (CI) of relative risk (RR) = 1. 516 - 10. 556). The incidence <b>of</b> <b>vitreous</b> <b>loss</b> among residents was 6. 93 % (28 / 404) and 2. 06 % (28 / 1358) among the faculty staffs.
