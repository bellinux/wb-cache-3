5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the south {{half of the}} <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> became part of NY221, a new route extending from NY38 at Harford Mills to US11 {{in the village of}} Marathon. NY221 was extended east to its current eastern terminus in Willet by the following year. The portion of the route between the Harford <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> and Willet utilized a highway added to the state highway system sometime after 1926. NY221 was rerouted to follow its current alignment to the hamlet of Harford in the mid-1930s, and its former routing to Harford Mills was redesignated as NY200 in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota {{contains}} two National Scenic Byways. The Peter Norbeck National Scenic Byway {{is in the}} Black Hills, while the Native American Scenic Byway runs along the Missouri River in the north-central part of the state. Other scenic byways include the Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, the Spearfish Canyon Scenic Byway, and the Wildlife <b>Loop</b> <b>Road</b> Scenic Byway.|$|E
5|$|However, the 2000s housing bubble {{that drove}} {{significant}} growth of Poinciana collapsed and Avatar {{was unable to}} justify the costs or finance construction of the highway. Around 2010, Avatar decided not to build the highway {{while at the same}} time, the state established the Osceola County Expressway Authority (OCX) to develop and built a series of toll road segments in Osceola County. The 2040 Master Plan developed by OCX has a loop route around the south and east sides of the Kissimmee-St.Cloud area. The Poinciana Parkway is a natural part of the proposed <b>loop</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E

5|$|Just outside Athol Springs, NY75 passes {{under two}} {{railroad}} bridges, carrying the Norfolk Southern Railway-owned Lake Erie District {{line and the}} CSX Transportation-owned Lake Shore Subdivision line over the highway. On {{the other side of}} the overpasses, NY75 curves northeastward as it becomes Saint Francis Drive, leaving Camp Road to continue northwestward to the lake as a two-lane street. The route continues on, passing south of Saint Francis High School before ending shortly afterward at a partial interchange with NY5. NY75 northbound merges directly into NY5 eastbound, a limited-access highway, while NY75 southbound begins as an offshoot of NY5 westbound. The remaining connections are made by way of a <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> leading from Big Tree Road, which NY5 and NY75 both intersect just south of the interchange.|$|E
5|$|Mug House {{is located}} on Wetherill Mesa; it {{contains}} 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House {{is one of the}} stops on the Mesa Top <b>Loop</b> <b>Road</b> driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} New York assumed {{maintenance}} of two highways linking the hamlets of Harford and Harford Mills—one directly connecting {{the two and}} a second, more circuitous route to the east—in the early 20th century. The direct route {{and most of the}} <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> were improved to state highway standards as part of a project contracted out on October16, 1914, and were added to the state highway system on December10, 1915, as State Highway1075 (SH1075). Each end of SH1075 connected to the segment of the loop route between modern NY38 and Owego Hill Road, which was rebuilt as part of an earlier project awarded on September19, 1906, and included in the state highway system on July5, 1908, as SH379. Both designations are unsigned and used only for inventory purposes.|$|E

25|$|Just {{north of}} Droney Road, PA 823 {{continued}} northward into {{the limits of}} the borough of Lewis Run. The highway then headed to the northwest, changing its name to Laffayette Avenue. After crossing into Lewis Run, there was an intersection with an unnamed <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> and with Valley Hunt Road, a dead-end highway. The route then turned to the northeast, intersecting with a few more local roads, and terminated at an intersection with US 219 in the northern borough limits of Lewis Run.|$|E
25|$|The {{local road}} network was also massively {{improved}} during the 1960s and 1970s. West Bromwich {{is at the}} extreme northern end of the M5 motorway, and has had direct access to it since the early 1960s. This gave the town an immediate fast road link to faraway places including Worcester, Gloucester, Bristol and Exeter. Traffic passing through West Bromwich on the main route from Wolverhampton to Birmingham was diverted along the new dual carriageway, the Northern <b>Loop</b> <b>Road</b> (also known as The Expressway), after its opening in 1972, with another dual carriageway being built to link The Expressway with neighbouring Oldbury.|$|E

Leeds {{is one of the}} principal hubs of the northern motorway network. Additionally, there is an urban motorway network; the radial M621 takes traffic into central Leeds from the M62 and M1. There is an Inner Ring Road with part motorway status and an Outer Ring Road. Part of the city centre is pedestrianised, and is encircled by the clockwise-only <b>Loop</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Sneinton Dragon {{is a large}} {{sculpture}} {{that stands}} at the junction of Colwick <b>Loop</b> <b>Road</b> and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from stainless steel, it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what {{they would like to}} see as a piece of public art to represent their area. It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the Christmas period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There also are three other sculptures in Sneinton.|$|E
25|$|The main High Street {{through the}} village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the {{residential}} streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the Second Boer War. Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and {{to the west and}} south by the A612 road (Manvers Street and Colwick <b>Loop</b> <b>Road)</b> which runs from Nottingham to Newark-on-Trent. The railway to Netherfield and Grantham runs through Sneinton but it has not had a station since the Racecourse station shut in 1959. The Nottingham Suburban Railway connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with Daybrook, but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. Tramlines once ran down Carlton Road.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{campground}} loops designated A, B, and C that contain 28, 48, and 55 campsites respectively. Loop A {{was built by}} the CCC in 1936, and has campsites on the outer perimeter of the loop with a grassy communal area in the center. Sites are separated by thick vegetation. Loops B and C {{were built in the}} 1970s with campsites located {{on both sides of the}} <b>loop</b> <b>roads</b> and no vegetation.|$|R
25|$|Graduations {{take place}} at Alumni Park, a broad expanse of lawn {{overlooking}} Pacific Coast Highway and the Pacific Ocean. The main academic plaza for undergraduate programs of Seaver College lies just above Alumni Park and includes Stauffer Chapel, Tyler Campus Center, Payson Library, and the Ahmanson Fine Arts Center. Undergraduate housing and athletic facilities sit to the north/northwest of the academic complex. The Law School exists even higher above these areas. The central campus {{is surrounded by a}} <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> consisting of Seaver Drive, Huntsinger Circle, and John Tyler Drive. Banowsky Boulevard separates Alumni Park from the main academic complex and is named in honor of William S. Banowsky, the 4th president of Pepperdine.|$|E
25|$|The route {{continues}} northward into Blauvelt, {{where it}} {{runs along the}} western border of Clausland Mountain County Park, Blauvelt State Park, and other town parks. While in Blauvelt, NY303 briefly overlaps with CR11, a mostly parallel county route that veers west to avoid the state park. Past CR11, NY303 proceeds north into the town of Clarkstown and the hamlet of Central Nyack, home to NY303's interchange with NY59. After the junction, NY303 passes Palisades Center and intersects the New York State Thruway (I-87 and I-287) at exit12, a modified partial cloverleaf interchange located adjacent to the mall. The south half of the interchange utilizes the <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> surrounding Palisades Center while the north half uses part of Snake Hill Road.|$|E
25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column stacked up, almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in {{at this point in the}} battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their stacked up and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded <b>loop</b> <b>road</b> that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E
