40|$|Intestinal barrier {{function}} in pigs <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> is almost exclusively determined in terminal experiments with Ussing chambers. Alternatively, the recovery in urine of orally administered lactulose {{can be used}} to assess intestinal permeability in living animals. This experiment was designed to study the {{barrier function}} of the small intestine of pigs over time <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> The aim was to relate paracellular barrier function (measured by lactulose recovery in the urine) with macromolecular transport [measured by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) using Ussing chambers] and bacterial translocation to assess whether lactulose recovery is related to possible causes of infection and disease. Forty gonadectomized male pigs (6. 7 ± 0. 6 kg) were weaned (d 0) at a mean age of 19 d, fitted with urine collection bags, and individually housed. Pigs were dosed by oral gavage with a marker solution containing lactulose (disaccharide) and the monosaccharides l-rhamnose, 3 -O-methylglucose, and d-xylose at 2 h and at 4, 8, and 12 d <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> The recovery of sugars in the urine was determined over 18 h after each oral gavage. The day after each permeability test, the intestines of 10 pigs were dissected to determine bacterial translocation to the mesenteric lymph nodes and jejunal permeability for HRP in Ussing chambers. Recovery of l-rhamnose in urine was affected by feed intake and by the time <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (P = 0. 05). Recovery of lactulose from the urine was greater (P = 0. 05) at 4, 8, and 12 d <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> compared with the first day <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> and was negatively correlated with feed intake (r = - 0. 63, P = 0. 001). The mean translocation of aerobic bacteria to the mesenteric lymph nodes was greater at 5 and 13 d <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> compared with d 1 (P = 0. 05). Lactulose recovery showed no correlation with permeability for HRP nor with bacterial translocation (P > 0. 05).

40|$|Under {{commercial}} conditions, weaning of piglets {{is associated}} with social, environmental and dietary stress. Consequently, small-intestinal barrier and absorptive functions deteriorate {{within a short time}} <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Most studies that have assessed small-intestinal permeability in pigs <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> used either Ussing chambers or orally administered marker probes. Paracellular barrier function and active absorption decrease when pigs are weaned at 3 weeks of age or earlier. However, when weaned at 4 weeks of age or later, the barrier function is less affected, and active absorption is not affected or is increased. Weaning stress is a critical factor in relation to the compromised paracellular barrier function <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Adequate feed intake levels <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> prevent the loss of the intestinal barrier function.

Trial A was carried out in an experimental unit to investigate the effects of age (from 12 to 147 days of age), weaning (at 21 or 28 days of age) and management at weaning (in optimal (OC) or deteriorated (DC) conditions) on those parameters. Trial B was performed in 16 commercial pig farms to describe the variability of these indicators on field between 26 and 75 days of age.

40|$|The aims of {{the present}} study were (a) to {{maintain}} the structure and function of the small intestine of the piglet <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> and (b) to compare the capacity In vivo of sucking and weaned piglets to digest oral boluses of lactose and sucrose and absorb their monosaccharide products. Piglets were fed on cows' whole milk Ad libitum every 2 h for 5 d <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Physiological doses of lactose plus fructose (treatment LAC+FRU) and sucrose plus galactose (treatment SUC+GAL) were administered on day 27 of lactation and on the fifth day <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> <b>after</b> which time piglets were killed. Villus height and crypt depth were maintained (P > 0. 05) by feeding cows' milk <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> The areas under the curves (AUC) for galactose and glucose, adjusted for live weight and plasma volume, increased (P < 0. 05) <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Despite the enhancement of gut function <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> the galactose index (Gall: AUC for galactose ingested as lactose divided by the AUC for the same dose of galactose ingested as the monosaccharide) and fructose index (FruI: AUC for fructose ingested as sucrose divided by the AUC for the same dose of fructose ingested as the monosaccharide), which are indices of digestive and absorptive efficiency, both decreased <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> This apparent anomaly may be reconciled by increased growth, and hence surface area, of the small intestine between weaning and slaughter such that 'total' digestion and absorption most probably increased despite apparent decreases in Gall and FruI, Positive correlations (P < 0. 05) between villus height and Gall are consistent, with the maximum activity of lactase occurring more apically along the villus, Significant linear relationships (P < 0. 05) were recorded between villus height at the proximal jejunum and adjusted AUC for galactose and glucose following treatment LAC+FRU, and between villus height at the proximal jejunum and adjusted glucose AUC following treatment SUC+GAL, These relationships suggest that maximum digestion and absorption occurs at increasing distances along the crypt:villus axis in the weaned pig...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} different pre-weaning interventions on performance, aspects of behaviour, and selected neuroendocrine, inflammatory and immune indices in 593 weanling pigs (59 litters, weaning age 22 ± 1. 7). Measurements were taken at various time points two weeks before and <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Sugar absorption tests (20 % mannitol and 20 % galactose solutions) {{were used to assess}} gastrointestinal tract (GIT) absorptive capacity. One week before weaning, litters were either co-mingled (CoM) for 8 h daily with another litter or not co-mingled (NoCoM). Half of the litters were also subjected to intermittent suckling (IS) involving separation from their sow for 8 h daily and the other half remained with their sow (NoIS). Hence, four treatments were produced in a 2 × 2 factorial design; (1) CoM IS (n = 16 litters), (2) CoM NoIS (n = 14 litters), (3) NoCoM IS (n = 16 litters), (4) NoCoM NoIS (n = 13 litters). Measurements are compared within each of the main effects (CoM or IS) unless otherwise stated. Acute weaning stress was evidenced by increases in cortisol, haptoglobin and N: L ratios when data were combined (P < 0. 001). However, there were tendencies (P < 0. 1) for lower cortisol in IS pigs and higher N: L ratios in CoM pigs at weaning. While CoM did not affect performance before weaning, growth (P < 0. 05), feed intake (P < 0. 05) and body weight (P < 0. 05) were reduced in CoM pigs 7 – 14 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> One week of IS before weaning improved feed intake before weaning (P < 0. 01), resulting in better growth (P = 0. 01) and a tendency (P < 0. 1) for a higher feed intake 2 – 7 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Co-mingled piglets had more scratches 4 days before weaning (P < 0. 001), but tended to have fewer scratches 2 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (P < 0. 1). Pigs exposed to either IS or CoM displayed more sleeping behaviour the day <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (P < 0. 01 and P < 0. 001). A higher mannitol absorption was evident in CoM NoIS pigs 3 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (P < 0. 01), and galactose absorption was reduced in IS pigs 3 days before weaning (P < 0. 05) and tended to be reduced 3 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (P < 0. 1), likely reflecting a GIT adaptive response. Overall, despite improvements in mannitol absorption and behaviour, there was no beneficial effect of CoM on performance <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Alternatively, IS improved behaviour and performance during the first week <b>after</b> <b>weaning...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the interrelationships between sex, weaning age, and weaning weight on aspects of physiological and gastrointestinal development in pigs. Forty-eight Large White x Landrace pigs were used in a factorial arrangement with the respective factors being: age at weaning (14 or 28 days), weight at weaning (heavy or light), sex (boar or gilt), and time <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (1, 7, and 14 days). At weaning, 48 pigs were removed from the sow; 16 pigs were then fasted for 24 h before euthanasia for determination of organ weights, gut histology, and enzymology, and 32 pigs were offered a high quality pelleted weaner diet ad libitum for subsequent assessment of organ weights, histology, and enzymology at 7 and 14 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> On Day 6 and 13 <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> 2 pigs from each group had their feed removed, and 24 h later were euthanased and similar measurements were taken. In general, the data highlighted the overall gastrointestinal underdevelopment of pigs weaned at 2 weeks of age and of pigs weaned light-for-age at either 2 or 4 weeks. Heavier body organs, gastrointestinal organs, and accessory digestive organs observed <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> except for the spleen, presumably reflected the increase in substrates available for cellular growth as feed intake increased <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> and the development of organs required to process this feed. Interestingly, the relative weights (% of liveweight) of the stomach and small intestine and, to a lesser extent, the caecum and colon, were greater in the light, 14 -day-old weaned pigs, but these differences diminished with increasing time <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> Consistent effects due to age, weight, and sex were not observed for villous height and crypt depth, or for the specific activities of the brush-border and pancreatic enzymes measured. However, increases (P < 0. 001) in the activities of maltase (P < 0. 001), glucoamylase (P < 0. 001), and sucrase (P = 0. 020) (all expressed per gram of mucosa), and that of trypsin (per gram of pancreas), occurred by 14 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> This most likely reflected the inducible nature of these enzymes in response to the increasing intake of substrates provided in the diet. In contrast, the specific activity of lactase declined (P = 0. 012) in the first 14 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> These data suggest that pigs weaned at 2 weeks of age and pigs weaned light-for-age at either 2 or 4 weeks have a less developed gastrointestinal tract, and that its development <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> might proceed differently to that of pigs weaned older and heavier.

40|$|An {{intestinal}} perfusion {{technique was}} used to measure the effects of supplementary feeding (experiment 1) and temporary weaning (experiment 2) during the sucking period on the net absorption of fluid, sodium, chloride and potassium from the small intestine of pigs <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> The technique was also applied to control pigs which did not receive supplementary feed and were not temporarily weaned during the sucking period. Paired intestinal segments were prepared at five sites along the small intestine in each of 80 pigs in experiment 1 and 36 pigs in experiment 2. The cranial segment of each pair was infected with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). In both experiments, four days <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> the net absorption of fluid, sodium and chloride in the uninfected segments was in general significantly less in all the pigs than at weaning or seven, 11 and 14 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> and it was significantly greater in the pigs given supplementary feed than in the other pigs. Net absorption values in the infected segments of the control pigs were less four days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> than on the day of weaning. No differences were Found between pigs that were temporarily weaned or not and those that were not fed during the sucking period. Supplementary feeding during the sucking period partially prevented the decrease of net absorption usually observed <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> in uninfected and in ETEC-infected segments of intestine...|$|R
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine whether pyridoxine or thiamine needs {{to be added to}} the diet for weanling pigs. In the first trial, weanling pigs were fed either a control diet or diets containing added thiamin (2. 5 or 5. 0 g/ton) or pyridoxine (3. 5 or 7. 0 g/ton). From d 0 to 14 <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> pigs fed added pyridoxine had increased ADG and ADFI, with pigs fed 3. 5 g/ton of added pyridoxine having the greatest response. Growth performance was not improved by added thiamin. In a second trial, weanling pigs were fed a control diet or diets containing 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 g/ton added pyridoxine. From d 0 to 14 <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> increasing pyridoxine increased ADG and ADFI, with pigs fed 3 g/ton of added pyridoxine having the greatest ADG. Pyridoxine level had no influence on growth performance from d 14 to 35 <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> These results suggest that adding between 2 and 3 g/ton of pyridoxine to the diet maximizes ADG and ADFI from d 0 to 14 <b>after</b> <b>weaning...</b>|$|R
40|$|The low {{nutrient}} intake shortly <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> is a {{major cause}} of post-weaning problems. Feed intake <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> is strongly related to feed intake during lactation. Feed intake during lactation, however, varies considerably between litters. We hypothesised that prenatal and postnatal exposure to certain flavours would increase the intake of feed containing the same flavours pre- and postweaning. Multiparous sows did (n = 17) or did not (n = 14) receive 50 g garlic granulate/powder and 25 g aniseed as daily additive to their diet during the last month of gestation and during lactation. From day 14 of lactation, litters were submitted to intermittent suckling: 12 h separation form the sow each day. During lactation, all litters had 40 g garlic and 20 g aniseed per kg added to their creep feed. <b>After</b> <b>weaning,</b> half of the litters had no additive in their diet. Piglets were weaned at 4 weeks (13 litters) or at 6 weeks (18 litters). At 6 weeks of lactation, litters of which the dam received the flavour in her diet, had a higher feed intake (309 ± 43 vs 233 ± 35 g/p/d) than litters of dams without the flavour, although the difference was not significant. Sow diet had no effect on postweaning feed intake, but postweaning piglet diet did. Late (week 6) weaned litters receiving the flavoured feed had a higher feed intake from 3 to 10 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> (833 ± 38 vs 687 ± 58 g/p/d). Weight gain during the first 10 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> was not affected by sow or pig diets. Feed intake and weight gain shortly <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> were strongly related to feed intake during lactation (overall R = 0. 64, P < 0. 05 and R = 0. 77, P < 0. 05). We conclude that early experience with flavours increases later acceptance and improves adaptation to post weaning conditions...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{progesterone}} {{levels were}} determined three days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> in 151 sows Landrace x Large White. Furthermore, {{the influence of}} bromocriptine (Parlodel, Sandoz) was studied on the resumption of ovarian activity in 19 sows during the hot season. An increased progesterone base-line level was shown during the June-July-August period as compared with May and September-October. No correlation was found between progesterone levels {{and the percentage of}} sows which returned to estrus 10 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning</b> except when progesterone levels reached and exceeded 0. 9 ng/ml; in this case, no sow resumed ovarian activity in normal time. Bromocriptine treatment had no influence on the resumption of ovarian activity, suggesting that prolactin is not involved in the lack of estrus <b>after</b> <b>weaning.</b> An influence of environmental factors is also suggested...|$|R

Group 4 : sows (n = 415) purposely chosen from among animals that did not show heat within 7 days <b>after</b> <b>weaning,</b> were treated on day 7 post-weaning as group 2. Sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating after treatment, treatment to oestrus intervals and follicular sizes were evaluated. The number of sows expressing oestrus, sows ovulating, and treatment to oestrus intervals differed between the groups (group 1 vs. 2 : P < 0. 05, group 3 vs. 4 : P < 0. 01).
