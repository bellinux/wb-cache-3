25|$|In the 2015 documentary, <b>Listen</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> Marlon, Brando {{claims to}} have rewritten most of the script. This would be Brando's last great film.

Whether Brando really did save the film, after this he really {{would be difficult to}} work with, not out of technique, but out of laziness. Brando admits that his heart was no longer in it for the most part at this point in his career and with his family issues, personal problems, and social issues.|$|E

25|$|Marlon Brando was {{the first}} to bring a natural {{approach}} to acting on film. According to Dustin Hoffman in his online Masterclass, Brando would often talk to camera men and fellow actors about their weekend even after the director would call action. Once Brando felt he could deliver the dialogue as natural as that conversation he would start the dialogue. In his 2015 documentary, <b>Listen</b> <b>To</b> <b>Me</b> Marlon, he said before that actors were like breakfast cereals. He was calling them predictable. Critics would later say this was Brando being difficult, but actors who worked opposite would say it was just all part of his technique.|$|E
25|$|Brando {{would later}} say in his 2015 documentary, <b>Listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> Marlon, {{that he felt}} the part in On the Waterfront that won him an Oscar was to him personally, not good, and that {{he knew he had}} done better acting. In the behind the scenes of On the Waterfront film experts and critics would say he would change lines because he didn't like the script, and that he'd let the {{director}} know by having regular conversations. However, This was a way for Brando to prepare before a scene by warming up before starting the dialogue, in order to deliver it as natural as possible. Brando often saw a shrink, and reportedly wasn't there for some of the shooting of the scene when the close up was on the opposite actor. This is why this part of his technique is recognized mistakenly as him being difficult, and not a part of his approach.|$|E
