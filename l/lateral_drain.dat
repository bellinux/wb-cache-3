Two {{kinds of}} {{efficient}} electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection circuits in <b>lateral</b> <b>drain</b> extended MOSFETs (DEMOSFETs) will be designed and investigated in this paper. One kind of these test samples is fabricated with an SCR structure, {{which has the}} lowest turned-on resistance when it is triggered by a high voltage of ESD event. The SCR circuit is the most efficient of all protection devices in terms of ESD performance per unit area. Furthermore, the other type of these DUTs is an SCR with RC-triggered structure, which will have a small trigger voltage (Vt 1) under ESD event, and then it obtains a good ESD immunity level...|$|E

In {{an effort}} to reduce {{suspended}} solids and organic carbon loading and to increase long-term groundwater recharge rates at Orange County Water District’s spreading basins, a pilot project was conducted to evaluate riverbed filtration as a technology to treat river water prior to groundwater recharge. A shallow under-channel <b>lateral</b> <b>drain</b> system was constructed within a channel adjacent to the Santa Ana River to induce and capture infiltration. Water pumped from the drain system was analyzed for a variety of water quality parameters and then recharged into test spreading basins to evaluate recharge rates compared to Santa Ana River water without treatment. Riverbed filtered water and untreated water was also tested in percolation columns. At the pilot project drain system, phreatic surface and temperature were continuously monitored at thirteen points. River water inflow and outflow and drain system pumping rates were also monitored. The pilot test was divided into two periods: Period 1 had shallow overflow (1 - to 3 -inches) within the river channel; Period 2 achieved deeper surface water depths (3 - to 12 -inches). <b>Lateral</b> <b>drain</b> system pumping during both test periods were incrementally increased to establish the maximum pumping capacity of the drain system for each test period. Monitoring data indicate that riverbed filtration effectively removed essentially all suspended solids and reduced organic carbon contents with the bulk of water captured by the under-channel drain system from induced infiltration. The phreatic surface and subsurface water movement within the drain system area was shown to be very sensitive to changes in surface water flow rates and depth, and drain system pumping rates. In addition, surface clogging was observed. The pilot project results indicate that riverbed filtration is a viable technology for treating surface water prior to recharge operations, however, additional testing and optimization is needed...|$|E

Both a numerical solution and an exact analytic solution are derived.

This paper reports a 2 -dimensional numerical simulation of the movement of contamination with water into the sub-grade and water table beneath a road to determine the major factors affecting transport of contaminants.

Analyses were undertaken to simulate 2 to 4 years of water percolation through the pavement sub-structure, some contamination arriving at an underlying ground water table and other arriving at a <b>lateral</b> <b>drain.</b> Overall, the potential for ground water table contamination above probable limit values is very low except in extreme permeability and low sorption cases. Results show, firstly, that the sorption capacity of aggregates {{should be taken into}} account, especially as the run-off {{is likely to be a}} more important consideration than the possibility of leaching from the pavement’s construction layers.

Six years of data from an ongoing field study in south central Minnesota (Sands et al., 2008) were used to support a modeling effort with DRAINMOD-NII to investigate: (1) {{the performance of the}} model in a region where soils are subject to seasonal freeze-thaw and (2) the long-term hydrologic {{and water quality}} characteristics of conventional and alternative subsurface drainage practices. Post-calibration model prediction and efficiency were deemed satisfactory using standard model performance criteria. Prediction errors were primarily associated with early spring snowmelt hydrology and were attributed to the methods used for simulating snow accumulation and melting processes, in addition to potential sublimation effects on ET estimates. Long-term simulations with DRAINMOD-NII indicated that drainage design and/or management practices proposed as alternatives to conventional design may offer opportunities to reduce nitrate (NO 3) -nitrogen losses without significantly decreasing (and in some cases, increasing) crop yields for a Webster silty clay loam soil at Waseca, Minnesota. The simulation study indicated that both shallow drainage and controlled drainage may reduce annual drainage discharge and NO 3 -nitrogen losses by 20 - 30 %, while impacting crop yields from - 3 % (yield decrease) to 2 %, depending on <b>lateral</b> <b>drain</b> spacing.

40|$|Most flank eruptions {{within a}} central {{stratovolcano}} are triggered by <b>lateral</b> <b>draining</b> of magma from its central conduit, and only few eruptions {{appear to be}} independent of the central conduit. In order to better highlight the dynamics of flank eruptions in a central stratovolcano, we review the eruptive history of Etna over the last 100 years. In particular, we {{take into consideration the}} Mount Etna eruption in 2001, which showed both summit activity and a flank eruption interpreted to be independent from the summit system. The eruption started with the emplacement of a ~N-S trending peripheral dike, responsible for the extrusion of 75 % of the total volume of the erupted products. The rest of the magma was extruded through the summit conduit system (SE crater), feeding two radial dikes. The distribution of the seismicity and structures related to the propagation of the peripheral dike and volumetric considerations on the erupted magmas exclude a shallow connection between the summit and the peripheral magmatic systems during the eruption. Even though the summit and the peripheral magmatic systems were independent at shallow depths (< 3 km b. s. l.), petro-chemical data suggest that a common magma rising from depth fed the two systems. This deep connection resulted in the extrusion of residual magma from the summit system and of new magma from the peripheral system. Gravitational stresses predominate at the surface, controlling the emplacement of the dikes radiating from the summit; conversely, regional tectonics, possibly related to N-S trending structures, remains the most likely factor to have controlled at depth the rise of magma feeding the peripheral eruption...|$|R

DRAINMOD-N II was calibrated using data from the first plot, while data set from the second plot was used for model validation over the two cropping seasons. The model simulation results were evaluated statistically by comparing the simulated and measured drain flows and nitrate–nitrogen (NO 3 –N) losses in the subsurface drains. The study results showed good agreement between the observed and simulated results for both plots. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the drainage rate was less than 0. 08 cm for the calibration plot over the two cropping seasons.

40|$|Mount Etna (Italy) {{produced}} two important flank eruptions in 2001 and 2002 - 2003, which were peculiar for their high degrees of explosivity {{and for the}} simultaneous emission of two compositionally distinct magmas. From a strictly volcanological point of view, the 2001 and 2002 - 2003 eruptions showed many similarities. Both affected {{two sides of the}} volcano (the southern and northeastern flanks), and both were actually ¸Stwo-eruptions-in-one¡T, with a part of the activity being fed by the <b>lateral</b> <b>draining</b> of the central conduit system (central-lateral activity), while much of the activity was fed from a source independent of the central conduit system (eccentric activity). However, when placed in a wider geodynamic context, the two eruptions are fundamentally different. While the 2001 eruption was heralded by an intense seismic swarm and vigorous ground deformation, very few such premonitory signs preceded the 2002 - 2003 eruption, which, however, was accompanied by a major slip of EtnaŠs unstable eastern to southeastern flank, and by widespread seismicity and ground rupturing in the moving sector. This suggests that the dynamics of magma ascent and eruption were anything but identical in the two eruptions. The deformation of the volcanic edifice during the 2001 eruption clearly indicates forceful dike intrusion, probably under N-S regional compression (tectonic triggering). During the first stage of this eruption, earthquakes began to cluster along the active faults traversing and delimiting the unstable sector on the eastern flank, marking the onset of accelerated spreading of that flank. For the 2002 - 2003 eruption, nearly all of the seismicity was concentrated along these faults, mostly on the eastern and southeastern flanks, but in September more vigorous flank slip began along the Pernicana Fault System on the northeastern flank of the volcano. Magma migration into the Northeast Rift began as a response to this event, and a second, much more significant slip event five weeks later, permitted the uprise of magma not only on the Northeast Rift, but also on the southern flank. The seismic and deformation data preclude any forceful intrusion of magma {{in the case of the}} 2002 - 2003 eruption, which was mainly triggered by the large-scale slip of the unstable eastern flank of the volcano (slip triggering) ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{nanoscale}} regime, the double-gate MOSFET {{can provide}} superior short-channel behavior. For this structure, device scaling issues are explored. Gate length scaling {{will be limited}} by {{the ability to control}} off-state leakage current due to quantum tunneling and thermionic emission between the source and drain as well as band-to-band tunneling between the body and <b>drain.</b> <b>Lateral</b> S/D doping abruptness requirements for gate length scaling are examined. VT control will be challenging as a single gate material for both NMOS and PMOS devices cannot provide low yet symmetrical VT’s. CMOS integration will thus require dual gate workfunction tuning, channel doping, or asymmetrical double-gates to adjust VT. Advantages of using alternative channel materials to facilitate scaling are investigated...|$|R
40|$|A {{groundwater}} flow model was constructed for the Rincon Valley area and Mesilla Basin. The system {{is dominated by}} the complex interaction of the Rio Grande, canals, <b>laterals,</b> and <b>drains</b> with groundwater pumping. The primary purpose of the model was to aid the New Mexico -Texas Water Commission in assessing options for water resources development in the Lower Rio Grand Basin from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to El Paso, Texas. One such assessment was to evaluate the effect of secondary irrigation releases from Caballo Reservoir on the water budget. In addition, the model will eventually be linked to a surface water model (BESTSM) being utilized by the New Mexico -Texas Water Commission to evaluate water supply alternatives for El Paso, Texas. Stress periods were specified on a seasonal basis, a primary irrigation season from March through October and a secondary irrigation season from November through February. Analysis of model output indicates that groundwater pumping decreases Rio Grande flows, secondary irrigation season releases do not alter the water budget significantly, and that recharge and discharge from aquifer storage are strongly related to the season...|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} {{control the}} behaviour of many unstable slopes and their importance for landslide activity is generally accepted. In slow-moving landslides differential displacement complicates the hydrological regime due to continuous {{opening and closing}} of the fissures and cracks, creating dynamic preferential flow path systems. The consequences of the appearance and destruction of these preferential flow paths is thus {{closely related to the}} formation of critical pore pressure and the resulting movement and persistence of fissure systems. This interaction may account for the seasonal nature of the slow-moving landslide activity, including the often observed shifts and delays. This research aims to investigate this interaction between slope stability and spatial and temporal variations in fissure patterns, which makes fissures act both as preferential flow paths for infiltration and as <b>lateral</b> groundwater <b>drains.</b> To this end, the hydrological processes that control exchange of water between the fissure network and the matrix has been included in a spatially distributed hydrological and slope stability model. The ensuing feedbacks in landslide activity were explored by running the model with the meteorological forcing of one year until a dynamic steady-state was achieved. The effect of fissure dynamics was evaluated by comparing simulations with static fissure patterns to those in which these patterns deform as function of the local stability...|$|R
40|$|The 2007 caldera-forming {{eruption}} of Piton de la Fournaise (PdF) erupted the largest volume of magma (210 Mm 3) recorded at this volcano {{in at least}} three centuries. Major and trace element and Sr-Nd isotope data for bulk-rocks, groundmasses and olivine phenocrysts have been combined with melt inclusion data (major, trace and volatile elements) to track magma evolution over the whole eruptive sequence. We show that each eruptive phase had a distinctive geochemical and petrological signature and that caldera collapse on 5 April was preceded by a marked shift in bulk magma composition and crystal content and size. Aphyric basalt erupted {{at the beginning of the}} sequence (February 2007) had relatively high Sr isotope ratio (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70420 - 0. 704180) and low Nd isotopic ratio (143 Nd/ 144 Nd = 0. 51285 - 0. 51286). Olivine-basalts extruded on 2 - 5 April just before caldera collapse are less enriched in radiogenic Sr (87 Sr/ 86 Sr = 0. 70412 - 0. 70416), but characterized by the same Nd isotopic composition. This magma is interpreted as a new deep input, which pressurized the shallow PdF plumbing system and triggered the 2007 activity. Post-collapse oceanite lavas represent the main volume of magma extruded in 2007. Their bulk-rocks and groundmasses have 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (~ 0. 70418) intermediate between those of February and 5 April, and similar to those of the March 2007 and 2001 - 2006 lavas. We show that the Steady State Basalts (SSB) commonly erupted at PdF are hybrid melts, which result from multistep mixing between 'alkaline' and 'transitional' end-members. Our results lead us to propose a new model of the PdF plumbing system to reconcile the petrological, geochemical and geophysical observations: (1) the shallow portion (above sea level) of the PdF plumbing system hosts several small sills, in which magma experiences variable degrees of degassing, cooling and crystallization; (2) oceanite lavas result from the withdrawal of shallow harrisitic mushes stored at low pressures (< 48 MPa; < 1800 - 2400 m depth) below both the volcano summit and its eastern flank; (3) water degassing plays a major role in fast magma crystallization at shallow depths. Multistep ascent and periodic extrusion of the shallow magmas is promoted by injections of deeper and hotter basaltic magma, containing up to 1. 3 wt % H 2 O and 1630 ppm S. In 2007, the new deep input was the ultimate source of the large excess in sulfur degassing detected by satellites. <b>Lateral</b> <b>draining</b> and intrusion of magma below the eastern flank of the volcano are the cause of major volcano deformation, flank sliding and summit caldera collapse. © The Author 2014.

30|$|The {{problem of}} {{salinity}} has {{great impact on}} soil fertility which in turns has a great effect on soil productivity. According {{to a survey by}} the Department of Agriculture in 1990, it was discovered that out of 128, 000  ha of cultivated land, 54, 000  ha is seriously alkaline, waterlogged and moderately saline (Du 1991). An estimated 18 % of the area under regular irrigation appears to be affected by water logging and salinization in the Vaal Harts irrigation scheme. In the 1960 s, a number of soil profiles from all over the Scheme, contained more salts in the subsurface than measured during the initial soil survey, indicating a disturbing tendency, although not alarming at that stage. Within 35  years of the scheme's existence, the fine sandy soils of this scheme were severely salinised. Reclamation of some 30 000  ha saline or saline-sodic soils (depth 0.3  m) was reported at VHS. Salt-affected soils at VHS resulted in 1.4 - 2.1 million South African Rand gross income loss for the irrigation scheme farmers in 1975 (Du 1991). The installation of 218 drainage systems totaling 500  km of subsurface <b>lateral</b> <b>drains</b> at a cost of 2 million Rand were undertaken between 1975 and 1977. In the 1980 s, a further 2 million Rand was invested to install sub-surface drains on farms and to link these drains to the partially developed system of open storm water drains, in an attempt to lower the water table and to leach salts. Since 2009, the service of a consultant was engaged to assess the scheme at an additional cost of about 5 million Rand (Ojo et al. 2009, 2011). Salinity problems are often measured by means of soil surveys, questionnaires and laboratory analyses. These traditional data collection methods analyses are neither enough for the assessment of this important environmental issue. Satellite image data are used to overcome most of these limitations with a need to better find the calibration between the data and real field situations. The spread of modeling techniques using distributed parameters has largely encouraged the use of input data from remote sensing with the support of GIS for manipulating large data sets. In the interim report submitted to the Institute for Applied Systems analysis, Brogaard and Prieler (1998) described how Landsat MSS can be used for the identification of broad land cover changes of the Western part of Horqin steppe, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Van Trinh et al (2004) used Landsat images for studying land use dynamics and soil degradation in the Tamduong district of Vietnam. Eranani and Gabriels (2006) used Landsat data from 1976 to 2002 to detect changes in land cover in the Yazd-Ardakan basin, Iran. Latifovic et al (2005) analysed the land cover change of the Oil Sands Mining Development in Athabasca, Canada using information extraction method applied to two Landsat scenes. The objective of this study was to assess the salinity problem in Vaal Harts irrigation scheme using multi-temporal satellite data.|$|R
40|$|Hydrological {{processes}} {{control the}} behaviour of many unstable slopes, and their importance for landslide activity is generally accepted. The presence of fissures influences the storage {{capacity of a}} soil and affects the infiltration processes of rainfall. The effectiveness of the fissure network depends upon fissure size, their spatial distribution, and connectivity. Moreover, fissure connectivity is a dynamic characteristic, depending {{on the degree of}} saturation of the medium. This research aims to investigate the influence of the fissure network on hydrological responses of a landslide. Special attention is given to spatial and temporal variations in fissure connectivity, which makes fissures act both as preferential flow paths for deep infiltration (disconnected fissures) and as <b>lateral</b> groundwater <b>drains</b> (connected fissures). To this end, the hydrological processes that control the exchange of water between the fissure network and the matrix have been included in a spatially distributed hydrological and slope stability model. The ensuing feedbacks in landslide hydrology were explored by running the model with one year of meteorological forcing. The effect of dynamic fissure connectivity was evaluated by comparing simulations with static fissure patterns to simulations in which these patterns change as a function of soil saturation. The results highlight that fissure connectivity and fissure permeability control the water distribution within landslides. Making the fissure connectivity function of soil moisture results in composite behaviour spanning the above end members and introduces stronger seasonality of the hydrological responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{microvascular}} bed of {{the stomach}} of Xenopus laevis and the changes it undergoes when the herbivorous tadpole becomes a carnivorous adult were studied by scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts and light microscopy of stained tissue sections. In tadpoles an upper and a lower gastric artery supplied, and upper, middle and lower medial and <b>lateral</b> gastric veins <b>drained</b> the vertically extending stomach. During metamorphosis, the stomach gained a horizontal cranio-caudal extension and vessels accordingly become dorsal and ventral gastric arteries, and anterior, middle and posterior gastric veins, respectively. Up to stage 64 (late climax) mucosal capillaries formed a polygonal network of wide immature-looking capillaries ensheathing gastric glands in a basket-like manner. From stage 64 onwards, blood vessels of the stomach appeared mature, revealed a clear hierarchy and were correlated closely with the histomorphology of the stomach, which had also gained the adult pattern. Within the gastric mucosa, ascending arterioles branched in a fountain-like pattern into wide subepithelial capillaries establishing a centripetal blood flow along the gastric glands, which makes an ultrashort control loop of glandular cells within the branched tubular gastric glands very unlikely. Formation of the stomach external muscular layer started at stage 57 when smooth muscle cells locally formed a single longitudinal and one-to-two single circular layers. Abundant signs of intussusceptive microvascular growth and rare vascular sprouts in vascular corrosion casts indicated that the larval-to-adult microvascular pattern formation of the stomach of Xenopus laevis Daudin occurs predominantly by non-sprouting angiogenesis...|$|R
