5|$|The Elvish {{languages}} are a language family of several related languages and dialects. The {{following is a}} brief overview of the fictional internal history of late Quenya as conceived by Tolkien. Tolkien imagined a diglossic Elven society with a vernacular <b>language</b> <b>for</b> every-day use, Tarquesta, and a more educated <b>language</b> <b>for</b> use in ceremonies and lore, Parmaquesta.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{computer}} scientists were generally uninterested in business applications when COBOL was created {{and were not}} involved in its design; it was (effectively) designed from the ground up as a computer <b>language</b> <b>for</b> business, with an emphasis on inputs and outputs, whose only data types were numbers and strings of text.|$|E
5|$|Although French is an {{official}} <b>language</b> <b>for</b> {{the purposes of}} the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not require it to be {{an official}} <b>language</b> <b>for</b> the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{scholars}} mention {{a possibility of}} future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue {{to function as a}} koineised language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world. English is used as the <b>language</b> <b>for</b> wider communication in countries around the world. Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any constructed language proposed as an international auxiliary language, including Esperanto.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult <b>language.</b> <b>For</b> instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

There were reservations among the developers about the <b>language</b> <b>for</b> the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E
5|$|English in Ireland {{was first}} during the Norman invasion. It was spoken {{by a few}} peasants and merchants brought over from England, and was largely {{replaced}} by Irish before the Tudor conquest of Ireland. It was introduced as the official language with the Tudor and Cromwellian conquests. The Ulster plantations gave it a permanent foothold in Ulster, and it remained the official and upper-class language elsewhere, the Irish-speaking chieftains and nobility having been deposed. Language shift during the 19th century replaced Irish with English as the first <b>language</b> <b>for</b> {{a vast majority of}} the population.|$|E

5|$|Hieratic {{was used}} {{alongside}} hieroglyphs for writing in Old and Middle Egyptian, becoming the dominant form of writing in Late Egyptian.

For the rest of ancient Egyptian history, Middle Egyptian remained the spoken <b>language</b> <b>for</b> more exalted forms of literature, such as historical records, commemorative autobiographies, hymns, and funerary spells. However, Middle Kingdom literature written in Middle Egyptian was also rewritten in hieratic during later periods.|$|E

5|$|In {{respect to}} the Greek {{language}} question, it becomes obvious that {{from the very beginning}} Hermes o Logios adhered to Koraisâ€™ views. Korais claimed that the appropriate <b>language</b> <b>for</b> the Greek nation should be a vernacular (Demotic) language without foreign words and accepted some views by conservative scholars to retain a tincure of archaism. On the other hand, some of Korais' opponents, both conservatives and vernacularists, published their own magazines in which they attacked his linguistic views.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} religion, Byzantine Greek Macedonia is also {{significant}} {{as being the}} home of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Greek brothers from Thessaloniki (Salonika) who were sent on state-sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east-central Europe. This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs' own <b>language,</b> <b>for</b> which they invented an alphabet that became known as Old Church Slavonic. In the process, this cemented the Greek brothers' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization and Orthodox Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs.|$|E
