25|$|In 1780, {{while making}} these {{chronometers}} for Brockbank, Earnshaw modified the pivoted detent by mounting the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> on a spring, thus dispensing with the pivots.

5000|$|Roller locking {{is used by}} the CZ 52 pistol, slide, barrel, <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and rollers shown here. Normally the {{recoil spring}} pushes the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> rearward, which in turn pushes the barrel back and holds the locking rollers. (In some of these {{pictures}} the spring is removed) ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{the gun is}} fired, the barrel, {{slide and}} <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> (right side of picture) will move {{backwards}} a short distance, while the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> will be stopped by a tab on the frame, shown on the left with a stick pointing out the mating surface.|$|E

50|$|Joe Juba from Game Informer {{gave the}} game a 6.5/10, praising its {{colourful}} graphics, while criticizing the unremarkable voice-acting, repetitive soundtrack, <b>locked</b> <b>pieces</b> in the sandbox mode, which only unlocked when the player meet certain {{point in the}} campaign mode. He {{also noted that the}} game lost its charm and excitement as the game progresses.|$|R
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to place all the {{rectangular}} pieces into the correct positions. Puzzle pieces can be varied in size to as few as 2x2 to over 10x10, depending on the puzzle. Additional options to increase difficulty include mirrored or flipped <b>pieces,</b> <b>locking</b> correctly placed <b>pieces,</b> blanking placed pieces after a time delay, and occasionally playing the video clip in reverse.|$|R
5000|$|With the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> {{stopped by}} the tab, the rollers will {{continue}} rearward with the slide, until they reach the recessed portion of the <b>locking</b> <b>piece.</b> The rollers will then be allowed to move inward, and will release from their indentations in the slide releasing the slide from the barrel.|$|E
50|$|The M1951 {{is a short}} recoil-operated, locked breech pistol with a {{vertically}} falling <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and an {{open top}} slide (the locking mechanism design {{was influenced by the}} Walther P38 pistol). The <b>locking</b> <b>piece,</b> located under the barrel, is unlocked by a sliding pin and locked back into battery by a beveled surface on the pistol's frame. The <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> features two locking lugs that engage appropriate recesses cut into the slide's internal side surfaces. When the pistol is fired, the <b>locking</b> <b>piece,</b> integral with the slide, goes back together with the barrel which is locked to the slide. After a brief period of unrestricted travel of approx. 13 mm the unlocking pin on the rear barrel lug strikes the receiver and stops. As the barrel and slide continue back, the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> strikes the stationary plunger and is forced down into recesses in the slide. The barrel comes to rest but the slide continues rearward for a further 50 mm. Upon forward return, the slide picks up the barrel and the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> on the barrel lug is lifted up by the receiver cam to lock the barrel to the slide. The spring-loaded extractor is integrated into the slide, and the fixed-type ejector is integral to the pistol's frame. The pistol has a hammer striking mechanism (with an exposed hammer) and a single-action trigger with a disconnector, which enables semi-automatic fire only. A cross-bolt safety mounted on the weapon's frame (beneath the hammer) provides safe operation with a cartridge introduced into the chamber. In the “weapon safe” position (the safety's button pushed in to the left) the slide catch is disabled.|$|E
5000|$|The HK21 is a {{selective}} fire roller-delayed blowback-operated firearm with a semi-rigid locking mechanism designed to retard the rearward {{movement of the}} bolt. This delay was achieved by artificially increasing the inertia of the bolt by using an angular, interposed transmission system, installed symmetrically to the bore axis, with two cylindrical rollers acting as transmission elements against a movable <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> which drives the heavy bolt carrier. The two-piece bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, which contains the aforementioned rollers, and a supporting <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and bolt carrier. During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the bolt head receives the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge and exerts rearward pressure against the rollers, seated in recesses in the barrel extension. The rollers are driven inward against angled ramps of the barrel extension and interact with the wedge-shaped <b>locking</b> <b>piece,</b> projecting it backwards. Thus a 4:1 transmission ratio is maintained (as long as the rollers move on the inclined surfaces of the barrel extension and <b>locking</b> <b>piece)</b> of the bolt carrier and <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> relative to the bolt head; the bolt carrier travels backwards four {{times faster than the}} bolt head, ensuring a safe drop of pressure within the barrel prior to extraction. Since extraction is carried-out under relatively high pressure, the barrel’s chamber received a series of flutes designed to help free the bloated cartridge casing from the chamber walls.|$|E
50|$|Survival mode {{challenges}} the player to completely clear the playfield. Unlike in Marathon and Timed modes, clearing {{pieces from the}} playfield does not automatically cause new ones to fall from the top. Instead, the player forms clusters and flowers until no more moves are possible, then any remaining <b>pieces</b> are <b>locked</b> in place and all open spaces are filled with new pieces. Clearing clusters with bonus stars causes nearby <b>locked</b> <b>pieces</b> to become unlocked. Forming a flower unlocks all pieces {{on the board and}} causes all pieces the same color as the center piece in the flower to clear from the board. If the player successfully clears the entire playfield or survives fifty rounds, they win the game. The game is over if all pieces on the playfield become locked.|$|R
50|$|In a {{torsional}} snap fit, {{one must}} deflect, or force the protruding edges of piece B {{away from the}} insertion area. Piece A then slides in between the protruding edges until the desired distance is reached. The edges of piece B is then released and piece A is held in place. The snap-fits in this description are the protruding edges of piece B. These types of snap-fits may have a spring in place; so that when activated, the <b>locked</b> in <b>piece</b> is released and put into action.|$|R
60|$|Kane {{had already}} wrapped her shorn <b>locks</b> in a <b>piece</b> of spotless white paper {{and tied it}} up with narrow white ribbon in the dainty fashion dear to druggists' clerks. As {{he handed it to}} her she felt in her pocket and {{produced}} a handful of gold.|$|R
50|$|As {{the slide}} moves forward, the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> {{maintains}} outward {{pressure on the}} rollers. When the recesses in the slide are positioned with the rollers, the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> will push them out into the recesses and move forward, locking the barrel to the slide again, the barrel and slide will move forward a small amount and stop. prepared for another cycle. Unlike a standard Browning short-recoil action, there is no tipping of the barrel during operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{heart of}} the {{operating}} system is the bolt assembly, which consists of a bolt head, <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and two cylindrical rollers, which upon chambering a round, are displaced outwards by angled surfaces in the forward pressing <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and into notches in the barrel extension. The geometry of the walls in the barrel extension and the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> ensure that once a shot is fired, the bolt head absorbs the recoil impulse from the ignited cartridge through {{the base of the}} empty casing and transmits this rearward pressure onto the rollers forcing them out of their sockets and inward at a mechanical disadvantage. The rollers then come into contact with inclined surfaces on the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and propel it backwards at a speed that is approximately 1.5x greater than that of the bolt head, thereby increasing the bolt's inertia and providing a delay in the blowback sequence. The relatively short initial rear displacement of the bolt head immediately after firing and the calculated delay eliminate the probability of a premature case extraction from the chamber (beyond the thick-walled base of the chamber) that would result in the spent casing bursting as the breech is opened only after the bullet has exited the barrel and gas pressures inside the bore have dropped to within safe limits.|$|E
50|$|The G41's {{engineering}} origins {{lay in the}} 7.92×33mm Kurz StG 45(M) Assault rifle, {{and later}} the 7.62×51mm NATO G3 battle rifle. It is a selective fire automatic weapon that employs a roller-delayed blowback system of operation. The two-piece bolt mechanism consists of a bolt head that contains two cylindrical rollers and a wedge-shaped <b>locking</b> <b>piece,</b> attached to a heavy bolt carrier. When fired, the build-up of gas pressure generated by the ignited powder charge exerts rearward pressure on the bolt, which is then transferred onto the rollers. The rollers are cammed inward against appropriately shaped walls in the barrel extension, displacing the <b>locking</b> <b>piece.</b> The geometry of the camming ramps on the wedge-like <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> ensure a rearward velocity that is {{greater than that of}} the bolt. This ensures that the bullet has left the barrel, allowing bore pressures to drop to a safe level before the rollers are fully retracted, clearing the barrel extension notches and releasing the bolt, which is then engaged by the bolt carrier and withdraws together with the entire moving assembly.|$|E
5000|$|At the Eshkol {{reservoir}}, another seven {{teams had}} to paddle a raft and collect nine <b>locked</b> puzzle <b>pieces</b> from the reservoir {{by using a}} designated key. After collecting all the pieces and completing their puzzle, teams could receive their next clue. Next, teams had to collect water from reservoir by using a hollow tube and use their palms to block the water from leaking out. Then, teams had to become a [...] "human transporter" [...] and transport the tube into the reservoirs filtering station and fill two full cups {{of water from the}} transported tube.|$|R
50|$|A chainlock, {{also known}} as a smiley is an improvised weapon which {{consists}} of a length of chain or strong cloth attached to a large <b>lock</b> or other <b>piece</b> of metal. The chainlock is mainly used in areas where other hand held weapons, such as knives, are not readily available.|$|R
5000|$|At one point, the Crown possessed Laeral Silverhand, {{one of the}} Seven Sisters, and was sundered by her husband, the archmage Khelben [...] "Blackstaff" [...] Arunsun, who <b>locked</b> its <b>pieces</b> away {{within the}} heavily {{protected}} walls of his tower. However, when Myrkul died at Midnight the Mage's hand during the Time of Troubles, the god tore the broken shards of the 'Crown' from Blackstaff Tower, reforged it in a new shape, and infused it with the remains of his sentience before teleporting away. To this day, Myrkul, through the Crown, has been spreading evil through the Realms, tormenting members of the Church of Cyric as well as hapless innocents.|$|R
5000|$|The Model L is a {{selective}} fire, roller-delayed blowback firearm. The weapon features a semi-rigid two-piece bolt mechanism {{that consists of}} a bolt head and a supporting angular <b>locking</b> <b>piece.</b> During the [...] "unlocking" [...] sequence, the two cylindrical rollers contained in the bolt head are cammed inward against inclined flanks of the barrel extension and act upon the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and bolt carrier, propelling it rearward at a velocity {{greater than that of}} the bolt, which remains closed until the fired bullet has left the barrel and pressures inside the bore have been reduced to a safe level before withdrawing together with the bolt carrier.|$|E
50|$|At {{about the}} same time, the barrel will be stopped by the <b>locking</b> <b>piece.</b> Momentum will carry the slide back against the {{pressure}} of the recoil spring where extraction and feeding a fresh cartridge happen similarly to other designs.|$|E
50|$|One {{peculiarity}} of this {{clock is}} that the count wheel only appears to have 11 notches, but the clock strikes 12 times each complete turn. This is because the first strike (when the clock strikes one) is executed whilst the lever is still within the first, wider, notch. The <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> is lifted out of the hoop of the hoop wheel, which then turns once, {{which leads to the}} great wheel turning 1/8 and striking once. Then the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> falls back into the hoop wheel. The fly will continue to turn until it stops gently on his own as it has a ratchet mechanism, which protects the bird cage on the fly arbor.|$|E
50|$|Most character-related side-quests may be {{undertaken}} by either Yumil or Tia {{even if the}} character in question is of the same gender as the player or the player already has an 'established' significant other. Developing platonic relationships adds new back-story information to entries in the Book of Prophecy. Every Hero and Heroine also has a particularly gripping personal issue that manifests itself {{in the form of}} a <b>locked</b> Code <b>piece.</b> For example, the sword master Gustav's son, Duran, was unable to stop a tragedy that happened before his eyes. A square in his Mental Map is taken up by 1 Weakness that is removable only by helping him come to a better understanding of the past.|$|R
5000|$|The {{elevator}} to the central tower is unlocked by finding a password, which is encoded {{in a piece of}} music. Each of the eight outer towers has a musical <b>piece</b> <b>locked</b> inside a safe. [...] The final password consists of six distinct musical pieces. Two of the pieces in the towers are duplicates. The player must rewind the tape so that the next musical piece records over the duplicate, erasing it.|$|R
5000|$|... 'ARE' (from the Japanese あれ are, used {{to refer}} to an object that does not have a given name, a remnant of the days of Sega arcade Tetris, where Japanese players {{did not know what to}} call it) is the length of time from when the {{previous}} <b>piece</b> <b>locks</b> and the next piece spawns on the playfield. During this time, players may [...] "charge" [...] DAS inputs, or [...] "pre-rotate" [...] the piece using the Initial Rotation System. (As well, in TI, the player may hold the piece) ...|$|R
50|$|When fired, {{expanding}} propellant gases {{produced from}} the burning powder in the cartridge exert rearward pressure on the bolt head transferred through {{the base of the}} cartridge case as it is propelled out of the chamber. A portion of this force is transmitted through the rollers projecting from the bolt head, which are cammed inward against the inclined flanks of the locking recesses in the barrel extension and to the angled shoulders of the <b>locking</b> <b>piece.</b> The selected angles of the recesses and the incline on the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> produce a velocity ratio of about 4:1 between the bolt carrier and the bolt head. This results in a calculated delay, allowing the projectile to exit the barrel and gas pressure to drop to a safe level before the case is extracted from the chamber.|$|E

50|$|The {{locking system}} {{features}} a locking block hinged from the bolt and {{housed in the}} bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the receiver's internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After 22 mm of unrestricted travel, a wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the breech <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and lifts it {{up and out of}} engagement with the locking recesses in the steel body. The breech <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for primary extraction. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty cartridge casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun.|$|E
50|$|According to {{a legend}} related in the Youyang Zazu (Youyang Miscellanies) by the Tang Dynasty writer Duan Chengshi (800-863), the Thousand Buddha Mountain was {{originally}} located {{by the sea}} and the sea god had locked it in place there by a large lock in order to prevent the god in charge of the mountains from moving it around. However, eventually the lock broke and the mountain was hurled through the air into its present position.

50|$|The Model 31 {{was later}} {{used as a}} basis for the Mossberg 500 and related shotguns. The Mossberg is {{simplified}} and cheaper to produce. Notable differences are the use of a two-piece bolt with separate <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> as well as a significantly simplified barrel mounting system. Further, the bolt locks into a barrel extension rather than directly to the receiver.|$|E
50|$|The delay {{results from}} {{the amount of time}} it takes for enough recoil energy to be {{transferred}} through to the bolt carrier in a sufficient quantity for it to be driven to the rear against the force of inertia of the bolt carrier and the forward pressure exerted against the bolt by the recoil spring. As the rollers are forced inward they displace the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> and propel the bolt carrier to the rear. The bolt carrier's rearward velocity is four times that of the bolt head since the cartridge remains in the chamber {{for a short period of}} time during the initial recoil impulse. After the bolt carrier has traveled rearward 4 mm, the <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> is withdrawn fully from the bolt head and the rollers are compressed into the bolt head. Only once the locking rollers are fully cammed into the bolt head can the entire bolt group continue its rearward movement in the receiver, breaking the seal in the chamber and continuing the feeding cycle.|$|E
50|$|The bolt rigidly {{engages the}} barrel extension—a {{cylindrical}} component welded to the receiver {{into which the}} barrel is pinned. The delay mechanism is of the same design as that used in the G3 rifle. The two-part bolt consists of a bolt head with rollers and a bolt carrier. The heavier bolt carrier lies up against the bolt head when the weapon is ready to fire and inclined planes on the front <b>locking</b> <b>piece</b> lie between the rollers and force them out into recesses in the barrel extension.|$|E

40|$|This Brief {{describes}} {{a method of}} machining and assembly when the depth of corrugations far exceeds the width and conventional machining is not practical. The horn is divided into easily machined, individual rings with shoulders to control the depth. In this specific instance, each of the corrugations is identical in profile, and only differs in diameter and outer profile. The horn is segmented into rings that are cut with an interference fit (zero clearance with all machining errors biased toward contact). The interference faces can be cut with a reverse taper to increase the holding strength of the joint. The taper is a compromise between the interference fit and the clearance of the two faces during assembly. Each internal ring is dipped in liquid nitrogen, then nested in the previous, larger ring. The ring is rotated in the nest until {{the temperature of the}} two parts equalizes and the <b>pieces</b> <b>lock</b> together. The resulting assay is stable, strong, and has an internal finish that cannot be achieved through other methods...|$|R
