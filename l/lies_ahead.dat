5|$|The central {{character}} in the series is Harry Potter, an English boy who lives with his aunt, uncle, and cousin - the Dursleys - who discovers, {{at the age of}} eleven, that he is a wizard, though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as Muggles. The wizarding world exists parallel to the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy. His magical ability is inborn and children with such abilities are invited to attend exclusive magic schools that teach the necessary skills to succeed in the wizarding world. Harry becomes a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a wizarding academy in Scotland and it is here where most of the events in the series take place. As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation that <b>lies</b> <b>ahead</b> in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.|$|E

500|$|Picard orders return fire, and the Enterprise {{appears to}} disable the Borg ship. Against Guinan's advice, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) takes an away {{team to the}} immense Borg cube where they find mostly dormant Borg drones and a Borg nursery. [...] Worf discovers that the Borg ship is {{regenerating}} and repairing the damage made by the [...] Enterprise. [...] The away team is beamed directly to the bridge, and Picard orders that they depart at maximum warp. The Borg ship immediately reactivates and begins pursuit, gaining on the Enterprise. Q appears on the bridge and warns Picard that the Borg will never stop chasing them, and cannot be defeated. Picard attempts to fight back against the Borg to no avail, and finally admits he needs Q's help. Q obliges, returning the Enterprise to its last position in Federation space. Picard, though thankful for Q's lesson, blames Q {{for the deaths of}} his crew. Q disappears, but not before reminding them again of their ill-preparedness. Guinan warns Picard that now that the Borg are aware of the Federation's presence, they will be coming. Picard reflects that perhaps Q did the right thing for the wrong reasons by bringing forward their encounter with the Borg, as it has informed the Federation for what <b>lies</b> <b>ahead</b> of them as they continue to explore.|$|E

2500|$|In March–April 1969, the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) bombed {{water and}} {{electricity}} installations in Northern Ireland, leaving much of Belfast without power and water. Paisley and the UPV blamed the bombings on the dormant IRA and elements {{of the civil rights}} movement. Paisley's Protestant Telegraph called them [...] "the first act of sabotage perpetrated by the IRA since the murderous campaign of 1956", warning that it was [...] "an ominous indication of what <b>lies</b> <b>ahead</b> for Ulster". Many people believed these claims of IRA responsibility. The loyalists also hoped that the bombings would weaken confidence in Prime Minister Terence O'Neill. Unionist support for O'Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister. Paisley's approach led him in turn to oppose O'Neill's successors as Prime Minister, Major James Chichester-Clark (later Lord Moyola) and Brian Faulkner.|$|E
2500|$|Like Albania, China {{defended the}} [...] "purity" [...] of Marxism by attacking both US imperialism and [...] "Soviet and Yugoslav revisionism", both equally {{as part of}} a [...] "dual adversary" [...] theory. Yugoslavia was viewed as both a [...] "special {{detachment}} of U.S. imperialism" [...] and a [...] "saboteur against world revolution." [...] These views however began to change in China, {{which was one of the}} major issues which Albania had with the alliance. Also unlike Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, the Sino-Albanian alliance lacked [...] "...an organizational structure for regular consultations and policy coordination, and it was also characterized by an informal relationship which was conducted on an ad hoc basis." [...] Mao made a speech on 3 November 1966 in which he claimed that Albania was the only Marxist-Leninist state in Europe and in the same speech, he also stated that [...] "an attack on Albania will have to reckon with great People's China. If the U.S. imperialists, the modern Soviet revisionists or any of their lackeys dare to touch Albania in the slightest, nothing <b>lies</b> <b>ahead</b> for them but a complete, shameful and memorable defeat." [...] Likewise, Hoxha stated that [...] "You may rest assured, comrades, that come what may in the world at large, our two parties and our two peoples will certainly remain together. They will fight together and they will win together." ...|$|E
