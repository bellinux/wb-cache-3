5|$|Having {{been elected}} twice to the presidency, Reagan {{reshaped}} the Republican party, led the modern conservative movement, and altered the political {{dynamic of the}} United States. His 1980 presidential campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the economy, <b>less</b> <b>government</b> interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher began {{attending}} lunches {{regularly at}} the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), {{a think tank}} founded by Hayekian poultry magnate Antony Fisher; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s. There she {{was influenced by the}} ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and became the face of the ideological movement opposing the British welfare state. Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed <b>less</b> <b>government,</b> lower taxes, and more freedom for business and consumers.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 presidential {{election}} featured Reagan against incumbent President Jimmy Carter and was conducted amid {{a multitude of}} domestic concerns {{as well as the}} ongoing Iran hostage crisis. Reagan's campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles: lower taxes to stimulate the economy, <b>less</b> <b>government</b> interference in people's lives, states' rights, and a strong national defense.|$|E
2500|$|Although all fiscal conservatives agree {{generally}} on {{a smaller}} and <b>less</b> expensive <b>government</b> there are disagreements over priorities. There are three main factions or subgroups each advocating for a particular emphasis.|$|R
5000|$|Doherty {{has been}} {{recognized}} by the Chicago Tribune for [...] "presiding ably over his ward" [...] and by the Chicago Sun-Times for acting [...] "independently." [...] Brian has been a consistent advocate for more efficient, <b>less</b> intrusive <b>government.</b>|$|R
50|$|Holcombe is {{the author}} of several books on {{economics}} and American politics. In libertarian theoretical discourse, he has argued that private defense agencies could form cartels and oppress people, more or <b>less</b> as <b>governments,</b> with little fear of competition.|$|R
5|$|Farmer {{was also}} criticized for his {{management}} of the agriculture department's vehicle fleet. Late in his first term, Farmer had removed the vehicles used by the Agriculture Department from the state fleet, opting to have department officials manage them separately. In 2010, the Bluegrass Institute for Public Policy Solutions, a free market think tank, criticized the department's {{management of the}} vehicles under its control, citing {{the frequency with which}} the department's vehicles were being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted in 2010 that the department's fleet had grown from 178 to 206 vehicles since 2007 while the state's fleet had shrunk by 5%, and that all but three of the department's vehicles were fewer than four years old. A department spokesman defended the moves, citing decreased maintenance costs and higher resale values of vehicles being replaced. The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that such incidents could undermine Williams and Farmer's traditional Republican message of the need for <b>less</b> <b>government</b> spending.|$|E
25|$|The New Zealand Party, {{founded by}} {{property}} tycoon Bob Jones, was launched primarily {{to oppose the}} Muldoon government (although it did not support Labour). A right-wing liberal party, it promoted <b>less</b> <b>government</b> control over markets, {{in contrast to the}} paternalist and somewhat authoritarian policies of National, the other significant right-wing party.|$|E
25|$|Steele won the Republican {{nomination}} after facing little {{opposition in}} the primary. His opponents were Democrat Ben Cardin and Independent Kevin Zeese (who was endorsed by the Green and Libertarian parties). The three candidates participated in three debates. Cardin primarily attacked Steele over his close relations with President Bush. Steele focused on low taxes, <b>less</b> <b>government</b> spending, free markets and national security.|$|E
50|$|Though the {{majority}} of John Broster’s archeological career has been based more or <b>less</b> in <b>government</b> office rather than in strict academia, he has produced some 50 publications over the last 40 years. Of these, 38 have been focused on Paleoindian research.|$|R
5|$|The {{death toll}} was placed between 57 {{and over a}} hundred people, {{including}} a thirteen-year-old boy, Romek Strzałkowski. Hundreds of people sustained injuries.

25|$|China's {{economic}} {{growth has been}} compared with other developing countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, and India. GDP growth in China outstrips all other developing countries, with only India after 1990 coming close to China's experience. Scholars believe that high rates of investments, especially increases in capital invested per worker, have contributed to China's superior economic performance. China's relatively free economy, with <b>less</b> <b>government</b> intervention and regulation, is cited by scholars as {{an important factor in}} China's superior performance compared to other developing countries.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{the term}} {{liberalism}} has become {{associated with the}} welfare state and expanded regulatory policies created {{as a result of}} the New Deal and its offshoots from the 1930s onwards. Fiscal conservatives form one of the three legs of the traditional conservative movement in the United States, together with social conservatism and national defense conservatism. Many Americans who are classical liberals also tend to identify as Libertarian, holding more socially liberal views and advocating a non-interventionist foreign policy while supporting lower taxes and <b>less</b> <b>government</b> spending.|$|E
25|$|An {{accelerated}} climate {{simulation chamber}} was built that applied varying weather conditions to insulation to test its efficacy and durability faster than real time. Materials research into heat resistant ceramics {{for use in}} truck and high-tech car engines was performed, building upon the materials research {{that began in the}} nuclear reactors of the 1950s. In 1987 the High Temperature Materials Laboratory was established where ORNL and industry researchers cooperated on ceramic and alloy projects. The materials research budget at ORNL doubled after initial uncertainty regarding Reagan's economic policy of <b>less</b> <b>government</b> expenditure.|$|E

25|$|In 1988 {{when the}} Ministry of Education started its {{independent}} school program, the school again reorganized. New regulations allowed schools access to private funding and subjected them to <b>less</b> <b>government</b> regulation {{in the content}} of their curricula. Renamed ACS (Independent), in 1993 the school vacated the Barker Road campus and moved to Dover Road. After strong lobbying by alumni, the Barker Road site became the site of a second secondary school. At the same time, the Anglo-Chinese Primary School abandoned its Coleman Street premises (the old building now housing the National Archives of Singapore) to share premises with the new secondary school at Barker Road, now named ACS (Barker Road).|$|E
25|$|The region, as {{with the}} rest of the state, tends to be more fiscally conservative, {{generally}} opting for lower taxes and <b>less</b> <b>government</b> spending. Specifically, in the Miami-Dade area there is a significant population of Cuban-American expatriates and people of Cuban descent, who often default to right-wing politics, seeing it as the opposite of liberalism, which is tied to socialism and seen as similar to the communist regime they escaped. Despite being considered the most liberal region in the state, only about of third of South Floridians surveyed felt they were in a liberal area. At the state level, there is little support for public transit infrastructure; for example, most transit-oriented development planning is done at the city or county level, with Miami-Dade County being considered one of the most active local governments in Florida in terms of transportation planning.|$|E
25|$|Health care {{prices in}} the United States {{describes}} market and non-market factors that determine pricing, along with possible causes as to why prices are higher than other countries. Compared to other OECD countries, U.S. healthcare costs are one-third higher or more relative {{to the size of}} the economy (GDP). According to the CDC, during 2015 health expenditures per-person were nearly $10,000 on average, with total expenditures of $3.2 trillion or 17.8% GDP. Proximate reasons for the differences with other countries include higher prices for the same services (i.e., higher price per unit) and greater use of healthcare (i.e., more units consumed). Higher administrative costs, higher per-capita income, and <b>less</b> <b>government</b> intervention to drive down prices are deeper causes. While the annual inflation rate in healthcare costs has declined in recent decades, it still remains above the rate of economic growth, resulting in a steady increase in healthcare expenditures relative to GDP from 6% in 1970 to nearly 18% in 2015.|$|E

30|$|In Asian {{countries}} that are developing, poor, more autocratic, or <b>less</b> educated <b>governments</b> own the media because they use public choice theory to handle political and economic freedom.

500|$|Johnson was term {{limited and}} could not run for a third {{consecutive}} term as governor in 2002. In the 2008 presidential election campaign, Johnson endorsed Ron Paul for the Republican nomination, [...] "because of his commitment to <b>less</b> <b>government,</b> greater liberty, and lasting prosperity for America." [...] Johnson spoke at Paul's [...] "Rally for the Republic" [...] on September 2, 2008.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{terms as}} {{governor}} helped {{to shape the}} policies he would pursue in his later political career as president. By campaigning {{on a platform of}} sending [...] "the welfare bums back to work," [...] he spoke out against the idea of the welfare state. He also strongly advocated the Republican ideal of <b>less</b> <b>government</b> regulation of the economy, including that of undue federal taxation.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} term, Paul founded the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE), a {{non-profit}} think tank dedicated to promoting principles of limited government and free-market economics. In 1984, Paul {{became the first}} chairman of the Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE), a conservative political group founded by Charles and David Koch [...] "to fight for <b>less</b> <b>government,</b> lower taxes, and less regulation." [...] CSE started a Tea Party protest against high taxes in 2002. In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy split into two new organizations, with Citizens for a Sound Economy being renamed as FreedomWorks, and Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation becoming Americans for Prosperity. The two organizations would become {{key players in the}} Tea Party movement from 2009 onward.|$|E

500|$|In February 2006, Willis {{appeared}} in Manhattan {{to talk about}} his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want <b>less</b> <b>government</b> intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican." ...|$|E
500|$|Boortz {{criticizes the}} major parties saying [...] "I believe that the {{principal}} difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats just want to grow our Imperial Federal Government a bit faster than the Republicans do." [...] He sides with liberals on some social issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage, and civil liberties. He agrees with fiscal conservatives in advocating <b>less</b> <b>government</b> spending and decreasing corporate regulation. He is an advocate for freedom of speech. In line with the traditional views of the Libertarian Party, Boortz supports eliminating the War on Drugs, and emphasizing personal responsibility. He has repeatedly stated his belief that global climate change is not man-made. His stances on many of these issues make him popular among conservative Republicans, who, due to their larger numbers in comparison to Libertarians, make {{up the majority of}} his listeners and callers.|$|E
500|$|Krohn wrote Defining Conservatism, {{which was}} self-published in 2008, {{when he was}} 13 years old, because he felt the term {{conservatism}} was often misused. The book was in part a response to criticism that John McCain, the 2008 Republican presidential candidate, received regarding his conservative credentials. The book outlines four fundamental principles of conservative thought: support for the United States Constitution, opposition to abortion, <b>less</b> <b>government,</b> and more personal responsibility. Krohn went on to apply the principles to current events and define whether specifically cited actions violated those principles. The book was dedicated to Ronald Reagan, William F. Buckley, Jr. and Barry Goldwater, whom Krohn describes as his political heroes, along with South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint. Krohn paid to have the book published from his own savings. He {{described it as a}} [...] "first effort" [...] and immediately planned to write a second one, which he said would focus in part on Alexander Hamilton and James Monroe.|$|E
50|$|Much of the {{negative}} response to airport security privatization comes from within the TSA. Officials of the TSA have expressed the concern that airports simply want to rid themselves {{of the influence of}} the Federal Government. According to Representative John Mica, the TSA should act <b>less</b> like <b>government</b> personnel, and more like security personnel.|$|R
