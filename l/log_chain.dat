A discriminative model (Ranking SVM) is employed to improve upon the initial ranking, using additional features as evidence. These features are derived from stateof-the-art techniques in spelling correction, including edit distance, letter-based n-gram, phonetic similarity and noisy channel model. This paper also presents a new method to automatically extract training samples from the query <b>log</b> <b>chain.</b> The system outperforms the baseline Aspell greatly, as well as previous models and several off-the-shelf spelling correction systems (e. g. Microsoft Word 2003). The results on query chain pairs are comparable to that based on manually-annotated pairs, with 32. 2 %/ 32. 6 % reduction in error rate, respectively. 1...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 45) This study determined {{an acceptable}} {{design of a}} fuel handling machine to refuel future liquid metal fast breeder reactors (LMFBR). To date, approximately seven fuel handling machines have been designed' and built for small scale liquid metal cooled reactors. Limitations of these previously operated handling devices eliminated their use for, the LMFBR. A study was therefore performed to establish a simple machine to meet the more stringent design safety criteria for the future LMFBR spent fuel assemblies. This study was however restricted to only those aspects of the design believed to be particularly critical for such a fuel handling machine. Once these critical design: aspects are satisfied, the detailed design can be prepared by more conventional design techniques. Fuel assemblies from the reactor must be removed periodically and, replaced with new fuel assemblies. The heat generated by the fission products in these spent fuel assemblies can cause the assemblies to melt unless adequate cooling is provided. The cooling system is therefore the most critical component of the fuel handling machine. Since provision for adequate heat removal from a spent fuel assembly is the most critical aspect of the design, two independent heat removal systems are suggested to provide near complete redundancy. Each heat transfer system must be capable of removing the entire 27 Kw generated internally in the spent assembly being removed. Sodium in the liquid state is used to transfer heat from the fuel assembly to the outside surface of the transfer container. In {{one of the two}} independent cooling systems, all of the decay heat is transferred froi the outside surface of the transfer container to an air-cooled cold wall by radiation. In the second cooling system, cold argon is pumped around the transfer container and through an air-to-argon heat exchanger to remove all of the decay heat of the spent fuel assembly by convection. Selection of the shielding material and the shielding dimension is the second critical design problem considered. The choice for shielding material is based on raw material costs, ease of fabrication, and shielding performance. No definitive answer exists to this selection problem, but this study showed that cast steel would be the best shielding material for this application. A flexible member must be used to raise and lower the fuel handling machine's grapple {{into and out of the}} reactor liquid sodium. To date none of the liquid metal reactor fuel handling machines have been designed with this constraint. The design of this component represented the third critical aspect of the design of the machine. The results show that <b>log</b> <b>chain</b> would be the best choice of the five alternative considered. A design concept for a IMFBR fuel handling machine evolved as a consequence of the results obtained by examination of the three critical design considerations discussed above...|$|E

40|$|In {{northeast}} China, logging {{has three}} stages; timber harvest, transportation and the operations inside a timber yard. The timber yard is an intermediate transhipment point between truck transport and rail transport to manufacturing centers. The transhipment {{capacity of the}} timber yard is often the limiting acitivity in the <b>logging</b> <b>chain.</b> Since the transportation is the middle part, its management affects both the technology and {{the economics of the}} other two. At the same time, the other two stages provide constraints to the transportation operations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} find an optimal economic plan for assigning trucks to timber yards in such a way as to minimize the number of trucks while satisfying the delivery schedule for the timber yard. This is done by controlling the log truck arrival distribution over time. As a result, the fewest number of trucks are used and the timber yard is efficiently used. A computer program was developed to provide the transportation manager with detailed information about truck allocations and to permit rapid updating of the transportation plan. The truck allocation problem is formulated as a capacitated network problem and the out-of-kilter algorithm is used to solve it. After the network problem is solved, the number of trucks needed to carry out the schedule can be determined through an hour-by-hour truck inventory analysis...|$|R

After dropping her friend off in Brandywine, Maryland, Stephanie proceeded toward her own home in Croom, but her car became disabled on a dark rural road. Two men stopped and instead of helping, kidnapped her at gunpoint. The two men, Jack Ronald Jones and Jerry Lee Beatty, kidnapped Stephanie and took her to an abandoned shack in Prince George's County. There she was tortured and raped repeatedly. One of the men called the other by his first name. Afraid now that Stephanie knew his name, they decided to kill her. Stephanie made several attempts to escape and upon her last capture, her skull was fractured with a <b>logging</b> <b>chain</b> and she was shot to death. In order to hinder identification, the murderers burned her body and severed her hands. They were captured after the younger man bragged about his part in the crime. Both men were charged with kidnapping, rape, and felony murder. The primary killer was convicted in Baltimore County while his co-defendant pleaded guilty to the same charges in Anne Arundel County. Both courts imposed sentences of two concurrent life sentences, with parole eligibility after twelve years.|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis involves preparation and execution of measurements on Francis runners. The measurements were performed by means of onboard measuring equipment both in model runners and full-scale prototype runners. Also, analysis of the measured data, and {{the discussion of the}} results, is presented. The measurements resulted in large data sets. These data sets were used by the author to investigate the dynamic pressure and strain in the runners. The results of the analysis can be used as input in future turbine design. Andritz Hydro AG has used the data for verification of their numerical simulation tools. In connection with the refurbishment of Tokke power plant, two model runners were made available for onboard pressure measurements. To investigate the dynamic pressure in these runners, methods for integration of pressure transducers in the runner blades needed to be developed. After initial difficulties during the preparation, successful measurements were obtained from both model runners. At Tokke power plant, both the original and replacement runners were made accessible for onboard pressure and strain gauge measurements. On the original KvÃ¦rner Brug AS runner, the test was prepared and performed by the author. This test failed, due to water intrusion in the <b>logging</b> <b>chain.</b> The second test was performed on the Andritz Hydro AG replacement runner. This test was prepared and performed by the author in close cooperation with Andritz Hydro AG, and the results were successful. The analysis results from both model and prototype runners show that the wake leaving the guide vanes is the most severe source of dynamic pressure in the runner. The draft tube vortex rope pulsation propagates upstream the runner, but does not appear as a significant frequency in the runner strain measurements.
