50|$|On a {{political}} level, {{relations between the}} First Men and the losian are often strained. Historically, the First Men have tended either to displace the original inhabitants or to expect them to adapt to First Man patterns of living, in a manner reminiscent of European colonialism. As a result, unconquered losian are now only found in harsh and remote areas. This has caused {{a good deal of}} bitterness for some groups of losian, such as the Widuz and the Mist. There are others who have become content with their new circumstances, but desire to be left alone; the Fenni, for example, deal swiftly and harshly with trespassers and have become an object of fear in northern legend. For their part, the statesmen of the Sixteen Kingdoms typically see the losian either as savages to be brought into civilisation, as enemies to be conquered, or using the principle of <b>leaving</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R

40|$|Social {{network sites}} and blogs have {{increasingly}} become breeding grounds for anonymous online groups that attack women and minorities. The attacks include rape threats, privacy invasions, defamation, and technological attacks that silence victims. Victims go offline or assume pseudonyms {{to prevent future}} attacks, impoverishing online dialogue and depriving victims {{of the social and}} economic opportunities associated with a vibrant online presence. Although social and legal norms have dampened offline discrimination, the internet’s Wild West culture and architecture invites bigots to move their hatred to cyberspace. The Internet facilitates anonymity, loosening social norms that constrain noxious behavior. It brings people together – a benefit when used for good purposes but especially dangerous when cyber mobs band together. Moreover, unlike offline hate that loses its impact with time, online hatred can be permanent. These are serious problems. Nonetheless, the public pays little attention to cyber hate. Law enforcement routinely trivializes cyber harassment of women and minorities, deeming it ranting victims can, and should, ignore. Police officers often refuse to pursue cyber harassment complaints {{on the grounds that the}} conduct is legally insignificant. Victims often do not pursue legal claims for fear that they won’t be taken seriously or that no law protects them. That is an unfortunate result of false information and mistaken assumptions—the law criminalizes cyber harassment and it may provide compensation for discrimination online. Digital Discrimination aims to chart a way forward. <b>Leaving</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone</b> is not an option. The more that we ignore cyber hate, the more prevalent in mainstream social media it will become. Although law has an important role to play, the existing legal framework can only take us so far. Other institutions can, and should, tackle cyber discrimination, including online intermediaries, educators, and interest group...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{haunting}} claims of each poor, unmarried mother in Edin and Kefalas 2 ̆ 7 Promises I Can Keep {{is that at}} least she can guarantee she will love her child, even though she cannot promise to make a lifelong commitment to a mate. That love, each young mother says, will be a sustaining gift both to her and the child. Similarly, in work done by sociologists McLanahan and Garfinkel to counteract the claim {{that it was not}} single parenting that made children 2 ̆ 7 s prospects dim, but poverty, sociologists have found that many of the bad effects of single parenting go away when wealth is taken into account. So, is love the answer here, or is it wealth? Does a legal marriage (let alone a two-tiered marriage) even matter, at least insofar as children 2 ̆ 7 s welfare is concerned? My recent empirical work with sociologist Steven Nock indicates that in fact love, measured in terms of parental warmth, is important to children 2 ̆ 7 s psychological well-being. We are using the Child Development Survey portion of the PSID (from the University of Michigan), which contains nearly 2700 children in a nationally representative sample. Love continues to remain important both in terms of impact and statistically though other variables are added. Wealth, measured in terms of total family wealth divided by the census needs standard for a family of that size, initially seems important to child wellbeing (on measures of depression, acting out, self-esteem and self-efficacy). However, unlike love, wealth 2 ̆ 7 s significance entirely disappears once family structure and particularly legal status like marriage and adoption comes into play. 2 ̆ 7 Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all., wrote Tennyson, and, we find, better to have married even if the marriage does not work out than never to have married. Children do better if they are in two parent, married homes, but are worse off in homes where their mothers never married even than in cases where the mother married, divorced, remarried and was widowed. Similarly, children do better where their fathers are living in the home, but less well with stepparents unless the stepparents adopt them. Children who live with relatives (let alone foster parents) do less well than those who are adopted by third parties. These rather dramatic findings suggest that law and public policy (as an instrument of law) should encourage and support marriage, particularly marriages that last. (They also suggest supporting adoption rather than foster care, though that is not the subject of this conference.) Law can do this in part merely by <b>leaving</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone</b> - by NOT adopting domestic partnership laws that equate unmarried, cohabiting couples with those that are married, and by NOT getting rid of special privileges enjoyed by the married when academics clamor that such benefits are not fair. Law ought also to make pre-marriage counseling and skills building more attractive and affordable, as some states have done through lower license costs, and some sort of real counseling effort requisite to divorces on non-fault grounds, as the covenant marriage movement suggests. Laws can be written to require mutual consent for divorce, or to become two-tier on the birth of children, so that the waiting period for no-fault separation and divorce lengthens.

40|$|SOMETIMES IT IS hard to <b>leave</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone.</b> During {{the first}} half of the 1980 s U.

In {{the first half}} of the 1990 s inflation slowed further, again at a real cost well within the range of standard "sacrifice ratio " calculations. For well over a year, as of the time of writing, unemployment has been at or below the conventional 6 percent estimate of the "nonaccelerating inflation " rate of unemployment, while inflation itself, after allowance for the upward bias in the current consumer price index (as recently evaluated by the advisory commission established by the Senate Finance Committee), is within 1 percentage point of zero. Yet despite this impressive track record of success over a period now spanning a decade and a half, there is still no end to calls for fundamental reform of the way in which the Federal Reserve System goes about making monetary policy.

Part working-class hero, part working-class stiff, the protagonist of Gerry Boyle’s eight-novel Jack McMorrow Mystery series embodies the archetypal ethical reporter, {{as defined by the}} Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ). For all his foibles and occasional ethical lapses, McMorrow seeks truth and reports it, minimizes harm, acts independently, and embraces accountability. 4 McMorrow also stomps a few corrupt toes in the process, as he notes.

40|$|Please do not {{distribute}} without authors ’ consent In this paper, {{we consider}} the pricing behavior of near-rational firms subject to idiosyncratic shocks which can adjust their prices at any time, but may make mistakes. We model error-prone behavior by assuming firms play a dynamic logit equilibrium. Prices are therefore endogenously sticky: when a firm’s current price is sufficiently close to the optimum, it prefers to <b>leave</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone,</b> avoiding the risk of accidentally choosing a worse price. This way of modeling price stickiness is consistent with several observations from microdata that {{have been hard to}} explain in most existing frameworks. First, even though the decision to adjust prices has an (S,s) structure, nonetheless many small price changes coexist with larger ones (Klenow and Malin, 2009, “Fact 7 ”). Second, error-prone choice implies that the price adjustment hazard exhibits negative duration dependence (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2008, “Fact 5 ”; Klenow and Malin, 2009, “Fact 10 ”), since firms will choose to adjust again quickly if they perceive that they have made a mistake. Third, the size of the price change is largely independent of the time since last adjustment (Klenow and Malin, 2009, “Fact 10 ”). When we estimate the logit rationality parameter, our model matches both the frequency of adjustment and the size distribution of price changes quite successfully. Since our setup guarantees that firms making sufficiently large errors will choose to adjust, it generates a large “selection effect ” in response to a nominal shock which eliminates most of the real effects of money. Thus, a model in which price stickiness is a precautionary phenomenon implies that money shocks are almost neutral, as in Golosov and Lucas (2007), but fits microdata better than their specification does. In ongoing work, we are also estimating a generalized model in which both the price chosen, and the decision of whether or not to adjust the price, are subject to logit errors. This should allow us to distinguish whether intermittent adjustment is driven primarily by a risk of errors or by stickiness per se...|$|E
40|$|In Beyond the Best Interests of the Child, three {{distinguished}} {{social science}} professionals have crafted out of evident {{compassion for the}} child a brief yet subtle program for the law's resolution of these difficult cases. Anna Freud and Albert J. Solnit are pre-eminent figures in child psychoanalysis and psychiatry, respectively, who insist that law recognize both {{what is known about}} child development and, as importantly, what is not known and cannot be predicted with certainty. Joseph Goldstein, a distinguished professor of law who has also acquired professional psychoanalytic training, seems ideally placed for the arduous task of smelting sound legal policy from the social science ore. Their book, warmly hailed by an impressive array of judges, child welfare professionals and others concerned with children, insists that the child's perspective must be controlling in any judicial proceedings to decide custody issues. In sum, we view much of what the authors say as extraordinarily helpful. The exhortation that courts would ordinarily do best to <b>leave</b> <b>well</b> <b>enough</b> <b>alone</b> [...] to distrust their capacities for bettering even apparently harmful family situations, and consequently to follow a policy of repose [...] is forcefully grounded and long overdue. But lawyers who understand and accept the authors' imperative concerns, whose highest value now in custody matters is keeping their clients out of court, may come to question this book for its failures to consider both the values [...] values to children as well as to their parents [...] of planning and compromise, and the impact of changed law upon behavior that does not presently come to court or find reflection in trouble cases. The book takes only the first, creative step towards important legal growth. So understood, its insights may mark the spot from which further analysis will occur. But initial creativity, the bold shift of perspective, must be channeled and refined before effective legal regimes can be shaped from it. That job remains to be done...|$|E
