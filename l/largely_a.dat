5|$|Zwingli's {{views on}} baptism were <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> {{response}} to Anabaptism, a movement which attacked {{the practice of}} infant baptism.

5|$|As of 2000, the {{population}} of Old Louisville was 11,043, of which 55.9% are white, 35.0% are black, 6.3% are listed as other, and 2.3% are Hispanic. College graduates are 24.5%, people without a high school degree are 22.6%, and people with college experience without a bachelor's degree are 28.4%. Females are 52.3% of {{the population}}, males are 47.7%. Households making less than $15,000 a year are 40.8%; although that is <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> function of the 27% of residents who are full-time college students. Ironically, Old Louisville has the youngest median age of any Louisville neighborhood and the highest percent of people {{between the ages of}} 20-29 (25%).|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success of experimental approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> {{result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, which is why all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E

5|$|Books are {{sometimes}} attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which {{feed on the}} covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage {{in the form of}} tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.|$|E
5|$|Both ships saw limited action during World War I, <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> {{result of}} the {{cautious}} strategies employed by the Regia Marina and its opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Nino Bixio {{was involved in the}} pursuit of a group of Austro-Hungarian raiders in December 1915, but did not engage them before they escaped. Marsala briefly battled Austro-Hungarian cruisers during the Battle of the Otranto Straits in May 1917. Both ships were sold for scrapping in the late 1920s, the victims of very tight naval budgets and their own poor performance.|$|E
5|$|Carrick Post Office {{opened on}} 5 November 1841. Carrick never grew large—the {{population}} varied from around 200 to 439—and {{today it is}} <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town. During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage, though reticulated services for both are now connected. Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply, from the Liffey, from 1961 and a sewerage plant {{was built in the}} mid-1970s on the towns outskirts. The local councils' strategic plan aims for the town to stay small with only infill development.|$|E

5|$|Coventry is {{an ancient}} city and a {{metropolitan}} borough in the West Midlands of England. The city's history dates back to at least the 11thcentury (CE), and by the 14thcentury, it was a thriving centre of commerce. Like several of the other monuments in the city, Coventry's city walls were erected {{towards the end of}} the 14th and the beginning of the 15thcenturies, though city walls served little defensive purpose by that time and were <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> status symbol.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} of Navenby {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, the post-war years saw numbers rise steeply. This increase can be directly linked to the 35-plus new houses built from the end of The Great War until the 1950s, as well as to other building projects from the 1970s onwards. Other post-war changes include the move away from a dependence on farming. Although Navenby continues to be surrounded by farms, it is now <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> dormitory village for Lincoln, Grantham and beyond. Figures from the 2001 census show that, out of a population of 1,666, almost 600 commute to work each day.|$|E
5|$|Takanohana was <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> yotsu-sumo wrestler, favouring {{techniques}} {{which involved}} grabbing his opponent's mawashi or belt. His preferred grip was migi-yotsu (right hand inside, left hand outside his opponent). His most common winning kimarite by far was yori-kiri, a simple force out, {{which accounted for}} 52 percent of his victories. He also regularly employed uwatenage, or overarm throw, {{and this was the}} technique he used to defeat Asashōryū in the second of their two meetings, in September 2002.|$|E

5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 was <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> failure, the blockships {{grounded}} too {{far from}} the channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties in poor weather. In anticipation of a raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
5|$|The South Circular Road (formally the A205 {{and often}} simply called the South Circular) in south London, England, {{is a major}} road that runs from the Woolwich Ferry in the east to the Chiswick Flyover in the west via Catford, Dulwich, Clapham Common, Wandsworth and Kew Bridge. Together with the North Circular Road and Woolwich Ferry, it makes a {{complete}} ring-road around Central London. The South Circular is <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> sequence of urban streets joined together, requiring several at-grade turns, and is frequently congested.|$|E
5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is <b>largely</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E
