Among these proteolytic systems, Lon protease {{is involved in}} the control of selective protein turnover in the mitochondrial matrix. In the absence of Lon, yeast cells have been shown to accumulate electron-dense inclusion bodies in the matrix space, to <b>loose</b> <b>integrity</b> of mitochondrial genome and to be respiratory deficient. In order to address the role of Lon in mitochondrial functionality in human cells, we have set up a HeLa cell line stably transfected with a vector expressing a shRNA under the control of a promoter which is inducible with doxycycline. We have demonstrated that reduction of Lon protease results in a mild phenotype in this cell line in contrast with what have been observed in other cell types such as WI- 38 fibroblasts. Nevertheless, deficiency in Lon protease led to an increase in ROS production and to an accumulation of carbonylated protein in the mitochondria. Our study suggests that Lon protease has a wide variety of targets and is likely to play different roles depending of the cell type...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} the {{nutrient}} emission from cage aquaculture systems (CAS) in coastal waters and its potential environmental impact on pelagic ecosystems. The nutrient emission from CAS can be estimated based on mass balance using feed use, fish production, nutrients in feed and fish, and digestibility of nutrient components as input data. CAS release inorganic nutrients (NH 4 and PO 4), particulate organic nutrients, and dissolved organic nutrients. Pelagic ecosystems are primarily affected by the inorganic nutri-ents. A typical Norwegian salmon farm producing 1000 tonnes fish per year generated an amount of nutrient wastes comparable to a community of 7, 500 to 10, 000 people, with highest emission rates during summer. 3 D hydrody-namic modelling is needed to estimate the dilution and transport of nutrients from CAS. Pelagic ecosystems have an inherent capacity of persistence, and smaller changes in nutrient input are mitigated through adaptive responses. There is an upper assimilation capacity above which pelagic ecosystems may <b>loose</b> <b>integrity.</b> The assimilation capacity of the pelagic ecosystem is medi-ated by two main mechanisms; the incorporation of nutrient in the organisms and a dilution process driven by hydrodynamics. There is a need for a system-atic waste management from aquaculture in the future.

In contrast to conventional solutions, which are well protected by standardized data access procedures, organizations tend to <b>loose</b> <b>integrity</b> of data when systems are outsourced to the cloud. Since the data is stored on the service provider’s storage they must ensure to overcome the threats against integrity of data and preventing its unauthorized disclosure. At the same time enterprises willing to outsource data storage should be mindful of the terms and conditions of their cloud contract. To maintain integrity and privacy of information it is encrypted and stored on the storage service. But if storage as well as encryption-decryption is performed by the same service, the administrator might {{have access to the}} data and corresponding keys. The aim {{of this study is to}} propose a model for secure cloud computing based on separate data storage from cryptographic process. Another way, the service is split into two: one service provider is proposed to be responsible for storage and another for its encryption-decryption; along with it both providers are different in order to ensure information security. It is also proposed that after the completion of encryption and decryption process, the service must not retain the data and the information must be encrypted first and then stored on the storage service...|$|E

After ischemia/reperfusion, this increased {{to an average}} of 27.4  ml oxygen per millimole of reabsorbed sodium in the vehicle group. A possible mechanism for this is that the renal tubular cells <b>loose</b> the <b>integrity</b> of the tight junctions due to ischemia and that NaK-ATPase redistributes to the apical membrane of tubular cells [40]. This in turn causes backward leakage of the reabsorbed sodium to the tubular lumen and faulty active transport of sodium from the intracellular domain to the urine [41]. If the function of the NaK-ATPase is intact, this will lead to increased oxygen-dependent transport of sodium without effective reabsorption. The PDNO-treated sheep displayed a significantly lower ratio between consumed oxygen and reabsorbed sodium, perhaps indicating less ischemic injury to tubular function.|$|R
40|$|Given {{the threat}} of {{terrorism}} involving toxic gasses, Draeger Safety, manufacturers of Breathing Apparatus (BA), found that the lung demand valve seal on their BA may <b>loose</b> <b>integrity</b> if exposed to particular gases over time. Watson managed a ‘design-with’ collaborative approach to fully understand the needs of the medical/safety professionals and the various international testing and certificating bodies. This led to an innovative solution involving an elastomeric baffle which could be stretched over the valve, directing the wearers exhaust air in a controlled path around the exterior of the product ensuring that the air around the seals was constantly moving, preventing build up of corrosive toxic gas. Having worked on previous medical design research products, looking at pulmonary function and lung targeted drug delivery, for clients such as Profile Therapeutics and AstraZeneca, Watson was able to apply these principles to the exhaust function of the wearer to eliminate the build up of gasses. Hewitt provided industrial design input to the project. The Draeger Lung Demand Valve (LDV) ‘Boot’ highlighted the value of design thinking as opposed to a more traditional engineering-led approach. The solution was simple, low cost, could be fitted to the full range of the company’s current valves and most importantly did not require the value to be re-certificated for safety. The project was a vehicle for Watson’s research interest and developing knowledge in the field of design driven innovation and IP. The design innovation approach, was capable of implementation and approval by Draeger in 3 months as opposed to 12 had a materials science approach been followed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Lining systems {{render a}} {{significant}} role in ensuring that waste materials are safely separated from the environment. Despite the advent of modern lining systems, compacted clay barriers or liners are {{regarded as one of the}} very significant components of lining system and are being used as a waste containment system in landfills which require insignificant infiltration. Compacted clay barriers made-up of soil minerals of low permeability characteristics are generally prone to damage: (i) for not meeting the required material characteristics, (ii) due to continuous differential settlements attributed to heterogeneous composition of municipal solid waste and sub-soil and (iii) low overburden in the case of top capping system. Differential settlements lead to bending and are critical for the behaviour of clay liners. As a result, the clay barrier could <b>loose</b> its <b>integrity</b> and sealing efficiency. The present study addresses the potential of biaxial geogrid layer as an alternative solution for restraining cracking of clay barrier at the onset of differential settlements. ...|$|R

Tensile strains and stresses can develop due to excessive non-uniform settlements within the liner components, {{as a result the}} mineral sealing layer could <b>loose</b> its <b>integrity</b> and sealing efficiency. Geosynthetic materials such as geogrids can be efficiently used as reinforcing elements within the mineral sealing layer to enhance its deformation behaviour. In the present study, the influence of geogrid inclusion in restraining cracks and crack propagation is evaluated due to soil-geogrid bond efficiency. Small-scale model tests are conducted under increased gravity conditions in Bochum geotechnical centrifuge by simulating non-uniform settlements of a landfill with the help of trap-door mechanism. Test results showed that the incorporation of geosynthetic reinforcement within the mineral sealing layer significantly influence its deformation behaviour and permeability of the liner systems. Further theoretical investigations are carried out to interpret the influence of geogrid reinforcement inclusion in limiting cracks and crack propagation. An analytical model was developed by keeping in view the analogous behaviour of soil-geogrid and concrete-steel interaction. Considering theoretical and model test results, an assessment procedure to check the performance of deformed reinforced mineral sealing layer is suggested. This can be used to select an ideal geogrid layer depending upon the extent of non-uniform settlements and sealing material characteristics. (orig.)

During prophase I, telomeres attach to the nuclear envelope (NE), but in Smc 1 β–/– meiocytes, one fifth of their telomeres fail to attach. This study reveals that SMC 1 β serves a specific role at telomeres, which is independent of its role in determining AE/SC length and loop extension. SMC 1 β is necessary to prevent telomere shortening, and SMC 3, present in all known cohesin complexes, properly localizes to telomeres only if SMC 1 β is present. Very prominently, telomeres in Smc 1 β–/– spermatocytes and oocytes <b>loose</b> their structural <b>integrity</b> and suffer a range of abnormalities.

40|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{apoptosis}} changes occur at the cell surface, which until now have remained difficult to recognize. One of these plasma membrane alterations is the translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) from the inner side of the plasma membrane to the outer layer, by which PS becomes exposed at the external surface of the cell. Annexin V is a Ca 2 + dependent phospholipid-binding protein with high affinity for PS. Hence this protein {{can be used as a}} sensitive probe for PS exposure upon the cell membrane. Translocation of PS to the external cell surface is not unique to apoptosis, but occurs also during cell necrosis. The difference between these two forms of cell death is that during the initial stages of apoptosis the cell membrane remains intact, while at the very moment that necrosis occurs the cell membrane <b>looses</b> its <b>integrity</b> and becomes leaky. Therefore the measurement of Annexin V binding to the cell surface as indicative for apoptosis has to be performed in conjunction with a dye exclusion test to establish integrity of the cell membrane. This paper describes the results of such an assay, as obtained in cultured HSB- 2 cells, rendered apoptotic by irradiation and in human lymphocytes, following dexamethasone treatment. Untreated and treated cells were evaluated for apoptosis by light microscopy, by measuring the amount of hypo-diploid cells using of DNA flow cytometry (FCM) and by DNA electrophoresis to establish whether or not DNA fragmentation had occurred. Annexin V binding was assessed using bivariate FCM, and cell staining was evaluated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -labelled Annexin V (green fluorescence), simultaneously with dye exclusion of propidium iodide (PI) (negative for red fluorescence). The test described, discriminates intact cells (FITC−/PI−), apoptotic cells (FITC+/PI−) and necrotic cells (FITC+/PI+). In comparison with existing traditional tests the Annexin V assay is sensitive and easy to perform. The Annexin V assay offers the possibility of detecting early phases of apoptosis before the loss of cell membrane integrity and permits measurements of the kinetics of apoptotic death in relation to the cell cycle. More extensive FCM will allow discrimination between different cell subpopulations, that may or may not be involved in the apoptotic process...|$|R
40|$|Small stable protein domains are {{attractive}} scaffolds for engineering affinity proteins {{due to their}} high tolerance to mutagenesis without <b>loosing</b> structural <b>integrity.</b> The albuminbinding domain is a 5 kDa three-helix bundle derived from the bacterial receptor Protein G with low-nanomolar affinity to albumin. In this thesis, the albumin-binding domain is explored as a scaffold for engineering novel affinity proteins with the possible benefit of combining a prolonged serum half-life with specific targeting in a single small scaffold protein. Previously, a library was created by randomizing surface-exposed residues in order to engineer affinity to a new target antigen {{in addition to the}} inherent albumin affinity. Here, phage display selections were separately performed against the tumor antigens ERBB 2 and ERBB 3. The ERBB 3 selection resulted in a panel of candidates that were found to have varying affinities to ERBB 3 in the nanomolar range, while still retaining a high affinity to albumin. Further characterization concluded that the clones also competed for binding to ERBB 3 with the natural activating ligand Heregulin. The selections against ERBB 2 resulted in sub-nanomolar affinities to ERBB 2 where the binding site was found to overlap with the antibody Trastuzumab. The binding sites on ABD to albumin and either target were found in both selections to be mutually exclusive, as increased concentrations of albumin reduced the level of binding to ERBB 2 or ERBB 3. An affinity-matured ERBB 2 binder, denoted ADAPT 6, which lacked affinity to albumin was evaluated as a radionuclide-labeled imaging tracer for diagnosing ERBB 2 -positive tumors. Biodistribution studies in mice showed a high renal uptake consistent with affinity proteins in the same size range and the injected ADAPT quickly localized to the implanted tumor. High contrast images could be generated and ERBB 2 -expressing tissue could be distinguished from normal tissue with high contrast, demonstrating the feasibility of the scaffold for use as diagnostic tool. In a fourth study, affinity maturation strategies using staphylococcal cell-surface display were evaluated by comparing two replicate selections and varying the stringency. A sub-nanomolar target concentration was concluded to be inappropriate for equilibrium selection as the resulting output was highly variable between replicates. In contrast, equilibrium sorting at higher concentrations followed by kinetic-focused off-rate selection resulted in high output overlap between attempts and a clear correlation between affinity and enrichment.

40|$|Although ice {{sheets are}} {{valuable}} paleo-climate archives, they can <b>loose</b> their <b>integrity</b> by ice flow (Faria et al. 2010). Consequently, understanding the dynamic processes {{that control the}} flow of ice is essential when investigating the past and future climate. While recent research successfully modelled the microdynamics of pure ice (e. g. Montagnat et al., 2014; Llorens et al., 2015), work taking into account second phases is scarce. Only a few studies also show the microstructural influence of air inclusions (Azuma et al., 2012, Roessiger et al., 2014). Therefore, modelling was performed focussing on {{the implications of the}} presence of bubbles on the microdynamical mechanisms and microstructure evolution. The full-field theory crystal plasticity code (FFT) of Lebensohn (2001), was coupled to the 2 D multi-process modelling platform Elle (Bons et al., 2008), following the approach by Griera et al. (2013). FFT calculates the viscoplastic response of polycrystalline materials deforming by dislocation glide, taking into account mechanical anisotropy. The models further incorporate surface- and stored strain energy driven grain boundary migration (GBM) and intracrystalline recovery simulating annihilation and rearrangement of dislocations by reduction of internal misorientations. GBM was refined for polyphase materials following Becker et al. (2008) and Roessiger et al. (2014). Additionally, the formation of new high angle grain boundaries by nucleation and polygonisation based on critical internal misorientations has been implemented. Successively running the codes for different processes in very short numerical timesteps effectively enables multi-process modelling of deformation and concurrent recrystallisation. Results show how air inclusions control and increase strain localisation, leading to locally enhanced dynamic recrystallisation. This is in compliance with Faria et al. (2014), who theoretically predicted these localizations based on firn data from EPICA Dronning Maud Land (EDML) ice core. We propose that strain localisation has a strong control on the dominating recrystallisation mechanisms and can account for microstructural observations from alpine and polar ice cores. Our results confirm dynamic recrystallisation occurring in the uppermost levels of ice sheets as observed by Kipfstuhl et al. (2009) and Weikusat et al. (2009) in EDML core. Azuma, N., et al.

40|$|The 25 {{amino acids}} long, transmembrane {{fragment}} of the Influenza virus M 2 protein forms a homotetrameric channel that transports protons across lipid bilayers. It has been postulated that high efficiency and selectivity {{of this process}} is due to gating by four histidine residues that occlude the channel lumen in the closed state. Two mechanisms of gating have been postulated. In one mechanism, the proton is "shuttled" through the gate by attaching to the delta nitrogen atom on the extracellular side of the imidazole ring, followed by the release of the proton attached to the epsilon nitrogen atom on the opposite side. In the second mechanism, the four histidines move away from each other due to electrostatic repulsion upon protonation, thus opening the gate sufficiently that a wire of water molecules can penetrate the gate. Then, protons are transported by "hopping" along the wire. In this paper, both mechanisms are evaluated in a series of molecular dynamics simulations by investigating stability of different protonation states of the channel that are involved in these mechanisms. For the shuttle mechanism, these are states with all epsilon protonated histidines, one biprotonated residue or one histidine protonated in the delta position. For the gate opening mechanism, this is the state in which all four histidines are biprotonated. In addition, a state with two biprotonated histidines is considered. For each system, composed of the protein channel embedded in phospholipid bilayer located between two water lamellae, a molecular dynamics trajectory of approximately 1. 3 ns (after equilibration) was obtained. It is found that the states involved in the shuttle mechanism are stable during the simulations. Furthermore, the orientations and dynamics of water molecules near the gate are conducive to proton transfers involved in the shuttle. In contract, the fully biprotonated state, implicated in the gate opening mechanism, is not stable and the channel <b>looses</b> its structural <b>integrity.</b> If only two histidines are biprotonated the channel deforms but remains intact with the gate mostly closed. In summary, {{the results of this study}} lend support to the shuttle mechanism but not to the gate opening mechanism of proton gating in M 2...|$|R
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. A {{series of experiments}} were performed to determine the mechanism of failure in compressively loaded laminated plates {{in the presence of}} stress gradients generated by a circular cutout. Real time holographic interferometry and in-situ photomicrography of the hole surface, were used to observe the progression of failure. The test specimens are multi-layered composite flat plates, which are loaded in compression. The plates are made of two material systems, T 300 /BP 907 and IM 7 / 8551 - 7. Two different lay-ups of T 300 /BP 907 and four different lay-ups of IM 7 / 8551 - 7 are investigated. The load on the specimen is slowly increased and a series of interferograms are produced during the load cycle. These interferograms are video-recorded. The results obtained from the interferograms and photo-micrographs are substantiated by sectioning studies and ultrasonic C-scanning of some specimens which are unloaded prior to catastrophic failure, but beyond failure initiation. This is made possible by the servo-controlled loading mechanism that regulates the load application and offers the flexibility of unloading a specimen at any given instance in the loadtime history. An underlying objective of the present investigation is the identification of the physics of the failure initiation process. This required testing specimens with different stacking sequences, for a fixed hole diameter, so that consistent trends in the failure process could be identified. It is revealed that the failure is initiated as a localized instability in the 0 ? plies at the hole surface, approximately at right angles to the loading direction. This instability emanating at the hole edge and propagating into the interior of the specimen within the 0 ? plies is found to be fiber microbuckling. The microbuckling is found to occur at a local strain level of [ [...] . ] 8600 [mu]strain at the hole edge for the IM material system. This initial failure renders a narrow zone of fibers within the 0 ? plies to <b>loose</b> structural <b>integrity.</b> Subsequent to the 0 ?-ply failure, extensive delamination cracking is observed with increasing load. The through thickness location of these delaminations is found to depend on the position of the 0 ? plies. The delaminated portions spread to the undamaged areas of the laminate by a combination of delamination buckling and growth, the buckling further enhancing the growth. When the delaminated area reaches a critical size, about 75 - 100 % of the hole radius in extent, an accelerated growth rate of the delaminated portions is observed. The culmination of this last event is the complete loss of flexural stiffness of each of the delaminated portions leading to catastrophic failure of the plate. The levels of applied load and the rate at which these events occur depend on the plate stacking sequence. A simple mechanical model is presented for the microbuckling problem. This model addresses the buckling instability of a semi-infinte layered half-plane alternatingly stacked with fibers and matrix, loaded parallel {{to the surface of the}} half-plane. The fibers are modelled using Bernoulli-Navier beam theory, and the matrix is assumed to be a linearly elastic foundation. The predicted buckling strains are found to overestimate the experimental result. However, the dependence of the buckling strain on parameters such as the fiber volume fraction, ratio of Youngs moduli of the constituents and Poisson's ratio of the matrix are obtained from the analysis. It is seen that a high fiber volume fraction, increased matrix stiffness, and perfect bonding between fiber and matrix are desirable properties for increasing the compressive strength...|$|R
40|$|A common value-loaded {{language}} (buzzwords) in {{the development}} aid paradigm is critized for creating a gap between rhetoric and reality. Partnership {{is one of these}} concepts used by donors, from multilateral organisations like the United Nations, to bilateral cooperation between states and as focused on in this thesis, in relations between North and South Non Governmental Organizations. The debates and discussions regarding the development aid strategies change with time, as shown in the short outline of the history of development aid (chapter one). Development aid can be crucial for some recipient countries, as in this case study from Mali in French speaking West Africa (chapter three). There is a need and a requirement in the partnership discourse to work together with local partners. But the label partnership is often used for various types of cooperation. The degree of independence, either economically or in the political decisions for the South partner, can be high or low depending on their institutional strength when meeting a donor, the North partner. In the concept of partnership, according to the definition and the rhetoric, equality is highlighted. The challenge is then for the North partner to be able to let the South partner be in the driving seat, {{but at the same time}} stick to the conditionalites that they may have when engaging in partnerships. The object of this master thesis, written in French, is to study the concept of partnership as a guiding line {{in the development}} aid. The thesis is exploring the theory behind the rhetoric of the concept partnership by trying to illuminate the discourse in the academic world and other case studies on development aid cooperation (chapter two). The theory is then compared to an empirical study of a project funded by CARE Norway in the framework of a partnership strategy elaborated by CARE international in Mali. In this case the international NGO, CARE, is working together with three local Malian partner NGOs. The case study is based on two months in Mali and the data is mainly collected from interviews with representatives working for three partner organisations selected by CARE international in Mali and from observation of workshops between other NGOs, members of the local government and the local communities (chapter five). I argue that the language and the concepts used in the development aid strategies are important for the practice and that if there is not a common understanding between North and South partners then the gap between rhetoric and reality may damage the sustainability. I also touch upon the fact that the partnership discourse is often in French or English in the documents, while the beneficiaries for the most part are illiterate and speak Malian languages. However, the empirical study showed that there is a relative common understanding of the concept of partnership in Mali, but the ambitions of achieving equality and participation at every stage of a partnership is not as explicit in practice as in the documents and the definitions of the concept. Nor is the critique against this concept as a paternalistic approach as pertinent in Mali as the critique outlined in the theory. It is more seen as a way of working towards more participation and independent Malian NGOs in the future, but today there are several ways of combining the partnership concept with certain conditional ties, capacity building, one-way funding and making the beneficiaries more responsible. The consequences of North organisations looking for local organisations for partnering may be creating local NGOs since there is a demand for partners. The challenge seems to be how to accomplish a North South partnership cooperation without <b>loosing</b> organizational <b>integrity,</b> without undermining the State s authority and to make sure that the beneficiaries are also playing a role in this institutionalization The donors utilising the partnership concept also need to take into account that beneficiaries more often than not illiterate and do not necessarily follow the international development aid logic if this discourse is predominantly in French or in English. My conclusion in this thesis is that the development aid rhetoric has gone from working for the beneficiary to working together with the beneficiary, even though partnership in practice is not as clearly defined as in the development rhetoric. The continuously changing concepts and labelling in the development aid strategies are thus making way for less paternalistic approaches...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of protons across membranes {{is an essential}} process for both bioenergetics of modem cells and the origins of cellular life. All living systems make use of proton gradients across cell walls to convert environmental energy into a high-energy chemical compound, adenosine triphosphate (ATR), synthesized from adenosine diphosphate. ATR, in turn, {{is used as a}} source of energy to drive many cellular reactions. The ubiquity of this process in biology suggests that even the earliest cellular systems were relying on proton gradient for harvesting environmental energy needed to support their survival and growth. In contemporary cells, proton transfer is assisted by large, complex proteins embedded in membranes. The issue addressed in this study was: how the same process can be accomplished with the aid of similar, but much simpler molecules that could have existed in the protobiological milieu? The model system used in the study contained a bilayer membrane made of phospholipid, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), which is a good model of the biological membranes focusing cellular boundaries. Both sides of the bilayer were surrounded by water which simulated the environment inside and outside the cell. Embedded in the membrane was a fragment of the Influenza-A M 2 protein and enough sodium counterions to maintain system neutrality. This protein has been shown to exhibit remarkably high rates of proton transport and, therefore, is an excellent model to study the formation of proton gradients across membranes. The Influenza M 2 protein is 97 amino acids in length, but a fragment 25 amino acids long, which contains a transmembrane domain of 19 amino acids flanked by 3 amino acids on each side, is sufficient to transport protons. Four identical protein fragments, each folded into a helix, aggregate to form small channels spanning the membrane. Protons are conducted through a narrow pore {{in the middle of the}} channel in response to applied voltage. This channel is large enough to contain water molecules, and is normally filled with water. In analogy to the mechanism of proton transfer in some other channels, it has been postulated that protons are translocated along the network of water molecules filling the pore of the channel. This mechanism, however, must involve an additional, important step because the channel contains four histidine amino acid residues, one from each of the helices, which are sufficiently large to occlude the pore and interrupt the water network. The histidine residues ensure channel selectivity by blocking {{transport of}} small such as sodium or potassium. They have been also implicated in gating protons due to the ability of each histidine to become positively charged by accepting an additional proton. Two mechanisms of gating have been proposed. In one mechanism, all four histidines acquire an additional proton and, due to repulsion between their positive charges, move away from one another, thus opening the channel. The alternative mechanism relies of the ability of protons to move between different atoms in a molecule (tautomerization). Thus, a proton is captured on one side of the gate while another proton is released from the opposite side, and the molecule returns to the initial state through tautomerization. The simulations were designed to test these two mechanisms. Large-scale, atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations of the channel, in which the histidine residues were in different protonation states revealed that all intermediate states of the system involved in the tautomerization mechanism are structurally stable and the arrangement of water molecules in the channel is conducive to the proton transport. In contrast, in the four-protonated state, postulated to exist in the gate-opening mechanism, the electrostatic repulsion between the histidine residues appears to be so large that the channel <b>looses</b> its structural <b>integrity</b> and one helix moves away from the remaining three. This result indicates that such a mechanism of proton transport is unlikely. The simulations revealed that translocation along a network of water molecules in the channel and tautomerization of the histidine residues in the M 2 proteins in the most likely mechanism of proton transport. The results not only explain how a remarkably simple protein system can efficiently aid in the formation of proton gradients across cell walls, but also suggest how this system can be genetically re-engineered to become a directional, reversible proton pump. Such a pump can provide energy to laboratory-built models of simple cellular systems. If they were successfully constructed it would greatly advance our understanding of the beginnings of life and find important applications in medicine and pharmacology...|$|R
