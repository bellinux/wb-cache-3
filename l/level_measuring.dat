The variation of the normalized rms disturbance levels with stagnation pressure indicated that transition occurred in the boundary layer on the nozzle wall and influenced the outputs of the instruments located at the exit of the nozzle when the total pressure was about 35 N/sq cm. Below this pressure the disturbance levels decreased markedly. At higher pressures the disturbances were predominantly aerodynamic noise generated by the turbulent boundary layer on the nozzle wall...|$|R
50|$|Gili Trawangan is {{the largest}} of Lombok's Gili Islands {{and the only one}} to rise {{significantly}} (30 m) above sea <b>level.</b> <b>Measuring</b> 3 km long and 2 km wide, it has a population of around 1500 (see demography). The name Trawangan originates from the Indonesian word Terowongan (Tunnel) due to the presence of a cave tunnel built there during Japanese occupation in World War 2. Of the Gilis, Trawangan is the most developed and geared towards tourism. The main concentration of settlement, recreation, accommodation and diving business is situated on {{the eastern side of the}} island. A local pub, Tîr na Nôg claims that Trawangan is the smallest island in the world with an Irish pub. It was previously administered under Lombok Barat Regency along with Senggigi until 2010 when the Gili islands came under the jurisdiction of the new North Lombok Regency (Kabupaten Lombok Utara).|$|E
5000|$|International Noise Awareness Day is {{a global}} campaign, founded in 1996 by the Center of Hearing and Communication (CHC), aiming to raise {{awareness}} of noise on the welfare and health of people. Noise affects people in many ways, but only deafness and annoyance receive actual interest from the general public. Worldwide, People are called upon to take part via various actions on this occasion: open days on hearing from acousticians, lectures in public health departments, universities and schools, panels of experts, noise <b>level</b> <b>measuring</b> actions, and readings.The day is commemorated on the last Wednesday of April of every year. Activities aimed at creating a focus not only on noise but on means to reduce the noise, are organized in several countries all over the world, such as in Brazil, Chile, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United States of America. In recent years there have been related events initiated in Asia, including Singapore and Australia.|$|E

Along the central column are three standoff arms measuring 3 meters long, 2.5 meters long, and 2 meters long, respectively. The standoff arms can be relocated up and down the central column during maintenance. Light collectors are at the ends of the standoff arms and {{at the top of the}} antenna column. The antenna column includes Global Positioning System (GPS), very high frequency (VHF), and cellular telephone antennas. Computers, communications, and control electronics occupy the float canister. A marine optical system (MOS), a power system, and batteries occupy the instrument canister. The MOS includes spectrographs with charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors, an optical multiplexer, and fiber optic sensor lines to the light collectors.|$|E

The middle of her thee brothers Johnny lived in Frankfurt Germany married Doris and had a son named Lakis in 1968. All of her other three siblings lived in Los Angeles. Her oldest brother Nicholas married Lois Dale Johnson; they had two children, William Petropoulos born July 17, 1963, and Cynthia Chrysa Louise born February 7, 1966. The youngest of the brothers George married to Soula had one daughter Mary, born march 23, 1962. Maria was very close with all of her family. Lois and Nicholas divorced in 1970. When Maria got divorced in 1971 she invited Lois and her children to live with her in Reseda California. The three cousins were very close in age and were thriving. Maria’s son Randy was a super intelligent child, his IQ <b>level</b> <b>measuring</b> over 160, put him in a category of a genius. The gifted programs of Tarzana elementary school were not enough for him, so he was enrolled in a science program, and bussed at a local university. Randy attended UCLA at 8 years of age till 12. He died suddenly on July 14, 1981. A cause for his death was never determined. After the autopsy and many biopsies, four months later on Thanksgiving day, a death certificate was finally issued bearing the results; UNKNOWN AND UNDETERMINED CAUSES. Maria’s sister Emerald and husband Takis Sarris, live now in Greece. Brothers Nicholas, Johnny, and their parents have all past on.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the tree}} is leaning, measure the {{circumference}} at 4+1/2 ft along the axis of the trunk. The distance should be measured {{along the side of}} the trunk from the base point of the center of the tree. The measurement is taken at a right (90 degree) angle to the trunk. Some groups recommend measuring the girth at breast height on the upper side when {{the tree is}} on a slope rather than from midpoint on the slope. One example is the Tree Register in the UK. [...] There are advantages to either option. Measuring on the upslope side if often easier, it is also higher on the tree and likely will include less of the flare at the base of the trunk, and when measuring extremely large trunk on a slope the upslope side of the girth loop will always be above ground <b>level.</b> <b>Measuring</b> the girth from a reference point at midslope also has advantages. Consider, the tree started as a single sprout and grew upward and outward from that point. This is the point where the pith of the tree would intersect the ground surface supporting the tree. This is the logical base point from which to measure the height of the tree and by extension the girth should be measured with respect to the same base point. This point is fixed at the same location over time as the tree grows. In addition this is a reference point that is present and consistent in all trees no matter the height of the girth measurement. Even if the girth is measured at a non- standard height because of low branching, a large burl, or even on the upslope side of a large girth tree on sloping ground, all heights can still be consistently referenced to this single point present on all trees. Measuring midpoint on the slope is the recommended option.|$|E
