Firstly, whether the {{defendants}} were liable for the actions of the contractors and secondly, whether the defendants were liable for the damage regardless of their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> They decided for the first point that the defendants were not liable, but more split on the second point. Pollock CB, Martin B and Channell B held that the defendants were not liable, as since a negligence claim could not be brought there was no valid case. Bramwell B, dissenting, argued that the claimant had the right to enjoy his land free of interference from water, and that as a result the defendant was guilty of trespass and the commissioning of a nuisance. He stated that [...] "the general law in matters wholly independent of contract" [...] should be that the defendants were liable, [...] "on the plain ground that the defendants have caused water to flow into the 's mines, which but for the defendant's act would not have gone there".|$|E

30|$|Among {{the factors}} that result in hidden {{failures}} of relay protection equipment, there is no <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> human <b>negligence</b> or errors, production quality of devices, devices management & maintenance, etc. These factors usually have effects on the fitness of software/hardware system and control scheme of the secondary equipment to the grid operation mode at that time. Throughout all processes of protection hidden failure modeling, there are two ideas. One which is often used {{is to work out}} hidden failure probability of relay protection devices and how it changes with the electric parameters (voltage, current, and line power flow) by taking the equipment’s software/hardware and control scheme into account. The other one is to work out hidden failure probability by considering the relay protection as a whole. These modeling processes only reflect the consequences <b>of</b> human <b>negligence</b> or errors, production quality of devices, equipment management & maintenance, etc., but don’t embody how these factors affect protection hidden failure probability.

In retrospect, the withdrawal was carried out with great skill and although parts of the artillery's guns were left behind, the Danish army did arrive almost undamaged to the new position. Historians have argued that if the army had not been withdrawn, the Danevirke position would have been overrun, and even the commission appointed by the cabinet to investigate and document the reasons for abandoning Danevirke acquitted de Meza completely in its report of March 10, 1864 and blamed the War Ministry for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> preparation and <b>negligence.</b> He died several months after the war ended.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} two claims are widely accepted: first, the ordinary {{principles of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> imply recovery for economic loss limited only by foreseeability and, second, such recovery is unacceptable.

40|$|In this chapter, I {{compare the}} role of the creditor’s (promisee’s) conduct in {{contractual}} relationships in US and European legal systems. Different approaches to comparative negligence and mitigation are first considered, and then a more general analysis of doctrines dealing with the creditor’s position in the contractual relationship and {{the role of}} cooperation is carried out. In this area, legal systems display significant divergences – partly rooted in their historical antecedents, and partly related to different concepts of contracts and contractual relationships. Continental European systems (with significant differences between Germany and France) recognize a strong role for comparative negligence and the duty to cooperate, while common law jurisdictions (with important differences between England and the US) limit the scope <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> and the duty to cooperate whilst attributing a wider role to the duty to mitigate In this chapter I have shown that the great divergence concerning the rule <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> in contract law between England and the US on the one hand, and among European continental systems with the exception of France on the other, needs to be rethought. A wider range of doctrines beyond mitigation should be considered on the ground that they act, at least partially, as functional equivalents to comparative negligence. The divergence is reduced if we move away from specific doctrines to the general principle of creditor’s cooperation. This cooperation is relevant in many doctrines of contract law in the US, and to a lesser extent, England, although it has different scope in these legal systems. In England, where comparative negligence has limited application, the doctrines of causation and foreseeability provide some recognition of creditor’s conduct and apportionment of losses The narrow and very limited recognition of the rule <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> in the US is ‘compensated’ for by reference to other apportionment techniques in different doctrines such as those fostering reasonable reliance, mitigation and foreseeability. The potential explanation for these divergences may vary if we consider the rule <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> or the principle of creditor’s cooperation and its apportionment of losses regime as encompassing different doctrines. The recognition of the principle, under different doctrines but with different weight, does not eliminate the divergence, rather forces us to rethink its reasons. The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> in the US, when considered along with the deployment of other forms of risksharing and apportionment of losses stemming from breach of contract, conforms to the idea that contract law is mainly directed at risk allocation. In European continental systems, the recognition of a general rule <b>of</b> comparative <b>negligence</b> and mitigation delineates a general principle based on the law of obligations, applicable to both contract and tort. Contractual relationships are generally characterized by a legal framework fostering higher level of cooperation including re-allocation between time of contract and time of performance. These divergences have been explained with reference to different business practices and community norms which legal systems have internalized. This ‘sociological’ perspective can partly shed light on these divergences but needs to be complemented by {{a deeper understanding of the}} core function of contract law and business rules...|$|R
40|$|Rediscovering the Law <b>of</b> <b>Negligence</b> {{offers a}} {{systematic}} and theoretical {{exploration of the}} law <b>of</b> <b>negligence.</b> Its aim is to re-establish the notion that thinking about the law ought to and can proceed {{on the basis of}} principle. As such, it is opposed to the prevalent modern view that the various aspects of the law are and must be based on individual policy decisions and that the task of the judge or commentator is to shape the law in terms of the relevant policies as she sees them. The book, then, is an attempt to re-establish the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> as a body of law rather than as a branch of politics. The book argues that the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> is best understood in terms of a relatively small set of principles enunciated in a small number of leading cases. It further argues that these principles are themselves best seen in terms of an aspect of morality called corrective justice which, when applied to the most important aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> reveals that the law - even as it now exists - possesses a far greater degree of conceptual unity than is commonly thought. Using this method the author is able to examine familiar aspects of the law <b>of</b> <b>negligence</b> such as the standard of care; the duty of care; remoteness; misfeasance; economic loss; negligent misrepresentation; the liability of public bodies; wrongful conception; nervous shock; the defences <b>of</b> contributory <b>negligence,</b> voluntary assumption <b>of</b> risk, and illegality; causation; and issues concerning proof, to show that when the principles are applied and the idea of corrective justice is properly understood then the law appears both systematic and conceptually satisfactory.
