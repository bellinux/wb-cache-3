40|$|Laboratories in {{the federal}} Laender {{detected}} plasticisers in around 190 food samples from jars with twist-off lids, above all in oil-containing foods like pasta sauces and pesto. The sub-stances migrate from the <b>lid</b> <b>seals</b> of the jars to food and in many samples they exceeded the limits envisaged within the EU for plasticisers. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a health assessment of the contaminated foods and supplements the findings from its 2005 Opinion. Plasticisers are used by industry in order to render plastics like PVC pliable. In addition to <b>lid</b> <b>seals,</b> they are used in many different ways: in carpets, cable insulation, toys or cling film. As plasticisers are not chemically bound to PVC, they may be dissolved or gassed out when they {{come into contact with}} liquids or fats. The toxic properties of plasticisers differ from sub-stance to substance. The EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) undertook health assessments of individual substances and estab-lished tolerable daily intakes (TDIs). In its exposure assessment, BfR comes {{to the conclusion that the}} TDIs for various plasticis-ers are, in some cases, considerably exceeded through the consumption of the foods exam-ined, and that the consumption of these foods can harm health. This applies above all to ex-posure to the plasticiser, DEHP. This is particularly worrying because consumers ingest plas-ticisers not only from food packaging but from many other products. BfR, therefore, recommends foregoing the use of plasticisers which, like DEHP, have particu-larly harmful properties when in contact with food and replacing them with less harmful sub-stitutes. Furthermore, the data available on the incidence of plasticisers like DEHA and DINCH in food, for instance as a consequence of their use in cling film, should be improved in order to be able to better estimate the overall exposure of consumers...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a gastight manner for chemical applications using a <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all gastight at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC. This was achieved with high reproducibility by a composition in the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - CaO-K 2 O quaternary system. The ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> is selectively crystallized by adequate temperature control and shows then the required high temperature resistance. The strengths achieved are sufficient for the planned application as a sealing material for a ceramic microreactor. The temperature cycling resistance and the thermal shock resistance are also adapted to Al 2 O 3. Additional tests of commercial glass sealants were carried out to evaluate the results obtained.

40|$|Break-up {{events in}} ice shelves {{have been studied}} {{extensively}} during the last years. One popular assumption links disintegration events to surface melting of the ice shelf in conjunction with growing melt-water ponds, leading to hydro-fracture. As this explanation only holds during warm seasons [1], the possibility of frost wedging as forcing mechanism for autumn and winter break-up events is considered. Frost wedging can only occur if a closed ice <b>lid</b> <b>seals</b> the water inside the crack. Hence, the present study of frost wedging in a single crack uses ice lid thicknesses to evaluate the additional pressure on the crack faces. The investigation of the resulting stress intensity factor {{as a measure of}} crack criticality follows consequently. The results show that freezing water inside a crack can result in unstable crack growth of an initially stable water filled crack...|$|R

50|$|Before the {{pressure}} cooker <b>lid</b> is <b>sealed</b> airtight, the internal air {{has to be}} mostly replaced by steam. Steam has a much higher specific heat than air, {{and the presence of}} steam rather than air inside {{the pressure}} cooker is how it's able to transfer sufficient heat into the parts of the food that aren't submerged in liquid, such as a pot roast. If the <b>lid</b> is <b>sealed</b> before enough air has been removed, not enough heat can be transferred to the food, and food may be undercooked; the presence of air would make the food cook more like it's in an oven than a pressure cooker. To remove the air, steam is vented for several minutes to replace the volume of air inside the cooker. This is why a pressure cooker takes about 10 minutes to reach pressure. For pressure cookers with a weight, the weight is placed over the steam vent pipe while steam is being emitted, to ensure the air inside has escaped. The newer generation pressure cookers, which have no weights, automatically expel air from inside for several minutes before a coloured pop-up indicator pin rises to <b>seal</b> the <b>lid</b> airtight; pressure then builds in the now airtight cooker. If the pressure cooker is already hot or a stovetop pressure cooker is placed on a very strong heat source - such as induction on too high a setting, the <b>lid</b> can <b>seal</b> airtight too quickly before the air inside has been removed. In these situations, a slightly lower heat setting can be used to allow the water to boil slower in order to vent the air.|$|R
