In this paper the feasibility of three different vibration absorbers is discussed when reducing transient vibrations originating from sudden load changes. The classical <b>linear</b> <b>absorber</b> is compared to two nonlinear ones, one with a cubic spring (known as the nonlinear energy sink or NES) and one {{with a combination of}} a linear and a cubic spring (a Duffing type absorber). Both nonlinear absorbers succeed in achieving a multimodal vibration reduction, whereas the <b>linear</b> <b>absorber</b> can only mitigate a single vibration mode. The most important reduction is however obtained in the initial phase where the energy of one vibration mode is decreased through a beating phenomenon. A much slower energy reduction of the remaining vibration modes takes place after this initial phase. As a result, both the NES and the Duffing type absorber still need to be tuned to the most important mode, despite their ability to mitigate multiple modes...|$|E
40|$|Passive or {{semi-active}} systems {{exhibit a}} {{great potential for}} structural vibration mitigation because of low-power consumption requirements, fault-tolerance characteristics, and low-maintenance costs. In addition, they can be easily retrofitted into existing structures while maintaining the global structural flexibility. In the area of passive systems design, the concept of augmenting the original system with an auxiliary subsystem (comprised of an attached mass with a visco-elastic device or a pendulum-like system) dates back to several centuries ago. Den Hartog (1934) {{was the first to}} effectively design a linear vibration absorber based on an optimal frequency tuning condition and optimum damping coefficient. For harmonic or narrow-band excitations, the <b>linear</b> <b>absorber</b> allows significant abatement of vibrational energy. However, in the presence of mistuning of the absorber (either frequency- and/or damping-wise) or in the presence of broad-band excitations, the <b>linear</b> <b>absorber</b> performance is significantly degraded. As a mean to overcome the drawbacks of the linear visco-elastic TMD, the effectiveness of a hysteretic device - delivering the restoring force in the auxiliary system - has been investigated in (Lacarbonara and Vestroni, 2003). A large number of materials exhibits the potential for implementation in hysteretic devices such as suitably arranged traditional elastic-perfectly plastic materials (e. g., structural steel) or innovative materials (e. g., shape-memory materials, high-damping hysteretic rubbers, or polymeric materials with embedded carbon-nanotube dispersions). The present investigations, based on a parametric study of different material parameters characterizing softening, hardening or quasi-linear behaviors, show that the levels of vibration reduction achieved near resonance may be enhanced for appropriate hysteretic characteristics. Moreover, the system sensitivity to mistuning is reduced thereby rendering the proposed passive system more robust, and the TMD strokes are sensibly reduced with respect to linear TMDs. The feasibility of the hystertic TMDs is investigated considering multi-story buildings of low and high rise...|$|E

Passive <b>linear</b> vibration <b>absorbers</b> are purpose-built, often designed using Den Hartog’s equal-peak strategy.

The NLTVA design aims at ensuring equal peaks in the nonlinear receptance function for an as large as possible range of forcing amplitudes, hence generalizing Den Hartog’s method to nonlinear systems. Our focus in this study is on experimental demonstration of the NLTVA performance using a primary structure consisting of a cantilever beam with a geometrically nonlinear component at its free end.

40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} a {{nonlinear}} energy sink (NES) with relatively small mass on the dynamics of a coupled system under periodic forcing {{in the vicinity of}} a main (1 : 1) resonance is studied theoretically and experimentally. It is demonstrated that over a range of amplitudes of the external forcing the damped system exhibits a quasiperiodic vibration regime, rather than the steady-state response reported in earlier publications. This regime is related to attraction of the dynamical flow to a damped-forced nonlinear normal mode (NNM) of the system and hysteretic motion of the flow in the vicinity of this mode.

A possible means to mitigate the re-sulting vibration amplitudes is the attachment of a vibration absorber. As the classical <b>linear</b> <b>absorber</b> is only efficient for a single vibration mode, a strongly nonlinear variant has re-cently been proposed allowing a multimodal vibration reduction. An important feature of this nonlinear absorber is the existence of different energy thresholds for each vibration mode, be-low which no efficient vibration reduction is possible. Therefore, as a first step of a design procedure, we examine in detail these thresholds and their influencing parameters. When one vibration mode dominates the response, the analysis can be reduced to that of a harmonically excited single DOF system. By nondimensionalizing this system, it appears that only one di-mensionless parameter comprises all the influencing parameters of the energy thresholds which greatly simplifies the analysis. This result can facilitate the design procedure of the nonlinear vibration absorber when dealing with multimodal responses...|$|E

40|$|The {{vibrational}} {{power flow}} {{characteristics of a}} two-degree-of-freedom system are investigated to examine the performance of nonlinear absorbers in vibration attenuation of nonlinear primary oscillators. The nonlinearities in the oscillator {{and those in the}} absorber are both characterised by cubic restoring and damping forces. Both analytical approximations and numerical integrations are used to obtain time-averaged power flow variables, as well as kinetic energies of the system. Power absorption ratio and the kinetic energy of the nonlinear oscillator are proposed to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of nonlinear absorbers with respect to the existing nonlinearities in the oscillator. Comparing with <b>linear</b> <b>absorbers,</b> it is found that softening (hardening) stiffness absorber provides benefits for vibration mitigation of a hardening (softening) stiffness primary oscillator by enhancing power absorption efficiency and reducing the kinetic energy of the oscillator so that the functioning frequency range of the absorber can be enlarged.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{performance of}} centrifugally-driven, order-tuned absorbers is investigated for vibration reduction of a cyclic rotating flexible structure under traveling wave (TW) engine or-der excitation. A key finding from previous {{work by the}} authors using a linearized model is {{the existence of a}} no-resonance zone, that is, an entire range of absorber designs that avoid system res-onance for any rotation speed. Linearization is generally valid for the rotating structure but absorber motions can become large for typical loading conditions. This work generalizes the linear results to account for large-amplitude, nonlinear absorber mo-tions. Existence and stability of the steady-state TW response to TW excitation are investigated in terms of the absorber path de-sign, which fixes its linear and nonlinear tuning characteristics. A TW response is unique for the linearized system and is shown to exist for the weakly nonlinear model. The nonlinear model exhibits the usual characteristics of a weakly nonlinear system, including bistability and the attendant hysteresis near resonance. More significantly, no additional instabilities associated with the symmetry could be identified. Hence the desired TW response is robust to nonlinear absorber effects and can be described by an equivalent model, which is obtained by reduction using the symmetry.
