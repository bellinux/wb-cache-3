25|$|At {{eight years}} old, Mercury began taking dance lessons, {{particularly}} classical ballet, jazz, and African dances. At age 13, {{influenced by the}} work of Elis Regina, she decided to become a singer. Her repertoire consisted of bossa nova as well as the music of Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, and Chico Buarque. To her parents' unease she started singing in local bars in 1980. She made her trio elétrico debut soon afterward, during the 1981 carnival. Mercury's zeal for dance eventually <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Federal University of Bahia, where she enrolled in the Dance School in 1984. A year later she married electronic engineer Zalther Póvoas and gave birth to Gabriel Almeida Póvoas. The next year she gave birth to daughter Giovana Almeida Póvoas.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste {{no time at all}} in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests that they need to come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E

500|$|Academic Christian Potschka {{described}} [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] {{as part of}} {{a decade}} of [...] "unprecedented conflict between government and broadcasters over ... investigative documentaries". Margaret Thatcher [...] "utterly rejected" [...] the findings of the Windlesham–Rampton report. After the reforms brought in by the Broadcasting Act 1990, the process of bidding for ITV franchises was overhauled in an attempt to introduce greater competition. In the subsequent auction, Thames Television lost its contract; several journalists and former Thames employees speculated that the Act was the government's revenge for [...] "Death on the Rock". This Week ceased after Thames lost its franchise. Lord Thomson, chairman of the IBA, believed the dispute {{between the government and the}} authority had a [...] "very substantial influence on Mrs Thatcher's attitude towards broadcasting policy", which <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> belief that Thames' franchise should not be renewed. The 1990 Act abolished the IBA, which Thomson believed was directly related to the authority's decision to permit the showing of [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E

2500|$|In 1928, the British Academy invited Caton Thompson to {{investigate}} the origins of ruins in southeastern Zimbabwe near Lake Mutirikwe. Known since the 16th century, Great Zimbabwe had been previously excavated by James Theodore Bent and David Randall-MacIver and controversy raged {{as to whether the}} site was the work of Africans (MacIver's view) or of some other civilisation. Working with Kathleen Kenyon, Caton Thompson's excavations <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unequivocal view that Zimbabwe was the product of a [...] "native civilisation". The assertion attracted considerable negative press attention and was received negatively by many within the archaeological community. Caton Thompson claimed to keep hostile letters from local experts in a file marked [...] "insane". Modern archaeologists now agree that the city was the product of a Shona-speaking African civilisation.|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{was born}} the eldest of five {{siblings}} in Seattle, Washington, where she spent the first ten years of her life. Her father, a blind singer, pianist and radio show host, took a job in Denver, Colorado, in 1949, and the family moved there. Collins studied classical piano with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13, performing Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos. Brico took a dim view, both then and later, of Collins' developing interest in folk music, which <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico {{to one of her}} concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands in hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, [...] "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." [...] Still later, Collins discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing jazz and ragtime piano (Singing Lessons, pp.71–72). In her early life, Collins had the good fortune of meeting many professional musicians through her father.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Bradshaw's {{research}} <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusion that}} {{post-traumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD) existed in free-ranging elephant survivors of severely traumatic events, including mass culls (systematic killing), poaching, translocation, and other human attacks. [...] Typically gentle and peaceful herbivores with complex social structures, tight-knit lifelong familial bonds, sophisticated cognitive capacities, and highly empathic responsiveness, traumatized elephants were displaying behavioral aberrations such as inter- and intra-species aggression, abnormal startle response, depression, and infant neglect. The unprecedented killing and assault of over 100 rhinoceroses by traumatized young bull elephants was documented in South Africa. [...] Bradshaw integrated psychobiological and ethological principles, specifically the understanding that maternal and community loss lead to pathogenic right hemispheric neurological development, which often results in hyperaggression and socioemotional dysfunction. She found that violent human interference was leading to the breakdown of elephant culture and society, which {{was the focus of}} a report by Charles Siebert at the New York Times called [...] [...] She also documented this in her book, , which received multiple international awards and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and recommended as a book of the week on the Jean Feraca show, [...] These findings and later studies confirming vertebrate commonalities led her to establish trans-species psychology as a theory and method for the study and care of animals (human-inclusive). She also established the non-profit organization, , which is dedicated to furthering scientific understanding and practical applications that promote animal well-being.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two records she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it... And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] She further described the songs on her previous albums as sounding very much the same, which <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realisation that she [...] "needed refreshing". She told Entertainment Focus that meeting French DJ David Guetta [...] "changed her perspective and helped to inspire the new sound". She then spent more time in Europe in 2009, something which she said had influenced her. [...] "It's different being over here in Europe and {{just being able to}} look at different magazines and fashion shows and things like that. And just thinking about the look and working with different stylists as well. I wanted {{to make sure it was}} a look that was all me, you know?." [...] She noted that seeing people's reactions to dance music made her feel [...] "completely intoxicated!." [...] In July 2010, Rowland said during {{an interview}} with Alex Catarinella of Paper magazine that [...] "I spent about a year of my life in Europe really listening to a whole bunch of European DJs and hearing dance music a lot on the radio and really loving it. 'When Love Takes Over' was my first introduction to dance music [...] it was a whole other monster. It's really a culture and I love it." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that he <b>led</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E
