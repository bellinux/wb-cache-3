5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on the ballot in 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the <b>legal</b> <b>aspects</b> for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro had full {{political}} {{backing from}} the three levels of the Government of Brazil—Federal, State and City—providing all guarantees and covenants required by the IOC, {{as well as some}} additional undertakings. All levels government, as well as all major political parties in the country, pledged complete support for the bid and endorsed the conduct of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil. On June 23, 2008, the Brazilian president formed the Government Action Management Committee, under the patronage of the Minister of Sport Orlando Silva, which coordinated Federal government actions during the bid process. Another act created the Olympic Development Authority (ODA) on January 17, 2009, to coordinate public services and infrastructure delivery for eventual Games in Rio de Janeiro, based in the pioneer model developed by Sydney for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics. Under <b>legal</b> <b>aspects,</b> the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (OCOG) would be the entity responsible for planning and staging the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. According to the IOC, the existing legislation was sufficient to enable the organization of the Games and would be amended or modified to suit the Olympic Charter if needed. The Ministry of External Relations and the Ministry of Labor guaranteed the entry, exit and working arrangements for Games personnel. People in possession of a valid passport and an Olympic or Paralympic Identity and Accreditation Card, in lieu of a visa, will be able to enter the Brazilian territory.|$|E
