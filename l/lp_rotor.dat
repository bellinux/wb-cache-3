40|$|Boresonic {{examinations}} of older vintage steam turbine rotor forgings typically {{result in a}} large number of ultrasonic beam signals or “hits ” from inclusions and porosities (lack of ingot consolidation) associated with steel making practices of the late 40 ’s and early 50 ’s. This makes the task of processing and evaluating the data extremely difficult, often leading to very pessimistic estimates of final flaw size after “linkup ” which results in a recommendation to retire the rotor from service. An alternate flaw-tolerance approach to evaluation and processing of a large amount of boresonic data for a 50 ’s vintage <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> which was condemned by an OEM, was developed and utilized to justify continued operation of this rotor. Tolerable flaw sizes were calculated for a number of flaw shapes (aspect ratios) and distances from the bore surface {{along the length of the}} rotor. Boresonic data was then screened to identify critical locations in the rotor with potentially rejectable flaws. These locations were further characterized using ASME Code Inservice Inspection techniques employed in the commercial nuclear industry. This technique was used to analyze and disposition all significant ultrasonic and magnetic particle indications. A review of prior metallurgical examination results for near-bore indications was also performed, indicating no evidence of linkup or growth of these small flaws. It was therefore concluded that the rotor could be returned to service as-is for 10 additional years based on a conservatively estimated number of operating cycles and overspeed tests during that period. BACKGROUND The unit is an early 1950 ’s vintage with the <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> forging likely made in the late 40 ’s or early 50 ’s. A cross-section of the rotor HP and LP tandem-compound sections is shown in Figure 1. The <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> section, to which the flaw tolerance approach was first applied, is the subject of this paper. A brief summary of the inspection history for the <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> is given below...|$|E

The vibration data {{collected in the}} test indicates that the amplitude enlarges {{with the increase in}} rotation frequency and reaches its maximum value at a certain frequency-doubling point. By various analysis and judgment, the main reason that causes the vibration of engine's high pressure rotor is the blade damage.

40|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) in the blade attachment region of low-pressure (<b>LP)</b> turbine <b>rotors</b> {{has emerged as}} one of the most significant problems affecting both nuclear and fossil steam turbines today. To assist turbine operators in evaluating the remaining life of <b>LP</b> <b>rotors</b> with known or suspected cracking, an easy-to-use PC-based computer program, LPRimLife, was developed for EPRI by Structural Integrity Associates. The first phase of development, incorporating the methodology for evaluating cracking in GE dovetail (straddle-mount) attachments, was completed in 1999 [1]. The second phase, which included evaluation of cracking in Westinghouse axial-entry (steeple) attachments, was completed in 2000 [2]. The third phase, to address cracking in GE multi pin-finger attachments is currently under way. Since initial development, the LPRimLife computer code has been successfully employed at nuclear and fossil plants, providing the basis for deferring or eliminating major unscheduled and costly repairs, such as “pressure plating ” which would have significantly extended the outages. Deferring unscheduled repairs for even one more fuel cycle allows for advance planning to evaluate and select the most-effective repair/replacement option and lead time needed for procurement of appropriate materials/services. In today’s competitive marketplace with evertightening outage schedules, timely application of LPRimLife has resulted in significant cost savings to utilities.

40|$|Aero-engines {{have high}} speed rotors {{carrying}} multi-stage turbine and compressor discs. Such systems need continuous monitoring during the operating regime. These rotors are mounted on ball bearings supported with squeeze film dampers {{and connected to}} stator casings. The motions of bearings and rotor are influenced by each other and therefore such a system requires structural dynamic studies. These rotors involve several nonlinear factors including contact forces, varying compliance vibration of ball bearing, nonlinear oil-film force of squeeze film damper etc Solving such nonlinear dynamic problems using the traditional transfer matrix method, modal synthesis approach, finite element method or impedance coupling technique is therefore a challenging task. Present work focuses on modelling of rotors using ball bearing nonlinearities along with nonlinear secondary transient excitations using finite element modelling. In order to validate the finite element model, preliminary dynamic analysis is carried out using linear spring-damper bearing elements. Results are illustrated both for <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> model and twin-spool rotor. Initially, the natural frequencies obtained from the computer program based on Timoshenko beam elements are validated with ANSYS results. Further, the results are also validated with those obtained from impact hammer tests on a scaled dual disk rotor-bearing system. To utilize this finite element model, the time and frequency-domain response studies are conducted with double-row ball bearing forces, rub-impact forces, Muszynska’s gas transients along with squeeze-film forces. In all the cases, differences from simple rotor supported by single-row ball bearings with only unbalance excitations have been reported. Using the fundamental frequency and its amplitude, an inverse modelling approach is applied to predict the parameters of rotor bearing system such as increased bearing clearance, changes in disc unbalances and the centralizing spring constants in squeeze-film damper. In this regard, a trained model of 3 -layer perceptron neural network model is employed. In the second study, changes in dynamic response due to waviness and race-way defects in ball-bearings are first studied using modified contact force relations. Using this data, type of bearing fault is estimated from the statistical parameters of the time-domain signal by training an unsupervised Kohenen’s neural network model. Here, the simulated data is collected from the rotor over an operating speed range. In the third study, the additional stiffness of rotor due to rub-impact forces is identified from optimization modelling. Such identification of rotor stiffening effect using finite element modelling is a new concept. Two types of control studies are proposed to minimize the amplitudes of rotor during the critical operating conditions. Semi active electromagnetic damper design helps in reducing vibration amplitudes of the <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> over a frequency range of interest. Here, the damper comprises of an electro-magnet and a spring. The required current and spring stiffness are identified from the basic relations {{and the results of}} control are illustrated with a two-disc <b>LP</b> <b>rotor</b> model. In active controller design, an electromagnetic actuator model is employed. The nominal gap maintained between the rotor and actuator coils is used in computing the actuator force. A proportional derivative (PD) control strategy is used to estimate the required forces. A neural network based alternate control scheme also proposed to compute the required actuator forces. In overall, the work focussed on the dynamic analysis of dual disc rotor model subjected to parametric nonlinear bearing loads under the action of various external forces and some controller design aspects applicable to this rotor. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} unsteady flow field in the two-spool counter-rotating transonic turbine at Graz University of Technology. The test setup consists of a high pressure (HP) stage, a diffusing mid turbine frame with turning struts (TMTF) and a shrouded low pressure (<b>LP)</b> <b>rotor.</b> The two rotors are mounted on mechanically independent shafts {{in order to provide}} engine-representative operating conditions. The rig was designed in cooperation with MTU Aero Engines and Volvo Aero within the EU project DREAM (ValiDation of Radical Engine Architecture SysteMs). A two-sensor fast response aerodynamic pressure probe (2 S-FRAP) has been employed to provide time-resolved aerodynamic area traverses downstream of the LP turbine. Such measurement allows estimating the total deterministic unsteadiness transported through the duct. In particular, it has been possible to isolate the structures induced by each rotor by means of the encoders mounted on the two shafts. A global ensemble averaged field, which takes into account the rotor-rotor interactions, is also provided. The time resolved distributions of the flow quantities are then discussed in details. The perturbations due to the HP rotor in terms of velocity and flow angle are negligible in this downstream plane. Indeed, the largest fluctuations of velocity are due to the TMTF-LP rotor interaction, they occur in the wake and secondary flows of the TMTF. Large fluctuations of static and total pressure are instead due to both rotors to the same extent...|$|E
40|$|An {{attention}} {{in this paper}} {{is focused on the}} stress analysis and the determination of fracture mechanics parameters in low pressure (<b>LP)</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> discs and on developing analytic expressions for stress intensity factors at the critical location of LP steam turbine disc. Critical locations such as keyway and dovetail area experienced stress concentration leading to crack initiation. Major concerns for the power industry are determining the critical locations with one side and fracture mechanics parameters with the other side. For determination of the critical locations in <b>LP</b> turbine <b>rotor</b> disc conventional finite elements are used here. For this initial crack length and during crack growth it is necessary to determine SIFs. In fatigue crack growth process it is necessary to have analytic formulas for the stress intensity factor. To determine analytic formula for stress intensity factor (SIF) of cracked turbine rotor disc special singular finite elements are used. Using discrete values of SIFs which correspond to various crack lengths analytic formula of SIF in polynomial forms is derived here. For determination of SIF in this paper, combined J-integral approach and singular finite elements are used. The interaction of mechanical and thermal effects was correlated in terms of the fracture toughness...|$|R

This has been the result of improvements in several areas dealing with materials, engineering analysis, nondestructive testing, and specialized welding techniques. Several papers have been written on the repair of <b>LP</b> <b>rotors</b> for central generating stations. A few have recently been written on repairs to HP rotors. There has been little written on the welded repair of mechanical drive steam turbine rotors. The specialized welding techniques needed to perform submerged arc welding restoration of mechanical drive steam turbine rotors are highlighted. The advantages of welded repair and the engineering analysis necessary to make a reliable repair to a rotor are also addressed. Basically, two categories of welded repair are studied. One is the welded journal repair. The other is the complete replacement of a stage disc on a monoblock rotor forging by the use of welding. Mock up test assemblies are used, along with sample weld test assemblies, {{in order to try to}} duplicate the actual welding situation as much as possible. Both destructive and nondestructive testing is performed on these test assemblies to determine occurrence of any flaws, mechanical and electrical runout, chemical composition variations, hardness distributions, tensile and yield strength in different directions at room and elevated temperatures, fracture toughness, fracture appearance transition temperatures, stress rupture strength, and fatigue endurance limits. The results from these tests are discussed along with the pertinent engineering requirements that pertain in order to give the limits of welded repair. Plans for further testing are outlined, along with the conclusion that supports continued acceptance of submerged arc weld restoration of steam turbine rotors ensuring reliability of the weld metal and the heat affected zone of the turbine base material...|$|R

Solidity of the cascade can be reduced by increasing the airfoil pitch by 25 %, while maintaining the throat in the blade-to-blade passage. Reynolds number examined is 57000, based on chord length and averaged exit velocity. Freestream turbulence intensity at the inlet is varied from 0. 80 % (no grid condition) to 2. 1 % by use of turbulence grid. Hot-wire probe measurements of the boundary layer on the suction surface for Low Pressure (<b>LP)</b> turbines <b>rotor</b> are carried out to obtain time-averaged and time-resolved characteristics of the boundary layers {{under the influence of}} the freestream turbulence. Frequency analysis extracts some important features of the unsteady behaviors of the boundary layer, including vortex formation and shedding. Numerical analysis based on high resolution Large Eddy Simulation is also executed to enhance the understanding on the flow field around the highly loaded turbine airfoils.
