In the 20th century, Vermeer's admirers included Salvador Dalí, who painted {{his own version of}} The <b>Lacemaker</b> (on commission from collector Robert Lehman) and pitted large copies of the original against a rhinoceros in some surrealist experiments. Dali also immortalized the Dutch Master in The Ghost of Vermeer of Delft Which Can Be Used As a Table, 1934.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{example of}} Lampião's activities, and his {{ambivalent}} nature, is his descent {{on the small}} town of Queimadas in Bahia, which took place in December 1929. His band entered the town, and immediately shut down the telegraph office to stop news from spreading. The seven policemen in the town and their sergeant were shut in the jail, whilst the jail's previous occupants were set free. The wealthiest citizens of the town were then levied for a forced monetary contribution. The bandits, however, paid for items, including soap and perfume, taken from the town's shops. The seven policemen were summarily executed by shots to the head, but their sergeant was left unharmed as he was liked by the townspeople. In the evening Lampião organised a baile, a dance for the townspeople and his cangaceiros. He also ordered a cinema show to be presented. The bandits were under strict instructions not to molest the local young women, and such was Lampião's authority that none were. The bandits left the town at 4:00 in the morning; Lampião rode a borrowed mule, which he later duly returned to its owner. On one occasion he attacked a large town, Mossoró in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, in June 1927. The bandits began their assault on the town to the sound of a bugle; when advancing they shouted vivas and sang their special song, Mulher Rendeira (The <b>Lacemaker).</b> However, the inhabitants had time to organise a defence, and 300 armed townsmen drove off Lampião's 60 cangaceiros.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Bondfield, {{known in}} private life as [...] "Maggie", [...] {{was born on}} 17 March 1873 in the Somerset town of Chard. She was the tenth of eleven children, and third of four {{daughter}}s born to William Bondfield and his wife Ann, née Taylor, {{the daughter of a}} Congregational minister. William Bondfield worked as a <b>lacemaker,</b> and had a history of political activism. As a young man he had been secretary of the Chard Political Union, a centre of local radicalism that the authorities had on occasion suppressed by military force. He had also been active in the Anti-Corn Law League of the 1840s. Entirely self-educated, he was fascinated by science and engineering, and was the co-designer of a flying machine, a prototype of the modern aircraft, that was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851.|$|E

Above all, he was eloquent on the shell of a <b>lacemaker</b> crab, all over prickles, which he had seen hanging in the window of a little tobacconist.

6000|$|One {{of these}} {{belonged to the}} most able <b>lacemaker</b> in the place, a {{hard-working}} woman, who kept seven little pupils {{in a sort of}} cupboard under the staircase, with a window into the back garden, [...] "because," [...] said she, [...] "they did no work if they looked out into the front, there were so many gapsies;" [...] these gapsies consisting of the very scanty traffic of the further end of Mackarel Lane. For ten hours a day did these children work in a space just wide enough for them to sit, with the two least under the slope of the stairs, permitted no distraction from their bobbins, but invaded by their mistress on the faintest sound of tongues. Into this hotbed of sprigs was admitted a child who had been a special favourite at school, an orphan niece of the head of the establishment. The two brothers had been lost together at sea; and while the one widow became noted for her lace, the other, a stranger to the art, had maintained herself by small millinery, and had not sacrificed her little girl to the Moloch of lace, but had kept her at school to a later age than usual in the place. But the mother died, and the orphan was at once adopted by the aunt, with the resolve to act the truly kind part by her, and break her in to lacemaking. That determination was a great blow to the school visitors; the girls were in general so young, or so stupefied with their work, that an intelligent girl like Lovedy Kelland was no small treasure to them; there were designs of making her a pupil teacher in a few years, and offers and remonstrances rained in upon her aunt. But they had no effect; Mrs. Kelland was persuaded that the child had been spoilt by learning, and in truth poor Lovedy was a refractory scholar; she was too lively to bear the confinement patiently; her mind was too much awake not to rebel against the dulness, and her fingers had not been brought into training early enough. Her incessant tears spoilt her thread, and Mrs. Kelland decided that [...] "she'd never get her bread till she was broke of her buke;" [...] which breaking was attempted by a summary pawning of all poor Lovedy's reward books. The poor child confided her loss to her young lady teacher at the Sunday school; the young lady, being new, young, and inflammable, reproached Mrs. Kelland with dishonesty and tyranny to the orphan, and in return was nearly frightened out of her wits by such a scolding as only such a woman as the lace mistress could deliver. Then Mr. Touchett tried his hand, and though he did not meet with quite so much violence, all he heard was that she had [...] "given Lovedy the stick for being such a little tod as to complain, when she knew the money for the bukes was put safe away in her money-box. She was not going to the Sunday schule again, not she, to tell stories against her best friends!" [...] And when the next district visitor came that way, the door was shut in her face, with the tract thrown out at the opening, and an intimation in Mrs. Kelland's shrill voice, that no more bukes were wanted; she got plenty from Miss Curtis.|$|E

2500|$|Some Huguenots {{settled in}} Bedfordshire, {{one of the}} main centres of the British lace {{industry}} at the time. Although 19th-century sources have asserted that some of these refugees were <b>lacemakers</b> and contributed to the East Midlands lace industry, this is contentious. The only reference to immigrant <b>lacemakers</b> in this period is of twenty-five widows who settled in Dover, and there is no contemporary documentation to support there being Huguenot <b>lacemakers</b> in Bedfordshire. The implication that the style of lace known as 'Bucks Point' demonstrates a Huguenot influence, being a [...] "combination of Mechlin patterns on Lille ground", is fallacious: what is now known as Mechlin lace did not develop until {{the first half of the}} eighteenth century and lace with Mechlin patterns and Lille ground did not appear until the end of the 18th century, when it was widely copied throughout Europe.|$|R
