The relation between a structure's static and dynamic responses depends primarily on its damping characteristics. Cracking also significantly affects the damping in reinforced concrete structures. The authors developed a formula for predicting <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements</b> of damping in reinforced concrete beams using the residual crack width and the span length. But all the beams used in this formulation were of normal strength concrete (NSC). Presented herein are the test results of 15 reinforced high strength concrete (HSC) beams.

The <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements</b> and modes are {{used to determine the}} TC rotor system stability. Second, based on the frequency domain of time transient analysis from the FEM, the nonlinear dynamic responses of the TC rotor system with different levels of induced unbalance magnitude in compressor and turbine wheels are calculated. Finally, the waterfall and response spectral intensity plots are compared to propose a suitable unbalance magnitude of turbine wheel and compressor wheel for the high-speed TC rotor with FRBs. In summary, the unbalance magnitude is an effective way to achieve the small vibration and stable operation for the high-speed TC rotor with FRBs.|$|R

40|$|A {{measure of}} the {{absorption}} of elastic waves is the specific absorption coefficient 1 /Q. In dispersive mediums, whether the dispersion is due to geometry, inhomogeneity, or both, measurements are often made outside {{the body and the}} measurements must be interpreted as to the distribution of values of 1 /Q within the body. Two definitive experiments of this type are those performed using standing waves set up in a confined sample of the body and with waves that propagate through or {{on the surface of the}} body. Typical examples of these experiments involve the measurement of the damping coefficient of the free modes of vibration of the earth and the measurement of the attenuation factor of propagating surface waves on the earth. These two types of experiments can themselves be interpreted in terms of dimensionless attenuation factors. We call the dimensionless attenuation factors in the standing wave and propagating wave experiments 1 /Q_T and 1 /Q_x, defined as the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements</b> π/QT and π/Q_x in each experiment. Then in a damped standing wave the amplitude will diminish with time t at a fixed point as exp (−πt/TQ_T), where T is the period.

When implemented numerically they allow for substantial savings in CPU time and memory storage requirements for a given resolved scale separation. Basic properties of these Taylor-Green flows generalized to MHD are given, and the ideal non-dissipative case is studied up to the equivalent of 2048 ^ 3 grid points {{for one of these}} flows. The temporal evolution of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements,</b> delta, of the energy spectrum remains exponential at the highest spatial resolution considered, for which an acceleration is observed briefly before the grid resolution is reached. Up {{to the end of the}} exponential decay of delta, the behavior is consistent with a regular flow with no appearance of a singularity. The subsequent short acceleration in the formation of small magnetic scales can be associated with a near collision of two current sheets driven together by magnetic pressure. It leads to strong gradients with a fast rotation of the direction of the magnetic field, a feature also observed in the solar wind. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of large and complex structures largely depends on damping {{resistance in the}} structure. A portion of the structural energy is lost to deformations in material, friction between the contact surfaces, and relative motion within the structure. Often, {{in an analysis of}} numerical models, before the dynamic analysis of transient events (transient analysis), the damping resistance is adopted on the basis of recommendations, which implies an error of transient response (introduced by frequencies, <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements</b> and maximal amplitudes). Decreasing amortized vibratory movement is dependent on the extent of the structural damping. This paper presents the importance of structural damping in structural analysis and shows the experimental and theoretical procedure for identifying G values of the structural damping coefficient. A model for determining the G coefficient is shown in the example of a real tower crane structure. The experimentally obtained values were then used in the transient numerical FEM analysis, as the basis for adopting the conclusions about the {{dynamic behaviour}} of this class of structures (transportation machines). The effect of the external perturbation force of trapezoidal impulse form (lifting and quickly lowering of load) is introduced and the dynamic task, {{as an example of the}} use of the G coefficient G, is solved.

30|$|The <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrement</b> of a tissue’s natural {{oscillation}} characterizes its elasticity, but more directly, {{it reflects the}} dissipation of the mechanical energy within an oscillation cycle, when tissues recover their shape after being deformed. Said another way, elasticity is the biomechanical property of a muscle that characterizes the ability to recover its initial shape after a contraction or removal of an external force of deformation. Elasticity is inversely proportional to the decrement. Therefore, as the decrement of a muscle decreases, the muscle elasticity increases. In theory, a decrement of 0 (zero) represents absolute elasticity. Elasticity is reported as the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrement,</b> while the inverse of elasticity is plasticity.|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA) is {{currently}} conducting a feasible study of crossing 8 fjords {{on the west}} coast of Norway. The most challenging crossing is the 3700 m wide Sognefjord. Three main concepts are under development, and one of the concepts of this crossing is a three span suspension bridge on floating towers. The floating foundation suggested is a multi-column pontoon with mooring lines to seabed. The object of this thesis was to study this bridge concept with respect to static deflection and dynamic properties. A preliminary bridge design based on the Hardanger Bridge design and a preliminary design of the pontoons was conducted. The hydrodynamic effects, e. g. added mass and added non-linear damping, were calculated according to potential theory and Morison equation assuming a vertical circular cylinder. The bridge and pontoons were modeled in the finite element program Abaqus/CAE. The static mean wind analysis and static traffic analysis gave reasonable results, but the tolerability of deflections zmax = 8. 8 m for static mean wind and ymax = 9. 8 m for traffic load can be disputed. From real and complex eigen-value analysis natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios were conducted. The ten first eigen modes had considerable motion in the pontoons with natural period between 138 s and 20 s. The first stiffening girder modes in vertical, horizontal and torsional direction have natural periods were 16. 5 s, 15. 1 s and 2. 6 s. The effect of adding hydrodynamic damping resulted in increased damping ratio of 6 % for modes with lateral and longitudinal motion in the pontoons, 2. 5 % increased damping ratio for modes with vertical motion in the pontoons and 1 % increased damping ratio for modes with longitudinal rotation in the pontoons. The validity and accuracy of these increased damping ratios is disputable. Simple time-domain response simulations gave considerably larger damping ratio using the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrements</b> of the oscillations. Three of the four simulations gave maximum damping forces according to implemented non-linear damping behavior when assuming reasonable maximum velocities. </p...|$|R

The parametric OMI method and interpolated DFT (IpDFT) methods are used to compute the δ from free decaying oscillations embedded in an experimental noise typical for low-frequency mechanical spectrometers. The results are reported for δ = 5 × 10 - 4, 0 f = 1. 12345 Hz and different sampling frequencies, Sf = 1 kHz and 4 kHz. A new YM algorithm yields the smallest dispersion in experimental points of the <b>logarithmic</b> <b>decrement</b> and the smallest relative errors among all investigated IpDFT methods. In general, however, the IpDFT methods suffer from spectral leakage and frequency resolution. Therefore it is demonstrated that the performance of different methods to compute the δ can be listed in the following order: (1) OMI, (2) YM, (3) YMC, and (4) the Yoshida method, Y. For short free decays {{the order of the}} best performers is different: (1) OMI and (2) YMC. It is important to emphasize that IpDFT methods (including the Yoshida method, Y) are discouraged for signals that are too short.
