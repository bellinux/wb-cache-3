A useful choice is the short-circuit current output of the amplifier (leading to the short-circuit current gain).

To {{improve the}} power quality and {{efficiency}} on feeding unbalanced loads, this paper proposes a scheme of instantaneous current compensation that can modify the power factor and balance the three-phase currents simultaneously. The method of instantaneous space vectors can compensate the reactive power effectively, but {{the problems of}} unbalanced <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> remains. This paper suggests a method that can mitigate the unbalanced <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> by setting the active power as a constant for each cycle. Field measurement data were analyzed.

40|$|In {{this report}} a new {{architecture}} of an NMOS Low Drop Out (LDO) Regulator is proposed. It features a new frequency compensation technique to enable better regulation. The LDO Regulator handles large <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> with good stability (25 ° phase margin for low <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> from no <b>load</b> till 2 mA and then towards 90 °for larger <b>load</b> <b>currents)</b> {{and a good}} transient response (overshoot and undershoot less than 3 % for a load step from 1 mA to 500 mA). The quiescent current of the LDO is 50 μA, with a load capacitor of 470 nF. The LDO is scalable for different maximum <b>load</b> <b>currents</b> without impact on stability. In Standby mode the LDO is stable with a quiescent current three times smaller than the normal operation. The application of the NMOS LDO is in Power Management Units for all the handheld and mobile application devices like the mobile phones, Apple IPODs etc...|$|R
25|$|When the {{electric}} current in a loop of wire changes, the changing current creates a changing magnetic field. A second wire in reach of this magnetic field will experience {{this change in}} magnetic field as a change in its coupled magnetic flux, d ΦB / d t. Therefore, an electromotive force is {{set up in the}} second loop called the induced EMF or transformer EMF. If the two ends of this loop are connected through an electrical <b>load,</b> <b>current</b> will flow.|$|E
25|$|Transient {{response}} is {{the reaction of}} a regulator when a (sudden) change of the <b>load</b> <b>current</b> (called the load transient) or input voltage (called the line transient) occurs. Some regulators will tend to oscillate or have a slow response time which in some cases might lead to undesired results. This value {{is different from the}} regulation parameters, as that is the stable situation definition. The transient response shows the behaviour of the regulator on a change. This data is usually provided in the technical documentation of a regulator and is also dependent on output capacitance.|$|E

Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.|$|E

25|$|The {{output voltage}} of the {{stabilizer}} {{is equal to}} the Zener diode voltage minus the base–emitter voltage of the transistor, UZ − UBE, where UBE is usually about 0.7V for a silicon transistor, depending on the <b>load</b> <b>current.</b> If the output voltage drops for any external reason, such as an increase in the current drawn by the load (causing a decrease in the Collector-Emitter junction voltage to observe KVL), the transistor's base–emitter voltage (UBE) increases, turning the transistor on further and delivering more current to increase the load voltage again.|$|E
25|$|Since supercapacitors do {{not rely}} on {{chemical}} changes in the electrodes (except for those with polymer electrodes), lifetimes depend mostly on {{the rate of evaporation}} of the liquid electrolyte. This evaporation in general is a function of temperature, of current <b>load,</b> <b>current</b> cycle frequency and voltage. Current load and cycle frequency generate internal heat, so that the evaporation-determining temperature is the sum of ambient and internal heat. This temperature is measurable as core temperature {{in the center of a}} capacitor body. The higher the core temperature the faster the evaporation and the shorter the lifetime.|$|E

The circuit designer must choose a minimum voltage that can be tolerated across Rv, bearing {{in mind that the}} higher this voltage requirement is, the higher the required input voltage, Uin, and hence the lower the efficiency of the regulator. On the other hand, lower values of Rv lead to higher power dissipation in the diode and to inferior regulator characteristics.|$|E
