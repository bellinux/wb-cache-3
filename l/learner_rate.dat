40|$|Abstract:- Finding similar e-learners in a {{distributed}} {{and open}} e- learning environment {{and help them}} to learn collaboratively is {{becoming one of the}} urgent challenges of personalized e-learning services. Literature shows that current e-learner community building approaches are generated from qualitative studies of small-sized learner-centered classrooms which may need the teacher's participation. However, the findings might not apply to large classes in distributed learning environments, which make the teachers to face hundreds of e-learners in each class. In such situations, teachers also find it impossible to analyze the learning behaviors of each e-learner and divide them into different learning communities accurately. This paper addresses this problem in the adaptive e-learner community self-organizing point of view. Considering both the feature vector of learning resources and a <b>learner's</b> <b>rating</b> value on each resource, this paper firstly defines the learning interest feature vector to model the learner's behavior. Based on this an accurate learning interest feature representation method and, an innovative e-learner community self-organizing algorithm, called IFV- SORC, are proposed in this paper.

Research shows that many different approaches using technology are effective. For instance, playing electronic games can encourage learners to practice skills such as language development. Games can also engage learners with special educational needs, such as ADHD. In one study, boys aged 9 - 11 with ADHD played a computer driving game.

Developing Case-based e-CME activities, one of the popular formats of e-CME programs, is difficult and time consuming. In this article we describe our experience of performing instructional system design for creating case-based e-CME contents.   Methods: We performed a five-step instructional system design (i. e. system analysis, design, development, delivery and evaluation) to create e-contents. We held several sessions with experts of the field to perform system analysis. Then we determined contents’ framework and a plan for faculty members’ development and incentives. In the development phase, we held workshops for faculty members and trained e-learning advisors who would help faculties to create contents. Incentives were legitimized. Then we delivered programs to the learners who would fill a program evaluation questionnaire after completing the study of each program.     Results: 20 e-CME programs were developed and delivered to the learners. Totally 3644 learner-programs were studied. Cases rated the programs as 4. 56 (SD= 0. 65) on the 1 – 5 Likert-type scale.

DESCRIPTORS: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, precision teaching, endur-ance, fluency Many children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have difficulty sustaining attention to task-rele-vant stimuli and inhibiting responses to nonrelevant stimuli (Barkley, 1991). Many fluency-oriented educators such as precision teachers claim that attention span or endur-ance is a by-product of behavioral fluency, which is defined as the combination of speed plus accuracy (Binder, 1996). Precision teaching (PT) is a technical off-shoot of behavior analysis (Potts, Eshleman, & Cooper, 1993). It is not a way of teach-ing, as the name suggests; rather, it is a gen-eral approach that involves repeated practice, error-correction procedures, timed drills to meet predetermined fluency aims, {{and the use of the}} standard celeration chart (Penny-packer, Koenig, & Lindsley, 1972).

Methods: An evaluation instrument assessed resident comfort levels, measured on a seven digit Likert scale ranging from significantly uncomfortable to significantly comfortable, in 13 areas of pediatric resuscitation. To complete the curriculum, residents had to demonstrate proficiency in knowledge and procedural skills during mock resuscitation scenarios and on both written and oral examinations. Results: Thirty-one residents participated in the study: 51. 6 % were pediatric, 12. 9 % were medicine/pediatric and 35. 5 % were emergency medicine residents. Participants in the curriculum had little previous experience with pediatric resuscitation (83 % had been involved in five or fewer pediatric resuscitations). In all 13 areas of pediatric resuscitation tested, residents reported improvement in comfort levels following the course (p< 0. 002; Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests). The most significant changes were observed for the following items: resuscitation of pulseless arrest, performance of cardioversion and defibrillation, performance of intraosseous needle insertion, and drug selection and dosing for rapid sequence intubation. Fewer than 48 % of <b>learners</b> <b>rated</b> themselves as comfortable in these areas prior to training, but after completion, more than 80 % rated themselves in the comfortable range.

To this end fifty Dutch-speaking EFL <b>learners</b> <b>rated</b> the congruency they perceived between the form and meaning of 24 English words on a 6 -point Likert scale. The motivation of their scores was elicited by means of a think-aloud protocol whose transcriptions were analysed with regard to the type of elaborations made. Both receptive and productive vocabulary size were measured through the LexTale test (Lemhöfer & Broersma 2012) and the Productive Vocabulary Levels Test (Laufer & Nation 1999). In a pre-test questionnaire, the participants also indicated which languages they are proficient in. The data point to four main types of elaborations: cross-lexical associations, sound symbolic associations, word form comparisons, and lexical decompositions. Awareness of the types of elaborations that learners can produce may help us to unravel the mental processes behind form-meaning mapping. It may also reveal which formal features are salient to learners themselves, and show us the kind of meaning-making they are capable of during deliberate word learning. If we wish to assist learners in expanding their L 2 lexicons, this knowledge can be capitalized on in the language classroom. The research will also demonstrate whether L 2 vocabulary size and/or knowledge of other background languages make it easier for learners to find meaning in the form of L 2 words...|$|R

"May, 2012 "This study identified espoused teaching modes and teaching perspectives for a sample of workplace learning facilitators. The difference between facilitator espoused teaching mode and learner perception of facilitator teaching mode was also explored. The Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS) was used to measure facilitator teaching mode; the Adapted Principles of Adult Learning Scale (APALS) was used to measure learner perception of facilitator teaching mode; and the Teaching Perspectives Inventory (TPI) was used to measure facilitator teaching perspective. The sample was 34 facilitators in colleges/universities and public/corporate training organizations and their 286 learners. Facilitator variables examined were age, gender, race, occupational field, professional preparation, years teaching experience, and program taught. Facilitators were designated as non-collaborative, but were found to be slightly more collaborative than other groups of instructors and teachers from past studies. There was moderate agreement between facilitator espoused and learner perceived teaching mode, yet <b>learners</b> <b>rated</b> facilitators lower on collaborative teaching mode than facilitators rated themselves. Gender and years teaching experience were found to be significantly associated with facilitator teaching mode. The most common facilitator teaching perspectives were the Nurturing and Apprenticeship perspectives. Teaching perspective did not predict espoused or perceived teaching mode; however, there were differences in teaching mode scores for the different teaching perspectives—with the Transmission perspective returning the lowest collaborative teaching mode scores (espoused and perceived) of all teaching perspectives. Recommendations for practice and future research were provided, which included a current examination of the PALS instrument for use in workplace learning settings...|$|R
