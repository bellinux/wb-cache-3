50|$|A {{transcription}} {{service is}} a business which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often provided for business, legal, or medical purposes. The {{most common type of}} transcription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file suitable for printing as a document such as a report. Common examples are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or a physician's recorded voice notes (medical transcription). Some transcription businesses can send staff to events, speeches, or seminars, who then convert the spoken content into text. Some companies also accept recorded speech, either on cassette, CD, VHS, or as sound files. For a transcription service, various individuals and organisations have different rates and methods of pricing. That can be <b>per</b> <b>line,</b> <b>per</b> word, <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> or <b>per</b> hour, which differs from individual to individual and industry to industry. Transcription companies primarily serve private law firms, local, state and federal government agencies and courts, trade associations, meeting planners and nonprofits.|$|R

40|$|Blink rate is {{reported}} to vary dependent upon ongoing task performance, perceptual, attentional and cognitive factors, and fatigue. Five levels of task difficulty were operationally defined and task performance as <b>lines</b> read aloud <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> were measured. A single noninvasive infrared TV eyetracker was modified to measure blinking and an on-line computer program identified and counted blinks while the subject performed the tasks. Blink rate decreased by 50 % when either task performance increased (fast reading) or visual difficulty increased (blurred text); blink rate increased greatly during rest breaks. There was no change in blink rate during one hour experiments even though subjects complained of severe fatigue...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical analysis of pedestrians’ route choice {{in a complex}} facility. The study has been done {{within the framework of}} a real-time evacuation assistant. The investigated facility is part of the promenade of the ESPRIT arena in Düsseldorf, Germany. The route choice data are obtained from an automatic person counting system consisting of cameras. The collected data are presented in terms of frequencies, i. e. the number of persons passing a counting <b>line</b> or exit <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> in the direction “in” and “out” of a section. Using that information, the proportional usage of the different exits is calculated. Also the global route profiles of spectators for entering and leaving the arena are obtained. The results for different football games are presented and analysed in details. A modelling approach based on a quickest path algorithm is used to reproduce the exit choosing behaviour of the spectators...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{monitoring}} diagnostic indicators during {{the operation of}} a machine used for production of packing materials with a print. It analyses low-frequency vibrations measured in individual spherical roller bearings in eight print positions. The rollers in these positions have a different pressure based on positioning these rollers {{in relation to the}} central roller. As a result, the article also deals with a correlation of pressure and level of measured low-frequency vibrations. The speed of the print machine (the speed of a <b>line</b> in meters <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> is a very important variable during its operation, this is why it is important to verify the values of vibrations in various speeds of the line, what can lead to revelation of one or more resonance areas. Moreover, it examines vibrations of the central roller drive and measurement of backlash of transmission cogs of this drive. Based on performed analyses recommendations for an operator of the machine have been conceived...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} compare programmer pro-ductivity and defect rates for Java and C++. A modified ver-sion of the Personal Software Process (PSP) was used to gather defect rate, bug rate, and productivity data on C++ and Java during two real world development projects. A bug is defined {{to be a problem}} detected during testing or deploy-ment. A defect is either a bug, or an error detected during compile time. A typical C++ program had two to three times as many bugs <b>per</b> <b>line</b> of code as a typical Java program. C++ also generated between 15 % and 50 % more defects <b>per</b> <b>line,</b> and perhaps took six times as long to debug. Java was between 30 % and 200 % more productive, in terms of <b>lines</b> of code <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> When defects were measured against devel-opment time, Java and C++ show no difference, but C++ had 2 to 3 times as many bugs per hour. Statistics were generated using Student’s t-test at a 95 % confidence level. Some discus-sion of why the differences occurred is included, but the offered reasons have not been tested experimentally. The study is limited to one programmer over two projects, so it is not a definitive experimental result. The programmer was experienced in C++, but only learning Java, so the results would probably favour Java more strongly for equally-experi-enced programmers. The experiment shows {{that it is possible to}} experimentally measure the fitness of a programming lan-guage...|$|R
