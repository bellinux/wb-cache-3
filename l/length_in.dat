40|$|In this paper, we present, given a odd integer d, a {{decomposition}} of the multiset of bar lengths {{of a bar}} partition λ as the union of two multisets, one consisting of the bar <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> its d̅-core partition c̅_d(λ) and the other consisting of modified bar <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> its d̅-quotient partition. In particular, we obtain that the multiset of bar <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> c̅_d(λ) is a sub-multiset of the multiset of bar <b>lengths</b> <b>in</b> λ. Also we obtain a relative bar formula for the degrees of spin characters of the Schur extensions of the symmetric group. The proof involves a recent similar result for partitions, proved in [1]...|$|R
