25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 2000s, {{concerns}} grew over the prospect of an 'energy gap' in United Kingdom generating capacity. This was forecast to arise because it was expected that a number of coal fired power stations would close due to being unable to meet the clean air requirements of the European <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plant</b> Directive (directive 2001/80/EC). In addition, the United Kingdom's remaining Magnox nuclear stations were to have closed by 2015. The oldest AGR nuclear power station has had its life extended by ten years, and it was likely many of the others could be life-extended, reducing the potential gap suggested by the current accounting closure dates of between 2014 and 2023 for the AGR power stations.|$|E

This document is published by the European Commission pursuant to Article 13 (6) of the Directive. This BREF for <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants</b> concerns the following activities specified in Annex I to Directive 2010 / 75 /EU: - 1. 1 : Combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more, only when this activity takes place in <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> with a total rated thermal input of 50 MW or more. - 1. 4 : Gasification of coal or other fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input of 20 MW or more, only when this activity is directly associated to a <b>combustion</b> <b>plant.</b> - 5. 2 : Disposal or recovery of waste in waste co-incineration plants for non-hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 3 tonnes per hour or for hazardous waste with a capacity exceeding 10 tonnes per day, only when this activity takes place in <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> covered under 1. 1 above. In particular, this document covers upstream and downstream activities directly associated with the aforementioned activities including the emission prevention and control techniques applied. The fuels considered in this document are any solid, liquid and/or gaseous combustible material including: - solid fuels (e. g. coal, lignite, peat); - biomass (as defined in Article 3 (31) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU); - liquid fuels (e. g. heavy fuel oil and gas oil); - gaseous fuels (e. g. natural gas, hydrogen-containing gas and syngas); - industry-specific fuels (e. g. by-products from the chemical and iron and steel industries); - waste except mixed municipal waste as defined in Article 3 (39) and except other waste listed in Article 42 (2) (a) (ii) and (iii) of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU. Important issues for the implementation of Directive 2010 / 75 /EU in the <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants</b> sector are the emissions to air of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and fluoride, organic compounds, dust, and metals including mercury; emissions to water resulting especially from the use of wet abatement techniques for the removal of sulphur dioxide from the flue gases; resource efficiency and especially energy efficiency. This BREF contains 12 Chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 provide general information on the <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants</b> industrial sector and on the industrial processes used within this sector. Chapter 3 provides data and general information concerning the environmental performance of installations within the sector in terms of water consumption, the generation of waste and general techniques used within this sector. It also describes in more detail the general techniques to prevent or, where this is not practicable, to reduce the environmental impact of installations in this sector that were considered in determining the BAT. Chapters 4 to 9 provide the following information given below on specific combustion processes (gasification, combustion of solid fuel, combustion of liquid fuel, combustion of gaseous fuel, multi-fuel combustion and waste co-incineration).

40|$|Protection of {{environment}} {{and human health}} is major concern for European Union. European Commission has established integrated pollution prevention and control directive and directives concerning <b>large</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> (LCP) and waste incineration (WI) plants to prevent emissions from industrial installations. The LCP and WI directives set the lowest requirements such as emission limit values and monitoring requirements that the operators have to comply in EU. European Commission has also published best available technique (BAT) reference documents to help authorities determine the requirements in environmental permits for the installations. This thesis is looking into the authority requirements for continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are set by the competent authorities in Spain, Estonia, France, Poland, Czech and UK. Power plants have to monitor and report air emissions {{with the help of}} CEMS. It consists of measurement equipment, analysers and sample conditioning systems as well as environmental data management solution. Directives and standards set the requirements for the CEMS, but still requirements differ between the target countries. For instance, according to the study only in UK certification (MCERTS) for the analyser is required and only in Spain plant owner is not allowed to perform the compliance reporting of the plants emissions. It is the responsibility of competent authority. Also the charging and trading emissions differ between the target countries. The coming directive on industrial emissions will be possibly accepted in the end of 2010. It will unify and straiten the requirements. Emission limit values will lower and the emission monitoring requirements will be stricter. Due to the directive, the importance of the use of best available technique will be emphasized. BAT reference documents for <b>large</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> and monitoring emissions are reviewed in 2010. The subject of this thesis was wide and the special requirements are presented in general level.

This paper studies eight scenarios; three proposed by the Croatian Energy Strategy, one proposed by the Indicative medium-term development plan of Croatia’s Transmission System Operator, and four alternative scenarios that propose extensive construction of hydro, wind and solar power plants in Croatia. Calculations have been conducted in the EnergyPLAN model based on modelled long term energy demand projections in the NeD model, with 2009 as the base year and a scope ranging until the year 2030. Each of the eight proposed scenarios is observed trough different hydrological conditions while analysing import dependency, economic costs and CO 2 emissions. After the initial calculations, additional analysis of intensive wind power penetration has been conducted.

40|$|The Serbian E-PRTR {{register}} (The European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register) {{was established}} in 2007 and harmonized with PRTR protocol of Arhus convention and E-PRTR directive. In this paper, the quality of 2009 data reported to the Serbian PRTR register was analyzed. The analysis includes 37 <b>large</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> with the capacity equal or greater than 50 MW. The <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> include power plants, heating plants and industrial energy units. The calculation is done using EMEP/EEA 2009 methodology and Tier 2 approach. The analysis obtained presents {{an overview of the}} quality of the reported data for SOx, NOx and TSP emissions for 61 combustion units e. g. emitters (stacks). The results show that all 61 emitters reported data with the deviation greater than 25 %, with 55 % of the emitters reporting data that differed from pollutant to pollutant in comparison to the estimated data. Out of those, 30 % of the emitters reported smaller and 8 % reported greater emissions than estimated emissions with 7 % of the emitters not submitting any emissions data. The analysis also includes calculation of the emissions scope limit within 95 % confidence interval. According to these results, it can be concluded that only 15 % of the emitters have emission levels that fall within the scope limits, 47 % of the emitters reported data of which two data fall within the scope limits, 28 % of the emitters reported data of which only one data fall within the scope limits, 3 % of the emitters had data that didn’t fall within the scope limits, and 7 % did not reported any emission data. The results of the analysis can be summarized as: 1) operators in facilities do not know how to calculate emissions from their sources, and 2) the application of global emission factors can lead to considerable errors. The main reasons for significant deviation are different fuel quality, type of technical units and human error, thus national emission factors should be developed...|$|R
40|$|Wastewater {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{potential}} heat recovery sources. The domestic, municipal, industrial, etc. wastewater are selected for heat recovery in the most cases. The wastewater of Kaunas wastewater treatment plant has been used in this case of study. The wastewater from the sludge household has been decided to use for the heat recovery. The temperature of it is between 24 – 28 °C and depends on a seasonal prevalence. The treated wastewater which is released to Nemunas has been used as another heat source for heat recovery. The annual average temperature of this stream is 14 °C. These streams of wastewater are a potential sources of recovered heat energy. The existing amount of heat inside of it has been recovered by double-pipe heat exchanger and heat pump. According to calculations has been recovered 116233 GJ of heat from the annual stream of wastewater. Implementation of heat recovery technologies in the wastewater treatment plant is an important approach not only to energy but to environmental approach as well because the emissions of greenhouse gases decrease. The reduction of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions are noticeable in the atmosphere. In the <b>large</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> when the natural gas is used to generate the same amount of energy (116233 GJ) the annual emission of carbon dioxide is 6614 t, nitrogen oxides – 3. 47 t and carbon monoxide – 0. 03 t.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarDecomposition {{analysis}} {{is a method}} for dis-entangling the different key-factors that determine temporal changes in emission levels. It is a 'top-down' method starting from general available statistical data. This report explores the role decomposition diagrams can play in national and international policy analysis and evaluation. For this purpose a case study has been performed. The case study concerns the reduction of NOx emissions from <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> in industries in the Netherlands and Belgium in the 1985 - 1999 period. NOx emission reduction policies have been studied and linked with the effect of NOx emission abatement that is the technique effect in the decomposition analysis. Policy instrument characteristics {{have been used to}} describe the likely effect of studied instruments. The case study shows that observed changes in the NOx-technique effect in the Netherlands could be closely linked to specific policy events, such as the introduction and stepwise further improvement of the Dutch Decree on emission limits for <b>large</b> <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> (BEES). Hardly any technique effect was observed in Belgium in the period 1985 - 1999. On the condition that monitoring results of Belgium are reliable, this implies that no clear technical improvement in emission abatement of NOx has occurred in this period in industrial <b>combustion</b> <b>plants</b> in Belgium. This may be explained by the less ambitious emission regulation in Belgium i. e. emission standards are less stringent and the scope of action of the national regulation is more confined (less installations are regulated). One of the most important conclusions of the case study is that decomposition analysis can {{play an important role in}} policy analysis. On the one hand, decomposition figures may confirm expected changes in emissions, and in doing so, underpin the results of policy analysis. On the other hand, changes observed in decomposition figures may indicate changes in policies, and in doing so, direct policy analysis. Finally, it may be concluded from the case study that the use of decomposition figures alone already gives a fair idea about the overall effectiveness of NOx emission reduction policies in different countries. A broad-based and in-depth study as performed in this study produces more detailed knowledge but also requires much more effort. This time-consuming aspect has to be taken into account when considering and planning these kind of studies...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{has had a}} {{long history}} of coal {{production}} and coal was the UK’s most important primary fuel until 1971, when it was overtaken by petroleum. Although the importance of coal as an energy source has declined, it continues to provide around 17 per cent of the nation’s primary energy consumption and about one third of its electricity. In 2003 the UK became a net importer of coal and in 2005, of a total demand for coal of about 63 Mt, only 20 Mt was produced domestically. In the same year production of coal by surface mining exceeded deep-mine production for the first time. There will be a continuing market for coal in the medium term as part of a balanced and varied UK energy supply. The operators of almost 75 per cent of UK coal-fired electricity generating capacity have opted to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment to enable their power stations to operate to at least 2015 in compliance with the EU Revised <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants</b> Directive. In addition, several operators have announced their interest in building new and more efficient coal-fired plant. However, the extent that indigenous coal will continue to contribute to UK supply will depend on the competitiveness of deep-mined coal relative to imported coal and the extent that new deep mine and opencast reserves can be accessed. The recent significant decline in opencast coal production in England reflects the fact that new permissions have failed to replenish the reserves being worked. The report brings together data on coal production, trade, consumption and uses, and provides information on licensing and reserves. It also summarises information on opencast coal sites granted and refused planning permissions and recommends that a system of safeguarding shallow coal resources be put in place. Coal exploitation by methods other than conventional deep and shallow mining are also summarised...|$|R
40|$|The {{interface}} {{between science and}} policy is often contentious and characterized by mutual suspicion, yet is critical to both halves of the divide. The application of science to real-world problems is ultimately {{one of the greatest}} markers of scientific achievement, while policy-makers can reduce the risks of failure by drawing on good evidence. The disproportionately large resource value of inland waters and marine systems together make synergies between science and policy particularly pertinent. Aquatic science has shaped major policy or regulatory legislation, with examples such as the US Clean Water Act (1972) and EU Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) deeply rooted in evidence. Modern policy examples are also emerging that can respond to the need for resilience to global change, the protection of natural capital and the sustainable management of ecosystem services. However, practical applications so far remain rudimentary. There have been extensive uses of aquatic conservation science to evaluate the outcomes from past policy implementation. Examples are the role of the EU <b>Large</b> <b>Combustion</b> <b>Plants</b> Directive (88 / 609 /EEC), EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91 / 271 /EEC) and the US Clean Water Act (1972) in restoring polluted, acidified, and urbanized fresh waters. However, larger-scale and longer-term data are required to reveal such policy effects more fully. Evaluations of policies to address recent problems in marine waters affected by climate change, acidification, or anoxia are far less complete. The authors suggest that aquatic scientists can play a pivotal role in identifying gaps or failings in policy or regulatory practice, and we urge our colleagues in aquatic conservation to recognize this role with conviction. A specific policy need is identified – to recognize more fully the importance of connectivity among land, inland waters, and seas to avoid high environmental costs, to capture conservation benefits, and to build resilience in aquatic ecosystems as, arguably, the world's most important environments...|$|R
