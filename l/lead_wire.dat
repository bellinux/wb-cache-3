5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} pollutant. Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of silver/silver chloride sensors operation is {{the conversion of}} ion current at the surface of human tissues to electron current to be delivered through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to the instrument to read. An {{important part of the}} operation is electrolyte gel which is applied between the electrode and tissues. The gel contains free chloride ions such that the charge can be carried through the electrolyte, therefore the electrolyte can be considered as conductive for ion current as the human tissues. When the ion current exists, the silver atoms in the electrode oxidize and discharge cations to the electrolyte and the electrons carry charge through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> At the same time, the chloride ions which are anions in the electrolyte travel toward the electrode and they are reduced as they bond with silver of the electrode resulting in silver chloride and free electrons to deliver to the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> The reaction allows current to pass from electrolyte to electrode and the electron current passes through the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> for the instrument to read.|$|E
25|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) {{is presently}} the most used method of surgical treatment {{because it does}} not destroy brain tissue, it is reversible, and it can be tailored to individuals at their particular stage of disease. DBS employs three hardware components: a neurostimulator, also called an implanted pulse generator (IPG), which generates electrical impulses used to modulate neural activity, a <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> which directs the impulses to a number of metallic electrodes towards the tip of the lead near the stimulation target, and an extension wire that connects the lead to the IPG. The IPG, which is battery-powered and encased in titanium, is traditionally implanted under the collarbone, and is connected by the subcutaneous extension to the lead, which extends from outside the skull under the scalp down into the brain to the target of stimulation. The IPG, or the entire three-component system, are sometimes referred to as a brain pacemaker, due to the precedence and renown of cardiac pacemakers and similarities in the components of both types of systems.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{composition}} resistors (CCR) {{consist of}} a solid cylindrical resistive element with embedded <b>wire</b> <b>leads</b> or metal end caps to which the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> are attached. The body of the resistor is protected with paint or plastic. Early 20th-century carbon composition resistors had uninsulated bodies; the <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> were wrapped around {{the ends of the}} resistance element rod and soldered. The completed resistor was painted for color-coding of its value.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{technique}} has been devised {{to reduce the}} number of <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> needed to connect an array of thermocouples to the instruments (e. g., voltmeters) used to read their output voltages. Because thermocouple wires are usually made of expensive metal alloys, reducing the number of <b>lead</b> <b>wires</b> can effect a considerable reduction in the cost of such an array. Reducing the number of wires also reduces the number of terminals and the amount of space needed to accommodate the wires...|$|R

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> was the traditional method of weighting flies, today's weighting materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{advantages}} of casting or swaging bullets from <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (which is pricier but avoids many quality-control issues of casting) {{is the ability}} to precisely control many attributes of the resulting bullet.

[...] A good example of where this is useful is for shooters of older military surplus firearms, which often exhibit widely varying bore and groove diameters; by making bullets specifically intended for the firearm in question, accuracy of the resulting cartridges can be significantly increased.|$|E
50|$|Since {{cartridge}} heaters {{are installed}} {{in a wide variety}} of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances. link The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> In order to prevent <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> can be protected with a metal conduit, braided metal or silicone sleeves.|$|E

50|$|A thermosonic bond {{falls in}} the {{category}} of a solid state metallic bond which is formed by mating two metal surfaces well below their respective melting points. Coucoulas introduced Thermosonic bonding which significantly improved upon the bond-reliability produced by available commercial solid-state bonding machines where he pre-heated the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> (and/or metallized silicon chip) prior to introducing the ultrasonic energy cycle. In addition to thermal softening the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the subsequent delivery of ultrasonic energy produced further softening by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the heated wire (known as ultrasonic softening). These two independent softening mechanisms (pre-heating <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> and deliverying the ultrasonic energy at the atomic lattice level) eliminated the incidences of cracking the fragile and costly silicon chip which were observed by Coucoulas when using earlier commercially available solid-state bonding machines. The improvement occurs because pre-heating and ultrasonic softening the lead-wire dramatically facilitated its deformation in forming the required contact area while using a relatively low set of bonding parameters. Depending on the temperature level and material properties of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire,</b> the onset of recrystallization (metallurgy) or hot working of the deforming wire can occur while it is forming the required contact area. Recrystallization takes place in the strain hardening region of the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> where it aids in the softening effect. If the wire was ultrasonically deformed at room temperature, it would tend to extensively strain hardened (cold working) and therefore tend to transmit damaging mechanical stresses to the silicon chip. Thermosonic bonding, initially referred to as Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding by Alexander Coucoulas, was found to bond a wide range of conductive metals such as aluminum and copper wires to tantalum and palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide and glass substrates all of which simulated the metallized silicon chip.|$|E

50|$|A Thermosonic bond {{is formed}} using {{a set of}} {{parameters}} which include ultrasonic, thermal and mechanical (force) energies. Figure 1 shows a diagram of a Thermosonic Bonding machine which includes a magnetostrictive or piezoelectric-type transducer {{which is used to}} convert electrical energy into vibratory motion which is known as Piezoelectricity. The vibratory motion travels along the coupler system, a portion which is tapered to serve as the velocity transformer. The velocity transformer amplifies the oscilliatory motion and delivers it to a heated bonding tip. It is akin to a friction bond, since the introduction of ultrasonic energy (via a bonding tool vertically attached to an ultrasonic transformer or horn) simultaneously delivers a force and vibratory or scrubbing motion to the interfacial contact points between a pre-heated deforming lead-wire and the metallized pads of a silicon integrated circuit (Figure 2). In addition to the delivery of thermal energy, the transmission of ultrasonic vibratory energy creates an ultrasonic softening effect by interacting at the atomic lattice level of the preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire.</b> These two softening effects dramatically facilitates the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> deformation by forming the desirable contact area using relatively low temperatures and forces. As a result of the frictional action and ultrasonic softening induced in the preheated <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> during the bonding cycle, thermosonic bonding can be used to reliably bond high melting point lead wires (such as gold and lower cost aluminum and copper) using relatively low bonding parameters. This ensures that the fragile and costly silicon integrated circuit chip is not exposed to potentially damaging conditions by having to use higher bonding parameters (ultrasonic energy, temperatures or mechanical forces) to deform the <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> in forming the required contact area during the bonding process.|$|E

50|$|Smaller {{spark gaps}} {{are often used}} to protect {{sensitive}} electrical or electronic equipment from high-voltage surges. In sophisticated versions of these devices (called gas tube arresters), a small spark gap breaks down during an abnormal voltage surge, safely shunting the surge to ground and thereby protecting the equipment. These devices are commonly used for telephone lines as they enter a building; the spark gaps help protect the building and internal telephone circuits {{from the effects of}} lightning strikes. Less sophisticated (and much less expensive) spark gaps are made using modified ceramic capacitors; in these devices, the spark gap is simply an air gap sawn between the two lead wires that connect the capacitor to the circuit. A voltage surge causes a spark that jumps from <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> to <b>lead</b> <b>wire</b> across the gap left by the sawing process. These low-cost devices are often used to prevent damaging arcs between the elements of the electron gun(s) within a cathode ray tube (CRT).|$|E
