5|$|As noted above, Section 7(a) led to {{significant}} increases in union organizing, as intended by the Act. But the enforcement of Section 7(a) and its legal limitations led to clear failures. Although Section 7(a) was not affected by the Supreme Court's decision in Schechter v. Poultry, {{the failure of the}} section <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to passage of the National Labor Relations Act in July 1935.|$|E
5|$|Eighteenth century {{scientific}} laboratories usually contained {{some form}} of hand-operated electrostatic machine. Italian scientist Luigi Galvani had an electrostatic generator in his laboratory, where experiments with frog legs led {{to the discovery of}} animal electricity. Another Italian scientist, Alessandro Volta, disagreed with some of Galvani's ideas, and this scientific argument motivated Volta to develop the first frog-free galvanic cell, and <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the invention of the first practical electric battery, the voltaic pile.|$|E

Besides, a subjective glare evaluation is presented. In the experience, signals with <b>LEDs</b> <b>directly</b> visible and signals with refractors are compared. Both signals were introduced in the visual field of 30 observers within a perceptive scene that simulated night vision conditions for a driver. The observers were later inquired about the experienced perturbation or discomfort sensation.|$|R

Starlog was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s. Initially, its focus was on Star Trek actors, but then it began to expand its scope.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} conspirators {{brought to}} power the 17-year-old King Peter II Karađorđević, whom they declared to be of age to assume the throne, and a {{government of national unity}} was formed with Simović as prime minister and Vladko Maček and Slobodan Jovanović as his vice-premiers. The coup <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Williams and Kilburn {{reported}} on the SSEM {{in a letter to}} the Journal Nature, published in September 1948. The machine's successful demonstration quickly led to the construction of a more practical computer, the , work on which began in August 1948. The first version was operational by April 1949, and it in turn <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the development of the Ferranti Mark 1, the world's first commercially available general-purpose computer.|$|E

5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more upmarket themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Dowding's {{insistence on}} waiting for AI <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to his {{dismissal}} on 24 November 1940. Many historians and writers, including Bowen, have suggested his dismissal was unwise, {{and that his}} identification of AI radar as the only practical solution was ultimately correct. While this may be true, the cat's eye force did result {{in a number of}} kills during the Blitz, although their effectiveness was limited and quickly overshadowed by the night fighter force. In May 1941 cat's eye fighters claimed 106 kills to the night fighters' 79, but flew twice as many sorties to do so.|$|E
5|$|Gauguin {{was celebrated}} by the Parisian avant-garde after the posthumous {{retrospective}} exhibitions at the Salon d'Automne in 1903 and 1906. The power evoked by his work <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. According to David Sweetman, Picasso became an aficionado of Gauguin in 1902 when he befriended the expatriate Spanish sculptor and ceramist Paco Durrio in Paris. Durrio {{was a friend}} of Gauguin and held several of his works in an attempt to help his poverty-stricken friend in Tahiti by promoting his oeuvre in Paris.|$|E

5|$|Later {{that same}} year, on May 4, the {{shooting}} of four students at Kent State protesting against the United States' invasion of Cambodia <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the student strike of 1970, a nationwide protest by students on college campuses against US involvement in Vietnam, including at Syracuse. Early protests on campus led to firebombing and window-breaking, but Corbally's decision to cancel classes and allow the students to protest without police or administration interference arguably resulted in more moderate protests than at other colleges.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{coached the}} Los Angeles Galaxy and the Columbus Crew in MLS, before {{becoming}} {{the head coach}} of Seattle Sounders FC in 2009. Despite never having played soccer at a professional level, he has the most coaching wins in MLS history and was {{the recipient of the}} MLS Coach of the Year Award in 1999 and 2008. Throughout his career, Schmid has received praise from critics for his ability to identify new talent. His defensive tactics are also highly regarded in the press and often cited as a factor in his success. However, their deployment in his final two seasons with Los Angeles <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the termination of his contract.|$|E
5|$|Between 1947 and September 22, 1949, Peng's forces {{occupied}} Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. His forces repeatedly defeated, {{but were}} not able to destroy, the forces of Hu Zongnan and Ma Bufang, which retreated into Sichuan and were airlifted to Taiwan when the Kuomintang lost the Civil War in December 1949. In October Peng's forces, <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> by Wang Zhen, invaded Xinjiang. Most of Xinjiang's defenders surrendered peacefully, and were incorporated as a new unit in Peng's army, but some ethnic guerrilla bands resisted Chinese control for several years. After the People's Republic of China was declared on October 1, 1949, Peng was appointed Chairman of the Northwest China Military and Administrative Commission and Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar of Xinjiang, with Wang Zhen as his deputy. This appointment gave Peng responsibility over Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, an area of over five millionsquare kilometres (1.9million square miles) but under thirty million people. Peng's forces continued their gradual occupation of Xinjiang, which they completed in September 1951.|$|E

5|$|Historian Robert Poole {{has called}} the Peterloo Massacre one of the {{defining}} moments of its age. In its own time, the London and national papers shared the horror felt in the Manchester region, but Peterloo's immediate effect was to cause the government {{to crack down on}} reform, with the passing of {{what became known as the}} Six Acts. It also <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the foundation of The Manchester Guardian (now The Guardian), but had little other effect on the pace of reform. In a survey conducted by The Guardian in 2006, Peterloo came second to the Putney Debates as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument or a memorial. Peterloo is commemorated by a plaque close to the site, a replacement for an earlier one that was criticised as being inadequate as it did not reflect the scale of the massacre.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Peloponnesian War, the militaristic city-state of Sparta had been able to impose a hegemony over the heartland of Classical Greece (the Peloponessus and mainland Greece south of Thessaly), the states of this area having been severely weakened by the war. This state of affairs was resented by many of the Greek city-states, which had traditionally been ferociously independent, and <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the Corinthian War of 395–387 BC. Sparta emerged from this conflict with its hegemony intact, though only as a result of Persian intervention, which led to the so-called King's Peace. The fragility of Spartan dominance had been demonstrated however, and in the next decade, the Thebans would revolt against Sparta. The Spartans were unable to successfully quell the revolt, leading to de facto Theban independence. Then, after several years of desultory conflict, the Thebans finally met the Spartans in open battle at Leuctra (371 BC), and under the leadership of Epaminondas inflicted an unprecedented defeat on the Spartan army, killing the Spartan king Cleombrotus I in the process.|$|E

5|$|Now one of Edward's strongest supporters, he {{accompanied}} the king {{on a campaign}} to Scotland in 1314, when several other nobles refused. He was killed at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24June, under somewhat unclear circumstances. Gloucester was {{the most prominent of}} the casualties of the battle, which ended in a humiliating defeat for England. As he had no issue, his death marked the end of the prominent de Clare family. His estates were divided between his three sisters, one of whom was married to the king's new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger. Despenser's ruthless expansion of the de Clare lordship of Glamorgan in Wales <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> to the troubles of EdwardII's later reign, including a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, the defeat of the Earl of Lancaster at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and eventually the deposition of the king by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella in 1326.|$|E
5|$|The War of the American Independence saw {{a series}} of {{military}} manoeuvres and battles involving naval forces of the British Royal Navy and the Continental Navy from 1775, and of the French Navy from 1778 onwards. These culminated in the surrender of the British Army force of Lieutenant-General Earl Charles Cornwallis, an event that <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> {{to the beginning of}} serious peace negotiations and the eventual end of the war. From the start of the hostilities, the British North American station under Vice-Admiral Samuel Graves blockaded the major colonial ports and carried raids agaynst patriot communities. Colonial forces could do little to stop these developments due to British naval supremacy. In 1777, colonial privateers made raids into British waters capturing merchant ships, which they took into French and Spanish ports, although both were officially neutral. Seeking to challenge Britain, France signed two treaties with America in February 1778, but stopped short of declaring war on Britain. The risk of a French invasion forced the British to concentrate its forces in the English Channel, leaving its forces in North America vulnerable to attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} ripe for {{redevelopment}} by the landholding elite, {{who wished to}} have suitably grand townhouses to occupy while attending Parliament and the court. The vestiges of the Privy Garden became {{the site of a}} new street. In 1808 a row of houses called Whitehall Gardens was constructed on the site. Behind each house, long grassy gardens planted with rows of trees <b>led</b> <b>directly</b> down to the river, until they were cut off by the construction of the Victoria Embankment along the river bank between 1865 and 1870. Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli lived in one of the houses between 1873 and 1875, while Sir Robert Peel lived in another (and died there in 1850 after falling from his horse on Constitution Hill). The trees outside the front entrance to Whitehall Gardens were the last survivors of the original Privy Garden, and stood until as recently as the late 1930s.|$|E
