2500|$|Most common glass {{contains}} {{other ingredients}} {{to change its}} properties. Lead glass or flint glass is more [...] "brilliant" [...] because the increased refractive index causes noticeably more specular reflection and increased optical dispersion. Adding barium also increases the refractive index. Thorium oxide gives glass a high refractive index and <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> and was formerly used in producing high-quality lenses, but due to its radioactivity {{has been replaced by}} lanthanum oxide in modern eyeglasses. Iron can be incorporated into glass to absorb infrared radiation, for example in heat-absorbing filters for movie projectors, while cerium(IV) oxide can be used for glass that absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|There {{exists a}} point called {{the circle of}} least confusion, where {{chromatic}} aberration can be minimized. It can be further minimized by using an achromatic lens or achromat, in which materials with differing dispersion are assembled {{together to form a}} compound lens. The most common type is an achromatic doublet, with elements made of crown and flint glass. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. By combining more than two lenses of different composition, the degree of correction can be further increased, as seen in an apochromatic lens or apochromat. Note that [...] "achromat" [...] and [...] "apochromat" [...] refer to the type of correction (2 or 3 wavelengths correctly focused), not the degree (how defocused the other wavelengths are), and an achromat made with sufficiently <b>low</b> <b>dispersion</b> glass can yield significantly better correction than an achromat made with more conventional glass. Similarly, the benefit of apochromats is not simply that they focus 3 wavelengths sharply, but that their error on other wavelength is also quite small.|$|E

40|$|The InAlAs/InGaAs/InP HEMT is the {{state-of-the-art}} technology for design of ultralow noise amplifiers for radio astronomy and deep space communication. One {{of the reasons}} that make this technology very attractive is the outstanding cut-off frequency fT and maximum frequency of oscillation fmax. However, a <b>low</b> frequency <b>dispersion</b> problem has been found for InP HEMTs working at very low temperature. This is a concern for receivers working in cryogenic condition to achieve better noise performance. No study has been published on this phenomenon before. In this thesis, a full study of <b>low</b> frequency <b>dispersion</b> in InP HEMTs is presented. The study is based on different measurement techniques including DC, RF and pulse characterization as well as analyzing spectrum measurements.

30|$|For the {{nanowires}} {{with smaller}} R, the maximum wavelengths in the lateral directions become shorter. As a result, the subbands {{except for the}} <b>lowest</b> <b>dispersion</b> curve of each mode {{go up to the}} higher frequency region, though a lot of subbands are folded into the mini-Brillouin zone. Changing the ratio of R and D, we can control the phonon modes in the lower frequency range.|$|R
30|$|All {{dispersion}} {{curves of}} the E mode are doubly degenerate because the irreducible {{representation of the}} E mode is two-dimensional. For the E modes, the <b>lowest</b> <b>dispersion</b> curve near k = 0 is proportional tok 2. This parabolic behavior {{is due to the}} fact that these modes correspond to the bending of the NWSL.

40|$|We present B and R-band {{luminosity}} functions (LF) for {{a sample}} of 25 nearby groups of galaxies. We find that the LFs of the groups with low X-ray luminosity (L_X < 10 ^{ 41. 7 } erg/s) are significantly {{different from those of}} the X-ray brighter groups, showing a prominent dip around M_b = - 18. While both categories show lack of late-type galaxies in their central regions, X-ray dim groups also show a more marked concentration of optical luminosity towards the centre. A toy simulation shows that in the <b>low</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> environment, as in the X-ray dim group, dynamical friction would facilitate more rapid merging, thus depleting intermediate-luminosity galaxies to form a few giant central galaxies, resulting in the prominent dip seen in our LFs. We suggest that X-ray dim (or <b>low</b> velocity <b>dispersion)</b> groups are the present sites of rapid dynamical evolution rather than their X-ray bright counterparts, and may be the modern precursors of fossil groups.

40|$|Dielectric {{relaxation}} in disordered dielectric mixtures {{are presented}} {{by emphasizing the}} interfacial polarization.

The considered systems are composed of two phases on two-dimensional square and triangular topological networks. We use the finite element method to calculate the effective dielectric permittivities of randomly generated structures. The dielectric relaxation phenomena together with the dielectric permittivity values at constant frequencies are investigated, and significant differences of the square and triangular topologies are observed. The frequency dependent properties of some of the generated structures are examined.
