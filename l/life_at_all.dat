5|$|On April 13, 1992, Reagan was {{assaulted}} by an anti-nuclear protester during a luncheon speech while accepting an {{award from the}} National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas. The protester, 41-year old Richard Paul Springer, smashed a 2-foot-high (60cm) 30-pound (13.5kg) crystal statue of an eagle that the broadcasters had given the former president. Flying shards of glass hit Reagan, {{but he was not}} injured. Using media credentials, Springer intended to announce government plans for an underground nuclear weapons test in the Nevada desert the following day. Springer was the founder of an anti-nuclear group called the 100th Monkey. Following his arrest on assault charges, a Secret Service spokesman could not explain how Springer got past the federal agents who guarded Reagan's <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times. Later, Springer pled guilty to reduced charges and said he hadn't meant to hurt Reagan through his actions. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor federal charge of interfering with the Secret Service, but other felony charges of assault and resisting officers were dropped.|$|E
25|$|In {{connection}} with healthcare philosophy, {{the theory of}} natural rights becomes a rather pertinent subject. After birth, man is effectively endowed {{with a series of}} natural rights that cannot be banished under any circumstances. One major proponent of natural rights theory was seventeenth-century English political philosopher John Locke. With regard to the natural rights of man, Locke states, Although partially informed by his religious understanding of the world, Locke's statement can essentially be viewed as an affirmation of the right to preserve one's <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> costs. This point is precisely where healthcare as a human right becomes relevant.|$|E
500|$|The Catechism {{states that}} [...] the embryo [...] "must be treated from {{conception}} as a person". The Latin original of as is tamquam, meaning [...] "like" [...] or [...] "just as". [...] "Although the Church has not determined officially when human life actually begins, {{it has taken}} the course of maintaining that human life is present {{from the moment of}} conception or fertilization"; respect for <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> stages, even potential life, is generally the context of church documents.|$|E

500|$|However, Milk's {{assassination}} {{has become}} entwined with his political efficacy, {{partly because he}} was killed at the zenith of his popularity. Historian Neil Miller writes, [...] "No contemporary American gay leader has yet to achieve in life the stature Milk found in death." [...] His legacy has become ambiguous; Randy Shilts concludes his biography writing that Milk's success, murder, and the inevitable injustice of White's verdict represented the experience of all gays. Milk's life was [...] "a metaphor for the homosexual experience in America". According to Frances FitzGerald, Milk's legend {{has been unable to}} be sustained as no one appeared able to take his place in the years after his death: [...] "The Castro saw him as a martyr but understood his martyrdom as an end rather than a beginning. He had died, and with him {{a great deal of the}} Castro's optimism, idealism, and ambition seemed to die as well. The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections, and possibly wanted no one." [...] On the 20th anniversary of Milk's death, historian John D'Emilio said, [...] "The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one's <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> times with integrity." [...] For a political career so short, Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life: [...] "His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process." ...|$|E

Donnelly said “As a pro-life congressman, I am committed to protecting <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> stages.” In 2011, he co-sponsored HR 3, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. The bill contained an exception for [...] "forcible rape," [...] which opponents criticized as potentially excluding drug-facilitated rape, date rape, and other forms of rape. The bill also allowed an exception for minors who are victims of incest.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{there has been}} an upward trend in <b>life</b> {{expectancy}} <b>at</b> older ages in England. Figures 1 and 2 show life expectancy in England at ages 65, 75, 85 and 95 from 1981 to 2014. The data points shaded red in Figures 1 and 2 indicate where life expectancy in that year was lower than in the previous year, showing that there is some fluctuation in <b>life</b> expectancy <b>at</b> these age groups, although the overall trend has been upwards. Male life expectancy was lower in 2012 than 2011 at ages 85 and 95, and at ages 65 and 75 it was the same in both years. There were no further falls in 2013. This flattening of the recent trend has not continued in 2014, which saw a rise in male <b>life</b> expectancy <b>at</b> <b>all</b> four ages. Male life expectancy increased by 0. 3 years at age 65 and 0. 2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95. For females, <b>life</b> expectancy <b>at</b> <b>all</b> four ages was lower in 2012 than 2011. At age 65, that was the first fall since 1995 and at age 75 the first fall since 2003. At ages 85 and 95, there have been frequent occasions when life expectancy in a year was lower than in the previous year. Between 2012 and 2013, there were no further falls in <b>life</b> expectancy <b>at</b> any of these ages. Between 2013 and 2014, there was an increase in female <b>life</b> expectancy <b>at</b> <b>all</b> four ages. Female life expectancy increased by 0. 3 years at age 65 and by 0. 2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95. ...|$|R
2500|$|Tang poetry (...) {{refers to}} poetry written in {{or around the}} time of or in the {{characteristic}} style of China's Tang dynasty, (June 18, 618 - June 4, 907, including the 690-705 reign of Wu Zetian) and/or follows a certain style, often considered as the Golden Age of Chinese poetry. The Quantangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social <b>life</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone. This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. Two of the most famous poets of the period were Li Bai and Du Fu. Tang poetry has had an ongoing influence on world literature and modern and quasi-modern poetry.|$|E
