The areas where the property rights over the land were given to landlords registered lower productivity and agricultural investments in post-Colonial years compared to areas where land tenure was dominated by cultivators.

In its assessments, this paper extracts information from Cross-Section Data and analyse it by applying Chi-square test to show the relationship between <b>Land</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>Systems</b> and agriculture productivity. The outcome shows that <b>Land</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>Systems</b> has a direct influence on productivity in Agriculture and can result in poverty and low standard of living among peasant farmers. In view of the problems, the paper discusses the prevalence of the terms, rules and regulations of the land acquisitions process and its repercussions and concludes from the results that <b>Land</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>Systems</b> is a factor for low productivity in Agribusiness, and makes recommendations for the improvement of the <b>land</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>Systems</b> to reduce the inherent insecurity...|$|R

25|$|The Lumads {{are people}} from various {{ethnic groups in}} Mindanao island. Residing in their ancestral lands, they are often evicted and {{displaced}} due to the Moro people's claim on the same territory. The Lumads have lost parts of their ancestral land due to a failure to understand the modern <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>system.</b> To counter this, the Lumads established schools in their communities, supplying essential knowledge for the tribe members that would protect their rights, property and culture. However, the Lumad communities are located in mountains that are distant from urban areas. These areas are also the location sites of armed conflict between the New People's Army (NPA) and the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). Caught in the conflict, the Lumad people's education, property, and security are endangered because of the increasing amount of military activity by the armed parties. Increasing military activity have {{eventually led to the}} displacement of the communities to shelter sites. Anxiety continues to grow among the Lumads with the escalation of armed conflict and detainment of community leaders (tribe leaders and teachers) labelled as rebels by the military. Alternative schools within the communities (aided by NGOs and universities) face concerns of closing down or demolition of their property, with some buildings converted by the military for their use. Lumad leaders and tribesmen, having experienced political detention due to false suspicions as well as the displacement of their tribes from their areas, have demanded respect for their human rights.|$|E

By {{the time of his}} arrival, a <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>system</b> known as the Native Customary Rights (NCR) have been practised by the indigenous communities. As Brooke's main priority is to abolishing headhunting among the indigenous communities in the interior, the kingdom authorities conduct persistent raids to Sea Dayak villages and forcing them to practice horticultural modes as a new method to sustain their lives. This was done as most of the Sea Dayak at the time refused to abandon the culture and only agreed after been stopped through their major rebellion. Other Dayaks like the Land Dayak were also previously involved in headhunting, but most of them are peaceful people who abide by the laws and only attacking if attacked by other tribes; which subsequently became Brooke loyal followers as they agreed to leaving the former culture. Most Malays coastal villages were also raided as part of the kingdom's policy to combating piracy and slavery. These policy turned to be successful but the kingdom was plagued by high debt as a result from several major rebellions in response to the ongoing supression campaign especially with the stagnant economic situation at the time.|$|E
2500|$|By 1908, much of {{the vigor}} and {{determination}} {{that went into the}} organization of the Association gradually died out due to a combination of internal and external complications. Most notably, the unfavorable <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>system,</b> the indolent and indifferent farmer, financial inability, and trust opposition all succeeded in the delay of progressive action. One of the most discouraging obstacles that the Association faced was the independent farmer who asserted his independence by refusing to join the association. These nonmembers, or [...] "hillbillies," [...] believed a better price could be obtained by refusing to join the association, and, in many instances, actually succeeded in obtaining significantly higher prices from the ATC representatives due to the shortage of tobacco. One representative of the American Tobacco Company remarked: [...] "What is the use of going into the association? We will give you as good and better prices than they can get for you {{and there will be no}} commissions or expenses. Sell to us direct, here is the cash for you now!" [...] Consequently, this refusal of cooperation would ultimately result in the deterioration of the public’s opinion of the Planters’ Protective Association.|$|E

2500|$|As the Enclosure Movement was a {{contentious}} political issue in England, {{the issue of}} land tenure was also highly contentious in 17th-century Massachusetts Bay Colony and in Sudbury in particular. [...] Open field or communal farming was practiced in most of Sudbury, following traditions of the commons and governance practices brought from central and western England during the early 17th century. [...] Rice and twelve other dissenters from Sudbury {{who were interested in}} 'closed field' or owner-operator farming, as it was practiced in southeastern England, petitioned the Great and General Court in 1656 to create the town of Marlborough where individual ownership of farmland was to be exclusively practiced. The tract of land was [...] west of Sudbury that, in addition to becoming Marlborough, eventually became Northborough, Westborough, Southborough, and Hudson as well. [...] Rice was elected as selectman of Marlborough in 1657 as the town was being established. [...] The town was formally chartered on 12 June 1660 by the General Court. [...] Upon being granted a maximum allotment of [...] of land in Marlborough, Rice was one of the three largest initial landholders of the new town. According to Powell (1963), the founding of Marlborough with exclusive closed-field land tenure was a seminal event in establishing the predominant freehold or fee simple <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>system</b> of America. Rice was reelected as selectman in Marlborough every year after 1657 until his death.|$|E

40|$|The {{combined}} {{economies of}} China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, referred to collectively as Greater China, are forecast to equal {{that of the}} USA by 2002. Land development has played a significant part in this growth in Hong Kong and Taiwan and is doing so increasingly in China as opportunities are taken {{as a result of}} land reform. As they continue to converge both economically and politically, the apparent disparity of their <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> may inhibit this process. This paper examines the common roots of their <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> and the divergences which have occurred during the last two centuries. In tracing these roots it focuses on the major evolution during this century when the communists and nationalists split to form the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China respectively whilst Hong Kong continued to be administered by Britain. It identifies the major <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> reforms which have occured and argues that the apparent differences in <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> are not substantive due to all three systems being founded on a common history and with philosophical developments which are compatible but one in which Britain's position seems somewhat ironic. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Land in Ethiopia is {{a public}} property. Farmers have use right to {{transfer}} or lease use rights of agricultural <b>land.</b> Thus, <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> under the existing public ownership of land derive from official allocation by local government authorities and/or through transfer of land use rights. Farmers 2 ̆ 7 practice of leasing agricultural land {{in the country is}} mostly limited to a few years, for instance to maximum of three years in one agreement. The common types of transaction of agricultural land include inheritance, cash renting, sharecropping and gift. The process and act of land transfer among land users, however, is often non-transparent. The transaction usually takes place informally. The land lease market (sharecropping and cash rental) is constrained, inter alia, by lack of clear rules and regulations for secure and transparent land lease transaction. Such situation is therefore expected to influence farmers to differentially manage leased-in and own land parcels in terms of application of sustainable land management technologies. On the other hand, however, most of the agricultural land in Ethiopia requires conservation-based land management technologies. The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> and examine the impact of <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> on the use of land management technologies and draw policy lessons...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{relies on}} an {{interdisciplinary}} framework {{to conduct an}} investigation of seminal national policies and planning processes in New Zealand and Quebec Province, Canada related to sovereignty, indigenous land rights, and customary <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems.</b> Theoretical frameworks for this research include a comparative analysis of European legislative systems and traditional planning frameworks in relation to indigenous governance <b>systems</b> and <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> for the Maori (NZ) and James Bay Cree (QC). Through interviews and experiential knowledge I will document tools and techniques that these indigenous communities use to navigate complex cross-cultural policy and planning processes for their own advocacy of cultural heritage values. From the Maori perspective, cultural heritage values include the concept and principles of kaitikatanga. James Bay Cree cultural heritage values include the concept and guiding principles embedded in Eeyou Iyihtiwin. These cultural heritage values represent abstract concepts and guiding principles that are embedded in and gain meaning from local context, cultural knowledge and customary traditions. The Maori and James Bay Cree share a similar orientation to the meaning and importance of land. Together these indigenous communities view land {{as the foundation for}} collective and individual identity and cultural traditions. From this perspective and meaning of land, the Maori and James Bay Cree recognize that people are a part of a greater interconnected system that spans across physical and metaphysical spaces. In practice, native or customary <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> are based on cultural heritage values that support a spirit of reciprocity with an underlying expectation that a balanced system will provide for all life. This analysis may provide a new cross-cultural framework for policy and planning processes to provide opportunities for fair negotiation of sustainable <b>land</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>systems</b> and natural resource management...|$|R
