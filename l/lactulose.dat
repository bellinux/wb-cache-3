5|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to <b>lactulose</b> for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class. This is thought {{to work in a}} similar way to other antibiotics, but without the complications attached to neomycin or metronidazole. Due to the long history and lower cost of <b>lactulose</b> use, rifaximin is generally only used as a second-line treatment if <b>lactulose</b> is poorly tolerated or not effective. When rifaximin is added to <b>lactulose,</b> the combination of the two may be more effective than each component separately. Rifaximin is more expensive than <b>lactulose,</b> but the cost may be offset by reduced hospital admissions for encephalopathy.|$|E
5|$|The West Haven {{classification}} was {{formulated by}} Prof Harold Conn (1925–2011) {{and colleagues at}} Yale University while investigating the therapeutic efficacy of <b>lactulose.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{preparation}} of L-ornithine and L-aspartate (LOLA) {{is used to}} increase the generation of urea through the urea cycle, a metabolic pathway that removes ammonia by turning it into the neutral substance urea. It may be combined with <b>lactulose</b> and/or rifaximin if these alone are ineffective at controlling symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event. <b>Lactulose</b> is frequently used to decrease ammonia levels. Certain antibiotics and probiotics are other potential options. A liver transplant may improve outcomes {{in those with}} severe disease.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lactulose</b> and {{lactitol}} are disaccharides {{that are}} not absorbed from the digestive tract. They are thought to decrease the generation of ammonia by bacteria, render the ammonia inabsorbable by converting it to ammonium (NH4+) ions, and increase transit of bowel content through the gut. Doses of 15-30ml are administered three times a day; the result is aimed to be 3–5 soft stools a day, or (in some settings) a stool pH of <6.0. <b>Lactulose</b> may also be given by enema, especially if encephalopathy is severe. More commonly, phosphate enemas are used. This may relieve constipation, one {{of the causes of}} encephalopathy, and increase bowel transit.|$|E
25|$|Patients with grade I–II {{encephalopathy}} {{should be}} transferred to a liver transplant facility and listed for transplantation. Consider a brain computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out other causes of altered or impaired mental status. Stimulation and overhydration can cause elevations in intracranial pressure (ICP) and should be avoided. Unmanageable agitation may be treated with short-acting benzodiazepines in small doses. <b>Lactulose</b> can be considered at this stage. A preliminary report from the ALFSG on 117 patients suggests that use of <b>lactulose</b> in the first 7 days after diagnosis {{is associated with a}} small increase in survival time, but with no difference in severity of encephalopathy or in the overall outcome. For patients who progress to grade III–IV encephalopathy, intubation for airway protection is generally required. Many centers use propofol for sedation because it may reduce cerebral blood. The head of the bed should be elevated to 30 degrees, and electrolytes, blood gasses, glucose, and neurologic status monitored frequently.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{liver damage}} from {{cirrhosis}} cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis {{may be an}} energy-consuming process. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as <b>lactulose,</b> decrease the risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.|$|E
25|$|Fibromyalgia is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} pain condition. <b>Lactulose</b> breath testing {{has shown that}} patients with fibromyalgia have a more pronounced degree of abnormal results compared to both IBS patients and the general population. This study also demonstrated positive correlation {{between the amount of}} pain and the degree of abnormality on the breath test. A subsequent study also demonstrated increased prevalence of intestinal hyperpermeability, which some believe occurs commonly with SIBO.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lactulose</b> and {{lactitol}} are {{beneficial for}} treating hepatic encephalopathy, {{and are the}} recommended first-line treatment. <b>Lactulose</b> {{does not appear to}} be more effective than lactitol for treating people with hepatic encephalopathy. Side effects of <b>lactulose</b> and lactitol include the possibility of diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and nausea. [...] In acute liver failure, it is unclear whether <b>lactulose</b> is beneficial. The possible side effect of bloating may interfere with a liver transplant procedure if required.|$|E
2500|$|Opioids, while very {{effective}} analgesics, {{may have some}} unpleasant side-effects. [...] Patients starting morphine may experience nausea and vomiting (generally relieved by a short course of antiemetics such as phenergan). Pruritus (itching) may require switching to a different opioid. [...] Constipation occurs in almost all patients on opioids, and laxatives (<b>lactulose,</b> macrogol-containing or co-danthramer) are typically co-prescribed.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of OIC is {{successional}} {{and dependent}} on severity. The first mode of treatment is non-pharmacological, and includes lifestyle modifications like increasing dietary fiber, fluid intake (around [...] per day), and physical activity. If non-pharmacological measures are ineffective, laxatives, including stool softeners (e.g., docusate), bulk-forming laxatives (e.g., fiber supplements), stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl, senna), and/or enemas, may be used. A common laxative regimen for OIC {{is the combination}} of docusate and bisacodyl. Osmotic laxatives, including <b>lactulose,</b> polyethylene glycol, and milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide), as well as mineral oil (a lubricant laxative), are also commonly used for OIC.|$|E
2500|$|Breath {{tests have}} been {{developed}} to test for bacterial overgrowth, based on bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates to hydrogen and/or methane, or based on the detection of by-products of digestion of carbohydrates that are not usually metabolized. [...] The hydrogen breath test involves having the patient fast for a minimum of 12 hours then having them drink a substrate usually glucose or <b>lactulose,</b> then measuring expired hydrogen and methane concentrations typically over a period of 2–3 hours. [...] It compares well to jejunal aspirates in making the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth. [...] 13C and 14C based tests have also been developed based on the bacterial metabolism of D-xylose. [...] Increased bacterial concentrations are also involved in the deconjugation of bile acids. [...] The glycocholic acid breath test involves the administration of the bile acid 14C glychocholic acid, and the detection of 14CO2, which would be elevated in bacterial overgrowth.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is best, {{when it can}} be performed. [...] Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, {{and it must be}} kept below 20cm H2O or else portal hypertension will ensue. [...] Methods of shunt attenuation should aim to slowly occlude the vessel over several weeks to months in order to avoid complications associated with portal hypertension. These methods include ameroid ring constrictors, cellophane banding, intravascular or percutaneous silicone hydraulic occluders. The most common methods of attenuation used by veterinarians are ameroid ring constrictors and cellophane banding. Both methods have reportedly good outcomes in both cats and dogs, although the true composition of readily sourced cellophane {{has been found to be}} made from plastics (inert) and not cellulose (stimulates a fibrous reaction). Recently, a commercial supplier of regenerated cellulose based cellophane for veterinarians has been established for use of [...] Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent. [...] However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent). [...] Intrahepatic shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed. [...] When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of liver failure. [...] Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and antibiotics such as neomycin or metronidazole and other medicines such as <b>lactulose</b> can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines. [...] The prognosis is guarded for any form of PSS.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lactulose</b> and {{lactitol}} are {{beneficial for}} treating hepatic encephalopathy, {{and are the}} recommended first-line treatment. <b>Lactulose</b> {{does not appear to}} be more effective than lactitol for treating people with hepatic encephalopathy. Side effects of <b>lactulose</b> and lactitol include the possibility of diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and nausea. [...] In acute liver failure, it is unclear whether <b>lactulose</b> is beneficial. The possible side effect of bloating may interfere with a liver transplant procedure if required.|$|E
50|$|The {{antibiotic}} rifaximin may be {{recommended in}} addition to <b>lactulose</b> for those with recurrent disease. It is a nonabsorbable antibiotic from the rifamycin class.

50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of chronic constipation in patients of all ages as a long-term treatment. <b>Lactulose</b> is used for chronic idiopathic constipation, i.e. chronic constipation occurring without any identifiable cause. <b>Lactulose</b> may be used to counter the constipating effects of opioids, and in the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids as a stool softener.|$|E
5000|$|Intestinal {{permeability}} is {{a measurement}} of intestinal mucosal barrier function and {{is defined as}} [...] "the facility with which intestinal epithelium allows molecules to pass through by non-mediated passive diffusion." [...] Permeability in this respect is mostly related to the measurable passage of ions and small inert molecules. Standard methods for measurement include tissue electrical resistance for in vitro testing and passage of ingested inert molecules of specific molecular weights into the urine for in vivo testing. For example, in vivo testing using <b>lactulose</b> / mannitol consists of ingesting 5 g <b>lactulose</b> and 2 g mannitol followed by determination of urinary concentrations of <b>lactulose</b> and mannitol 5 hours after ingestion. The percentage <b>lactulose</b> excretion and the <b>lactulose</b> mannitol ratio in the urine are calculated and used {{as a measure of}} intestinal permeability.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of <b>lactulose</b> are {{abdominal}} cramping, borborygmus and flatulence. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening. Uncommon side effects are nausea and vomiting. In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced kidney function, excess <b>lactulose</b> dosage can result in dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as low magnesium levels. Ingestion of <b>lactulose</b> does not cause a weight gain because it is nondigestible with no nutritional value. Although <b>lactulose</b> {{is less likely to}} cause dental caries than sucrose, as a sugar there is potential for this. This should be taken into consideration when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> is {{effective}} in treating hepatic encephalopathy. Specifically it {{is effective}} as secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Moreover, recent studies showed improved cognitive functions of in people with cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy treated with <b>lactulose.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lactulose</b> is a {{carbohydrate}} {{that is not}} {{absorbed by}} humans. <b>Lactulose</b> is well known to measure oro-cecal transit time. [...] The mean oro-cecal transit time in normal healthy individuals is 70 to 90 minutes. [...] By 90 minutes, at least 50% of individuals would have delivered the <b>lactulose</b> dose to the colon. Approximately 90 to 95% of individuals have colonic bacteria that can metabolize <b>lactulose</b> to hydrogen or methane gas. Thus, any SIBO breath test that collects longer than 60 minutes may be measuring colonic activity. Diagnostic criteria of 20 ppm hydrogen and/or methane changes within 90 or 120 minutes will have higher positive rates of SIBO but this will reflect colonic activity not jejunal metabolism. A one-hour SIBO breath test avoids false positive results by collecting breath up to 60 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Examples: {{glycerin}} suppositories (Hallens), sorbitol, <b>lactulose,</b> and PEG (Colyte, MiraLax) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> {{was first}} made in 1929 {{and has been}} used {{medically}} since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic and brand-name product. In various countries it could be purchased for about 0.16 per 15 ml of syrup (10 g of <b>lactulose)</b> in 2015. In the United States the cost of this amount is about 0.63. <b>Lactulose</b> is made from the milk sugar lactose, which is composed of two simple sugars, galactose and glucose.|$|E
50|$|For children, PEG {{was found}} to be more {{effective}} than <b>lactulose.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> {{works by}} the osmotic effect, which retains water in the colon, {{lowering}} the pH through bacterial fermentation to lactic, formic and acetic acid, and increasing colonic peristalsis. <b>Lactulose</b> is also indicated in portal-systemic encephalopathy. Glycerin suppositories work mostly by hyperosmotic action, but the sodium stearate in the preparation also causes local irritation to the colon.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> is the {{international}} nonproprietary name(INN). It is sold under various brand names.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> is {{commonly}} used as a food additive to improve taste and promote intestinal transit time.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> is {{available}} without prescription in most countries, but a prescription {{is required in}} the United States and Austria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lactulose</b> for hepatic {{encephalopathy}} generally requires relatively large oral dosages {{three or four}} times a day with episodic diarrhea and constant flatulence almost a certain side effect. People who take <b>lactulose</b> at this level of dosage generally end up wearing an adult diaper and plastic pants for any activities away from home or at night (with a chux pad for the bed) because the diarrhea can occur swiftly and without much warning.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Lactulose</b> {{is useful}} in {{treating}} hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia), {{which can lead to}} hepatic encephalopathy. <b>Lactulose</b> helps trap the ammonia (NH3) in the colon and bind to it. [...] It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible ammonia into ammonium (...) which can no longer diffuse back into the blood. It is also useful for preventing hyperammonemia caused as a side effect of administration of valproic acid.|$|E
5000|$|Small Bowel Bacterial Overgrowth Syndrome (SBBOS) or Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) [...] - [...] {{the patient}} is either given a {{challenge}} dose of glucose, also known as dextrose (75-100 grams), or <b>lactulose</b> (10 grams). A baseline breath sample is collected, and then additional samples are collected at 15 minute or 20 minute intervals for 3-5 hours. Positive diagnosis for a <b>lactulose</b> SIBO breath test [...] - [...] typically positive if the patient produces approximately 20 ppm of hydrogen and/or methane within the first two hours (indicates bacteria in the small intestine), followed by a much larger peak (colonic response). This {{is also known as}} a biphasic pattern. <b>Lactulose</b> is not absorbed by the digestive system and can help determine distal end bacterial overgrowth, which means the bacteria are lower in the small intestine.|$|E
50|$|High osmotic gap (>100 mosm/kg) {{causes of}} osmotic {{diarrhea}} include celiac sprue, chronic pancreatitis, lactase deficiency, <b>lactulose,</b> laxative use/abuse, and Whipple's disease.|$|E
50|$|Lactose is {{hydrolysed}} to glucose and galactose, isomerised in {{alkaline solution}} to <b>lactulose,</b> and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol.|$|E
50|$|For adults, a {{randomized}} controlled trial found PEG (MiraLax or GlycoLax) 17 grams once per {{day to be}} superior to tegaserod at 6 mg twice per day. A randomized controlled trial found greater improvement from two sachets (26 grams) of PEG versus two sachets (20 grams) of <b>lactulose.</b> 17 grams per day of PEG has been effective and safe in {{a randomized}} controlled trial for six months. Another randomized controlled trial found no difference between sorbitol and <b>lactulose.</b>|$|E
50|$|The SIBO {{breath test}} {{typically}} uses a 10 gram oral dose of <b>lactulose</b> for detection of proximal bacterial overgrowth. The best practice {{is to have}} breath samples collected at 20, 40, and 60 minutes after dosing. Since SIBO occurs in the proximal intestine, breath samples should be collected only within 1 hour after <b>lactulose</b> ingestion. This truly reflects proximal intestinal bacterial activity, not distal or colonic activity. The same argument is true if glucose is the substrate.|$|E
