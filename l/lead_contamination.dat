5|$|Mycena galericulata is saprobic, {{and grows}} on {{decaying}} hardwood and softwood sticks, chips, logs, and stumps. It can also grow from submerged wood, which may {{give it a}} terrestrial appearance. It typically grows in small clusters or sometimes singly. The fungus fruits from late spring to early winter. A study of litter-decomposing fungi in a coniferous forest in Finland showed that M.galericulata produces extracellular hydrolytic enzymes in the humus and eluvial soil, including β-glucosidase, β-xylosidase, α-glucosidase, butyrate esterase and sulphatase. The enzymes form complexes with inorganic and organic particles in the soil and break down (depolymerize) biopolymers such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and starch, which contributes to the cycling of carbon and nutrients. The presence of <b>lead</b> <b>contamination</b> in the soil decreases both the growth and the extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activity of M.galericulata.|$|E
5|$|On December 31, 1999, Moscoso {{oversaw the}} {{handover}} of the Panama Canal from the US to Panama under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. Her government then faced {{the challenge of}} cleaning up environmental problems in the Canal Zone, where the US Army had long tested bombs, biological agents, and chemical weapons. Remaining issues included <b>lead</b> <b>contamination,</b> unexploded munitions, and stockpiles of depleted uranium. Though Moscoso fired all of Pérez Balladares' appointments from the Panama Canal Authority and appointed supermarket magnate (and future president) Ricardo Martinelli as its head, the Authority retained its autonomy from her administration. At the same time, Panama's economy began to struggle due {{to the loss of}} income from American canal personnel.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for <b>lead</b> <b>contamination</b> in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
40|$|Lead is an {{environmental}} toxin which causes injuries {{of the human}} organism {{as well as of}} the central nervous system (CNS). In the past, research in this context was mostly related to investigations of persons who were heavily exposed to lead, especially children with increased measurable lead blood concentrations. It was shown in different studies that <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> <b>lead</b> to irreversible intelligence deficits for children. In addition, lead can reduce the concentration capabilities and the scholar performance (mathematical, memory and reading skills) as well as lead to reduced coordination and fine motor skills. In recent publications, it was also shown that weak <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> of children (< 10 µg/dl limit as defined by WHO) cause damages of the central nervous system. However, it is still unknown in how far weak <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> damage the central nervous system of adult people. In this thesis, the influence of weak <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> of adults was investigated in the context of the achievable attentiveness. For this purpose, 50 test persons who suffered from environmental diseases were examined in detailed medical tests during the time period between April 1997 and December 1997 in the environmental ambulance of the Klinikum Aachen. In the course of these tests, especially the lead concentration in the blood and the urine of the test persons were screened for heavy metals and selenium. Based on a standardized set of neurological tests specific attention capabilities of the test persons were assessed. As a result, it was shown that a significant correlation between the lead concentration in the blood and the speed of the human working memory exists. Lead has a negative impact already for low levels of contamination and yields measurable cognitive degenerations. The observed degradations indicate that constant weak <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> affect the pre-frontal cortex which is connected to the working memory performance. Other disorders described by the test persons may also be influenced by <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations.</b> A proof for this, however, can not be provided by the involved test methods...|$|R
40|$|Background: Lead and cadmium are toxic {{heavy metals}} found as major {{contaminants}} in food products and edible oils. The aims {{of this study}} were to investigate the <b>lead</b> and cadmium <b>contaminations</b> in seeds and extracted oils from Brassica napus L and Carthamus tinctorius grown in the vicinity of industrial sites (Isfahan Zobe Ahan) near Isfahan province/Iran. Methods: In this study, the seeds of B. napus and C. tinctorius were randomly sampled from the farms. The oils of seeds were provided by factory and extracted as well in our laboratory. The two series of washed and unwashed seeds digested with nitric acid and the amount of elements in seeds and oils were measured using GF-AA spectrometer equipped with Zeeman Effect. Results: Cadmium was found in all samples below the Method Detection Limit (MDL, 0. 04 μg/L). <b>Lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> were found in all seeds and oils except washed B. napus seeds. The highest levels of <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> were observed in oils of C. tinctorius and B. napus with the amount of 24. 74 μg/L and 11. 85 μg/L, respectively. The level of lead in unwashed seed oils were significantly higher than washed seed oils (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: The contamination rate of cadmium compared with lead was very low. The higher <b>lead</b> <b>contaminations</b> in unwashed seeds oils compared with washed seeds oils indicated that the contaminant should have been be transferred through the air. Although these observations suggest that the levels of contaminations in edible oils are below the toxic level, long-term exposure may lead to potential health risks. ...|$|R

25|$|Diving is also {{sometimes}} practiced in swimming pools {{for training and}} exercise. Swimming pools can be contaminated by lead weights.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s an {{extensive}} government funded Lead Education program was established {{and people with}} children under 5 were able to have free lead testing of their children, homes and gardens to assess <b>lead</b> <b>contamination</b> levels. Any property that had considerably high lead levels in ceiling dust or garden soil was provided with free remediation works to reduce potential exposure to lead dust.|$|E
25|$|In West Dallas, Texas, {{a mostly}} African American and Latino community, a lead smelter {{poisoned}} the surrounding neighborhood, elementary school, and day cares {{for more than}} five decades. Dallas city officials were informed in 1972 that children in the proximity of the smelter were being exposed to <b>lead</b> <b>contamination.</b> The city sued the lead smelters in 1974, then reduced its lead regulations in 1976. It wasn't until 1981 that the EPA commissioned a study on the <b>lead</b> <b>contamination</b> in this neighborhood, and found the same results that had been found a decade earlier. In 1983, the surrounding day cares had to close due to the lead exposure while the lead smelter remained operating. It was later revealed that EPA Deputy Administrator John Hernandez had deliberately stalled the clean up of the lead-contaminated hot spots. It wasn't until 1993 that the site was declared a Superfund site, and {{at the time it was}} one of the largest ones. However, it was not until 2004 when the EPA completed the clean-up efforts and eliminated the lead pollutant sources from the site.|$|E

25|$|While still {{considered}} one of the most polluted places on the planet, the valley's air pollution problems are not as bad as they were several decades ago. One major problem that was brought under control was the <b>lead</b> <b>contamination</b> in the air with the introduction of unleaded gasoline. Two other contaminants that have been brought under control are carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. The contamination problems that remain are primarily with ozone and fine particles (soot) (between 2.5micrometers and 10micrometers). Thirty to fifty percent of the time, Mexico City's levels of fine particles of ten micrometers, the most dangerous, exceed levels recommended by the World Health Organization.|$|E
