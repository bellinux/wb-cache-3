40|$|The paper {{develops}} a general {{framework for the}} formulation of generic uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers.</b> In particular, we introduce a basic generic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> that contains recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> by Andrews [2] and Hoadley [7 J as special cases. We also develop a truncation approach. {{that makes it possible}} to obtain uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the functions under consideration from uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for truncated versions of those functions. The point of the truncation approach is that uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> for the truncated versions are typically easier to obtain. By combining the basic uniform law of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> and the truncation approach we also derive generalizations of recent uniform laws of <b>large</b> <b>numbers</b> introduced in Potscher and Prucha [13, l 5]. ...|$|R

In studying such objects, the interest for mathematical statisticians {{lies in the fact that}} most of the frequencies are small and, therefore, difficult to deal with. It is not immediately clear how one should be able to derive consistent and reliable inference from a <b>large</b> <b>number</b> of such frequencies. In this thesis we study the diversity of questionnaires with multiple answers. It has been demonstrated that this is a particular model of LNRE theory.
