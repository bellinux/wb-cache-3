The Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> is a fishery of National significance, producing large rainbow trout. Two spectacular 100 foot class waterfalls are potential National Natural Landmarks. The river is a potential Wild and Scenic River. Elk from Yellowstone National Park cross the river in the area. The cumulative effects of these proposals can alter traditional uses and values. A national audience is expressing concern. The pending Targhee National Forest Land Management Plan will direct study of the Henry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> for possible addition to the Nation 2 ̆ 7 s Wild and Scenic River System. The plan will direct qualities be maintained until studies are completed. A project proponent has asked that Forest Service study the river before he applies for license.

The obese wrestler taps out to <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> who kicks Masked Man M in the chest - a move he appears to greatly enjoy. This prompts him to accidentally swap out with his partner Chicken, who tries and fails to attack <b>Lady</b> <b>S.</b> She proceeds to beat him while an envious Masked Man M watches, begging for Chicken to swap out with him. Chicken succeeds, {{but at this point}} <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> also swaps out with the obese wrestler, to his dismay. Masked Man M manages to beat the obese wrestler, which angers The Boss. He storms down to the dressing room to confront Masked Man M and Chicken, as <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> was supposed to win the match. The Boss just barely misses the two as they flee the arena, Masked Man M carrying a box of <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> dolls he stole.|$|R

Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute. He holds her down and almost wins, but, at the last minute, is signaled to throw the match, which he does. After the match Masked Man M's popularity takes off and Romeo returns to the orphanage where he realizes that Sister Juliet is <b>Lady</b> <b>S,</b> as she has used the money to fix the place up.|$|R

40|$|Fractures and faults in the Jakey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> area, northeastern Wind River Range, Wyoming, {{caused by}} brittle Laramide {{deformation}} in the Precambrian granitic basement {{have been studied}} in detail at airphoto, outcrop, and thin-section scales. The study area is bounded on the south by the approximately east-west and vertical Jakey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> Fault and on the east by the approximately northwest-southeast and vertical Ross Lakes Fault. Both were active during Laramide deformation. Four distinct structural domains, defined by fracture pat terns and proximity to the two major faults nave emerged in this study. The areas are: 1) Along Ross Lakes Fault granite cores a fold defined by shallowly and steeply east dipping Cambrian Flathead Sandstone. Laramide movement on Ross Lakes Fault appears to have post-dated, Jakey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> Fault movement and was discordant with Precambrian zones. Fractures at all scales studied strike approximately northeast-southwest, consistent with the inferred maximum Laramide principal stress. 2) Along east-west striking Jakey 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fork</b> Fault, Laramide movement appears to have reactivated Precambrian mylonite zones {{as evidenced by the}} chlorite-rich, foliated cataclasite along its trace. Fractures at all scales have an approximate east-west orientation. 3) Near the intersection of the two faults, deformation was intense, as shown by mylonitic, breccia, and veined clasts. Discrete airphoto fractures were not recognized due to intense deformation in this interaction zone. 4) In the central area, away from the two faults, airphoto and outcrop fracture orientations have a north to northeast strike. Fracture orientations at the thin-section scale are more variable and do not agree with macroscopic orientations; they strike west to northwest. The central area is a 2 ̆ 7 block 2 ̆ 7, possibly divided into 2 ̆ 7 sub-blocks 2 ̆ 7, bounded by zones along which much of the deformation occurred. Thus, these zones had an insulating effect at thin-section scale. The Paleozoic rocks were at least partially decoupled from the basement during deformation, suggested by gouge along the contact and different fracture orientations {{on opposite sides of the}} contact. At least two fluid systems are represented in the study area. Relatively wide-spread, pre-Laramide chlorite development occurred at temperatures and pressures higher than those present during Laramide deformation. A Laramide (or post-Laramie) pervasive fluid system (especially near Ross Lakes Fault) is reflected by abundant fracture porosity, advanced feldspar alteration, and kaolinite development...|$|R
