Wynne is distinguished {{for his work}} in aberration theory and for his development of new mathematical methods embodied in the first successful computer programmes for the optimisation of optical systems of many kinds. In high performance optical instruments complicated lens systems are usually needed, systems of up to 50 parameters are common and over 100 may be required. Wynne has demonstrated conclusively that computer-aided design can lead to the manufacture of such lenses with substantially improved performance. As a consequence, the programmes he has developed are now in regular use at Imperial College and in industry. Examples of the work undertaken by Wynne include optical systems for sir navigation, for space research, for particle physics (CERN, CEA Saclay, Brookhaven National Laboratory, USA) and for astronomy (for the Isaac Newton Telescope of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, Palomar, Kitt Peak, and McDonald Observatories).

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{aberration}} metrology (AM) of a lithographic projection <b>lens</b> based on <b>aerial</b> images (AI) {{by using a}} quadratic relationship model (Quad) between the aerial-image intensity distribution and the Zernike coefficients. The proposed method (AMAI-Quad) uses principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analyses for model generation. The quadratic model is, then, used to extract Zernike coefficients by a nonlinear least-squares minimizing technique. The best linear constrain condition is estimated by optimizing the illumination settings. Compared with earlier techniques, based on a linear relationship between Zernike coefficients and AIs, the new method can extend the orders of Zernike coefficients measured. The application of AMAI-Quad to AIs, computed by lithography simulators PROLITH and Dr. LiTHO, demonstrated an extension of measurement range to 90 m lambda and an enhancement of measurement accuracy by more than 30 percent.

40|$|Abstract — The goal of {{integrating}} drones into the civil airspace requires a technical system which robustly detects, tracks and finally avoids aerial objects. Electro-optical cameras {{have proven to}} be an adequate sensor to detect traffic, especially for smaller aircraft, gliders or paragliders. However the very challenging environmental conditions and image artifacts such as lens flares often result in a high number of false detections. Depending on the solar radiation lens flares are very common in aerial images and hard to distinguish from aerial objects on a collision course due to their similar size, shape, brightness and trajectories. In this paper we present an efficient method to detect <b>lens</b> flares within <b>aerial</b> images based on the position of the sun with respect to the observer. Using the date, time, position and attitude of the observer we predict the lens flare direction within the image. Once the direction is known the position, size and shape of the lens flares are extracted. Experiments show that our approach is able to compensate for errors in the parameters influencing the calculation of the lens flare direction. We further integrate the lens flare detection into an aerial object tracking framework. A detailed evaluation of the framework with and without lens flare filter shows that false tracks due to lens flares are successfully suppressed without degrading the overall tracking system performance.

40|$|Aerial {{photography}} {{obtained by}} UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) is an emerging market for civil applications. Small UAVs {{are believed to}} close gaps in niche markets, such as acquiring airborne image data for remote sensing purposes. Small UAVs {{will be able to}} fly at low altitudes, in dangerous environments and over long periods of time. However, the small lightweight constructions of these UAVs lead to new problems, such as higher agility leading to more susceptibility to turbulence and limitations in space and payload for sensor systems. This research investigates the use of low-cost fisheye lenses to overcome such problems which theoretically makes the airborne imaging less sensitive to turbulence. The fisheye lens has the benet of a large observation area (large field of view) and doesn't add additional weight to the aircraft, like traditional mechanical stabilizing systems. This research presents the implementation of a fisheye <b>lens</b> for <b>aerial</b> photography and mapping purposes, including theoretical background of fisheye lenses. Based on the unique feature of the distortion being a function of the viewing angle, methods used to derive the fisheye lens distortion are presented. The lens distortion is used to rectify the fisheye images before these images can be used in aerial photography. A detailed investigation into the inner orientation of the camera and inertial sensor is given, as well as the registration of airborne collected images. It was found that the attitude estimation is critical towards accurate mapping using low quality sensors. A loosely coupled EKF filter applied to the GPS and inertial sensor data estimated the attitude to an accuracy of 3 - 5 ° (1 -sigma) using low-cost sensors typically found in small UAVs. However, the use of image stitching techniques may improve the outcome. On the other hand, lens distortion caused by the fisheye lens can be addressed by rectification techniques and removed to a sub-pixel level. Results of the process present image sequences gathered from a piloted aircraft demonstrating the achieved performance and potential applications towards UAVs. Further, an unforeseen issue with a vibrating part in the lens lead to the need for vibration compensation. The vibration could be estimated to ± 1 pixel in 75 % of the cases by applying an extended Hough transform to the fisheye images...|$|R
40|$|During the 1930 s {{the massive}} {{expansion}} of London and fears over the uncontrolled, unplanned modernity {{of the city}} coincided with fears over {{the ability of the}} new technology of the bomber and aerial warfare to decimate cities. This thesis explores the relationship between London as a governed, practiced and represented site, and aerial bombardment. It considers the impact of the new technology of aerial bombing on city space, by looking at the policies that emerged to deal with the consequences of bombardment, specifically through analysis of Air Raid Precautions. It follows these policies on a trajectory through to the actual bombing {{of the city and the}} public commemoration of that bombing in 1943. The thesis explores the competing visions of city life opened up by the <b>lens</b> of <b>aerial</b> warfare, providing a cultural history of the defence of London. It considers how fears about how to protect the city from bombs offered the opportunity for political commentators, local authorities, architects, engineers and planners to voice their concerns about how to protect the urban population at war. Contained within these debates are particular visualisations of the population of London. The thesis thus considers social imaginations of London between 1932 and 1943. It sugests that ARP offered a means to present and articulate different ideas about how to govern and manage an urban population. It also reflects on how these ideas changed over time. Ultimately it seeks to move between the universal and the particular, exploring how and why blitzed London came to stand for the nation during the war, and in so doing provided a collective consciousness for the nation at war. At the same time by interrogating the representations that made up that collective consciousness, I move to the particular, considering how representations of London under fire were mediated by local experiences and urban practices. The thesis seeks to offer a nuanced account of London's modernity through showing the compexity of responses to the problem of managing and imagining a city under fire.
