5|$|Bowel: bowel {{problems}} affect around 70% of {{the patients}}, with around 50% {{of the patients}} suffering from constipation and up to 30% from fecal incontinence. Cause of bowel impairments in MS patients is usually either a reduced gut motility or an impairment in neurological control of defecation. The former is commonly related to inmobility or secondary effects from drugs used {{in the treatment of}} the disease. Pain or problems with defecation can be helped with a diet change which includes among other changes an increased fluid intake, oral <b>laxatives</b> or suppositories and enemas when habit changes and oral measures are not enough to control the problems.|$|E

5|$|To {{adapt the}} dogs to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. <b>Laxatives</b> did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the <b>laxatives,</b> but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about <b>laxative</b> use, the {{association}} of constipation with <b>laxative</b> use, risk factors for constipation and how each of these changes over time in the community-dwelling elderly. Objective: The aim was to explore the prevalence of <b>laxative</b> use and of self-reported constipation, and identify risk factors (including age) associated with constipation, in a cohort of community-dwelling elderly residents. Methods: Data from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA) {{was used to compare}} differences in constipation and <b>laxative</b> use in the community-dwelling elderly between 1992 - 1993 and 2003 - 2004. Results: Relevant data was available for 239 ALSA participants. The prevalence of self-reported constipation increased from 14 % in 1992 - 1993 to 21 % in 2003 - 2004. There was a corresponding increase in the prevalence of <b>laxative</b> use from 6 % to 15 % over the same period. At both time points, females reported a higher prevalence of both constipation and <b>laxative</b> use however the female:male prevalence ratios decreased over time indicating higher increases in the prevalence of each among males. Persistent chronic constipation occurred in 9 % of the cohort. The association between <b>laxative</b> use and self-reported constipation was poor and <b>laxative</b> use was associated with self-reported constipation in {{less than a third of}} cases. Conclusion: The prevalence of both constipation and <b>laxative</b> use increases with age in the elderly, and these increases are greater for males than for females. Discrepancies between self-reported constipation and <b>laxative</b> use may suggest sub-optimal management of constipation in the community-dwelling elderly and further work is needed to fully understand this. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{costs and}} medical {{benefits}} of an early, routine <b>laxative</b> screening test {{in patients with}} diarrhoea of uncertain origin was evaluated.

Fifty four patients denying <b>laxative</b> consumption had diarrhoea (mean daily stool weight greater than 200 g) of uncertain origin at their initial visit of whom 47 were screened to detect ingestion of anthraquinones, bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, and magnesium salts.
