Amanda Hensel of PopCrush commented that the cover was executed [...] "so artistically that it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new song". Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy felt {{that the idea of}} Folds covering [...] "Sleazy" [...] was a [...] "welcome experiment". Glazer praised Folds' vocals on the track and went on to say [...] "we don't know what's more epic: the cover of the song or the mere fact that it happened in the first place".|$|E

When Zoe's obviously released, it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new scenario for her because there are people who haven't really trusted her or believed in her. People that have really let her down, and plus the fact she hasn't got over Sarah [...] being killed yet either. She hasn't had the chance to deal with that, so that's really interesting, and she still wants Lydia to go down!" [...] The character of Zoe then set out to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. She befriended her, and even seduced her in order to gain a confession. During an interview about Zoe's new scheme, Lister said: ...|$|E

The 2008 review was overwhelmingly positive, saying that [...] "EB feels <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new Total War game", and going on to praise the modification's [...] "stunning" [...] scope and the [...] "striking" [...] extent of the differences between it and Rome: Total War. The review was somewhat critical of the modification's graphical user interfaces which [...] "" [...] had a [...] "home-made" [...] feel to them, as well as its lack of accessibility and steep learning curve, although it adds that the second point is not a large problem as the modification is largely a [...] "master's challenge for accomplished Rome players". The review finished on a positive note, summing Europa Barbarorum up as a [...] "superior game". In 2010 the same magazine's website named Europa Barbarorum the best mod of any Total War game.|$|E

[...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's just something about that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{his early}} tutors {{were among the}} first to use the thumbpick in guitar playing, freeing the fingers to pick melody, Travis's style, {{according}} to Chet Atkins, went on in musical directions [...] "never dreamt about" [...] by his predecessors. His trademark mature style incorporated elements from ragtime, blues, boogie, jazz and Western swing, and was marked by rich chord progressions, harmonics, slides and bends, and rapid changes of key. [...] He could shift quickly from finger-picking to flatpicking in the midst of a number by gripping his thumbpick like a flat pick. In his hands, the guitar resembled a full band. As his son Thom Bresh puts it, on first hearing his father as a child [...] "I thought it was just the coolest sound, because it sounded <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> bunch of instruments coming from one guitar. In it, I heard rhythm parts, I heard melodies, I heard chords and all this wrapped up in one."

2500|$|When Jackson {{returned}} to the role, he was given multiple emotional storylines that continually put Lucky in tragic situations. As Jackson resumed the character in October 2009, Lucky is unaware that Elizabeth, his fiancée again, is {{having an affair with}} his brother Nikolas. What started as a joke grows into a physical relationship the same night Elizabeth accepts Lucky's remarriage proposal. Herbst explained to Comcast: [...] "I truly believe that [...] is in love with Lucky and has been in love with him her entire life. But what happened with Nikolas caught her by surprise as much as everybody else. It's hard for her to articulate it. She just knows that Nikolas did make her feel more like a woman and that in her relationship with Lucky she's very much still that 16-year-old girl that constantly needs to be saved. That's kind of the role that Lucky has played in her life." [...] When Lucky eventually walks in on her with Nikolas, he does not say anything and instead trashes his house and resumes drinking. J Bernard Jones from entertainment website Zap2it described that Lucky: [...] "generally was an emotional wreck, careening all over the place like a pinball. On the other hand, whenever Lucky was with Elizabeth or Nikolas he was cold and detached, imbuing just enough of Jackson's trademark sincerity (some would say over-earnestness) to knock the two cheatin' hearts off-kilter." [...] Lucky is irate by the time he confronts them. Herbst described the scene: [...] "Jonathan actually seemed like one more step {{and he was going to}} take my head off. Honestly, it was not so hard to be present when he was yelling at me like he did." [...] Jones from Zap2it stated that in the confrontation scenes: [...] "Jackson accomplished a much harder task than simply reclaiming the Lucky mantle: he has bridged the gap between his previous run, Jacob Young's and most recently, Greg Vaughan's. Now Lucky seems <b>like</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> person once again, as opposed to a fractured character sliced up over the years by the writers, and fractured by fan loyalties." [...] Lucky, Nikolas and Elizabeth soon learn that Elizabeth is pregnant, and either brother could be the father. Jackson explained Lucky's position: ...|$|E
