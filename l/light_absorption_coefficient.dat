The uncertainty of the <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> is primarily determined by {{the uncertainty of the}} correction scheme commonly used to convert the measured light attenuation to <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> and ranges from about 20  % at sites with high loadings of strongly absorbing aerosols up to 100  % or more at sites with low loadings of weakly absorbing aerosols.

40|$|Several {{types of}} filter-based {{instruments}} {{are used to}} estimate aerosol <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Two significant results are presented based on Aethalometer measurements at six Arctic stations from 2012 to 2014. First, an alternative method of post-processing the Aethalometer data is presented, which reduces measurement noise and lowers the detection limit of the instrument more effectively than box-car averaging. The biggest benefit of this approach can be achieved if instrument drift is minimised. Moreover, by using an attenuation threshold criterion for data post-processing, the relative uncertainty from the electronic noise of the instrument is kept constant. This approach results in a time series with a variable collection time (Delta t) but with a constant relative uncertainty with regard to electronic noise in the instrument. An additional advantage of this method is that the detection limit of the instrument will be lowered at small aerosol concentrations {{at the expense of}} temporal resolution, whereas there is little to no loss in temporal resolution at high aerosol concentrations (> 2. 1 - 6. 7 Mm(- 1) as measured by the Aethalometers). At high aerosol concentrations, minimising the detection limit of the instrument is less critical. Additionally, utilising co-located filter-based absorption photometers, a correction factor is presented for the Arctic {{that can be used in}} Aethalometer corrections available in literature. The correction factor of 3. 45 was calculated for low-elevation Arctic stations. This correction factor harmonises Aethalometer attenuation <b>coefficients</b> with <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> as measured by the co-located <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> photometers.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{properties}} of optically significant water constituents (phytoplankton, suspended matter, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)) in Hudson Bay are different from other Arctic regions. A new bio-optical data set collected in summer 2010 shows that this region also presents seasonal variability of the <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> by the different constituents, with a higher relative proportion of CDOM absorption in summer than in the fall as a result of decreased phytoplankton absorption in summer. The slope of the exponential function describing nonalgal particles and CDOM spectral absorption shows little variability between fall and summer. Seasonal variability of <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> and water optical constituents is more pronounced near the coast, while less variability is observed in the central part of the bay. Very low summertime chlorophyll-specific <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> by phytoplankton, among the lowest reported in the literature, are attributed to the high proportion of large size phytoplankton (microphytoplankton) and important packaging effect. There is also a smaller contribution of accessory pigments to total pigments in the summer than in the fall, resulting in a lower blue-to-red phytoplankton absorption ratio. These results emphasize that it is necessary to take into account the seasonal variability of <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> properties in bio-optical models for further remote sensing applications in Hudson Bay.

The particulate absorption spectra reflected a dominance of nonphotosynthetic, likely detrital, particles in rivers and a dominance of phytoplankton in coastal lagoons. There was a strong relationship between the light absorbed by phytoplankton and the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration of the systems, which indicated an average (±SE) Chl a specific absorption coefficient of 0. 0233 ± 0. 0020 m 2 · mg Chl a- 1 for these widely diverse systems.

The objective of this work was to study fines as a limiting factor for reaching higher brightness levels in high consistency hydrogen peroxide bleaching of Norway spruce (Picea abies) thermomechanical (TMP) and stone groundwood (SGW) pulps. The hydrogen peroxide bleaching efficiency (i. e. <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> reduction) was studied {{as a function of}} temperature, alkali charge and fines content using an experimental design based on MODDE software (Umetrics AB). It is known that all types of fines contain more lignin, hemicelluloses, pectins, metals and less cellulose than long fibres. The <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> was greater for unbleached TMP than for unbleached SGW pulp and an increased quantity of fines increased the <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> for both pulp types. The increase was, however, most pronounced for the TMP. Furthermore, the data suggests that both the fibre fraction and the fines fraction are more coloured in the thermomechanical pulp. In most cases, increased amounts of fines in the pulp had a negative impact on the bleached pulp brightness in spite of the improved light scattering ability accompanying the addition of fines. A level of fines exceeding 50 % was especially detrimental resulting in lower pulp brightness due to a higher <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Increasing the bleaching temperature did not improve the bleaching efficiency. The optimal bleaching temperature at a hydrogen peroxide charge of 4. 5 % was found to be 70 °C within the tested interval of 70 - 110 °C.

AR properties {{can be achieved by}} introducing micro/nanostructures on flat films [4]. So far, a variety of anti-reflection structures have been reported, such as nanoholes [6 – 8], nanowires [9], nanoparticles [10], and nanocones [11, 12].|$|E
40|$|Data {{acquired}} from filter-based measurement such as Aethalomenter needs carefully correction {{due to its}} inherent systemic error, i. e., filter matrix effect, scattering effect and loading effect. The non-linear relationship between (light attenuation on the filter) and (<b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient</b> of suspended aerosol in ambient air) {{has become a challenge}} for Aethalomenter, as a linear relationship is assumed by default in its output data. This program applies Weingartner (2003) and Virkkula (2007) algorithm to correct the data. QA/QC features are also provided, including statistic of sensor voltage.

40|$|Smoke {{particle}} {{emissions from}} the combustion of biomass fuels typical {{for the western}} and southeastern United States were studied and compared under high humidity and ambient conditions in the laboratory. The fuels used are Montana ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), southern California chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), and Florida saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). Information on the non-refractory chemical composition of biomass burning aerosol from each fuel was obtained with an aerosol mass spectrometer and through estimation of the black carbon concentration from <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> measurements at 870 nm. Changes in the optical and physical particle properties under high humidity conditions were observed for hygroscopic smoke particles containing substantial inorganic mass fractions that were emitted from combustion of chamise and palmetto fuels. Light scattering cross sections increased under high humidity for these particles, consistent with the hygroscopic growth measured for 100 nm particles in HTDMA measurements. Photoacoustic measurements of aerosol <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> reveal a 20 % reduction with increasing relative humidity, contrary to the expectation of <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> enhancement by the liquid coating taken up by hygroscopic particles. This reduction is hypothesized to arise from two mechanisms: 1. Shielding of inner monomers after particle consolidation or collapse with water uptake; 2. The contribution of mass transfer through evaporation and condensation at high relative humidity to the usual heat transfer pathway for energy release by laser-heated particles in the photoacoustic measurement of aerosol <b>light</b> <b>absorption.</b> The mass transfer contribution is {{used to evaluate the}} fraction of aerosol surface covered with liquid water solution as a function of RH...|$|R
40|$|Advancing in the {{photocatalyst}} scale-up {{is crucial}} {{for the development of}} highly efficient solar fuels production at industrial scale. Here, we report DC-magnetron sputtering as a suitable technique to produce photocatalytic TiO 2 coatings for CO 2 reduction with a view on process scalability. The crystallinity of the obtained TiO 2 coatings varies with surface density, with amorphous or quasi-amorphous coatings obtained with very low densities, while UV <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> show the opposite trend, which has been related to the proportionally higher abundace of surface defects and grain boundaries associated to the small crystal size and/or amorphicity of the lightest coatings. The as-prepared samples lead to the reduction of CO 2 as demonstrated by 13 C isotope tracing. An optimum catalyst area density of 1 g/m 2 (by geometric area) is obtained in terms of CO 2 photoreduction production, which is ascribed to a compromise situation between crystallinity and <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Selectivity to the different reaction products also varies with the coating characteristics, with amorphous or quasi-amorphous light coatings favouring methanol formation, in contrast with the preferred CO evolution in heavier, crystalline ones. Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of peroxo and peroxocarbonate species on the photocatalyst surface as oxidation products during the CO 2 reduction, the accummulation of which is proposed {{to be related to the}} observed catalyst deactivation...|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{atmospheric}} aerosol particles {{were collected in}} Valladolid, Spain, {{during the winter of}} 2003 - 2004. The measurements were made with a Dekati PM 10 cascade impactor with four size stages: greater than 10 µm, between 2. 5 to 10 µm, 1 to 2. 5 µm and less than 1 µm. The size and shape of the particles were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elemental analysis was done with an energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). We present an evaluation by size, shape and composition of the major particulate species in the Valladolid urban atmosphere. The total aerosol concentration is very variable, ranging from 39. 86 µg·m - 3 to 184. 88 µg·m - 3 with the coarse particles as the dominant mass fraction. Emphasis was given to fine particles (< 1 µm), for which the visible (400 nm to 650 nm) <b>light</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficients</b> were measured using the integrating plate technique. We have made some enhancements in the illumination system of this measurement system. The <b>absorption</b> <b>coefficient,</b> σ a, is highly variable and ranges from 7. 33 × 10 - 6 m - 1 to 1. 01 × 10 - 4 m - 1 at a wavelength of 550 nm.
