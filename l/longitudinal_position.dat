25|$|Given a {{reasonably}} accurate model of wind speeds within the 18–25km band, Google {{claims that it}} can control the latitudinal and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>position</b> of high-altitude balloons by adjusting only the balloon's altitude. By adjusting the volume and density of the gas (e.g., helium, hydrogen, or another lighter-than-air compound) in the balloon, the balloon's variable buoyancy system is {{able to control the}} balloon's altitude. Google has additionally indicated that balloons may be constructed from various materials (e.g., metalized Mylar or BoPET) or a highly flexible latex or rubber material (e.g., chloroprene).|$|E
25|$|The 2.5 TL was {{positioned}} as the sporty {{model and the}} 3.2 focused more upon a luxurious ride. There were minimal styling differences between the two, but the 3.2 TL had larger tires despite the 2.5 TL's more sporty marketing. Moreover, the added power in the 3.2 TL gave it better acceleration. The V6 engine in the 3.2 TL was mounted in a front-rear, or <b>longitudinal</b> <b>position.</b> This contrasted with the more typical transverse engine mount style, and was intended to provide better weight distribution and reduce nose dive. The engine mount design resulted in an elongated hood for the first generation TL. The inline-5 engine in the 2.5 TL competed with similar 5-cylinder engines offered in Audi and Volvo models.|$|E

40|$|Simplified Aircraft-based Parallel Approach (SAPA) is an {{advanced}} concept {{proposed by the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to support dependent parallel approach operations to runways with lateral spacing closer than 2500 ft. At {{the request of the}} FAA, NASA performed an initial assessment of the potential performance and feasibility of the SAPA concept, including developing and assessing an operational implementation of the concept and conducting a Monte Carlo wake simulation study to examine the longitudinal spacing requirements. The SAPA concept was shown to have significant operational advantages in supporting the pairing of aircraft with dissimilar final approach speeds. The wake simulation study showed that support for dissimilar final approach speeds could be significantly enhanced {{through the use of a}} two-phased altitudebased <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positioning</b> requirement, with larger <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positioning</b> allowed for higher altitudes out of ground effect and tighter <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positioning</b> defined for altitudes near and in ground effect. While this assessment is preliminary and there are a number of operational issues still to be examined, it has shown the basic SAPA concept to be technically and operationally feasible...|$|R

25|$|Named to honour the company's twenty-fifth anniversary, in 1988, the 25th Anniversary Countach, {{although}} mechanically {{very similar}} to the 5000QV, sported considerable restyling. Notably, restyling, enlargement and extension of the rear 'air-box' intake-ducts was among other refinements undertaken (extending them to a more gradual incline further in-keeping with aerodynamic-streamlining), while the secondary pair of debossed ducts, originally situated further behind them, were brought forward and relocated directly on top, encompassing refashioned fins now running longitudinally rather than transversely, this allowed the airboxes, located behind the radiators to be rotated from a transverse to a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>position,</b> allowing better airflow from the radiators out through the secondary fins. Additionally, further reconstruction of an already modified engine-bay cover, from a concept consisting of dual-raised sections and tri-ducting, to one that embodies a centre-raised section incorporating dual-ducting become another feature. Various redevelopments to the rear-end were made; most notably the introduction of a rear bumper extending outwardly from the lower-portion.|$|E
2500|$|The map was {{discovered}} serendipitously on 9 October 1929, through the philological {{work of the}} German theologian Gustav Adolf Deissmann (1866–1937). He had been commissioned by the Turkish Ministry of Education to catalogue the Topkapı Palace library's non-Islamic items. At Deissmann's request to search the palace for old maps and charts, the director Halil Edhem (1861–1938) managed to find some disregarded bundles of material, which he handed over to Deissmann. [...] Realizing that the map might be a unique find, Deissmann showed it to the orientalist Paul Kahle, who identified it as a map drawn by Piri Reis. The discovery caused an international sensation, as it represented the only then known copy of a world map of Christopher Columbus (1451–1506), and was the only 16th-century map that showed South America in its proper <b>longitudinal</b> <b>position</b> in relation to Africa. Geographers had spent several centuries unsuccessfully searching for a [...] "lost map of Columbus" [...] that was supposedly drawn {{while he was in}} the West Indies.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{stabilization}} of lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positions</b> for hover flight mode of an unmanned autonomous helicopter (UAH) in a gusty environment is considered. The controller design {{is based on}} generic linear model which successfully describes the behaviour of most small scale helicopters. A recursive (backstepping) design procedure is used to design the robust adaptive controller for longitudinal and lateral dynamics based on control Lyapunov approach. Finally a computer simulation is conducted to test the proposed controller. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controllers can effectively attenuate the gust effects and achieve rapid and accurate <b>longitudinal</b> and lateral <b>positions</b> in a gusty environment...|$|R

The vectored-thrust jet could be tested at two alternate <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positions</b> and three nozzle deflection angles. The vectored-thrust configuration with the rear nozzles showed an increase in lift {{and a decrease in}} pitching moment when compared with the forward nozzles.

50|$|In {{accelerator}} physics, {{a magnetic}} lattice is a composition of electromagnets at given <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positions</b> around the vacuum tube of a particle accelerator, and thus {{along the path}} of the enclosed charged particle beam. The lattice properties have a large influence on the properties of the particle beam, which is shaped by magnetic fields. Lattices can be closed (cyclic accelerators like the synchrotrons), linear (for linac facilities) and are also used at interconnects between different accelerator structures (transfer beamlines).|$|R

50|$|For 1987, GM {{changed the}} {{nomenclature}} of their Turbo Hydramatic transmissions — the THM400 was renamed to the '3L80' (three forward speeds, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positioning,</b> and an arbitrary 'strength' of 80, {{the second highest}} such rating assigned). The 3L80HD was introduced in 1987 as the HD unit used in passenger trucks. In 1991, a four-speed overdrive version, the 4L80-E, replaced the THM400 in Chevrolet/GMC pickups, vans, SUVs, and commercial vehicles. The 4L80E (and its successor 4L85E) was the first Hydramatic to incorporate electronic controls — {{almost all of the}} THM400/3L80/3L80HD's components are interchangeable.|$|R

40|$|Fast beam losses, {{due to a}} {{vertical}} coherent instability of high frequency, have been observed in the PS near transition energy, with the high-intensity single-bunch beam for the neutron Time-of-Flight facility (n-ToF).

These phenomena can be described by the beam breakup theory, since near transition the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>positions</b> of particles are almost frozen, as in the linac case. Comparison between observations and theory, using Brandt and Gareyte’s formula for single-bunch beam breakup in circular accelerators, shows good agreement. ...|$|R
