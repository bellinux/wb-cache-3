25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, the rod acts as a catapult: by moving the rod forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) the rod and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and the fisherman strikes, the bending of the rod will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of the rod not only enables the fisherman to keep the <b>line</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension,</b> but the bending of the rod will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable the fisherman to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of the leverage by shortening the distance of the lever (the rod). A stiff rod will demand lots of power of the fisherman, while actually less power is put on the fish. In comparison, a deep bending rod will demand less power from the fisherman, but deliver more fighting power to the fish. In practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on the fisherman. In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of the leverage effect.|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} splicing {{methods for}} double-braid line {{have been tested}} to simu-late a loading condition in which {{the eye of a}} <b>line</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> is rotated around a bollard as might occur during a docking operation. The Blue Book splice-(-*) method, used on double-braid line before 1976, is thought to have one leg of the eye that is significantly weaker than the other. The Red Book splice [...] *) method, a revision of the Blue Book, is thought to eliminate the weakness of the Blue 3 ook splice. The results of these tests shown that the strength of a line with the Red 2 ook eye splice is not reduced when loaded in rotational loading; buth legs of the splice are equal in strength. The weakness in one leg of the Blue Book splice is confirmed; it fails in rotational loading when the load in the standing part of the line reaches 620 of rated break strength (RBS). The Red Book splice is approximately 9. 816 stronger than the Blue Book splice in straight-pull conditions (i. e. no rotation). Nylon 3 -strand twisted line is included for comparison with double-braid line. Results indicate that one leg of the eye fails in rotational loading when the load in the line reaches 8100 RBS because the tucks in the splice fail and the splice pulls apart freeing the end of the leg. ...|$|E
50|$|The Farrimond {{friction}} hitch is a {{quick release}} adjustable friction hitch for use on <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> It is useful when {{the length of a}} line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain or adjust tension whilst remaining quick and easy to untie; such as when hanging the ridge line for a Basha. It can be used in very effective conjunction with the Siberian hitch for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|The taut-line hitch is an {{adjustable}} loop knot {{for use on}} <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> It is useful when {{the length of a}} line will need to be periodically adjusted in order to maintain tension. It is made by tying a rolling hitch around the standing part after passing around an anchor object. Tension is maintained by sliding the hitch to adjust size of the loop, thus changing the effective length of the standing part without retying the knot.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the localization of stiff directed lines with bending energy by a short-range random potential. Using perturbative arguments, Flory arguments, and a replica calculation, {{we show that}} a stiff directed line in 1 +d dimensions undergoes a localization transition with increasing disorder for $d> 2 / 3 $. We demonstrate that this transition is accessible by numerical transfer matrix calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions and analyze {{the properties of the}} disorder-dominated phase. On the basis of the two-replica problem, we propose a relation between the localization of stiff directed lines in 1 +d dimensions and of directed <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> in 1 + 3 d dimensions, which is strongly supported by identical free energy distributions. This shows that pair interactions in the replicated Hamiltonian determine the nature of directed line localization transitions with consequences for the critical behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. Furthermore, we quantify how the persistence length of the stiff directed line is reduced by disorder. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a common}} {{macroscopic}} observation that knotted ropes or fishing <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> easily break at the knot. However, a more precise localization of the breakage point in knotted macroscopic strings is a difficult task. In the present work, the tightening of knots was numerically simulated, a comparison of strength of different knots was experimentally performed and a high velocity camera was used to precisely localize the site where knotted macroscopic strings break. In the case of knotted spaghetti, the breakage occurs at the position with high curvature at the entry to the knot. This localization results from joint contributions of loading, bending and friction forces into the complex process of knot breakage. The present simulations and experiments are in agreement with recent molecular dynamics simulations of a knotted polymer chain and with experiments performed on actin and DNA filaments. The strength of the knotted string is greatly reduced (down to 50 %) {{by the presence of}} a knot, therefore reducing the resistance to tension of all materials containing chains of any sort. The present work with macroscopic strings revels some important aspects, which are not accessible by experiments with microscopic chains...|$|R
40|$|It may be {{convenient}} that dense {{arrays of}} floating point absorbers are spread-moored {{to the sea}} bottom through only some of their elements (possibly located in the periphery), while the other array elements are prevented from drifting and colliding with each other by connections to adjacent elements. An array of identical floating point absorbers located at the grid points of an equilateral triangular grid is considered in the paper. A spread set of slack-mooring lines connect the peripheric floaters to the bottom. A weight {{is located at the}} centre of each triangle whose function is to pull the three floaters towards each other and keep the inter-body moorings <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension.</b> The whole system – buoys, moorings and power take-off systems – is assumed linear, so that a frequency domain analysis may be employed. Equations are presented for a set of three identical point absorbers. This is then extended to more complex equilateral triangular grid arrays. Results from numerical simulations, with regular and irregular waves, are presented for the motions and power absorption of hemispherical converters in arrays of three and seven elements and different mooring and PTO parameters, and wave incidence angles.

Although local fishermen considered there had been no tunny before World War I, the studies suggested that migration into the North Sea had not been recent. There are photographs of Peel and Russell engaged on this study. In 1934, together with Richard Kindersley, he took out a patent for a fishing reel.

40|$|Theridiidae {{typically}} {{construct a}} three-dimensional web {{often described as}} "irregular". The web consists of a supporting structure and <b>lines</b> <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> termed gumfooted <b>lines.</b> We used automated methods to observe web construction in the theridiid Steatoda triangulosa under laboratory conditions. Web construction lasted several nights. After orientation, spiders built a three-dimensional structure of several threads radiating sideways and downward from the retreat. To build gumfooted lines, they started from the retreat, moved along a structural thread, then dropped down to attach the thread to the lower substrate. On returning, they coated the lowest part of the thread with viscid silk before moving up along the same thread back to the structural thread. They then continued moving along the same structural thread to drop down again to build the next gumfooted line. This behavior was continued until the spiders had built a series of gumfooted lines (a bout). There were regular intervals between the construction of two bouts. Thus, a single web included many bouts built in different stages. We show that gumfooted lines are not homologues to sticky web elements of orb-weavers and present new synapomorphic characters that support the monophyly of Theridiidae + Nesticidae and the monophyly of araneoid sheet web weavers. Further, the time allocation pattern for different behavioral stages and the fine structure of a gumfooted line are presented...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not until}} the {{development}} of the Rogallo kite in the late 1940s that there was large scale interest in unpowered kite flying once again. The possibility of untethered flight on man-lifting kites {{led to the development of}} hang gliders and paragliders, but static-anchored-tethered man-lifting kites have seen little development, chiefly due to the lack of control inherent in the tethered design. Nowadays, most man-lifting is carried out on a dual line system, where the passenger on a single kite ascends a <b>line</b> held <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> by a train of kites. No kites are available commercially for the static-ground-based-anchored tethered flight of people. Note that many hang gliders are kited in various ways to get to give the participant desired altitude; sometimes just a short glide is needed; sometimes an altitude is desired that will provide an opportunity for the kited hang glider pilot to seek and find assistive thermals.|$|R

Cyclic deformation under tension-compression also shows {{that it is more}} difficult to deform the material during compression than during tension, where an asymmetric stress-strain loop is obtained. TEM observations show that, <b>under</b> <b>tension</b> to 4 % strain, martensite variants are partially reoriented via migration of variant interfaces with formation of dislocation networks mainly along the junction plane areas, and no significantly plastic deformation has been observed inside the martensite twin bands. While under compression to 4 % strain, a high density of dislocations has been generated in both the martensite twin bands and the variant accommodation area, and no significant martensite reorientation via variant interfacial migration has been observed.

The accessibility of the reagents to cellulose chains is indeed limited. Classical evocated reasons for this lack of accessibility are pore structure, tight hydrogen bond arrays, crystallinity and presence of resistant materials like lignin. Studying dissolution of cotton hairs and regenerated cellulose fibres in various solvents <b>under</b> uniaxial <b>tension,</b> we found that tension is preventing these fibres to dissolve in chemicals that would dissolve the same cellulose fibres tension-free.
