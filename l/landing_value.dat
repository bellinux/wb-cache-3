40|$|A {{compressibility}} of the actuating fluid of a {{pneumatic drive}} (compressed air) leads to significant landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston {{at the time}} of stop and hold of the load, a constant component of which can fluctuate significantly for the holding period. There are a lot of factors, which {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>landing</b> <b>value</b> of piston. Those are: an initial position of the piston at its stop, which determines the volume of the an active area of the piston, a value of the constant load component {{at the time of}} stop and its variation for the holding period, a transfer coefficient of the position component of the load, an active area of the pneumatic cylinder piston, as well as reduction in atmospheric pressure, which can significantly affect the operation of the control systems of small aircrafts flying at high altitudes. To reduce the <b>landing</b> <b>value</b> of piston due to changing value of the constant load component for its holding period, it is proposed to use a hydraulic positioner, which comprises a hydraulic cylinder the rod of which is rigidly connected to the rod of the pneumatic cylinder through the traverse, a cross-feed valve of the hydro-cylinder cavities with discrete electro-magnetic control, and adjustable chokes. A programmable logic controller provides the hydraulic positioner control. At the moment the piston stops and the load is held the cross-feed valve overlaps the hydro-cylinder cavities thereby locking the pneumatic cylinder piston and preventing its landing. With available pneumatic cylinder-controlled signal the cross-feed valve connects the piston and rod cavities of the positioner hydro-cylinder, the pneumatic cylinder piston is released and becomes capable of moving. A numerical estimate of landing of the pneumatic cylinder piston and its positioning quality is of essential interest. For this purpose, a technique to calculate the landing of piston has been developed taking into consideration that different factors, which determine operation conditions of the pneumatic cylinder, have the impact on it. Experimental investigation of piston landing was conducted using the pneumatic cylinder with piston and rod diameters of 32 and 16 mm, respectively, at operating pressure of 0. 8 MPa. With a vertical arrangement of the pneumatic cylinder axis, the control weights of a dead-weight pressure-gauge tester created a constant component of the load and its variation, and an indicator with resolution of 0. 05 mm estimated a <b>landing</b> <b>value.</b> The article shows the calculated data of piston landing, which are in good compliance with the experimental results. To substantially reduce the piston landing for the holding period of the load varying in value and sign was designed a hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston, and its operation quality is studied on the physical layout of electro-pneumatic control system operating in the discrete and tracking modes. For control system service, work programs of the programmable logic controller integrated in the control circuit of the hydraulic positioner in discrete mode, and, as a digital discriminator, in tracking mode are developed. In conclusion as a result of the research activities the article estimates the impact of factors on the quality of the load position at the time of its hold and notes a high efficiency of the hydraulic positioner of pneumatic cylinder piston both in discrete mode and in tracking one. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{fisheries management}} scheme generates incentives to maximize a vessels {{share of the}} catch and encourages a ‘race to fish’. Individual vessel quota management schemes change the incentives to eliminate the ‘race to fish’ and {{have the potential to}} generate resource rent. An interesting question is whether it is the changed incentives due to individual quota or the capacity reduction due to transferability of individual quota that is most important in generating rent. In this study, the cost function approach is used to model the production technology for a fishery regulated with individual vessel quotas. We measure rent generated and potential rent in a fishery managed with individual vessel quotas at the vessel as well as the fleet level given the total quota and vessel type for the fishery. Country studies for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK show that only at Iceland where the individual quotas are highly transferable is any rent generated. The rent potential is, however, in general high and often more then 50 % of <b>landing</b> <b>value.</b> To realise these rents, a substantial reduction of the fleet is necessary...|$|E
40|$|The Baltic Sea {{ecosystem}} {{has undergone}} dramatic changes, so-called ecosystem regime shifts, {{during the past}} four decades. Baltic Sea herring (Clupea harengus) spawning-stock biomass has declined to a third, and weight-at-age has halved {{as a result of}} food shortages and competition with sprat (Sprattus sprattus). The management objective for the herring stock is currently in transition from pre-cautionary to maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The main basin Baltic Sea herring was modelled under the current ecosystem regime and the effect of a recovery of the cod (Gadus morhua) stock and the availability of planktonic food to levels found in the early 1980 s analysed. A target of FMSY 0. 16 for herring, which should decline to FMSY 0. 10 with recovery of the cod stock, is proposed. An increase in the availability of planktonic food is estimated to more than double the yield at FMSY 0. 27, overriding the negative effects of cod predation should there be a simultaneous increase in both cod and availability of planktonic food. The estimated net increase in yield is 40 % at FMSY 0. 20. Functions are presented to calculate FMSY and to estimate the expected yield depending on the abun-dance of cod and food availability. Retrospective application of the functions is indicative of overfishing of herring in the 1990 s and early 2000 s, and a net loss in yield, with a <b>landing</b> <b>value</b> of some E 440 million...|$|E

In order to maintain the sustainability of Taiwan’s offshore fisheries stocks and to avoid overfishing, the government has implemented a fisheries management policy which regulates harvests by suspending fishing licenses, restricting construction of fishing vessels, and buying back used vessels {{in order to reduce the}} offshore fleet size. The most recent measure, announced on Dec. 24, 1991, which is still in effect, restricts the construction of all fishing vessels, except for fish transport vessels over 2, 000 tons. In addition, the government adopted two voluntary vessel buy back programs in order to reduce the fleet size in 1991 - 1995 and 2000 - 2004, respectively. This study tries to examine whether or not the current offshore fishing industry in Taiwan falls in a Pareto inferior situation with smaller output and higher price, such as shown in the upper part of the backward bending supply. By using annual offshore fisheries harvest and the total tonnage and horse power of fishing vessels for the period 1953 to 2002, this paper utilize the bioeconomic model present in Sun (1998) to simulate the backward bending supply curve under various fishing capacity.

40|$|Se evalúa y analiza el estado de explotación del stock de la langosta (Jasus frontalis) explotada en las islas Robinson Crusoe y Santa Clara del archipiélago de Juan Fernández (33 º 40 'S- 80 º 00 'W). Mediante el modelo de análisis de cohorte a la talla (ACT) ajustado a la pesquería realizada en la temporada 1996 - 97, se estiman los valores de mortalidad por pesca de los grupos completamente reclutados (Fcr) en 0, 63 para machos y 0, 81 para hembras, con una talla al 50 % de retención de 94 a 96 para machos y 96 para hembras. Se estima una biomasa media de machos entre 29 y 31 toneladas (46. 663 y 50. 355 individuos respectivamente) y entre 39 y 42 toneladas (59. 785 y 63. 249 individuos respectivamente) para hembras. Por otra parte, en el análisis del rendimiento equilibrado se estima que las mortalidades por pesca Fcr derivadas del modelo ACT, resultaron inferiores al valor recomendado Fmáx estimado en 0, 86 en machos y 1, 15 en hembras, y superiores a un nivel de mortalidad F 0. 1. El análisis de rendimiento equilibrado de largo plazo (CBA), sugiere para una estrategia de explotación F 0. 1, que el valor recomendado de desembarque equivale a 10, 4 y 14, 6 toneladas (16. 885 y 15. 449 individuos) de machos y hembras respectivamente, cifras inferiores en un 10 % respecto a los actuales niveles desembarcados. La talla crítica de langosta para un valor de M= 0, 18, se determinó igual a 110 mm en machos y 107 mm en hembras, mientras la edad crítica estimada para ambos sexos corresponde al grupo de edad de 9 años.

An analysis of cohort at size (ACT) model is {{adjusted to the}} fishery {{carried out in the}} 1996 - 97 season. The fishing mortality of the totally recruited groups (Fcr) are estimated in 0, 63 for males and 0, 81 for females, with a 50 % of retention size of 94 to 96 for males and 96 for females. The lobsters mean biomass is estimated in 29 to 31 ton (46. 663 and 50. 355 individuals respectively) for males and in 39 to 42 ton (59. 785 and 63. 249 individuals respectively) for females. On the other hand, in the equilibrated yield analysis is estimated that fishing mortality Fcr derived of the ACT model, was inferior to the Fmáx recommended value estimated in 0, 86 for males and 1, 15 for females, and superiors to the F 0. 1 mortality. The long term equilibrated yield analysis (CBA), suggests for a F 0. 1 exploitation strategy that the recommended <b>landing</b> <b>value</b> is equal to 10, 4 and 14, 6 ton (16. 885 and 15. 449 individuals) of males and females respectively, 10 % inferior to current landings levels.

This finding suggests that <b>land</b> <b>value</b> taxation could be used to design compact development strategies that address sprawling development. <b>Land</b> <b>value</b> tax, <b>Land</b> development model, Urban sprawl, Land Economics/Use, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R
40|$|The <b>value</b> of <b>land</b> {{dominates the}} {{financial}} structure of most American agricultural production firms, and <b>land</b> <b>values</b> {{are an important}} factor in long-term agricultural planning and risk management. As the primary source of collateral for farm loans, farmland values have significant implications for both producers as well as bankers financing agricultural loans. The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Survey of Agricultural Credit Conditions is an expert opinion survey in which agricultural bankers provide <b>land</b> <b>value</b> forecasts. As the survey has drawn increased attention, the survey has drawn criticism regarding its use qualitative data to forecast <b>land</b> <b>values.</b> Our research examines the value of the survey data with respect to its ability to forecast movement in <b>land</b> <b>values.</b> Three techniques are used in the analysis. Interpreting the aggregate forecasts as probability estimates, Brier’s probability scores are used to evaluate aggregate bankers’ predictions. Next, turning points are evaluated using contingency tables. Finally, Granger causality tests are used to determine the dynamic relationship between <b>land</b> <b>value</b> predictions and actual <b>land</b> <b>value</b> changes reported by bankers. Bankers’ forecasts predict <b>land</b> <b>values</b> for irrigated and ranchland well, but non-irrigated forecasts were only marginally helpful in prediction non-irrigated farmland values. Forecasts provided in the survey may be beneficial, especially considering the scarcity of other publicly available data. farmland, forecasting, <b>land</b> <b>values,</b> Federal Reserve Bank, Agribusiness, Financial Economics,...|$|R

For example, 10% of land owners (all corporations) in Baltimore, Maryland own 58% of the taxable <b>land</b> <b>value.</b> The bottom 10% {{of those who}} own any land own less than 1% of the total <b>land</b> <b>value.</b> This form of analysis as well as Gini coefficient analysis {{has been used to}} support <b>land</b> <b>value</b> taxation.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} model {{provides an}} explanation to several empirically observed phenomena in spatial economics. By representing {{the system as}} a complex network of fixed-size land areas connected by trade between harbored activities, city size and <b>land</b> <b>value</b> distributions are obtained as higher-order patterns. The model predicts the empirically observed spatial distribution of <b>land</b> <b>value</b> density {{as well as that of}} urban cluster prices. To connect <b>land</b> <b>value</b> to population, which is a commonly observed quantity, we also demonstrate that there is, for urban clusters, a linear relation between accumulated <b>land</b> <b>value</b> and population.

40|$|This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{performance}} of industrial rents and <b>land</b> <b>values</b> in the Sydney property market. In the Sydney industrial property market, no growth of the rents and marginal growth of the <b>land</b> <b>values</b> in real terms has been seen between 1976 to 1996. It means that the overall return from an investment in industrial property is achieved largely from initial yield and current rental incomes, rather than rental growth and capital appreciation. The trends of real growth of industrial rents and <b>land</b> <b>values</b> have a similar cycle, but different magnitude (a or s) of fluctuation. It is concluded that industrial rent is determined more by demand than supply side factors, while <b>land</b> <b>value</b> is determined more by supply side factors than demand side factors.

40|$|Summary Even in {{the absence}} of formal <b>land</b> markets, {{estimated}} <b>values</b> on agricultural frontiers of the Brazilian Amazon reflect the value-adding characteristics of the land. Understanding these characteristics provides important insights to the incentives (or dis-incentives) to protect tropical forests and reduce deforestation. A hedonic model is used to identify characteristics determining smallholder <b>land</b> <b>values</b> on the Amazon frontier. Years on the lot, area under agricultural production, and house values were found to add value; while distance from the nearest city and area under forest decreased values. Characteristics that do not appear to significantly affect <b>land</b> <b>value</b> include pasture area and the claim to hold definitive title. By not adding significantly to <b>land</b> <b>values,</b> pasture may be used to establish property rights rather than to increase <b>land</b> <b>value</b> through positive rents. Our results also confirm the underutilization of the forest resource by smallholders. Brazil Amazon smallholder <b>land</b> <b>value</b> hedonic model...|$|R
