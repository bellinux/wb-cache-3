40|$|We {{computationally}} {{study the}} micromechanics of shear-induced size segregation and propose distinct migration mechanisms for individual <b>large</b> and small <b>particles.</b> While small particles percolate through voids without enduring contacts, <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> climb under shear through their crowded neighborhoods with anisotropic contact network. Particle rotation associated with shear {{is necessary for}} the upward migration of <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> Segregation of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> can be suppressed with inadequate friction, or with no rotation; increasing interparticle friction promotes the migration of <b>large</b> <b>particles,</b> but has little effect on the percolation of small particles.

40|$|Segregation of <b>larger</b> <b>particles</b> due to excluded-volume {{attraction}} is studied using experiments and simulations in a bidisperse vibrated granular material. There {{is an attractive}} force when {{the distance between the}} <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is less than the small-particle diameter, because smaller particles are excluded from the gap between the <b>larger</b> <b>particles,</b> and there is no pressure in the gap to resist the pressure exerted by the collision of the smaller particles on the outer surfaces of the <b>larger</b> <b>particles.</b> Analytical results are derived for the excluded-volume attraction, and these are in agreement with the experimental and simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The forestomach of {{ruminants}} and camelids {{does not}} only allow a differential excretion of fluids and small particles, {{but also a}} differential excretion of small and <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> The question whether <b>larger</b> <b>particles</b> of different size classes are also retained for different time periods, or whether simply a particle size threshold exists above which all particles of a size higher than this threshold are retained in an undifferentiated manner, has not been addressed so far. We determined the mean retention time (MRT) of different sized <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> (10 and 20 mm) in three banteng (Bos javanicus) on two forage only diets, grass and grass hay. We used cerium (Ce) -mordanted fibre (10 mm) and lanthanum (La) -mordanted fibre (20 mm) as particle markers, mixed in the food. Average total tract MRT for large and very <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> at the grass diet was 58 and 56 h, and at the grass hay diet 66 and 64 h, respectively. Very <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> moved slightly faster than <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> through the gut of the banteng. Three interpretations are possible: Very <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> are resubmitted to rumination sooner than <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> Ingestive mastication of the particle markers could have reduced {{the difference in the}} size of the particle markers; alternatively, particle retention may be governed by a threshold, above which all particles of a size higher than this threshold are retained in an undifferentiated manner. In order to test these possibilities, experiments with fistulated animals would have to be performed...|$|R
25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then agglomerate to form <b>large</b> <b>particle</b> chains, which subsequently deposit on {{the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and down the length of the tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E

40|$|Grain {{segregation}} occurs {{under various}} conditions, such as vibration, shear and mixing. In the gravity-driven shear flow, size segregation is {{triggered by the}} percolation of small particles through the opened voids (kinetic sieving), and <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> are accumulated in the upper layer. One hypothesis for the upward migration of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is the squeeze expulsion mechanism, which remains yet ambiguous due to limited evidences from either physical or numerical experiments. Here we show statistically how the percolation of small particles facilitates the upward movement of <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> We found that in <b>large</b> <b>particles,</b> the mechanical anisotropy (strong force network) coincides with the geometric anisotropy (contact network), which indicates squeeze, and the connectivity of <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is much higher when they are squeezed through small particles. The presence of small particles filling the voids hinders the downward movements and provides dynamic steps for the climbing <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> Furthermore, increasing the coefficient of friction promotes rotation and empowers more <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> {{to reach the top}} layer, implying that the climbing particles tend to rotate relative to their neighbors. Our findings of the microstructure and movement pattern of individual particles add new evidences to the mechanism of squeeze expulsion and provide new perspective for the study of segregation.

5000|$|When shaken, the {{particles}} move in vibration-induced convection flow; individual particles move {{up through the}} middle, across the surface, and down the sides. If a <b>large</b> <b>particle</b> is involved, it will be moved {{up to the top}} by convection flow. Once at the top, the <b>large</b> <b>particle</b> will stay there because the convection currents are too narrow to sweep it down along the wall.|$|E
5000|$|The same {{explanation}} without buoyancy or {{center of}} mass arguments: As a <b>larger</b> <b>particle</b> moves upward, any motion of smaller particles into the spaces underneath blocks the <b>larger</b> <b>particle</b> from settling back in its previous position. Repetitive motion results in more smaller <b>particles</b> slipping beneath <b>larger</b> <b>particles.</b> A greater density of the <b>larger</b> <b>particles</b> {{has no effect on}} this process. Shaking is not necessary; any process which raises particles and then lets them settle would have this effect. The process of raising the particles imparts potential energy into the system. The result of all the particles settling in a different order may be an increase in the potential energy—a raising of the {{center of mass}}.|$|R
5000|$|Deep sand beds {{may be made}} of {{a variety}} of materials, but {{typically}} fine or [...] "superfine" [...] sand is used, with a grain size between 1 mm and 0.05 mm.

50|$|If the {{container}} contains particles of different sizes, the downward-moving region {{at the sides}} is often narrower than the <b>largest</b> <b>particles.</b> Thus, <b>larger</b> <b>particles</b> tend to become sorted {{to the top of}} such a mixture.

40|$|Particle {{cycle and}} {{residence}} time distributions in different regions, {{particularly in the}} spray zone, {{play an important role}} in fluid bed coating. In this study, a DEM-CFD (discrete element method, computational fluid dynamics) model is employed to determine particle cycle and residence time distributions in a laboratory-scale Wurster fluid bed coater. The calculations show good agreement with data obtained using the positron emission particle tracking (PEPT) technique. The DEM-CFD simulations of different size <b>particles</b> show that <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> spend a longer time in the spray zone and in the Wurster tube than small <b>particles.</b> In addition, <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> are found on average to move closer to the spray nozzle than small particles, which implies that the <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> could shield small particles from the spray droplets. Both of these effects suggest that <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> receive a greater amount of coating solution per unit area per cycle than small particles. However, the simulations in combination with the PEPT experiments show that this is partly compensated for by a longer cycle time for <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> <b>Large</b> <b>particles</b> thus receive more coating per unit area per pass through the spray zone, but also travel through the spray zone less frequently than small particles...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Large</b> <b>particles</b> {{naturally}} {{fall out}} of the air faster than small particles, but the CADR rating is based on how well the filter works over and above this effect. So CADR ratings for dust and pollen come out lower than would be expected by looking only at the filter's efficiency at removing <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> This [...] "bias" [...] against the filter's efficiency at removing <b>large</b> <b>particles</b> is a relative bias in favor of the filter's ability to remove small (smoke) articles. Since smoke particles are the most difficult to filter (lower filter efficiency relative to <b>large</b> <b>particles),</b> the two effects largely cancel so that CADR ratings are usually similar for both small and <b>large</b> <b>particles.</b> A filter that is very good at removing smoke particles by using a slow fan or electrostatic effects will not get as good CADR numbers for pollen and dust because those particles will fall down and deposit on room surfaces during the test, before the filter has had a chance to collect them.|$|R
