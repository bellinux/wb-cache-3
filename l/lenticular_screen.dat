50|$|Eugène Estanave {{performed}} further {{experiments with}} Lippmann's technique. He exhibited an integral photograph in 1925 and published about his findings in La Nature.

5000|$|Additionally, {{the nature}} of {{polarized}} 3-D projection {{requires the use of}} interposed filters, and the overall image is consequently less bright than if it were being normally projected.

5000|$|A silver screen, {{also known}} as a silver <b>lenticular</b> <b>screen,</b> is a type of {{projection}} screen that was popular {{in the early years of}} the motion picture industry and passed into popular usage as a metonym for the cinema industry. The term silver screen comes from the actual silver (or similarly reflective aluminium) content embedded in the material that made up the screen's highly reflective surface.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} is in 3D imaging and displays. In 1902 Frederic E. Ives proposed {{the use of}} an array of alternately transmitting and opaque strips to define the viewing directions for a pair of interlaced images and hence enable the observer to see a 3D stereoscopic image. The strips were later replaced by Hess with an array of cylindrical lenses known as a <b>lenticular</b> <b>screen,</b> to make more efficient use of the illumination.|$|E
50|$|The panoramagram is an {{instrument}} invented in 1824 and {{a method of}} stereoscopic viewing in which the left-eye and right-eye photographs are divided into narrow juxtaposed strips and viewed through a superimposed ruled or <b>lenticular</b> <b>screen</b> {{in such a way}} that each of the observer's eyes is able to see only the correct picture. Also used to obtain the illusion of depth of one or more objects placed on the horizon and reflected on a flat surface.|$|E
5000|$|Silver <b>lenticular</b> <b>screens,</b> {{while no}} longer {{employed}} {{as the standard}} for motion picture projection, have come back into use as they are ideally suited for modern polarized 3-D projection. The percentage of light reflected from a non-metallic (dielectric) surface varies strongly with the direction of polarization and the angle of incidence; {{this is not the}} case for an electric conductor such as a metal [...] (as an illustration of this, sunlight reflected from a horizontal surface such as a reflective road surface or water is attenuated by polarized sunglasses relative to direct light; {{this is not the case}} if the light is reflected from a metallic surface). As many 3-D technologies in use today depend upon maintaining the polarization of the images to be presented to each eye, the reflecting surface needs to be metallic rather than dielectric.|$|R

30|$|The {{generation}} of multiview stereoscopic images of large volume rendered data demands {{an enormous amount}} of calculations. We propose a method for hardware accelerated volume rendering of medical data sets to multiview lenticular displays, offering interactive manipulation throughout.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the multi-user autostereoscopic 3 D display system constructed {{and operated by}} the authors using the time-multiplexing approach. This prototype has three main advantages over the previous versions developed by the authors: its hardware was simplified as only one optical array is used to create viewing regions in space, a <b>lenticular</b> multiplexing <b>screen</b> is not necessary as images can be produced sequentially on a fast 120 Hz LCD with full resolution, and the holographic projector was replaced with a high-frame-rate digital micromirror device (DMD) projector. The whole system in this prototype consists of four major parts: a 120 Hz high-frame-rate DMD projector, a 49 -element optical array, a 120 Hz screen assembly, and a multi-user head tracker. The display images for the left/right eyes are produced alternatively on a 120 Hz direct-view LCD and are synchronized with {{the output of the}} projector, which acts as a backlight of the LCD. The novel steering optics controlled by the multiuser head tracker system directs the projector output to regions referred to as exit pupils, which are located in the viewers’ eyes. The display can be developed in the “hang-on-the-wall” form...|$|R
40|$|Along public pathways, visual {{signs and}} audio cues {{are used by}} {{pedestrians}} to guide them into forming smoother pedestrian flows. However, often ignored or neglected, these signals require greater pedestrian attentiveness and appropriate conscious effort. To solve this problem, we have proposed the concept of “vection field”. This is a field of optical flow that cues movement according to a pedestrian’s motion. Visual stimulus within this optical flow leads pedestrians innately in specific directions without requiring direct interventions. We have implemented such a field by covering {{the ground with a}} lenticular lens screen; in this setup, neither power supply nor position tracking of pedestrians is necessary. An experimental result from our previous study shows that a vection field can direct pedestrians to one side. However, the quality of the optical flow such as image clarity and smoothness of motion was unsatisfactory in that it could cause a reduction in leading inducement. In this paper, we describe in detail a new display method involving a <b>lenticular</b> lens <b>screen</b> that yields an improvement in the quality of the vection field and ultimately pedestrian optical flow. Experiments showed improvements over previous attempts...|$|R

40|$|Dichoptic {{training}} {{is designed to}} promote binocular vision in patients with amblyopia. Initial {{studies have found that}} the training effects transfer to both binocular (stereopsis) and monocular (recognition acuity) visual functions. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether dichoptic training effects also transfer to contrast sensitivity (CS) in adults with amblyopia. We analyzed CS data from 30 adults who had taken part in one of two previous dichoptic training studies and assessed whether the changes in CS exceeded the 95 % confidence intervals for change based on test-retest data from a separate group of observers with amblyopia. CS was measured using Gabor patches (0. 5, 3 and 10. cpd) before and after 10. days of dichoptic training. Training was delivered using a dichoptic video game viewed through video goggles (n = 15) or on an iPod touch equipped with a <b>lenticular</b> overlay <b>screen</b> (n = 15). In the iPod touch study, training was combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation of the visual cortex.

40|$|A {{lenticular}} film {{system designed}} to suppress image degrading crossover during dual screen radiographic exposure is proposed and evaluated. The <b>lenticular</b> <b>screen</b> consists of two sheets of crossed cylindrical lenslets each with a frequency of 25 lenslets/mm. A numerical analysis via optical ray tracing compares the theoretical frequency response of the proposed system {{to that of a}} conventional radiographic film.

Experimental measurements made on simulations of the proposed system using Kodak film type, SO- 241 confirm the predicted improvement in the mid-frequency range. The proposed lenticular system reduces the need to absorb crossover illumination with a tinted film base by imaging crossover illumination with lenslets molded into the film base. By using the crossover illumination as part of the image forming exposure, a reduced radiation dose is required to obtain comparable or improved image quality...|$|E

The advantages of a video projection onto lenticular screens are emphasised. In particular, it is a method without aid of spectacles. It is the only realised system for more than only one video stereo image in motion and consequently, several different stereo images can be projected simultaneously onto the same screens. If several pairs of stereo cameras point from various directions to an object, all these sights can be observed by a little movement of the head or from different viewing positions. The lenticular projection screen is suitable for large, wideangle and realistic spatial impressions.

Stereoscopic imaging is a well-known technique already {{for a long time}} with understood physical and physiological parameters. Recently, a commercial hype has been observed, especially in display techniques. The commercial market is already flooded with systems based on goggle-aided 3 D-viewing techniques. However, their use is limited for military applications since goggles are not accepted by military users for several reasons. The proposed uncooled thermal imaging stereoscopic camera with a geometrical resolution of 640 x 480 pixel perfectly fits to the autostereoscopic display with a 1280 x 768 pixels. An eye tracker detects the position of the observer's eyes and computes the pixel positions for {{the left and the right}} eye.
