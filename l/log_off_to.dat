2500|$|In a {{joke about}} Trump's use of social media, {{journalist}} and MSNBC host Chris Hayes said that protestors should yell at Donald Trump to <b>log</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> [...] "see {{if they can get}} him to recreate that @dril tweet," [...] a reference to the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|They {{travel for}} several days through the {{landscape}} before finding out that the diver's use of the Warlock virus somehow linked Vicka's landscape with an RPG server, where fantasy fans play in a Lord of the Rings-like world. They {{find out that the}} game server plays out a war between King Legolas's elves and an alliance of orcs and dwarves. They leave Jinx (who is wounded from [...] "Labyrinth") by a road and <b>log</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> rest and come back as fantasy characters. While the diver is eating, the Maniac shows up and cleans up his computer, erasing all trace of Warlock and the Gunslinger persona. He then helps the diver design a fantasy character for him - a human healer Elenium (by the name of the tranquiliser). The diver returns to the fantasy server and finds that Vicka is now a male elf archer. They go back to Jinx and try to get him back into Deeptown but are intercepted by Man with no Face and several armed goons. Another diver shows up and attacks the goons looking like a big wolf.|$|E
5000|$|Apparently, the Dark Diver {{wants him}} dead. Man with no Face does not reveal {{what is in}} the stolen files. Instead, he gives the {{prototype}} weapon to Leonid, saying that most of the bullets are stun rounds and the last one is deadly. He leaves, after which Leonid's team-mates arrive, followed by the deliveryman. Leonid takes the letter, opens it, and reads it. The files describe an attempt by Man with no Face to create [...] "shadow consciousness" [...] — a sort-of echo of a person who <b>logs</b> <b>off</b> from Deeptown. Apparently, there was some success in allowing an avatar to exist and interact with Deeptown {{for a period of time}} after the user leaves. The ramifications of this discovery are staggering — should Dibenko succeed, Deeptown will soon be populated with [...] "ghosts" [...] of real-life people. There will be no knowing who is real and who is not. Also, those [...] "ghosts" [...] will eventually achieve a form of AI, as evident by the Emperor in the [...] "Labyrinth of Death" [...] (his question [...] "Who am I?" [...] is the proof of his self-awareness). After locking the file on Chingiz's computer with four passwords (Leonid's, Chingiz's, Bastard's, and Pat's), they all leave the Temple and agree to meet up later in Chingiz's Deeptown apartment. Leonid <b>logs</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> find Vicka near her computer. He realizes that she was Nike and was helping them reach the last level.|$|R

Alice signs on first to see that only one ticket is left, and finds it expensive. Alice takes time to decide. Bob signs on and also finds one ticket left, and orders it instantly. Bob purchases and <b>logs</b> <b>off.</b> Alice decides <b>to</b> buy a ticket, to find there are no tickets. This is a typical read-write conflict situation.|$|R
5000|$|... whereas an open {{computer}} conference {{begins with}} {{a small number of}} well-informed and highly interested participants, it soon attracts others. That's all right; it's supposed to attract others. Where else would you get new ideas? But soon it attracts too many, far too many, {{and some of them are}} not only ignorant but aggressively misinformed. Dilution takes place. Arguments replace discussions. Tempers are frayed.The result is that while computer conferencing began by saving time, it starts to eat up all the time it saved and more. Communications come from dozens of sources. Much of it is redundant. Some of it is stupid. The user spends more and more time dealing with irrelevancies. One day the user wakes up, decides the initial euphoria was spurious, and <b>logs</b> <b>off,</b> never <b>to</b> return. This is known as burnout, and it's apparently quite common.|$|R
5000|$|In late July 2007, news {{broke that}} AOL OpenRide {{was to be}} {{replaced}} by [...] "AOL Helix". Helix was then renamed to AOL Desktop, which incorporates most of AOL OpenRide's feature. However, key features were missing such as the Dynasizer, along with the multi-pane layout, and OpenRide's Media Center which incorporated AOL's desktop search, pictures, music, files, XM Radio, new feeds, and a flash player. As of December 2007, users of OpenRide are no longer able to log into the AOL network with the OpenRide application to use Email/IM, you are immediately <b>logged</b> <b>off</b> and referred <b>to</b> the download page of AOL Desktop. The only feature that still works is the web browser.|$|R
50|$|Teams flew {{to their}} final {{destination}} city: Portland, Oregon. Upon arrival, {{they had to}} travel to Tilikum Retreat Center in Newberg and the Detour, a choice of High & Dry or Low & Wet. In High & Dry, teams had to climb a tree to a certain height where they had to balance themselves on a <b>log,</b> then jump <b>off</b> <b>to</b> each grab half of their next clue. In Low & Wet, teams participated in a logrolling tradition, where they had to walk across floating logs a distance of 800 ft to a river island to retrieve their next clue.|$|R
50|$|Pat, while {{sending the}} file, {{suspects}} {{something is wrong}} and enters the apartment armed. The Dark Diver, however, is quicker and shoots Pat. Too late does he realize that the bullet is lethal. He disappears with the file, as Pat's heart stops beating. Chingiz's virtual computer is too far away, so Leonid takes drastic measures. Somehow, he forces Chingiz to see the deep for {{what it really is}} (i.e. become a diver) and <b>log</b> <b>off.</b> Bastard rushes <b>to</b> his own virtual computer <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>off,</b> and Leonid leave the apartment and goes to his favorite bar/restaurant in Deeptown. There, he calls the Dark Diver, and the figure appears by him. Leonid finally knows the Dark Diver's true nature — he is an echo of Leonid and the power he once held. Apparently, after Jinx left, Leonid decided that he did not wish to be a diver anymore. So, subconsciously, he altered the deep-program to have a built-in timer and removed diver ability to see programming holes. The part of him that had the power to manipulate any program and access Deeptown without a computer split off and formed its own personality, while still remaining a distant part of him. That is why the Dark Diver did not know about the lethal round in his gun — it was Leonid's gun.|$|R
