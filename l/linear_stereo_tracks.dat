50|$|Although {{there is}} a {{superficial}} similarity between Betamax and Betacam in that they use the same tape cassette, they are really quite different formats. Betamax records relatively low resolution video using a heterodyne color recording system and only two recording heads, while Betacam uses four heads to record in component format, {{at a much higher}} linear tape speed of 10.15 cm/s (3.99606 in./s) compared with Betamax's 1.87 cm/s (0.7362205 in./s), resulting in much higher video and audio quality. A typical L-750 length Betamax cassette that yielded about 3 hours of recording time on a Betamax VCR at its B-II Speed (NTSC), or on PAL, only provided 30 minutes' record time on a Betacam VCR or camcorder. Another common point between Betamax and Betacam is the placement of the <b>stereo</b> <b>linear</b> audio <b>tracks.</b> Also, some Betacam and Betamax portables share the same batteries.|$|R
50|$|Studio film {{releases}} {{began to}} emerge with <b>linear</b> <b>stereo</b> audiotracks in 1982.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is developed for tracking multiple targets using distributed bearings-only sensors. It {{is assumed that}} the sensors report the measurements asynchronously and the processing is done centrally. The proposed algorithm first forms bearings-only (mono) tracks for each sensor and then combines them to form Cartesian position (<b>stereo)</b> <b>tracks.</b> The <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> are initialized using a multidimensional assignment technique. Once the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> are initialized the mono tracks contributed to the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> are deleted and the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> are updated directly using the measurements from the sensors. As shown later in this paper the proposed {{algorithm is}} computationally simple and can provide better tracking performance compared to an existing algorithm. Simulations carried out to track multiple targets confirm {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm. T. Sathyan, A. Sinh...|$|R

2500|$|The {{cassette}} {{was a great}} {{step forward}} in convenience from reel-to-reel audio tape recording, although, because {{of the limitations of}} the cassette's size and speed, it initially compared poorly in quality. Unlike the 4-track stereo open-reel format, the two <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> of each side lie adjacent to each other, rather than being interleaved with the tracks of the other side. This permitted monaural cassette players to play stereo recordings [...] "summed" [...] as mono <b>tracks</b> and permitted <b>stereo</b> players to play mono recordings through both speakers. The tape is [...] wide, with each <b>stereo</b> <b>track</b> 0.6mm wide and an unrecorded guard band between each track. The tape moves at [...] (1⅞ inch/s) from left to right. For comparison, the typical open-reel format in consumer use was [...] (¼ inch) wide, each <b>stereo</b> <b>track</b> nominally 1.0mm (1⁄25 inch) wide, and running at either twice or four times the speed of a cassette.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{two-stage}} centralized algorithm for tracking multiple targets using spatially distributed bearings-only sensors that report the observations asynchronously. The sensors {{are assumed to}} be passive, i. e., they detect the energy emitted by the targets of interest to measure the bearing. The number of targets in the surveillance region is unknown a priori and the targets can enter or leave the surveillance region at any time. The measurement origin is also unknown since a detection can be due to the target being tracked, from a new target, or from clutter. In the first stage (the initialization stage) the proposed algorithm forms local bearings-only (mono) tracks for each sensor and combines these tracks to generate complete kinematic(stereo) tracks in the Cartesian coordinate frame. Once <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> are formed, in the second stage, which is called the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracking</b> stage, bearing measurements are directly used to update the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks.</b> This separation of the initialization and maintenance of the <b>stereo</b> <b>tracks</b> is lacking in many existing algorithms and results in improved performance. In this work we used the assignment-based technique to solve various data association problems that arise due to measurement origin uncertainty. Through extensive simulations we show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tracking accuracy while being computationally simpler than existing algorithms. T. Sathyan and A. Sinh...|$|R
