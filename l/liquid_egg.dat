40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteRandall K. PhebusFrancisella tularensis is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{that can}} cause tularemia in humans. The disease can be acquired through several routes, {{one of which is}} the ingestion of contaminated food and water. The pathogen {{has the potential to be}} used as a biological weapon, and its intentional introduction in the food supply is a possible way to cause public harm. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth and/or survival of F. tularensis in food matrices under various storage conditions. Cystine Heart Agar enriched with 2 % hemoglobin and supplemented with antibiotics was used to aid the enumeration of the target organism by suppressing the levels of indigenous microflora in foods. During the first portion of the study, the growth/survival of highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S 4 strain was investigated in prepared bagged iceberg lettuce stored at two temperatures. F. tularensis counts were significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) among temperature levels for days 1 - 3, but not day 4. After the first 24 h of incubation, the mean estimates of F. tularensis counts were 1. 00 log cfu g⁻¹ lower in lettuce stored at 23 ± 1 °C compared to lettuce stored at 6 ± 1 °C. Lower recovery rates at higher temperatures are likely due to the more rapid proliferation of naturally present bacteria which can inhibit the growth of F. tularensis. After 48 and 72 h, differences in F. tularensis counts between temperatures were 0. 55 log cfu g⁻¹ and 0. 3 log cfu g⁻¹, respectively. For the second portion of the experiment, the ability of F. tularensis to grow or survive was evaluated in nine food matrices with variable compositional content (red delicious apples, green bell pepper, shredded iceberg lettuce, strawberries, whole <b>liquid</b> <b>eggs,</b> boneless ham steak, beef hot dogs, 80 - 20 ground beef, and 2 % UHT milk) at 4, 21, and 37 °C. F. tularensis grew well in pasteurized whole <b>liquid</b> <b>eggs</b> stored at 21 and 37 °C.

Viscosity, pH, turbidity, foaming properties, color, and volatile profile of <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> white, and {{color and texture}} properties of cooked egg white were determined at 0, 7, and 14 days of storage. Irradiation increased the turbidity but decreased viscosity of <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> white. Foaming capacity and foam stability were not affected by irradiation at lower dose (2. 5 kGy), but were deteriorated at higher doses (≥ 5. 0 kGy) of irradiation. Sulfur-containing volatiles were generated by irradiation and their amounts increased as the irradiation dose increased. However, the sulfur volatiles disappeared during storage under aerobic conditions. Lightness (L* value) and yellowness (b* value) decreased, but greenness (-a * value) increased in cooked egg white in irradiation dose-dependent manners. All textural parameters (hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, chewiness, and resilience) of cooked egg white increased as the irradiation dose increased, but those changes were marginal. Our results indicated that irradiation of shell egg at lower doses (up to 2. 5 kGy) had little {{negative impact on the}} physiochemical and functional properties of <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> white, but can improve the efficiency of egg processing due to its viscosity-lowering effect.

The {{objective of this}} study was to investigate the efficiency of UV-C radiation as a non-thermal pasteurization process for <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> products (LEPs). The outcomes of this study were evaluated from the rheological, biodosimetric and inactivation efficiency points of view. The results pertaining to rheological characterization, physical and optical measurements of the fresh and pasteurized LEPs indicated that liquid whole egg (LWE) and <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> white (LEW) showed Newtonian behavior within the range studied. <b>Liquid</b> <b>egg</b> yolk (LEY) exhibited pseudoplastic and time independent behavior in temperature ranges from 4 C to 25 C. But its rheological behavior was affected at pasteurization temperature and showed thixotropy and time dependent. The biodosimetric study based on the UV treatment of LEPs by using collimated beam apparatus pointed out that the best reduction was achieved in <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> white (LEW) when the fluid depth and UV dose were 0. 153 cm and 98 mJ/cm 2, respectively. Maximum inactivation was 0. 675 -log CFU/ml in <b>liquid</b> <b>egg</b> yolk (LEY) and 0. 316 -log CFU/ml in liquid whole egg (LWE). The kinetics of UV inactivation of E. coli in LEPs was found nonlinear. Our results emphasize that UV-C radiation can be used as a pre-treatment process or combined with mild heat treatment to reduce the adverse effects of thermal pasteurization of LEPs. The efficacies of short wave ultraviolet light (UV-C) as a non-thermal process for LEW were investigated in the continuous flow UV reactor based on the result derived from the biodosimetric study. Maximum 0. 2 log reduction was achieved after 5 cycle of operation. The efficiency of the UV light treatment in continuous flow UV reactor was found to be lower compared to bench-top studies. This is attributed to the problems caused by inefficient design of UV chamber. Results of these work showed that the UV reactor was designed poorly to supply enough UV irradiation exposure for all the fluid elements in the system. Redesigning of the system was suggested...|$|E
