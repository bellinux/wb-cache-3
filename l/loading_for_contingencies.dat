40|$|Generation loss {{contingencies}} in {{electric power}} systems {{result in a}} deviation of system frequency from nominal, a condition which must be corrected promptly {{in order to prevent}} further degradation of the power system. Automatic load-shedding using underfrequency relays is one of the techniques used to correct abnormal frequency deviations and prevent the risk of uncontrolled outages. If sufficient load is shed following a contingency to preserve interconnections and keep generators on-line, the system can be restored with relative speed and ease. On the other hand, if a declining frequency condition is not dealt with adequately, a cascading disconnection of generating units may develop, leading to a possible total system blackout. This thesis develops and tests a new systematic method for setting underfrequency relays offering a number of advantages over conventional methods. A discretized swing equation model is used to evaluate the system frequency following a contingency, and the operational logic of an underfrequency relay is modeled using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) techniques. The proposed approach computes relay settings with respect to a subset of all plausible <b>contingencies</b> <b>for</b> a given system. A method for selecting the subset of <b>contingencies</b> <b>for</b> inclusion in the MILP is presented. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate that given certain types of degrees of freedom in the relay setting problem, it is possible to obtain a set of relay settings that limits damage or disconnection of generating units for each and every possible generation loss outage in a given system, while attempting to shed the least amount of <b>load</b> <b>for</b> each <b>contingency...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract â€” Contingency {{analysis}} and risk management are important tasks for the safe operation of electrical energy network. Potential harmful disturbances that occur during the {{steady state operation}} of a power system are known as contingencies. Contingency analysis is carried out by using repeated <b>load</b> flow solutions <b>for</b> each of a list of potential component failures. In this paper is work is carried out by selecting the contingencies according to the line <b>loading</b> <b>for</b> single transmission line outage and identified the severe most contingency based on transmission line loading. This process has to be executed for all the possible <b>contingencies</b> <b>for</b> tie lines and limiting lines, and repeated every time when the structure changes significantly and Available Transfer Capability (ATC) is calculated between the areas <b>for</b> each <b>contingency.</b> The results are analyzed and discussed on 124 -bus real life Indian utility system of Andhra Pradesh State Grid...|$|R
