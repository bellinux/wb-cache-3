40|$|Abstract <b>Lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> which convert <b>lactate</b> to {{pyruvate}} {{are found}} in almost every organism and comprise a group of highly divergent proteins in amino acid sequence, catalytic properties, and substrate specificity. While the L-lactate dehydrogenases {{are among the most}} studied enzymes, very {{little is known about the}} structure and function of D-lactate dehydrogenases (D-LDHs) which include two discrete classes of enzymes that are classified based on their ability to transfer electrons and/or protons to NAD in NAD-dependent <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (nLDHs), and FAD in NAD-independent <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (iLDHs). In this study, we used a combination of structural and phylogenomic approaches to reveal the likely evolutionary events in the history of the recently described FAD binding oxidoreductase/transferase type 4 family that led to the evolution of D-iLDHs (commonly referred as DLD). Our phylogenetic reconstructions reveal that DLD genes from eukaryotes form a paraphyletic group with respect to D- 2 -hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D 2 HGDH). All phylogenetic reconstructions recovered two divergent yeast DLD phylogroups. While the first group (DLD 1) showed close phylogenetic relationships with the animal and plant DLDs, the second yeast group (DLD 2) revealed strong phylogenetic and structural similarities to the plant and animal D 2 HGDH All sequences produced in this work have been deposited to GenBank (GQ 199601; GQ 199602; GQ 199603; GQ 199604).

5|$|Carbohydrate {{catabolism}} is {{the breakdown}} of carbohydrates into smaller units. Carbohydrates are usually taken into cells once they have been digested into monosaccharides. Once inside, the major route of breakdown is glycolysis, where sugars such as glucose and fructose are converted into pyruvate and some ATP is generated. Pyruvate is an intermediate in several metabolic pathways, but the majority is converted to acetyl-CoA through aerobic (with oxygen) glycolysis and fed into the citric acid cycle. Although some more ATP is generated in the citric acid cycle, the most important product is NADH, which is made from NAD+ as the acetyl-CoA is oxidized. This oxidation releases carbon dioxide as a waste product. In anaerobic conditions, glycolysis produces lactate, through the enzyme <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> re-oxidizing NADH to NAD+ for re-use in glycolysis. An alternative route for glucose breakdown is the pentose phosphate pathway, which reduces the coenzyme NADPH and produces pentose sugars such as ribose, the sugar component of nucleic acids.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzyme {{consists of}} four protein subunits. Since the two most common subunits found in <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> are encoded by the LDHA and LDHB genes, either variation of this disease causes abnormalities {{in many of the}} <b>lactate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> enzymes found in the body. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase-A deficiency, mutations to the LDHA gene results in the production of an abnormal lactate dehydrogenase-A subunit that cannot bind to the other subunits to form the complete enzyme. This lack of a functional subunit reduces the amount of enzyme formed, leading to an overall decrease in activity. During the anaerobic phase of glycolysis (the Cori Cycle), the mutated enzyme is unable to convert pyruvate into lactate to produce the extra energy the cells need. Since this subunit has the highest concentration in the LDH enzymes found in the skeletal muscles (which are the primary muscles responsible for movement), high-intensity physical activity will lead to an insufficient amount of energy being produced during this anaerobic phase. This in turn will cause the muscle tissue to weaken and eventually break down, a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. The process of rhabdomyolysis also releases myoglobin into the blood, which will eventually end up in the urine and cause it to become red or brown: another condition known as myoglobinuria. Some other common symptoms are exercise intolerance, which consists of fatigue, muscle pain, and cramps during exercise, and skin rashes. In severe cases, myoglobinuria can damage the kidneys and lead to life-threatening kidney failure. In order to obtain a definitive diagnosis, a muscle biopsy may be performed to confirm low or absent LDH activity. There is currently no specific treatment for this condition.|$|E
