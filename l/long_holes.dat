50|$|One of Whitehead, County Antrim's two golf courses. Bentra Golf Course is touted {{to be one}} of {{the longest}} 9-hole courses in Ireland, {{spanning}} 3042 yards long. The course was designed for both experienced and novice golfers in mind, with wide fairways and avenues of grand old trees, plus some particularly <b>long</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
50|$|Production mining {{is further}} {{broken down into}} two methods, <b>long</b> <b>hole</b> and short hole. Short hole mining is similar to {{development}} mining, except that it occurs in ore. There are several different methods of <b>long</b> <b>hole</b> mining. Typically <b>long</b> <b>hole</b> mining requires two excavations within the ore at different elevations below surface, (15 m - 30 m apart). Holes are drilled between the two excavations and loaded with explosives. The holes are blasted and the ore {{is removed from the}} bottom excavation.|$|R

5000|$|Putt-Putt's short {{holes are}} {{designed}} so that a hole-in-one can be scored on each hole with a skillful putt, often {{through the use of}} banking; the metal rails facilitate accurate caroms. Most mini-golf courses include holes that are impossible to ace, and those that can be aced often rely on luck due to extremely <b>long</b> <b>holes</b> and randomly placed obstacles. Additionally, the borders of each hole usually are made of rocks or uneven brick, making accurate banking difficult.|$|E

5000|$|In British English, a fish slice is {{a kitchen}} tool {{with a wide}} flat blade with <b>long</b> <b>holes</b> in it, used for lifting and turning food while cooking. [...] It was {{originally}} a serving implement for fish, usually made of silver, antique examples of which commonly appear at auction. [...] Fish slices were made of silver or Sheffield plate rather than steel to avoid the possibility of tainting {{the taste of the}} fish due a reaction between the fish and its lemon seasoning and the steel. After 1745 their outlines were usually fish shaped.|$|E
50|$|Located 14 km {{northeast}} of Avanos, this underground city {{was built on}} the northern slopes of Mt. Idis in an area with lots of strata made up of volcanic granite. The extensive galleries of the city are spread out over a large area and connected to each another by tunnels. Unlike the underground cities in Kaymaklı and Derinkuyu, there are very narrow (5 cm) and <b>long</b> <b>holes</b> between the different levels of the city that used to provide communication between the different levels of the city. The ventilation of these neatly carved out rooms was provided by these holes when the city was sealed up against enemies.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools a process called , or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when {{the depth of the}} hole is three times greater than the drill diameter). Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately <b>long</b> <b>holes,</b> otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.|$|E
50|$|<b>Long</b> <b>hole</b> stoping as {{the name}} {{suggests}} uses holes drilled by a production drill to a predetermined pattern as designed by a Mining Engineer. <b>Long</b> <b>hole</b> stoping is a highly selective and productive method of mining and can cater for varying ore thicknesses and dips (0 - 90 degree). It differs from manual methods such as timbered and shrinkage as once the stope has begun blasting phase it cannot be accessed by personnel. For this reason the blasted rock is designed to fall into a supported drawpoint or removed with remote control LHD (load, haul, dump machine).|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} types of bunkers used in golf course {{architecture}} and all {{are designed to be}} impediments to the golfer's progress toward the green. Fairway bunkers are designed primarily to gather up wayward tee shots on par 4 and par 5 holes; they are located to the sides of the fairway or even {{in the middle of the}} fairway. Greenside bunkers are designed to collect wayward approach shots on <b>long</b> <b>holes</b> and tee shots on par 3 holes; they are located near and around the green. Waste bunkers are natural sandy areas, usually very large and often found on links courses; they are not considered hazards according to the rules of golf, and so, unlike in fairway or greenside bunkers, golfers are permitted to ground a club lightly in, or remove loose impediments from, the area around the ball.|$|E
50|$|The {{rubberized}} {{surfaces of}} new all-weather running tracks that became common {{starting in the}} 1970s, made the old blocks even less secure. Original Tartan tracks left <b>long</b> <b>holes</b> to secure the blocks but most tracks today require blocks to be held by small spikes {{similar to the ones}} used in shoes. Block slippage was common enough that it is an allowable loophole in the rules to recall the start of a race without calling a false start against an athlete whose blocks slip. In some amateur settings, such as high school track, since block slippage is much more common due to lower quality track surface material and/or starting blocks' spike quality, it is a commonly accepted practice to allow another person (usually a teammate) to sit on the ground behind the starting block and place their feet behind each block, using their leg power to further reduce the chance for the blocks to slip back upon the runner launching out of them.|$|E
