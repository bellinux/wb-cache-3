50|$|If each {{location}} in main memory can be cached {{in either of}} two locations in the cache, one <b>logical</b> <b>question</b> is: {{which one of the}} two? The simplest and most commonly used scheme, shown in the right-hand diagram above, is to use the least significant bits of the memory location's index as the index for the cache memory, and to have two entries for each index. One benefit of this scheme is that the tags stored in the cache do not have to include that part of the main memory address which is implied by the cache memory's index. Since the cache tags have fewer bits, they require fewer transistors, take less space on the processor circuit board or on the microprocessor chip, and can be read and compared faster. Also LRU is especially simple since only one bit needs to be stored for each pair.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics", {{published}} in 2004 in October, Claire Bishop describes the aesthetic of Palais de Tokyo as a [...] "laboratory", the [...] "curatorial modus operandi" [...] of art {{produced in the}} 1990s. Bishop writes, [...] "An effect of this insistent promotion of these ideas as artists-as-designer, function over contemplation, and open-endedness over aesthetic resolution is often ultimately to enhance {{the status of the}} curator, who gains credit for stage-managing the overall laboratory experience. As Hal Foster warned in the mid-1990s, 'the institution may overshadow the work that it otherwise highlights: it becomes the spectacle, it collects the cultural capital, and the director-curator becomes the star.'" [...] Bishop identifies Bourriaud's book as an important first step in identifying tendencies in the art of the 1990s. However, Bishop also asks, [...] "if relational art produces human relations, then the next <b>logical</b> <b>question</b> to ask is what types of relations are being produced, for whom, and why?" [...] She continues that [...] "the relations set up by relational aesthetics are not intrinsically democratic, as Bourriaud suggests, since they rest too comfortably within an ideal of subjectivity as whole and of community as immanent togetherness." ...|$|E
5000|$|Thus {{one thing}} cannot be {{predicated}} of another, that is, {{the essence of}} things cannot be reached by means of [...] Plutarch quotes Stilpo as arguing: To be a horse differs from to be running. For being asked {{the definition of the}} one and of the other, we do not give the same for them both; and therefore those err who predicate the one of the other. For if good is the same with people, and to run the same with a horse, how is good affirmed also of food and medicine, and again (by Jupiter) to run of a lion and a dog? But if the predicate is different, then we do not rightly say that a person is good, and a horse runs.Plutarch remarks here that Colotes attacked Stilpo in a bombastic manner as though he ignored common life: [...] "for how shall we live, if we cannot style a man good, nor a man a captain, but must separately name a man a man, good good, and a captain a captain." [...] But Plutarch, in turn, replied, [...] "but what man lived any the worse for this? Is there any man who hears this said, and who does not understand it to be the speech of a man who rallies gallantly, and proposes to others this <b>logical</b> <b>question</b> to exercise their mind?" ...|$|E

To form an answer both deduction and plausible reasoning are used. As a knowledge domain under consideration is social behavior of persons, plausible reasoning is based on laws of social psychology. Proposed algorithms of inference and plausible reasoning can be realized in computer systems closely connected with text processing (criminology, operation of business, medicine, document systems) ...|$|R

40|$|Loop {{heat pipes}} (LHPs) {{have been used}} for thermal control of several NASA and {{commercial}} orbiting spacecraft. The LHP operating temperature is governed by the saturation temperature of its compensation chamber (CC). Most LHPs use the CC temperature for feedback control of its operating temperature. There exists a thermal resistance between the heat source to be cooled by the LHP and the LHP's CC. Even if the CC set point temperature is controlled precisely, the heat source temperature will still vary with its heat output. For most applications, controlling the heat source temperature is of most interest. A <b>logical</b> <b>question</b> to ask is: "Can the heat source temperature be used for feedback control of the LHP operation?" A test program has been implemented to answer the above question.

40|$|Abstract: In Kripke {{semantics}} for modal logic, “pos-sible world^ &quot; and {{the possibility}} relation are both primitive notions. This has both technical and con-ceptual shortcomings. From a technical point of view, the mathematics associated with Kripke. se-mantics is often quite complicated. From a concep-tual point of view, {{it is not clear}} how to use Kripke structures to model know!edge and belief, where one wants a clearer understanding of the notions that are primitive in Kripke semantics. We introduce modal structures as models for modal logic. We use the idea of possible worlds, but by directly describing the “internal semantics ” of each possible world. It is much easier to study the standard <b>logical</b> <b>questions,</b> such as completeness, decidability, and compactness, ushg modal structures. Furthermore, modal struc-tures offer a much more intuitive approach to mod-elling knowledge and belief. 1...|$|R

5000|$|White's early {{electronic}} art consisted mostly of gridded installations of light bulbs controlled by contemporary-vintage digital logic circuits. Like {{most of his}} art, these displays were concerned more with communicating internal rules and behaviours than simple visual appeal. For example, White's first major electronic work, [...] "First Tighten Up on the Drums" [...] (1969), generated shimmering light patterns through the unpredictable interaction of many interconnected circuits computing simple <b>logical</b> <b>questions</b> independently. The work illustrated how complex behaviours - for example, patterns akin to swirling clouds or rain on a window pane - can emerge from simple principles. In retrospect, White recognizes this first project as an early cellular automata experiment.
