One of the ILAs is input fed, {{and the other is}} electromagnetically coupled. The positioning of the gap affects the bandwidth. A dual-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs being input fed, and the other being coupled. This dual-band planar antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs. A triple-band planar antenna includes two ILAs facing each other across a gap with one of the ILAs being input fed and the other IPA being coupled. This triple-band antenna also includes a monopole antenna disposed between the two ILAs, and a conductor extending horizontally from the monopole antenna towards, but not reaching the coupled ILA. Another dual-band antenna includes an inner <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> antenna encompassed by an outer <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> antenna.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{procedure}} for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted by considering two-particle and triple unitarity cuts of the corresponding bubble and triangle integral functions. After choosing a specific parameterisation of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum we can uniquely identify the coefficients {{of the desired}} integral functions simply by examining the behaviour of the cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum approach infinity. In this way we can produce compact forms for scalar integral coefficients. Applications of this method are presented for both QCD and electroweak processes, including an alternative form for the recently computed three-mass triangle coefficient in the six-photon amplitude $A_ 6 (1 ^-, 2 ^+, 3 ^-, 4 ^+, 5 ^-, 6 ^+) $. The direct nature of this extraction procedure allows for a very straightforward automation of the procedure. Comment: 42 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

We show that our {{approach can be}} applied to most variants of the Cable Trench Problem (CTP) that have been considered in the literature. The proposed algorithm is augmented with a stabilization procedure to accelerate the convergence of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> and with a primal heuristic to derive high-quality primal solutions. Three different variants of the CTP are considered in a computational study which compares the Benders approach with two compact integer linear programming formulations that are solved with CPLEX. The obtained results show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the two compact models and that {{it can be used to}} tackle significantly larger instances than previously considered algorithms based on Lagrangean relaxation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{constructing}} one-loop amplitudes using a unitarity bootstrap approach we discuss a general systematic procedure for obtaining the coefficients of the scalar bubble and triangle integral functions of one-loop amplitudes. Coefficients are extracted after examining {{the behavior of the}} cut integrand as the unconstrained parameters of a specifically chosen parameterization of the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum approach infinity. Measurements of new physics at the forthcoming experimental program at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will require a precise understanding of processes at next-to-leading order (NLO). This places increased demands for the computation of new one-loop amplitudes. This in turn has spurred recent developments towards improved calculational techniques. Direct calculations using Feynman diagrams are in general inefficient. Developments of more efficient techniques have usually centered around unitarity techniques [1], where tree amplitudes are effectively 'glued' together to form loops. The most straightforward application of this method, in which the <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momentum is in D = 4, allows for the computation of 'cut-constructible' terms only, i. e. (poly) logarithmic containing terms and any related constants. QCD amplitudes contain, in addition to such terms, rational pieces which cannot be derived using such cuts. These 'missing' rational parts can be extracted using <b>cut</b> <b>loop</b> momenta in D = 4 - 2 {var_epsilon}. The greater difficulty of such calculations has restricted the application of this approach, although recent developments [3, 4] have provided new promise for this technique. Recently the application of on-shell recursion relations [5] to obtaining the 'missing' rational parts of one-loop processes [6] has provided an alternative very promising solution to this problem. In combination with unitarity methods an 'on-shell bootstrap' approach provides an efficient technique for computing complete one-loop QCD amplitudes [7]. Additionally other new methods have also proved fruitful for calculating rational terms [8]. Such developments have again refocused attention on the optimization of the derivation of the cut-constructable pieces of the amplitude. Deriving cut-constructible terms for any one-loop amplitude reduces to the computation of coefficients of a set of scalar bubble, scalar triangle and scalar box integral functions. Box coefficients may be found with very little work, directly from the quadruple cut of the relevant box function [9]. A unique box coefficient contributes to each distinct quadruple cut. Unfortunately triangle and bubble coefficients cannot be derived in quite so direct a manner. Multiple scalar integral coefficients appear inside a two-particle cut or triple cut. It is therefore necessary to disentangle the relevant bubble or triangle coefficients from any other coefficients sharing the same cut [1, 4, 10, 11]. The large number of NLO processes of interest for the LHC suggests that a completely automated computational procedure is highly desired. To this end we discuss, in this proceeding, a recently proposed method [12, 13] for the direct, efficient and systematic extraction of bubble and triangle coefficients which is well suited to automation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to compare and quantify the simulated effects of noise, index errors, and photometric level errors on four different optical monitoring layer termination strategies. A computer program to simulate optical thin film monitoring has been written for this work. These four termination methods are: photometric <b>cut</b> <b>level,</b> two types of turning point termination, and percent change from the extrema of the last maximum and minimum in the optical monitoring curve (POEM). The turning point termination algorithms which have been implemented are described briefly. A 4 -layer antireflection coating design has been simulated to find its possibilities and limitations, and to quantify the effects. The <b>level</b> <b>cut</b> strategy works well if the noise is low and the errors in index and photometric scale are small; however, systematic errors are a problem for <b>level</b> <b>cuts</b> {{in the presence of}} index and/or photometric scale errors. All of the other strategies are insensitive to index and/or photometric scale errors. It was found that two the turning point strategies work reasonably well from the turning point to points beyond that. The POEM strategy is robust and insensitive to errors when it is used beyond a ~ 5 % difference from the photometric level of the turning point...|$|R
