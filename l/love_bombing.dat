50|$|The key to {{understanding}} how <b>love</b> <b>bombing</b> differs from romantic courtship {{is to look at}} what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it’s probably not <b>love</b> <b>bombing.</b> That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the signs}} of <b>love</b> <b>bombing</b> in {{the start of a}} {{relationship}} is much attention in short time, and pressure for very rapid commitment. [...] It is often the first sign of narcissism, and if successful turns to control and degradation. [...] Psychologist Dale Archer identifies [...] "The Phases of Love Bombing: Idealization, Devaluation, Discard (Repeat)." [...] He advises: [...] "Stop, Look, and Listen" [...] to avoid <b>love</b> <b>bombing</b> and to break off contact with the abuser, if possible, and seek support from family and friends.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Love</b> <b>bombing</b> is {{an attempt}} to {{influence}} a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and can be used for either a positive or negative purpose. Members of the Unification Church of the United States (who reportedly coined the expression) use it to convey a genuine expression of friendship, fellowship, interest, or concern. Critics of cults use the phrase with the implication that the [...] "love" [...] is feigned and that the practice is psychological manipulation {{in order to create a}} feeling of unity within the group against a society perceived as hostile. Psychologists have identified <b>love</b> <b>bombing</b> as a part of a cycle of abuse and have warned against it. In 2011 clinical psychologist Oliver James advocated <b>love</b> <b>bombing</b> in his book Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat, as a means for parents to rectify emotional problems in their children.|$|E

50|$|As soon as any {{interest}} {{is shown by}} the recruits, they may be love bombed by the recruiter or other cult members. This process of feigning friendship and interest in the recruit was originally associated {{with one of the}} early youth cults, but soon it was taken up by a number of groups as part of their program for luring people in. <b>Love</b> <b>bombing</b> is a coordinated effort, usually under the direction of leadership, that involves long-term members' flooding recruits and newer members with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark. <b>Love</b> <b>bombing</b> - or the offer of instant companionship - is a deceptive ploy accounting for many successful recruitment drives.|$|E

5000|$|The Cult Information Centre {{believes}} that the most striking features of post-war religious cults includes the usage of mind control techniques, and strict adherence to a leader or tight-knit leadership structure. [...] This high level of adherence helps to reinforce authority, as well as belief in the leader's doctrine, which may involve his own personal delusions. [...] The organisation cites twenty-six key forms of mind control, which includes hypnosis, peer pressure and groupthink, <b>love</b> <b>bombing,</b> the rejection of old values, confusing doctrine, use of subliminal messages, time-sense inhibition, dress codes, disinhibition, diet, confession, fear, and chanting and singing.|$|E
