40|$|The task of {{converting}} SINDA finite difference thermal model temperature results into NASTRAN {{finite element model}} thermal loads can be very labor intensive {{if there is not}} one node-to-one element, or systematic node-to-element. correlation between models. This paper describes the SINDA-NASTRAN Interfacing Program (SNIP), a FORTRAN computer code that generates NASTRAN structural model thermal <b>load</b> <b>cards</b> given by SINDA (or similar thermal model) temperature results and thermal model geometric data. SNIP generates NASTRAN thermal <b>load</b> <b>cards</b> for NASTRAN plate, shell, bar, and beam elements. The paper describes the interfacing procedures used by SNIP, and discusses set-up and operation of the program. Sample cases are included to demonstrate use of the program and show its performance under a variety of conditions. SNIP can provide structural model thermal loads that accurately reflect thermal model results while reducing the time required to interface thermal and structural models when compared to other methods...|$|E

40|$|The SNIP {{program is}} a FORTRAN {{computer}} code that generates NASTRAN structural model thermal loads when given SINDA (or similar thermal model) temperature results. SNIP correlates thermal nodes to structural elements to interface SINDA finite difference thermal models with NASTRAN finite element structural models. Node-to-element correlation includes determining which SINDA nodes should be related to each NASTRAN element and calculating a weighing factor for temperatures associated with each element-related thermal node. SNIP provides structural model thermal loads that accurately reflect thermal model results while reducing {{the time required to}} interface thermal and structural models as compared to other methods. SNIP uses thermal model geometry to search the three-dimensional space around each structural element for the nearest thermal nodes. Thermal model geometry is the combination of standard thermal model temperature results from SINDA and structural model geometry from NASTRAN. Thermal and structural models must both be defined in the same, single Cartesian coordinate system. The thermal nodes located nearest each element are used to determine element temperature for thermal distortion and stress analysis. The program shapes the three-dimensional search region while the user controls the size. With these region specifications, the numerical coding of thermal nodes, and the structural element numbers; the code can provide for the separation of substructures during correlation. The input to SNIP contains a file of thermal model temperature results and a physical location of each thermal node in three-dimensional space, combined in a SNIP-unique format. The input also contains a standard NASTRAN input deck for a model made up of plate, shell, beam, and bar elements. SNIP supports the CTRIA, CQUAD, CBAR, and CBEAM elements of NASTRAN. The user adjusts the input parameters in the source code which control the node-to-element correlation. The program outputs NASTRAN element temperature <b>load</b> <b>cards</b> for each element and NASTRAN case control cards for each temperature load set. SNIP also outputs a list of elements that contains the numbers of the SINDA nodes related to each NASTRAN element and the weight that is given to each node in temperature calculations. SNIP is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77. The PC version requires a PC FORTRAN compiler and has compiled successfully using Lahey FORTRAN v. 3. 0. A core memory of 300 k is recommended. The program was developed in 1987...|$|E

50|$|To {{purchase}} an IDS BK travelcard the customer needs a smartcard accepted by IDS BK operators. These are smartcards issued by DPB, Slovak Lines and Železničná spoločnosť Slovensko, a student card issued by selected Slovak {{schools and universities}} as well as Bratislavská mestská karta which is a Maestro PayPass card issued only to residents of Bratislava by participating banks. Customer can then load a travelcard at ticket offices of participating operators, some DPB ticket machines or via websites of IDS BK operators. Online purchase is only available {{at least one day}} before {{the first day of the}} travelcard validity - this is to ensure enough time for all operators' control devices (such as regional bus cash registers, or train conductor's control devices) to synchronize data about online tickets. Such synchronization is necessary since online tickets are not physically loaded into smartcard's chip when purchased. Instead, all control devices have database of tickets purchased online and compare <b>loaded</b> <b>card's</b> ID with this database.
