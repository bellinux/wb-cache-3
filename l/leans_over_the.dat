5|$|Yabuhara hires Hanada to kill four men, {{the first}} three being a customs officer, an ocularist and a {{jewellery}} dealer. Hanada snipes the first from behind a billboard's animatronic cigarette lighter, shoots the second from a basement up through a pipe drain when the latter <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sink and, ordered to finish quickly, blasts {{his way into the}} third's office and escapes on an advertising balloon. Misako then appears at his door and offers him a nearly impossible contract to kill a foreigner, which he cannot refuse having just been told the plan.|$|E
2500|$|... 20. Finale. The {{final section}} {{begins with a}} soft woodwind chord {{followed}} by harp arpeggios with a wordless choral accompaniment à bouches fermées (similar to the [...] "Humming Chorus" [...] from Puccini's later opera, Madama Butterfly) which repeats the theme from Pâle et blonde. Ophélie sings: Le voilà! Je crois l'entendre! – [...] "There he is! I think I hear him!". As she <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> water, holding onto {{the branches of a}} willow [...] with one hand, and brushing aside the rushes with the other, she repeats some of the words and the melody (Theme of Hamlet's Love) from her love duet with Hamlet in act 1 (Ophélie: Doute de la lumière – [...] "Doubt that the light illumines"). One sees her momentarily floating in her white gown, as the current carries her away. (The action follows Gertrude's description of Ophelia's death in Shakespeare's act 4, scene 7.) ...|$|E

6000|$|He didn’t think o’ nothing better, and {{one night}} just as we was making the Channel ’e tried ’is plan. He was in the second mate’s watch, and by-and-by ’e <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> wheel and says to ’im in a low voice, [...] "This is my last v’y’ge, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|But his harrowed {{mind and}} {{exhausted}} body no longer allowed him even anxiety. Weak, yet excited, his senses fled; and when Arundel Dacre returned {{in the evening}} he found his friend delirious. He sat by his bed for hours. Suddenly the Duke speaks. Arundel Dacre rises: he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sufferer's couch.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{have any}} vocation, {{it is the}} making of verse. When I [...] take my pen for that, the world opens itself ungrudgingly [...] before me; {{everything}} seems clear and easy, as it seems [...] sinking to the bottom could be as one <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> edge of [...] his boat {{in one of those}} dear coves at Fresh Pond.... My [...] true place is to serve the cause as a poet. Then my heart [...] leaps before me into the conflict." ...|$|E

60|$|On the {{way home}} this urchin's sole delight was to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bow and watch the fish and coral-groves over which they skimmed. In this he was imitated by Nigel who, ungallantly {{permitting}} his companion to row, also <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> side and gazed down into the clear crystal depths with unwearying delight.|$|R
60|$|Ruff <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{motionless}} body, {{looked into}} its face, and nodded.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> table {{toward me}} with an evident desire to make himself {{perfectly}} understood. [...] "I find myself like some creature that is taken out of its shell--soft and new. I was trained to dress in a certain way, to behave in a certain way, to think in a certain way; I see now it's all wrong and narrow--most of it anyhow--a system of class shibboleths. We were decent {{to each other in}} order to be a gang {{to the rest of the}} world. Gentlemen indeed! But it's perplexing------" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These men wouldn't stick at much," [...] he {{told his}} companion. [...] "They're hand in glove with the {{authorities}} here. Anything they did would be hushed up {{in the name of}} the law. These things are never allowed to come out. It doesn't do any one any good to have them gossiped about. If they caught Sidney and shot him, we should never make a protest. It's all part of the game, you know. Now that is the spot I want you to stop at, exactly where the mimosa tree <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> path. But first of all, I'd turn out your head-light." ...|$|E
6000|$|Let us {{change the}} scene now. We are out upon the sea--in a {{floating}} palace. And oh how that palace rushes onward, ever onward, without rest, without check, night and day, cleaving its way irresistibly through the mighty deep. Mighty! Ah! how mighty {{no one on}} board can tell so well as that thin, gentle, evidently dying youth who <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stern watching the screws and the [...] "wake" [...] that seems to rush behind, marking off, as it were mile by mile, the vast and ever-increasing space--never to be re-traversed he knows full well--that separates him from home and all that is dear to him on earth.|$|E

60|$|Perhaps {{there is}} nothing more lovely than the love of two {{beautiful}} women, who are not envious of each other's charms. How delightfully they impart to each other the pattern of a cap, or flounce, or frill! how charmingly they entrust some slight, slender secret about tinting a flower or netting a purse! Now one <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> other, and guides her inexperienced hand, as it moves in the mysteries of some novel work, and then the other looks up with an eye beaming with devotion; and then again the first leans down a little lower, and gently presses her aromatic lips upon her friend's polished forehead.|$|E
6000|$|LIFE. The briefest {{outline of}} Donne's life shows its intense human interest. He {{was born in}} London, {{the son of a}} rich iron merchant, at the time when the merchants of England were {{creating}} a new and higher kind of princes. On his father's side he came from an old Welsh family, and on his mother's side from the Heywoods and Sir Thomas More's family. Both families were Catholic, and in his early life persecution was brought near; for his brother died in prison for harboring a proscribed priest, and his own education could not be continued in Oxford and Cambridge because of his religion. Such an experience generally sets a man's religious standards for life; but presently Donne, as he studied law at Lincoln's Inn, was investigating the philosophic grounds of all faith. Gradually he left the church in which he was born, renounced all denominations, and called himself simply Christian. Meanwhile he wrote poetry and shared his wealth with needy Catholic relatives. He joined the expedition of Essex for Cadiz in 1596, and for the Azores in 1597, and on sea and in camp found time to write poetry. Two of his best poems, [...] "The Storm" [...] and [...] "The Calm," [...] belong to this period. Next he traveled in Europe for three years, but occupied himself with study and poetry. Returning home, he became secretary to Lord Egerton, {{fell in love with the}} latter's young niece, Anne More, and married her; for which cause Donne was cast into prison. Strangely enough his poetical work at this time is not a song of youthful romance, but [...] "The Progress of the Soul," [...] a study of transmigration. Years of wandering and poverty followed, until Sir George More forgave the young lovers and made an allowance to his daughter. Instead of enjoying his new comforts, Donne grew more ascetic and intellectual in his tastes. He refused also the nattering offer of entering the Church of England and of receiving a comfortable [...] "living." [...] By his [...] "Pseudo Martyr" [...] he attracted the favor of James I, who persuaded him to be ordained, yet left him without any place or employment. When his wife died her allowance ceased, and Donne was left with seven children in extreme poverty. Then he became a preacher, rose rapidly by sheer intellectual force and genius, and in four years was the greatest of English preachers and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. There he [...] "carried some to heaven in holy raptures and led others to amend their lives," [...] and as he <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pulpit with intense earnestness is likened by Izaak Walton to [...] "an angel leaning from a cloud." ...|$|E
