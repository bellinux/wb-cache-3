5|$|In 2006, renewed {{criticism}} regarding current Premier Jean Charest's {{limited use}} of the apartment led to another proposal for a proper official residence. Charest, who heads a family of five and lives in Montreal, saw <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> move them across the province. These proposal were never taken further, and Charest's successor, Pauline Marois, made regular {{use of the}} apartment.|$|E
5|$|Plesiorycteropus {{is known}} {{from a number}} of subfossil bones, {{comparable}} to coverage of some of the poorly known subfossil lemurs, such as Daubentonia robusta. The material includes several skulls, all of which are missing the facial bones, complete long bones such as the femur and humerus (upper arm bone), and other bones, but some elements are still unknown, including most of the skeleton of the hand and foot. There is <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> assume it was similar in general form to the aardvark. No teeth or jaws referable to Plesiorycteropus have been found, and it is generally assumed that the animal was toothless.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} were similarly well received. Bob Mackey of 1UP.com and Martin Robinson of Eurogamer called them believable and {{easy for the}} player to care about. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas was satisfied by development of each character, while Mike Manson of Nintendo Life considered each characters' motives to be unique and interesting. In contrast, Boosinger found the characters to be uncompelling and poorly written, and believed that there was <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> care for them until their backstories were revealed.|$|E

5|$|Following his triumph, Germanicus {{was sent}} to Asia to reorganize the provinces and kingdoms of Asia, which were in such disarray that the {{attention}} of a domus Augusta was deemed necessary to settle matters. Germanicus was given imperium maius (extraordinary command) over the other governors and commanders of the area he was to operate; however, Tiberius had replaced the governor of Syria with Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was meant to be his helper (adiutor), but turned out to be hostile. According to Tacitus, this was an attempt to separate Germanicus from his familiar troops and weaken his influence, but the historian Richard Alston says Tiberius had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> undermine his heir.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun's father, Patrick Calhoun, {{helped shape}} his son's {{political}} views. He was a staunch supporter of slavery who taught his son that social standing depended not merely on {{a commitment to}} the ideal of popular self-government but also on the ownership of a substantial number of slaves. Flourishing {{in a world in which}} slaveholding was a hallmark of civilization, Calhoun saw <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> question its morality as an adult. He further believed that slavery instilled in the remaining whites a code of honor that blunted the disruptive potential of private gain and fostered the civic-mindedness that lay near the core of the republican creed. From such a standpoint, the expansion of slavery decreased the likelihood for social conflict and postponed the declension when money would become the only measure of self-worth, as had happened in New England. Calhoun was thus firmly convinced that slavery was the key to the success of the American dream.|$|E
5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries {{early on in the}} 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into the stands and Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E

5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> keep Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990 Ryzhkov {{suffered}} a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers {{and replaced it with}} the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov's hospitalisation and Pavlov's election as Prime Minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government's hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough's view that Gorbachev had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were good reasons to replace him given that with Ryzhkov's Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.|$|E

The last recorded funeral carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish (1868–1941), buried on 11 April 1941. The SR offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR's fast and frequent services to their own Brookwood railway station. The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which bona fide mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57am service to Brookwood (the SR service closest to the LNC's traditional departure time), but the SR management (themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage) refused to entertain any compromise.|$|E

5|$|The Southern Railway (SR), {{which had}} absorbed the LSWR in 1923, offered the LNC the {{temporary}} use of Waterloo station {{to allow the}} Necropolis Railway service to be continued, but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling {{to and from the}} cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day, meaning those visiting the cemetery had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> choose the LNC's irregular and infrequent trains to the cemetery stations over the SR's fast and frequent services to Brookwood.

In September 1945, following the end of hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, the branch line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E

Likewise, broadcasters had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> develop color programming when households lacked color TVs. RCA won the battle in two ways. It flooded the market with low cost black-and-white TVs incompatible with the CBS format but compatible with its own. Broadcasters then needed to use the RCA format to reach established viewers. RCA also subsidized Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, which gave consumers reason to buy the new technology.|$|E

25|$|While Becquerel was {{interested}} primarily in conducting scientific research into fluorescence, Thomas Edison briefly pursued fluorescent lighting for its commercial potential. He invented a fluorescent lamp in 1896 that used a coating of calcium tungstate as the fluorescing substance, excited by X-rays, but although it received a patent in 1907, {{it was not}} put into production. As with a few other attempts to use Geissler tubes for illumination, it had a short operating life, and given {{the success of the}} incandescent light, Edison had <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> pursue an alternative means of electrical illumination.

25|$|In his {{majority}} opinion, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes considered {{whether any}} of the three clauses of the California law, were, as the applicant alleged, a violation of her constitutionally-protected rights.

The Court found <b>little</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> question the validity of the second and third clauses of the statute as they pertain to such prohibited forms of expression, and concentrated instead on the first clause.|$|E
