50|$|The area {{of devastation}} covered about eight square miles. Inside this area, the {{annihilation}} {{of life and}} property was total; outside was a second, clearly defined zone where there were casualties, but the material damage was less, while beyond this <b>lay</b> a <b>strip</b> <b>in</b> which vegetation was scorched but life was spared.|$|R
60|$|The {{moon was}} {{rounding}} the southern {{side of the}} house. Her paling beams streamed through the nearer windows, and <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> long <b>strips</b> of slanting light on the marble pavement of the Hall. The black shadows of the pediments between each window, alternating with the strips of light, heightened the wan glare of the moonshine on the floor. Toward its lower end, the Hall melted mysteriously into darkness. The ceiling was lost to view; the yawning fire-place, the overhanging mantel-piece, the long row of battle pictures above, were all swallowed up in night. But one visible object was discernible, besides the gleaming windows and the moon-striped floor. Midway in the last and furthest of the strips of light, the tripod rose erect on its gaunt black legs, like a monster called to life by the moon--a monster rising through the light, and melting invisibly into the upper shadows of the Hall. Far and near, all sound <b>lay</b> dead, drowned <b>in</b> the stagnant cold. The soothing hush of night was awful here. The deep abysses of darkness hid abysses of silence more immeasurable still.|$|R
60|$|Anthea Merril made no answer, but {{a slight}} flush crept into her cheek. She was very human, {{and it was}} in one sense an eloquent compliment. Then Jimmy went forward to haul the {{staysail}} down, though he found he had to do it with one hand, and he was kept busy until he went down with Valentine into the little forecastle, when the Sorata <b>lay</b> snug <b>in</b> a <b>strip</b> of still green water close beneath the dusky pines. Louis had just gone ashore with the dory to gather bark for fuel, and, for the scuttle was open, they could hear the splash of his oars through the deep stillness that was emphasized by the murmur of falling water. Valentine sat on a locker with the lamplight on his bronzed face, which was a trifle grave.|$|R
60|$|The {{spot where}} Merton and Lady Bude were seated was {{beautiful}} indeed. They reclined {{on the short}} sea grass above a shore where long tresses of saffron-hued seaweed clothed the boulders, and the bright sea pinks blossomed. On their right the Skrae, now clearer than amber, mingled its waters with the sea loch. On their left was a steep bank clad with bracken, climbing up to perpendicular cliffs of basalt. These ended abruptly above the valley and the cove, and permitted {{a view of the}} Atlantic, in which, far away, the isle of the Lewis lay like a golden shield in the faint haze of the early sunset. On {{the other side of the}} sea loch, whose restless waters ever rushed in or out like a rapid river, with the change of tides, was a small village of white thatched cottages, the homes of fishermen and crofters. The neat crofts <b>lay</b> behind, <b>in</b> oblong <b>strips,</b> on the side of the hill. Such was the scene of a character common on the remote west coast of Sutherland.|$|R

5000|$|Indie Rock Pete (later {{found to}} be named [...] "Peter Gaylord Weiner", much to his disdain <b>in</b> <b>strip</b> #1241), a poseur obsessed {{with the idea of}} {{maintaining}} a facade of indie cred. Attempts to manipulate the other characters, but usually fails. Pete works as a substitute high school teacher, and developed a crush on Frieda Berger, one of his students before finding out she was in high school. Introduced <b>in</b> <b>strip</b> #2. Apparently killed by gunshot to the head <b>in</b> <b>strip</b> #2307, but the strip's title ("not cannon"), may be a hint that it is not real, as is his appearances <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> after the incident #2309 anon.|$|R
60|$|The glory {{therefore}} of {{the temple}} <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> one thing, and the glory of this house <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> another: the glory {{of the temple}} <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> that she contained the true form and modes of worship, and {{the glory of the}} house of the forest of Lebanon <b>lay</b> <b>in</b> her many pillars and thick beams, by which she was made capable, through good management, to give check to those of Damascus when they should attempt to throw down that worship.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} new {{results on}} the growth and zeros of the Ruelle zeta function for the Julia set of a hyperbolic expanding rational map. It is shown that the zeta function is bounded by exp(CK jsj) <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> jRe sj K, where is the dimension of the Julia set. This leads to bounds {{on the number of}} zeros <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> (interpreted as the Pollicott-Ruelle resonances of this dynamical system). An upper bound on the number of zeros in poly-nomial regions fjRe sj jIm sjg is given, followed by weaker lower bound estimates <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> fRe s> C; jIm sj rg, and logarithmic neighbourhoods fjRe sj log jIm sjg. Recent numerical work of Strain-Zworski suggests the upper bounds <b>in</b> <b>strips</b> are optimal. 1...|$|R
