They placed charges under a {{railroad}} track and blew up a passing train. The Barb also conducted several rocket attacks against shore targets on this same patrol, the first ever by an American submarine. They used 5-inch unguided rockets fired from a special <b>launching</b> <b>rack</b> on the main deck.|$|E

50|$|The Rap {{was ordered}} from Thornycroft {{shipbuilding}} company, England, in either 1872 or 1873, and was built at Thornycrofts shipyard at Church Wharf in Chiswick on the River Thames. Managing {{a speed of}} 14.5 kn, {{she was one of}} the fastest boats afloat when completed. The Norwegians initially planned to arm her with a spar torpedo, but this may never have been fitted. Rap was briefly used for experiments with a towed torpedo before finally being outfitted with <b>launch</b> <b>racks</b> for the new self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes in 1879. Her initial commanding officer was First Lieutenant Koren, who also designed the torpedo racks.|$|R
50|$|The front {{loading door}} was welded shut and an {{additional}} deck installed above the tank storage bay to provide a mounting for the rocket <b>launching</b> <b>racks.</b> The resulting storage space below the deck (formerly the tank deck) {{was used as a}} magazine for storage of rockets, with up to 5,000 being able to be carried. The craft was also fitted with a Type 970 radar set whose primary use was for rangefinding, but was also successfully used for navigation. Generally propulsion was provided by Paxman diesel engines, however, others were used due to availability. Some U.S. craft were fitted with petrol (gasoline) engines.|$|R
50|$|The primary anti-ship {{armament}} was {{two to four}} Mark 8 torpedoes, which weighed 2600 lb {{and contained}} a 466 lb TNT warhead. These torpedoes were launched by Mark 18 21 in steel torpedo tubes. Mark 8 torpedoes had a range of 16000 yd at 36 knots mph. These torpedoes and tubes were replaced in mid-1943 by four lightweight 22.5 in Mark 13 torpedoes, which weighed 2216 lb and contained a 600 lb Torpex-filled warhead. These torpedoes were carried on lightweight Mark 1 roll-off style torpedo <b>launching</b> <b>racks.</b> The Mk13 torpedo had a range of 6300 yd and a speed of 33.5 knots mph.|$|R
50|$|Hubbard always {{claimed that}} his ideas of Dianetics {{originated}} in the 1920s and 1930s. By his own account, LRH had been injured by the premature detonation of a primer mechanism on a small depth charge that had become stuck in the <b>launch</b> <b>rack</b> aboard the navy ship {{he was assigned to}} in 1941. His injuries were mainly flash burns to his eyes and so was despatched ashore and he {{spent a great deal of}} his recovery time in the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital's library, (despite claiming in his authorised biography that he was blinded). LRH encountered the work of Thompson, Korzybski, Jung, Freud, Perls and other psychoanalysts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{deployment}} {{was designed}} to initially supplement and then replace gun batteries deployed around the nation's major urban areas and vital military installations. The defense areas consisted of major cities and selected United States Air Force Strategic Air Command bases which were deemed vital to national defense. The original basing strategy projected a central missile assembly point from which missiles would be taken out to prepared above-ground <b>launch</b> <b>racks</b> ringing the defended area. However, the Army discarded this semimobile concept because the system needed {{to be ready for}} instantaneous action to fend off a [...] "surprise attack." [...] Instead, a fixed-site scheme was devised.|$|R
50|$|Related to the Chinese Fire Arrow, Bang Fai {{are made}} from bamboo bongs. Most {{contemporary}} ones, however, are enclosed in pvc piping, making them less dangerous by standardizing their sizes and black-powder charges (which contest rules require be compounded by the rocketeers, themselves). Baking or boiling a bong kills insect eggs that otherwise hatch in dead bamboo and eat it, inside out. Skipping this step may cause the bong to disintegrate and melt the PVC piping. Vines tie long bamboo tails to <b>launching</b> <b>racks.</b> The {{time it takes for}} the exhaust to burn through the vines (usually) allows a motor to build up to full thrust; then the tails impart in-flight stability. Ignition comes from a burning fuse or electric match.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, a few PT {{boats were}} {{equipped}} to carry naval mines <b>launched</b> from mine <b>racks,</b> {{but these were}} not commonly used.|$|R
5000|$|One solution, {{implemented}} in 1943, was to replace {{each of the}} PT Boat's two to four Mark 8 torpedoes, and their Mark 18 torpedo tubes, with the significantly lighter Mark 13, carried in lightweight Mark 1 <b>launching</b> <b>racks,</b> at a total savings of more than 1400 lb each. The shorter Mark 13 also took up less deck space. The racks {{took advantage of the}} Mark 13's air-drop capability by simply allowing the torpedoes to roll over the side, eliminating the risks of a [...] "hot run" [...] within the tube and the flare of burning grease that sometimes gave away the PT Boat's position upon firing. The Mark 13 also had the advantage of a significantly larger warhead (600 lb vs. 466 lb), containing the significantly more powerful explosive Torpex, which was approximately 1.5 times more powerful per pound than TNT. [...] The Mark 13's shorter range and slower speed were considered acceptable tradeoffs for boats that usually operated at night and relied on stealth to reach firing position.|$|R
50|$|In China {{and other}} parts of Asia, fire arrows were thick, dartlike, rocket-propelled {{incendiary}} projectiles with barbed points, wrapped with pitch-soaked canvas which took fire when the rocket was launched, which could either be from special <b>launching</b> <b>racks</b> or from a cannon barrel (see Chongtong, B≈ç hiya.) The point stuck in sails, hulls or spars and set fire to the enemy ship. In Western naval warfare, shore forts sometimes heated iron shot red-hot in a special furnace before loading it (with water-soaked wads to prevent it from setting off the powder charge prematurely.) The hot shot lodging in a ship's dry timbers would set the ship afire. Because of the danger of fire aboard (and the difficulty of heating and transporting the red-hot shot aboard ship), heated shot was seldom used from ship-mounted cannon, as the danger to your own vessels was almost as great as to the enemy; fire was the single greatest fear of all men sailing in wooden ships. As such, for men aboard these vessels, going up against shore artillery firing heated shot was a terrifying experience, and typically wooden fleets were not expected to brave such fire except in cases of great emergency, as a single heated shot could easily destroy the entire ship and crew, while the same ship could typically be expected to survive numerous hits from normal solid shot.|$|R
50|$|In {{and around}} the harbor there are 15 marinas, 13 private clubs with boating facilities, and 5 {{commercial}} port facilities. There are more than 1800 berthing spaces and more than 500 harbor mooring locations.About 800 boats may be <b>launched</b> from storage <b>racks</b> at marinas and clubsas well as via the city maintained launching ramp in Veterans Park.More than 2700 commercial vessel trips {{to and from the}} harbor occur each year.The main harbor channel is small enough to restrict the size ofvessels that could attempt to use it. In 2001 waterborne commerce in the harbor totaled 512000 ST. Typical freight included fuel oil, sand, gravel, stone, and shellfish (particularly oysters and lobsters).|$|R
500|$|The obliquely-mounted {{fuselage}} cannon {{were thought}} to be too difficult to aim and {{were not included in the}} prototype; the weight savings allowed the ammunition for the four 23mm Shpital'nyy Sh-3 wing-mounted guns to be increased to 900 rounds. One additional innovation in the prototype was that they could be adjusted on the ground to fire at a 23¬∞ downward angle in addition to the normal level position. The dorsal gunner also fired a Sh-3 gun, which was mounted in a separate, remotely controlled, Il-VU-11 turret that could traverse through 180¬∞ and elevated to a maximum of 80¬∞.

40|$|The {{goals of}} space biology {{research}} {{to be conducted}} aboard the Space Station in 1990 s include long-term studies of reproduction, development, growth, physiology, behavior, and aging in both animals and plants.

5000|$|The {{adoption}} of the 21 cm Nebelwerfer-derived Werfer-Granate 21 (Wfr. Gr. 21) rocket mortar by the Luftwaffe in mid-August 1943 promised {{the introduction of a}} major [...] "stand-off" [...] style of offensive weapon - one strut-mounted tubular launcher was fixed under each wing panel on the Luftwaffe's single-engine fighters, and two under each wing panel of a few twin-engine Bf 110 daylight Zerst√∂rer aircraft. However, due to the slow 715 mph velocity and characteristic ballistic drop of the fired rocket (despite the usual mounting of the launcher at about 15¬∞ upward orientation), and the small number of fighters fitted with the weapons, the Wfr. Gr. 21 never had a major effect on the combat box formations of Fortresses. The Luftwaffe also fitted heavy-calibre Bordkanone-series 37, 50 and even 75 mm cannon as anti-bomber weapons on twin-engine aircraft such as the special Ju 88P fighters, as well as one model of the Me 410 Hornisse but these measures did not have much effect on the American strategic bomber offensive. The Me 262, however, had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war.

40|$|NASA Ames Research Center is {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} Space Station Biological Research Project (SSBRP) which will support non-human life sciences research on the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA). The SSBRP is designed to support both basic research to understand the effect of altered gravity fields on biological systems and applied research to investigate the effects of space flight on biological systems. The SSBRP will provide the necessary habitats to support avian and reptile eggs, cells and tissues, plants and rodents. In addition a habitat to support aquatic specimens will be provided by our international partners. Habitats will be mounted in ISSA compatible racks at u-g and will also be mounted on a 2. 5 m diameter centrifuge except for the egg incubator which has an internal centrifuge. The 2. 5 m centrifuge will provide artificial gravity levels over the range of 0. 01 G to 2 G. The current schedule is to <b>launch</b> the first <b>rack</b> in 1999, the Life Sciences glovebox and a second rack early in 2001, a 4 habitat 2. 5 in centrifuge later the same year in its own module, and to upgrade the centrifuge to 8 habitats in 2004. The rodent habitats will be derived from the Advanced Animal Habitat currently under development for the Shuttle program and will be capable of housing either rats or mice individually or in groups (6 rats/group and at least 12 mice/group). The egg incubator will be an upgraded Avian Development Facility also developed for the Shuttle program through a Small Business and Innovative Research grant. The Space Tissue Loss cell culture apparatus, developed by Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, is being considered for the cell and tissue culture habitat. The Life Sciences Glovebox is crucial to all life sciences experiments for specimen manipulation and performance of science procedures. It will provide two levels of containment between the work volume and the crew through the use of seals and negative pressure. The glovebox will accommodate use by two crew persons simultaneously and the capability for real time video down-link and data acquisition. In house testbeds and Phase B studies of the centrifuge validated the concepts of vibration isolation and autobalancing systems to meet the ISSA microgravity requirements. The vibration isolation system is effective above the centrifuge rotation frequency while the autobalancing system on the rotor removes vibration at and below the rotation rate. Torque of the Station, induced by spin-up/spindown of the centrifuge, can be minimized by controlling spin-up/spin-down rates. The SSBRP and ISSA will provide the opportunity to perform long-term, repeatable and high quality science. The long duration increments available on the Station will permit multigeneration studies of both plants and animals which have not previously been possible. The u-g habitat racks and the eight habitat centrifuge will accommodate sufficient number of specimens to permit statistically significant sampling of specimens to investigate the time course of adaptation to altered gravity environments. The centrifuge will, for the first time, permit investigators to use gravity itself as a tool to investigate fundamental processes, to investigate the intensity and duration of gravity to maintain normal structure and function, to separate the effects of u-g from other environmental factors and to examine artificial gravity as a potential countermeasure for the physical deconditioning observed during space flight...|$|R
