These measurements were made using standard electrophysiological technique. Simultaneously, the relative cross-sectional area of the fibers was determined. Lattice plane spacings and hence unit-cell volumes were determined by low-angle x-ray diffraction. At a sarcomere length at which the myosin filaments and actin filaments nominally do not overlap, measurements of potential, relative cross-sectional area, and unit-cell volume were used in conjunction with Donnan equilibrium theory to calculate the effective <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities</b> along the myosin filament (6. 6 X 10 (4) e-/mu) and actin filament (6. 8 X 10 (3) e-/mu).

A method of approximate uniformly valid solutions for the Green function equation for the eigenfunctions of polymer density distributions is developed to rationalize the critical adsorption conditions.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the charge density of polyelectrolytes on the growth of polyelectrolyte multilayers via layer-by-layer self-assembly from pure aqueous solutions was studied. Multilayers were built from strong polyanions, namely poly(styrenesulfonate) and an exfoliated synthetic hectorite, and cationic copolymers of diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) with N-methyl-N-vinylformamide (NMVF) for which the composition and thus the charge density was varied systematically. The analysis of the system {cationic copolymer/poly(styrenesulfonate) } reveals that a critical <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> c of 0. 036 elementary charge/Å of contour length is necessary to obtain Stable multilayer growth in pure water.

Beside classical methods to investigate polymer/surfactant systems, we applied, {{for the first}} time concerning these systems, the analogy between the small angle neutron scattering by foams and the neutron reflectivity of films to measure in situ film thicknesses of foams. CTAB/pectin foam films are much thicker than that of the pure surfactant foam film but similar for highly and lowly charged pectin/CTAB systems despite the difference in structure of complexes at interfaces. The improvement of the foam properties of CTAB bound to pectin is shown to be directly related to the formation of pectin-CTAB complexes at the air-water interface. However, in opposition to surface activity, there is no specific behavior for the highly charged pectin: foam properties depend mainly upon the bulk charge concentration, while the interfacial behavior is mainly governed by the <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> of pectin. For the highly charged pectin, specific cooperative effects between neighboring charged sites along the chain are thought {{to be involved in the}} higher surface activity of pectin/CTAB complexes.

40|$|A simple {{statistical}} mechanical {{approach is}} applied to calculate {{the profile of the}} density of the number of particles and the profile of the electrostatic potential of an electric double layer formed by a charged cylindrical surface in contact with electrolyte solution. The finite size of particles constituting the electrolyte solution is considered by including the excluded volume effect within the lattice statistics while the electrostatic interactions are considered by means of the mean electrostatic field. It is shown that the excluded volume effect decreases the density of the number of counterions and increases the electrostatic potential near the charged cylindrical surface. The effect is more pronounced for high area <b>densities</b> of <b>charge</b> of the charged surface and for larger counterions. Further, it is shown that the ratio between the density of the number of the counterions near the charged cylindrical surface and the density of the number of counterions far from the charged surface reaches a plateau at large <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities</b> for ions of finite size, while no plateau is reached for dimensionless ions.

40|$|The {{complexation}} of macroions or charged micelles and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes was {{studied by}} the use of Monte-Carlo simulations and mean field calculations. The Monte-Carlo simulations were performed on a simple model system with the emphasis on the electrostatic interaction, (i) polyelectrolyte rigidity, (ii) polyelectrolyte <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> (iii) surfactant tail length, and (iv) the polyelectrolyte concentration. Structural data for all simulations and thermodynamic quantities of the complexation for (i) to (iii) was obtained from the Monte Carlo simulation technique and thermodynamic integration. The ratio of the critical aggregation concentration, cac, and the critical micellization concentration, cmc, was calculated for (i) to (iii), cac being the lowest surfactant concentration at which the surfactants self-assemble. The largest reduction of the cmc occurred for the highest polyelectrolyte flexibility, largest <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>density,</b> and longest surfactant tail. The complexation is caused by the strong attractive electrostatic interaction between the micelle and the polyelectrolyte and is manifested by a decrease of the electrostatic energy due to small micelle-polyelectrolyte charge separations and an increase of the entropy due to the release of the counterions of the macroions. The simulations at various polyelectrolyte concentrations (iv) showed that for flexible and highly charged polyelectrolytes a tight complex, containing one macroion and one polyelectrolyte was formed at all polyelectrolyte concentrations considered. However, for flexible but lower charged polyelectrolytes, a looser macroion-polyelectrolyte complex was established, and the complex involved two polyelectrolytes when two or more polyelectrolytes were available.

40|$|Polyelectrolytes are {{polymers}} bearing ionisable groups, which, in polar solvents, can dissociate into charged polymer chains (polyelectrolytes) {{and small}} counterions. In aqueous solutions, polyelectrolytes interact strongly with other macroions {{and in particular}} they tend to associate with objects of opposite charge and form complexes. Nearly all industrial and biological process involves solutions of charged macromolecules, i. e., paint, detergents, drug delivery, and cosmetics, but also many diseases are associated with malfunctions at the colloidal level. The complexation between one linear flexible polyelectrolyte and one or several oppositely charged macroions was examined by employing a simple model system with focus on the electrostatic interactions. The composition {{and the structure of}} the complex as well as conformational data of the polyelectrolyte were obtained by using Monte Carlo simulations. The binding isotherms obtained are Langmuir-like, and in excess of macroions the polyelectrolyte-macroion complex displays a charge reversal. These properties were investigated at different <b>linear</b> <b>charge</b> <b>densities,</b> different lengths, and flexibilities of the polyelectrolyte, and different macroion charges, all at different numbers of macroions at constant volume. The effect of adding simple 1 : 1 salt has also been investigated. The complexation, phase separation, and redissolution of concentrated polyelectrolyte-macroion solutions have also been examined. As oppositely charged polyelectrolytes were added, the stable macroion solution with repelling macroions became successively less stable. The strong electrostatic attraction brought macroions and polyelectrolytes closely together and slightly before macromolecular charge equivalence, distinct and repelling complexes were established. At macromolecular charge equivalence, the system became unstable and a large and loose cluster of macroions and polyelectrolytes was formed. Finally, in excess of polyelectrolytes, the large cluster was broken up and the macroions were dispersed again – a redissolution had occurred. The effect of the macroion radius, the chain length, and the chain flexibility on the phase separation has also been investigated.

40|$|Screening of a {{strongly}} charged macroion by multivalent counterions is considered. It is shown that counterions form {{a strongly}} correlated liquid {{at the surface}} of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional attraction of counterions to the surface which is absent in conventional solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of counterions near the surface. Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder and a sphere. In all three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent counterions in the solution they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign the net macroion charge. Absolute value of the inverted <b>charge</b> <b>density</b> can be as large as 20 % of that of the bare one.
