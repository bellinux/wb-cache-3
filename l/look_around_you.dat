25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. <b>Look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you</b> who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are here. If the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E
500|$|Robert Patterson III, {{son of the}} Mint Director under whom Peale {{served for}} many years, wrote that through Peale's report, [...] "our Mint was placed in full {{possession}} of all that was then worthy to be known" [...] from foreign mints and refineries. Patterson indicated that he had often thought, as he passed through the Philadelphia Mint's coining department, that a plaque should be set up to Peale reproducing the tribute to Sir Christopher Wren in London's St. Paul's Cathedral, Si Monumentum Requiris, Circumspice (if you seek his monument, <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you).</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} dispute my title with thee, noble Thane," [...] said Richard, calmly; [...] "but I will bid <b>thee</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>thee,</b> {{and see where}} thou wilt find another {{to be put into}} the scale against it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{noble and}} touching," [...] said the glover; [...] "and to me, who knew your father, most {{especially}} so. When you {{rested on the}} sword and <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> methought I saw mine old friend Gilchrist MacIan arisen from the dead and renewed in years and in strength." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can come}} on board and <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> if <b>you</b> wish," [...] called out {{the owner of the}} schooner. [...] "I want you to satisfy {{yourself}} that you are mistaken." ...|$|R
500|$|In early {{planning}} stages of Final Fantasy VII, Aerith {{was to be}} one of only three protagonists; herself, Cloud and Barret. During a phone call to Kitase, it was suggested that {{at some point in the}} game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith. Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview: [...] "Cloud's the main character, so you can't really kill him. And Barrett... well, that's maybe too obvious." [...] While designing Final Fantasy VII, Nomura was frustrated with the [...] "perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love." [...] He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan, and asked [...] "Is it right to set such an example to people?" [...] Kitase concluded: [...] "In the real world things are very different. You just need to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> Nobody wants to die that way. People die of disease and accident. Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad. It leaves, not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness. When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think, 'If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently.' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith's death relatively early in the game. Feelings of reality and not Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another {{interview}} with Brian Palmer, he professed {{his admiration for}} the British comedy show <b>Look</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You</b> and also stated, [...] "I haven't seen anything that tops Mr. Show." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 13 January 2012 <b>Look</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You</b> had its 10th anniversary {{celebrated by}} a showing of all episodes {{of the first}} series at the BFI Southbank in London. Peter Serafinowicz also {{released}} a new short clip entitled [...] "Intermission".|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, <b>look</b> <b>around</b> if <b>you</b> want to," [...] was Merrick's reply. [...] "I am pretty certain {{these boys}} are alone here--although more persons from the steam yacht may be ashore." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'll go with you," [...] added Dick. [...] "Tom, {{you stay}} {{down here and}} take a <b>look</b> <b>around.</b> If <b>you</b> see {{anything}} of him blow the auto horn three times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think you'll {{find him}} {{anywhere}} around here," [...] answered Mr. Basswood. [...] "But it won't hurt {{to take a}} <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> if <b>you</b> boys care to take a walk." ...|$|R
2500|$|Robert Popper reprised {{the role}} of his <b>Look</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You</b> character, Jack Morgan, for an {{appearance}} in the music video of the Frankie & The Heartstrings song [...] "Hunger" [...] (2011). Jack is seen hosting a Blue Peter-type programme, and introduces the song.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas the modules in Series 1 were distinct, {{there is}} a measure of {{continuity}} throughout the episodes of Series 2. Each week, inventors (played by a number of British comic actors) showcase their new products, culminating in the live final programme where a winning invention is chosen, supposedly by [...] "HRH, Sir Prince Charles". To achieve this fake presentation, archive footage of Prince Charles was blended with <b>Look</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You</b> footage, whilst Serafinowicz dubs the Prince's real voice with his own lip-synced impression of it.|$|E
2500|$|DVD extras {{include a}} quiz, mock pages from Ceefax, an {{alternative}} [...] "Birds of Britain" [...] feature, the Scary Picture, {{which features a}} comically large succession of screens making sure the viewer actually wants to view it, then suddenly showing {{it at the same}} time as hearing a male scream, which is shown without the scream in 2 episodes of Series 2, and the Test Card (a music video). Watching this to the end, including the credits, triggers an Easter egg featuring Jack Morgan's more realistic reaction to his plastic surgery, in which the <b>Look</b> <b>Around</b> <b>You</b> team are shocked at the modifications to Jack's face when Dr. Fu reveals him to them. When handed a mirror, Jack turns to Dr. Fu and starts shouting expletives at him, but then calms down after stating that it was the initial reaction to the surgery.|$|E
6000|$|... "A criminal!" [...] {{cried the}} farmer. [...] "Say, that's bad! Certainly <b>look</b> <b>around</b> all <b>you</b> please, and I hope {{if he is}} {{anywhere}} near you'll catch him. I'd go <b>around</b> with <b>you</b> myself, only I can't very well on account of this rheumatism of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he responded, [...] "I'll take a <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> and <b>you</b> {{had better}} start {{off the first}} thing to-morrow and hurry those {{castings}} on. There's a good deal to be done if we're to get away when Carsley turns up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In one way I {{think the}} old fellow I {{was talking with}} last night was right," [...] {{declared}} Jack. [...] "He said that the oil had spoiled the whole country. Just <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> will <b>you?</b> Everything is black and greasy with oil." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand up and <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> <b>you</b> will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E

6000|$|... 2 [...] You road I enter {{upon and}} <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> I believe <b>you</b> {{are not all}} [...] that is here, [...] I believe that much unseen is also here.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Very likely,' {{said the}} hermit; 'but if <b>you</b> were to <b>look</b> <b>around</b> I think <b>you</b> might find {{something}} to suit you which the reigning potentate {{might be willing to}} lease.' ...|$|R
60|$|Well, {{you sent}} even your daintiest and most {{delicate}} and fleeting points home to that audience--absolute proof of good reading. But you couldn't read worth a damn {{a few years}} ago. I do not say this to flatter. It is true I <b>looked</b> <b>around</b> for <b>you</b> when I was leaving, but you had already gone.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe we}} can locate the lake in this {{darkness}} and with the snow coming down so thickly. Why, <b>look</b> <b>around!</b> <b>You</b> can't see at all!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir, they're all {{the rest}} of the stars, and not planets at all. Then, sir, <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you,</b> and you'll find {{everything}} going by threes. There are three topsails, three jibs, and three topgallant sails--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Billina, [...] "I {{must find}} Ozma. She {{is sure to}} be here, somewhere, and of course she is green, being from Oz. So <b>look</b> <b>around,</b> <b>you</b> stupid soldiers, and help me in my search." ...|$|E
50|$|Across House Creek {{there is}} also {{evidence}} of an old speed way ground (circa 1970s) and if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>around</b> the district <b>you</b> can find history in old horse race tracks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{better of}} my zeal, Lady," [...] said the steward, [...] "and judge not without <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> Lindesay, Ruthven, and your kinsman Morton, poniarded Rizzio, {{and yet you}} now see no blood on their embroidery--the Lord Semple stabbed the Lord of Sanquhar--does his bonnet sit a jot more awry on his brow? What noble lives in Scotland who {{has not had a}} share, for policy or revenge, in some such dealing?--and who imputes it to them? Be not cheated with names--a dagger or a draught work to the same end, and are little unlike--a glass phial imprisons the one, and a leathern sheath the other--one deals with the brain, the other sluices the blood--Yet, I say not I gave aught to this lady." ...|$|R
50|$|With smaller {{companies}} beware the hidden charges when the rates {{are too low}} to be true. They mave have hidden fees or poorly advertised fees, like 3 minute rounding, connection fees, monthly, weekly, daily, or even maintenance fees. <b>Look</b> <b>around</b> when <b>you</b> buy these smaller name brands {{to make sure you}} know what you are buying.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{you know}} how pinched and {{destitute}} I am?' she retorted. 'I do not think you do, or can.

Oh! let your heart be softened by your own affliction, friend, and have some sympathy with mine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Here's the spot. <b>Look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> Above on {{the height}} [...] Lay the Hessians encamped. By that {{church on the}} right [...] Stood the gaunt Jersey farmers.

Grasses spring, waters run, flowers blow, [...] Pretty {{much as they did}} ninety-three years ago.|$|E
6000|$|... “Father, {{you are not}} yet {{past the}} summer of life; your limbs are young. Go to the highest hill, and <b>look</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> All that you see, from the rising to the setting sun, from the head-waters of the great spring, to where the ‘crooked river’* is hid by the hills, is his. He has Delaware blood, and his right is strong.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] Grant assented. [...] "I wouldn't have {{believed}} it was so big before Hardie {{put me on the}} track and I began to <b>look</b> <b>around.</b> But <b>you</b> want to remember that what you're doing may cost you something. I'm your nearest neighbor, you're running stock that are often out of sight, and you're up against a determined crowd." ...|$|R
50|$|The song isn't about Disneyland at all. It's {{not about}} Disneyland. It... {{has nothing to}} do with Disneyland, actually. It has more to do with the craziness of the {{juxtaposition}} of the state of your every day. Just <b>looking</b> <b>around</b> <b>you.</b> You could see a guy's head being chopped off and, you know, a leg flying away and someone embracing someone in a lovely kiss and then flip the channel and then a chainsaw goes buzzing through, you know, some butter and it accidentally cuts your mom's head off and then you flip again and they're making love and then you flip again and it's Montana going 'I'm going to Disneyland'. You know, it's just that whole thing, how insane it is, but you know, it's just the natural state. I don't think we're making a, we're not pointing our fingers. We're just... it just is, and we're just singin' it.|$|R
