5|$|Ticks {{have four}} stages to their <b>lifecycle,</b> namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid ticks have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their <b>lifecycle.</b> Argasid ticks have up to seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans and other animals.|$|E
5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone <b>lifecycle.</b> This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones {{at the tail end}} of their <b>lifecycle</b> and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
50|$|Another related {{thread of}} work {{is the use of}} state {{machines}} to model object <b>lifecycles.</b> Industries often define data objects and standardize their <b>lifecycles</b> as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations. Redding et al. and Küster et al. give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object <b>lifecycles.</b> In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object <b>lifecycles</b> glued by events.|$|R

40|$|Medical {{instrumentation}} typically requires <b>lifecycles</b> {{far beyond}} {{those found in}} standard consumer products. Yet the increasing consumer electronics content of medical instrumentation creates “life support ” issues because component and critical subassembly <b>lifecycles</b> are increasingly depending on consumer product <b>lifecycles.</b> Processors and displays can be particularly vulnerable to product obsolescence issues. This paper will look at options medical device manufacturers have to mitigate this challenge in the design process and sustaining engineering strategies which can provide life support to existing products already facing these component obsolescence issues...|$|R

5|$|Genomics {{is central}} to malaria research. With the {{sequencing}} of P.falciparum, one of its vectors Anopheles gambiae, and the human genome, the genetics of all three organisms in the malaria <b>lifecycle</b> can be studied.

5|$|Warm seclusions {{may have}} cloud-free, eye-like {{features}} at their center (reminiscent of tropical cyclones), significant pressure falls, hurricane-force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars (28.05inHg) with a definitive lower to mid-level warm core structure. A warm seclusion, {{the result of}} a baroclinic <b>lifecycle,</b> occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics.|$|E
5|$|Windows 8.1 (codenamed Blue) is {{an upgrade}} for Windows 8, a {{computer}} operating system released by Microsoft. First unveiled and released {{as a public}} beta in June 2013, it was released to manufacturing on August 27, 2013, and reached general availability on October 17, 2013, almost {{a year after the}} retail release of its predecessor. Windows 8.1 is available free of charge for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT users via the Windows Store. Unlike service packs on previous versions of Windows, users who obtained Windows 8 outside of retail copies or pre-loaded installations (i.e., volume licensing) must obtain Windows 8.1 through new installation media from their respective subscription or enterprise channel. Microsoft's support <b>lifecycle</b> policy treats Windows 8.1 similar to previous service packs of Windows: It is part of Windows 8's support <b>lifecycle,</b> and installing Windows 8.1 is required to maintain access to support and Windows updates after January 12, 2016. However, unlike previous service packs, Windows 8.1 cannot be acquired via Windows Update.|$|E
5|$|Alien Soldier was {{released}} in 1995 on a physical cartridge format in Australia, Europe and Japan. In North America, the game was delivered exclusively through the Sega Channel cable service. Released late in the Mega Drive's <b>lifecycle</b> and {{after the release of}} the Sega Saturn, Alien Soldier pushed the system to its technical limits. Suganami wished he continued working on it after release, believing he could have improved on the story and graphics. Years later, Yosuke Okunari of Treasure addressed concerns that Alien Soldier {{was released}} as an incomplete game, stating that the notion is only derived from Suganami having originally had large ambitions that were never realized.|$|E

5|$|Crickets are hemimetabolic insects, whose <b>lifecycle</b> {{consists}} of an egg stage, a larval or nymph stage that increasingly resembles the adult form as the nymph grows, and an adult stage. The egg hatches into a nymph {{about the size of}} a fruit fly. This passes through about 10 larval stages, and with each successive moult, it becomes more like an adult. After the final moult, the genitalia and wings are fully developed, but a period of maturation is needed before the cricket is ready to breed.|$|E
5|$|Fleas are {{holometabolous}} insects, {{going through}} the four <b>lifecycle</b> stages of egg, larva, pupa, and imago (adult). In most species, neither female nor male fleas are fully mature when they first emerge but must feed on blood before they become capable of reproduction. The first blood meal triggers the maturation of the ovaries in females and {{the dissolution of the}} testicular plug in males, and copulation soon follows. Some species breed all year round while others synchronise their activities with their hosts' life cycles or with local environmental factors and climatic conditions. Flea populations consist of roughly 50% eggs, 35% larvae, 10% pupae, and 5% adults.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{bivalves}} in {{the order}} Unionoida have a different <b>lifecycle.</b> Sperm is drawn into a female's gills with the inhalant water and internal fertilization takes place. The eggs hatch into glochidia larvae that develop within the female's shell. Later they are released and attach themselves parasitically to the gills or fins of a fish host. After several weeks they drop off their host, undergo metamorphosis and develop into juveniles on the substrate. An advantage of this to the molluscs {{is that they can}} disperse upstream along with their temporary hosts, rather than being constantly swept downstream by the water flow.|$|E

5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire <b>lifecycle</b> within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains. Murray cod larvae feed within the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel/floodplain boundary, {{but not on the}} floodplain.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all the continents of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex <b>lifecycle</b> requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such as the level of inbreeding, the stage of the <b>lifecycle</b> in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
40|$|The {{estimation}} {{of effort and}} cost {{is still one of}} the hardest tasks in software project management.

This paper shows the results obtained when applying a technique to estimate the effort of each construction iteration in software development projects that use iterative-incremental <b>lifecycles.</b> The results were obtained from software projects of a fourth-year course in Informatics.

Four-year early and late emergences are common and involve a much larger {{proportion of the population}} than one-year changes.|$|R
5|$|The last {{experimental}} {{flight was}} flown in 1971, {{due to a}} lack of candidate storms and a changeover in NOAA's fleet. More than a decade after the last modification experiment, Project Stormfury was officially canceled. Although a failure in its goal of reducing the destructiveness of hurricanes, Project Stormfury was not without merit. The observational data and storm <b>lifecycle</b> research generated by Stormfury helped improve meteorologists' ability to forecast the movement and intensity of future hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account {{factors such as the}} level of inbreeding and the stage of the <b>lifecycle</b> in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its <b>lifecycle.</b> One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E
