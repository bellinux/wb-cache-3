500|$|On 14 July 2008, Scunthorpe United signed Hooper {{for a fee}} of £125,000, {{rising to}} £175,000. Hooper signed a three-year {{contract}} with the League One club. In the first match of Scunthorpe's league campaign, Hooper scored in a 2–1 defeat at Glanford Park against Leeds United. He scored his first ever hat-trick against, Brighton, on 6 September and netted seven goals in his first seven matches to help Scunthorpe's promotion push. After this teammate Izzy Iriekpen paid tribute to Hooper saying that [...] "As soon as he started training you could see there was something special there." [...] On 28 October, league leaders, Scunthorpe suffered their first defeat in 12 matches as they lost 3–0 to Oldham Athletic. Hooper came off with an injury in this match and it was feared he had broken his foot {{and may have been}} out for up to six months. However, scans later revealed that his foot was just badly bruised. He was labelled in the media as the <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> Scunthorpe's [...] "production line for talented young forwards." [...] He scored both goals in a win over promotion rivals Millwall on 31 January 2009. Scunthorpe reached the final of the Football League Trophy and faced League Two Luton Town. Hooper scored the opener but Luton pulled it back to win the match 3–2 in extra-time. At {{the end of the season}} Hooper won Scunthorpe's Player of the Year award. He said he was delighted with the team's performance during the season, in which he scored 24 league goals to help Scunthorpe gain promotion. He then set himself a target of 15 Championship goals for the next season. He scored 30 goals in all competitions throughout the 2008–09 season, just three goals short of Billy Sharp's record 33 goals in a season for Scunthorpe.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{addressed}} the series' portrayal of women after Game of Thrones began airing in 2011. Ginia Bellafante {{wrote in a}} piece from The New York Times that the series was [...] "boy fiction patronizingly turned out to reach the population's other half" [...] and considered it a [...] "true perversion" [...] that [...] "all of this illicitness [...] has been tossed in as {{a little something for}} the ladies, out of a justifiable fear, perhaps, that no woman alive would watch otherwise". Although there may be women who read books like the Ice and Fire series, Bellafante said to never have [...] "met a single woman who has stood up in indignation at her book club and refused to read the <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> Lorrie Moore unless everyone agreed to The Hobbit first".

2500|$|They {{had been}} {{seasonal}} migrants to coastal waters {{of both sides}} of Atlantic, including the Baltic Sea, Wadden Sea, the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Fundy, Hudson Bay (possibly), and Pamlico Sound. [...] Radiocarbon dating of subfossil or fossil European (Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom) coastal remains confirms this, with whaling the possible cause. Remains dating from the Roman epoch {{were found in the}} Mediterranean during excavation of the antique harbor of Lattara near Montpellier in 1997, raising the question of whether Atlantic gray whales migrated up and down the coast of Europe from Wadden Sea to calve in the Mediterranean. Similarly, radiocarbon dating of American east coastal subfossil remains confirm that gray whales existed there at least through the 17th century. This population ranged at least from Southampton, New York, to Jupiter Island, Florida, the <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> 1675. In his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony a whale of the kind called [...] "scragg" [...] entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the [...] "scrag whale", described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by the early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale.|$|E

2500|$|Westervelt {{learned the}} [...] "art, trade and mystery" [...] of his {{profession}} in a most independent way—as a teenage sailor and as an apprentice to Christian Bergh, for whom {{he worked at the}} very <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> the year 1817. Such was his talent that he was in Bergh's absolute confidence. Before even graduating from his apprenticeship, Westervelt accepted an offer to start business in Charleston, where he undertook the construction of two schooners, with the help of African American slaves from planters in and around Charleston (with his employer's consent). He was so successful during those few months that he continued in business there, but he found the environment too confining for his ambitions and in 1822 he returned to New York, where he formed a partnership with Robert Carnley and his old master under the name of C. Bergh & Co. Some of the ships built by Bergh and Westervelt were Hope (1825), Henry IV (1826), Charlemagne (1828), Albany (1831), Philadelphia (1832), Utica (1833), Westminster (1835), and Toronto (1835). Christian Bergh retired a wealthy man in 1837, and was succeeded by his sons Henry and Edwin Bergh, who continued the business until just after their father's death in 1843.|$|E
2500|$|When Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped {{and taught}} Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, {{for which he}} also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. {{prosecutors}} with plotting with members of al-Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, Abdul-Malik said in February 2005: [...] "Our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community." [...] He added: [...] "The feeling I get here on a daily basis must be {{what it was like to}} be a member of Martin Luther King Jr.'s church following the case of Rosa Parks. People always ask, 'What is the <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> the courthouse?'" [...] Abdul-Malik accused the government of singling out Abu Ali to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. Abu Ali was convicted in 2005 of providing material support to the al-Qaeda terrorist network, and conspiracy to assassinate President Bush, and is serving a life sentence. [...] When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: [...] "There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk." [...] Al-Timimi was sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|E

6000|$|Early in the forenoon {{parties of}} jaded men began to straggle into the village, but the strongest of the {{citizens}} continued searching. All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked {{that had never been}} visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names [...] "BECKY & TOM" [...] had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious, because this one parted <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> the living body before the awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a sickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.|$|E

I get reports almost hourly from the government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose--no, it CAN'T be loose--but if it isn't loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it held back? That's the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was it, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night when the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why is it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with her? If so, is it in her house in Paris? How could I search for it without the French police having their suspicions aroused? It is a case, my dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals are. Every man's hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are colossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion, it will certainly represent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my <b>latest</b> <b>from</b> the front!"

60|$|I {{only know}} that during our {{fortnight}} in Seville I suffered no wound to a sensibility {{which has been}} kept in full repair for literary, if not for humanitarian purposes. The climate was as kind as the people. It is notorious that in summer the heat {{is that of a}} furnace, but even then it is bearable because it is a dry heat, like that of our indoor furnaces. The 5th of November was our last day, and then it was too hot for comfort in the sun, but one is willing to find the November sun too hot; it is an agreeable solecism; and I only wish that we could have found the sun too hot during the next three days in Granada. If the 5th of November had been worse for heat than it was it must still remain dear in our memory, because in the afternoon we met once more these Chilians of our hearts whom we had met in San Sebastian and Burgos and Valladolid and Madrid. We knew we should meet them in Seville and were not the least surprised.
