Kuhn formed a patrol to head south down a double-hedgerowed lane. Lomell saw markings in this sunken road that <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> heavy had been over it.|$|E
25|$|Dyson {{also did}} {{work in a}} variety of topics in mathematics, such as topology, analysis, number theory and random matrices. There is an {{interesting}} story involving random matrices. In 1973, the number theorist Hugh Montgomery was visiting the Institute for Advanced Study and had just made his pair correlation conjecture concerning the distribution of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function. He showed his formula to the mathematician Atle Selberg who said it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> in mathematical physics and he should show it to Dyson, which he did. Dyson recognized the formula as the pair correlation function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble, which has been extensively studied by physicists. This suggested that there might be an unexpected connection between the distribution of primes 2,3,5,7,11,... and the energy levels in the nuclei of heavy elements such as uranium.|$|E
500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, {{you would want to}} check out her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> that was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fact,--as big as my fist," [...] {{said the}} Captain, obdurately; [...] "and all the clothes he wore was jist a stiff crust of pearls and {{precious}} stones. I tell you, he <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> in the Revelations,--a real New Jerusalem look he had." ...|$|E
6000|$|We hurried {{the turkey}} into the oven, and soon {{everything}} was going merrily. We had lots of fun getting up that dinner, and we made ourselves perfectly at home, as Aunt Jean had commanded. We kindled {{a fire in the}} dining room and dusted everything in sight. We couldn't find anything remotely resembling a duster, so we used our handkerchiefs. When we got through, the room <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something,</b> for the furnishings were really very handsome, but our handkerchiefs--well! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Strike," [...] {{said the}} policeman. His {{interest}} in Beaton's ignorance seemed to overcome his contempt of it. [...] "Knocked off everywhere this morning except Third Avenue {{and one or}} two cross-town lines." [...] He spat again and kept his bulk at its incline over the gutter to glance at a group of men on the corner below: They were neatly dressed, and <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> better than workingmen, and they had a holiday air of being in their best clothes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bring Little Mother down; {{we want to}} {{show her}} off on Friday. And make her put on {{something}} pretty.

Nash said she <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> out of an old picture, and he's going to be an artist. Don't let her dress herself. She doesn't understand it. And will you get me a gun--" ...|$|E
60|$|Archie started violently. There was {{an instant}} in which Pongo seemed to hang suspended, like Mohammed's coffin, between heaven and earth, then {{the force of gravity}} {{asserted}} itself. Pongo fell with a sharp crack and disintegrated. And as it did so {{there was a knock at}} the door, and in walked a dark, furtive person, who to the inflamed vision of Mr. Daniel Brewster <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> connected with the executive staff of the Black Hand. With all time at his disposal, the unfortunate Salvatore had selected this moment for stating his case.|$|E

60|$|But {{that was}} a mistake. We saw the Cross to-night, {{and it is not}} large. Not large, and not strikingly bright. But it was low down toward the horizon, and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky. It is ingeniously named, for it looks just as a cross would look if it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> else. But that {{description}} does not describe; it is too vague, too general, too indefinite. It does after a fashion suggest a cross -- a cross that is out of repair--or out of drawing; not correctly shaped. It is long, with a short cross-bar, and the cross-bar is canted out of the straight line.|$|E
60|$|My {{experience}} is that a fellow never really looks his best just after he's {{come out of a}} cell. When I was up at Oxford, I used to have a regular job bailing out a pal of mine who never failed to get pinched every Boat-Race night, and he always <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> that had been dug up by the roots. Cyril was in pretty much the same sort of shape. He had a black eye and a torn collar, and altogether was nothing to write home about--especially if one was writing to Aunt Agatha. He was a thin, tall chappie with a lot of light hair and pale-blue goggly eyes which made him look like one of the rarer kinds of fish.|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{had watched}} the whole {{transaction}} from first to last, and had a perfect understanding of its results. To him, it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> unutterably horrible and cruel, because, poor, ignorant black soul! he had not learned to generalize, and to take enlarged views. If he had only been instructed by certain ministers of Christianity, he might have thought better of it, and seen in it an every-day incident of a lawful trade; a trade which is the vital support of an institution which an American divine* tells us has [...] "no evils but such as are inseparable from any other relations in social and domestic life." [...] But Tom, as we see, being a poor, ignorant fellow, whose reading had been confined entirely to the New Testament, could not comfort and solace himself with views like these. His very soul bled within him for what seemed to him the wrongs of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes; the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal thing, which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and bales, and boxes, among which she is lying.|$|E
6000|$|... [5] There may, however, {{be a kind}} of {{dishonesty}} even in the use of [...] marble, if it is {{attempted to}} make the marble <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> [...] else. See the final or Venetian Index under head [...] "Scalzi." ...|$|R
5000|$|Actor Patrick Troughton was reputedly {{particularly}} {{unhappy about}} the production. He {{is reported to}} have described the show as having [...] "ridiculous costumes and make-up of the fish people". Producer Innes Lloyd appeared to concur, admitting [...] "it did <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> from a '50s American 'B' movie".|$|R
50|$|Creating {{the visual}} effect of texture without {{actually}} adding texture. For instance, a texture created to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> other than paint {{on a flat}} surface. An example is Cataract 3, painted in 1967 by Bridget Riley, which creates the illusion of ripples in the paper through the repetition of lines.|$|R

50|$|To {{a casual}} viewer, many demo effects <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> {{attainable}} by a general-purpose 3D engine. However, classic effects with an apparent 3D look often have no real-time 3D calculation whatsoever. For example, static screen-to-texture look-up tables {{can be used}} with symmetrical 3D objects that rotate around their axis of symmetry.|$|R

5000|$|This {{thing was}} about 75 yards away, {{at right angles}} from our boat. At first it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> {{floating}} on the water. It was black and the part of it {{that was out of}} the water seemed about 12 feet long. It has a head about as big as a football and shaped somewhat like a horse’s head. It turned its head around several times — almost all the way around.|$|E
50|$|The series {{received}} {{very negative}} critics from manga and anime reviewers. John Jakala {{said that the}} first instalment of the series was okay, but the second was even more amateur. He referred to a car panel as it <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> an elementary school child would draw {{in the margins of}} his math notebook. He also noted that {{he does not want to}} pay for work of such unprofessional quality. He cast his vote against Bomber Girl on an online survey. John Jakala continuously made fun of the series in the later reviews.|$|E
5000|$|Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 3.7 {{star rating}} out of 5, stating: [...] "Manticores, <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> I would fight against in a Final Fantasy game, came to Portland seeking vengeance in Grimm Season 3 Episode 11. The {{case with the}} manticores was pretty average. There's really not much to talk about." ...|$|R
50|$|A lot of {{mountains}} along the Norwegian shore are obviously named because they <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>something.</b> Bjønnahaugen (the bears hill), on Nordlandet in Kristiansund, <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a sleeping bear. On Averøya, west of Kristiansund, is a mountain {{that is called}} Bremsneshatten, which is thought to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a hat. Løwenørn calls it Plak-Myssen (a kind of seal), in the Middle Ages it was probably Brimill. The mountain <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> {{the head of a}} seal sticking out of the seabed.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "Tron-inspired" [...] Palumbo & Coch {{directed}} video {{starts with}} the camera rushing across a fluorescent blue sea, then a road towards [...] "a cityscape which <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>something</b> between downtown Tokyo and a graphic equalizer".
