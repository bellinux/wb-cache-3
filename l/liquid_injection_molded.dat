40|$|Biologically inert {{elastomers}} such as silicone are favorable {{materials for}} medical device fabrication, but forming and curing these elastomers using traditional liquid injection molding processes {{can be an}} expensive process due to tooling and equipment costs. As a result, it has traditionally been impractical to use liquid injection molding for low-cost, rapid prototyping applications. We have devised a method for rapid and low-cost production of liquid elastomer injection molded devices that utilizes fused deposition modeling 3 D printers for mold design and a modified desiccator as an injection system. Low costs and rapid turnaround time in this technique lower the barrier to iteratively designing and prototyping complex elastomer devices. Furthermore, CAD models developed in this process can be later adapted for metal mold tooling design, enabling an easy transition to a traditional injection molding process. We have used this technique to manufacture intravaginal probes involving complex geometries, as well as overmolding over metal parts, using tools commonly available within an academic research laboratory. However, this technique can be easily adapted to create <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molded</b> devices for many other applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and mechanical characterization {{of a novel}} technology for stretchable electronics is presented, {{which can be used}} for the realization of wearable textile electronics and biomedical implants. The stretchable devices consist of rigid or flexible component islands interconnected with stretchable meander-shaped copper conductors embedded in a stretchable polymer, polydemethylsiloxane. The technology uses standard printed circuit board manufacturing steps and <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> techniques to achieve a robust and reliable product. The conductors in the device are designed to accommodate strains up to 10 - 15 %. Spin-on photo-definable polyimide as mechanical support for the stretchable interconnects and the functional flexible islands are introduced. By use of polyimide, the reliability of the stretchable interconnects, the straight interconnects on the flexible islands and the transitions between the stretchable and nonstretchable parts are improved. Long-term endurance behavior of the stretchable interconnects is studied by cyclic elongation at strain ranges of up to 20 % while monitoring the electrical connectivity.

40|$|Advani, Suresh G. In Liquid Composite Molding (LCM) processes, {{a liquid}} resin {{is forced to}} flow through dry fibrous preform, usually fabrics, to {{impregnate}} it and create the composite part in net or near-net shape. The principal advantage of LCM processes is their capacity to produce high fiber volume fraction and high quality parts under low pressure at low cost. The main conditions for successful manufacturing are complete filling of the mold and perfect impregnation of the reinforcement material. If these conditions are not met the structural properties of the finished part are significantly impaired by defects like voids. The mold filling depends on the permeability of the fibrous media. Permeability is an intrinsic property of fiber reinforcement, which includes all interactions between fibers and fluid and characterizes the ease of flow through the medium. The complete prediction of second-order permeability tensor is critical to understanding and prediction of flow in the resin transfer molding process of thick composites or where the flow process is three dimensional In this thesis a new approach for characterizing the three dimensional permeability tensor of fabrics used as reinforcement in <b>liquid</b> <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> processes from a single experiment is presented and validated. In this approach, a liquid is injected into a preform placed in a mold containing 192 electrical resistance flow sensors radially embedded in the top and the bottom platens of the mold. The proposed method uses an optimization routine in which the permeabilities in a 3 D flow simulation of the identical mold is updated continuously until the error between the simulation arrival times at all the 192 sensor locations and the experimental arrival time is minimum. The optimization routine systematically changes {{the values of the}} components of the permeability tensor using golden search method until the best match is obtained. The validation and sensitivity of this method is explored and {{it has been shown that}} this technique is promising for permeability characterization. The approach is shown to be valid for reinforcements with anisotropic and isotropic nature The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to obtain permeability values from a single experiment; there is no need to scale the circular injection inlet, and it is not limited to principal permeability values. The sensors utilized are unobtrusive to the flow unlike say optic fibers embedded in the fabric that interfere with the flow of the test fluid. The electrical resistance sensors used in this approach are embedded in mold platens instead and which flush with the surface. The method can be used to help predict and understand resin flow behavior during liquid molding of advanced composite materials. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM.
