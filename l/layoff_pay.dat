25|$|Bieber's {{final round}} of {{collective}} bargaining talks came in 1993, but once more his control of the union's bargaining apparatus was apparent. In August and September 1992, GM workers in Lordstown, Ohio, struck a critical GM parts plant with Yokich's permission, idling many other GM plants and throwing 40,000 other GM employees out of work. The Detroit Free Press later said that Bieber formally approve the strike, but Yokich was the quarterback who actually led the union through it. Despite the problems the Lordstown strike created, Bieber entered contract negotiations with the Big Three automakers seeking pledges against new layoffs. Bieber chose Ford as the strike target, and the company focused on reining in health care costs as its major goal. A new contract was reached on September 15, 1993, but the deal was considered a failure since Bieber was unable to win any major changes to the old agreement. Ford asked for a six-year rather than a three-year agreement, but gave this goal up and promised instead to increase pension payouts by 17 percent for certain veteran workers. The union agreed to a lower wage for new workers, and extend {{the time it took}} for new workers to reach the full wage. No changes were made to the wage or layoff income security provisions. However, Ford did agree to fully pay for health care costs for all workers, but the workers gave up a part of their pay raises to do so. A contract with GM followed the next month. GM sought to reduce its pension costs, but failed. GM, however, forced workers to agree to use vacation time rather than use <b>layoff</b> <b>pay</b> during the summer production shutdown, and gained the right to stop paying <b>layoff</b> <b>pay</b> to workers who refuse jobs at nearby plants. The wage payment scheme was the same as the previous contract.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the connection between}} <b>layoffs,</b> executive <b>pay,</b> and stock prices. Firms that announce layoffs {{in the previous year}} pay their CEOs more, and give their CEOs larger percentage raises than firms which do not have at least one layoff announcement in the previous year. However, the likelihood of announcing a layoff varies dramatically along other dimensions, for example firm size, which are also correlated with CEO pay. Once firm-specific fixed effects are controlled for, the CEO pay premium for laying off workers disappears. In addition, there is a small negative share price reaction to layoff announcements.

50|$|With more {{costs to}} the farmer, some will no longer find it financially {{feasible}} to farm. Agriculture employs {{the majority of the}} population in most low-income countries and increased costs can result in worker <b>layoffs</b> or <b>pay</b> cuts. Other farmers will respond by raising their food prices; a cost which is directly passed on to the consumer and impacts the affordability of food. Some farms do not export their goods and their function is to feed a direct family or community; without that food, people will not have enough to eat. This results in decreased production, increased food prices, and potential starvation in parts of the world.|$|R
40|$|The project {{focuses on}} layoffs of public {{employees}} in the municipality of Høje-Taastrup, and how to avoid or minimize severance pay in relation to these layoffs. Managers control the day-to-day operations of the institutions in the municipality, which include layoffs. Handling layoffs is a minor part of the managers’ workload. Consequently, the municipality has established a Human Resource Center. The consultants in the Human Resource Center offer legal advice on the processes of layoffs but errors and misunderstandings still occur. Somewhere in the cooperation between the managers and the consultants, mistakes happen. These mistakes {{provide the basis for}} this project. The project seeks to understand and analyse the processes of layoffs through the theories on sensemaking by organizational psychologist Karl E. Weick. Theories on sensemaking help to illustrate the managers’ and consultants’ thoughts and reflections on previous layoffs. This provides the foundation for a brand new strategy on layoff processes. The project finds {{that it is not a}} necessity that all managers and consultants agree on the procedure of layoffs. However, it is essential that there is an agreement between the manager and the consultant on how to execute a <b>layoff</b> without <b>paying</b> severance. A clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities is needed to establish who monitors what in the processes of layoffs to avoid and minimize confusion. Managers and consultants are required to agree on several plausible ways to fire employees. Consultants and managers in the municipality can use the findings and conclusions of this project to focus on their organizational compass to create a strategy on future <b>layoffs</b> without <b>paying</b> severance...|$|R

Since the provision of insurance against firm-specific shocks adversely affects workers' incentives to find better jobs, the optimal contract provides only partial insurance: it prescribes low (high) wages and under (over) employment to encourage workers to leave (stay) at low (high) productivity firms; and it employs quits and layoffs as alternative means of inducing separations at low productivity firms, with the mix depending upon the relative efficiency of the on- and off-the-job search technologies. Our analysis of implicit contracts with asymmetric search information establishes that any consistent explanation for worksharing, <b>layoffs,</b> severance <b>pay,</b> quits and unemployment must focus on questions of labor mobility. ...|$|R
