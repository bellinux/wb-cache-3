5|$|All {{three are}} part of the genus Oecomys, which {{includes}} about fifteen species distributed in rainforest habitats in South America and into southern Central America. Oecomys is one of the genera of the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> classified in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
50|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone and {{luteinizing hormone}} <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} elevated (30-33 mIU/mL and 34-37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119-272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone-binding globulin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (6.0-10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> both substantially elevated (18.7-21.6 ng/mL and 33.3-35.9 ng/mL, respectively).|$|R
50|$|One of {{her famous}} aphorisms compares the occidental {{economic}} model to a cake with four levels, with {{glass on the}} top: the first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> nature, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the subsistence economy, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> {{the public and private}} economy, and the last <b>level</b> <b>is</b> finance.|$|R

5|$|For adults, {{the testing}} of electrolyte, blood glucose and calcium <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} to rule out problems with these as causes. An electrocardiogram can rule out problems with {{the rhythm of the}} heart. A lumbar puncture may be useful to diagnose a central nervous system infection but is not routinely needed. In children additional tests may be required such as urine biochemistry and blood testing looking for metabolic disorders.|$|E
5|$|The Lost <b>Levels</b> <b>is</b> an unlockable bonus in the 1999 Game Boy Color game Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. The {{game was}} edited for the {{handheld}} device: the visible screen is cropped and some features are omitted, {{such as the}} wind and five bonus worlds. The Lost Levels was rereleased in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance on the third volume of Nintendo's Japan-only Famicom Mini compilation cartridges.|$|E
50|$|DDSN uses a {{capability}} {{model that}} consist of four levels. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Reacting, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Anticipating, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Collaborating {{and the last}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.|$|R

5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, studies have suggested significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation in the {{watershed}} is {{closely tied to}} elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation <b>levels,</b> <b>is</b> populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, sagebrush, juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.|$|E
5|$|Water {{levels are}} {{maintained}} {{at a lower}} level during the winter months, when flows are high, and the Drain {{needs to be able}} to cope with higher volumes of rainfall, than during the summer months, when navigable levels are maintained. As on the neighbouring River Witham, the switch between winter and summer <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> normally made at the beginning of April.|$|E
50|$|In video systems, nominal <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> 1 VP-P for synched systems, such as {{baseband}} composite video, and 0.7 VP-P for systems without sync. Note {{that these}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> measured peak-to-peak, while audio <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> time averages.|$|R
30|$|A polygon {{for each}} house was {{produced}} {{based on a}} field experiment, and the damage <b>level</b> information <b>was</b> attached to each polygon. The polygons with same damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated and were converted to raster data with 10 -m resolution, which matched the PALSAR- 2 processed data. The raster images for each damage <b>level</b> <b>were</b> aggregated. There were several pixels in which different damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> assigned in the same pixel. In that case, the damage <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> averaged. The range, 3.5 ≤damaged level < 4.5 <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 4; 4.5 ≤damaged <b>level</b> <b>was</b> regarded as <b>level</b> 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} has six stories, {{three of}} which are allocated for passenger processing. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for arrivals, the sixth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for departures, and the fourth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine <b>level</b> (which <b>is</b> the uppermost <b>level).</b>|$|R
5|$|Blood {{lead levels}} are an {{indicator}} mainly of recent or current lead exposure, not of total body burden. Lead in bones {{can be measured}} noninvasively by X-ray fluorescence; {{this may be the}} best measure of cumulative exposure and total body burden. However this method is not widely available and is mainly used for research rather than routine diagnosis. Another radiographic sign of elevated lead <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> the presence of radiodense lines called lead lines at the metaphysis in the long bones of growing children, especially around the knees. These lead lines, caused by increased calcification due to disrupted metabolism in the growing bones, become wider as the duration of lead exposure increases. X-rays may also reveal lead-containing foreign materials such as paint chips in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Chelation {{therapy is}} used in cases of acute lead poisoning, severe poisoning, and encephalopathy, and is {{considered}} for people with blood lead levels above 25µg/dL. While the use of chelation for people with symptoms of lead poisoning is widely supported, use in asymptomatic people with high blood lead <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> more controversial. Chelation therapy is of limited value for cases of chronic exposure to low levels of lead. Chelation therapy is usually stopped when symptoms resolve or when blood lead levels return to premorbid levels. When lead exposure has taken place over a long period, blood lead levels may rise after chelation is stopped because lead is leached into blood from stores in the bone; thus repeated treatments are often necessary.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored {{features}} role-playing game elements, such as {{the ability}} to upgrade powers and to make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences. The game is designed to allow the player to complete it without killing any non-player characters (NPC), including boss characters and mission targets. An example of a non-lethal situation given by co-creative designer Harvey Smith involved the player completing a side mission for a character, and in return that character had two of Corvo's targets kidnapped and enslaved. Each mission contains multiple ways to explore and reach targets. Movement through and exploration of <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> designed to support the player character's abilities, rather than specific paths that are aimed at a particular gameplay style, such as hacking or sneaking. Specific elements of missions, such as changes to the color of a target's clothing and mask in one mission are randomized, requiring the player to explore the game area to find the target each time the mission is played.|$|E
30|$|Different <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} for centers and eventually one capacity <b>level</b> <b>is</b> selected for each center.|$|R
50|$|Points are tallied {{up at the}} end of each level, {{successful}} completion of which will unlock additional <b>levels.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> rated in difficulty using a star system; one star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy, while five star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult.|$|R
50|$|<b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> square mazes {{that grow}} larger as the player descends, {{simulating}} {{the design of}} a pyramid. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 3x3, totalling 9 squares. Each succeeding <b>level</b> <b>is</b> one step larger in each dimension (so the next <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 4x4 steps, for a total of 16 squares, and so on). A key on each must be found to unlock the next <b>level.</b> Ascension <b>is</b> impossible, which can strand players if an important item is left behind.|$|R
5|$|Henry is {{generally}} credited with initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|Homeworld is a {{real-time}} strategy game set in space. Gameplay, {{as in most}} real-time strategy titles, {{is focused}} on gathering resources, building military forces, and using them to destroy enemy forces and accomplish an objective. The game includes both single-player and multiplayer modes; the single-player mode consists of one story-driven campaign, broken up into levels. In each level, the player has an objective to accomplish before they can end the level, though the ultimate objective of the mission can change as the level's story unfolds. Between each of the 16 <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> a hand-drawn, black-and-white cutscene with narrative voiceovers.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E
50|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{dramatically}} and persistently elevated (estradiol <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 2340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750-3500 pg/mL), gonadotropin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 6.7-19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8-13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> slightly elevated (33-88 ng/dL). Inhibin A <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also markedly elevated. Sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which {{are known to}} be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated <b>levels</b> of gonadotropins <b>were</b> attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERβ could not be excluded.|$|R
5000|$|Estradiol and LH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{dramatically}} elevated due to loss {{of negative}} feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH <b>levels,</b> in contrast, <b>are</b> normal. Testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> also substantially elevated. Prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased by 5-fold, which {{is due to}} a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 2009, the {{basement}} <b>level</b> <b>was</b> flooded when Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) battered the capital. The appliance center, supermarket, food court and other retail stores located at {{the basement}} <b>level</b> <b>were</b> heavily damaged. The basement <b>level</b> <b>was</b> temporarily closed for several days.|$|R
5|$|Near the coast, {{halfway between}} the Quantocks and the Mendips, and lying {{parallel}} to them, is the low ridge of the Polden Hills. On either side is a coastal plain and wetlands area known as the Somerset Levels, an area of about , much of which is about above sea level. The northeasterly part of the <b>Levels</b> <b>is</b> drained by the Axe and Brue, and the southwesterly part by the Parrett and its main tributary, the Tone. This part of the Levels has traditionally been known as Sedgemoor, and to the east is Glastonbury Tor, an isolated hill projecting from the low-lying plain.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one treatment modality under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary tumors require {{treatment}} {{when they}} are causing specific symptoms, such as headaches, visual field defects or excessive hormone secretion. Transsphenoidal surgery (removal of the tumor by an operation through the nose and the sphenoidal sinuses) may, apart from addressing symptoms related to the tumor, also improve pituitary function, although the gland is sometimes damaged further {{as a result of}} the surgery. When the tumor is removed by craniotomy (opening the skull), recovery is less likely–but sometimes this is the only suitable way to approach the tumor. After surgery, it may take some time for hormone levels to change significantly. Retesting the pituitary hormone <b>levels</b> <b>is</b> therefore performed 2 to 3 months later.|$|E
50|$|Zimbabwe's {{public health}} care is {{delivered}} at four <b>levels,</b> which <b>are</b> meant {{to function as a}} referral chain. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the primary <b>level</b> consisting of Rural Health Centres, Rural Hospitals and Urban Clinics (services do not require an attending Physician). The second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the first referral level consisting of District Hospitals. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the second referral level consisting of Provincial and General Hospitals. The fourth and final <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the third referral level to Central and Special Hospitals.|$|R
