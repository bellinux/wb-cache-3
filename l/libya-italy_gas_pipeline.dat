The factors {{contributing}} to <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage most are third party damage, corrosion, design and incorrect operation. The accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage and quantitative risk assessment method of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage consequence are analyzed. In order to achieve quantitative fire risk assessment of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and thermal radiation damage criterion are analyzed. Firstly, the gas leakage quantity is estimated. Then, the heat radiation estimate flux, the thermal dose and damage range are got by using flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and the thermal radiation damage criterion respectively. Combined with an example of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline,</b> damage ranges of different disaster patterns are estimated according to different <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage pattern. Through comparing the accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, this paper provides some reliable scientific references for <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> management departments...|$|R

The leakage of the oil and gas would be happened because of some inner or outer factors during the transportation. If the concentration of the mixture gas composed by oil/gas and air reaches the burning and/or explosion limit, the fire and/or explosion accident resulting in casualties and serious loss of property may be happened once there is a fire source in the surroundings. Therefore, the relevant research on the risk analysis and evaluation to the oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> has been focused on the field of safety engineering in recent years. So it is necessary to carry out the evaluation on the fire risk study {{to ensure the safety of}} long-distance oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline.</b> In this paper, the character of the risk of long distance oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> was analysed firstly, and then the fire risk of the long-distance oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> was processed based on Quantitative Risk Analysis (QRA). Taking a natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> as an example, the influence area (death radius) and individual risk contour line of fire were charted based on the software CASSTQRA, For the natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline,</b> the death radius was 148. 42 m, and the areas circled by the individual risk contour line of 3 × 10 - 7 and 1 × 10 - 6 were not high density residential areas, public gathering places of high density or high sensitive areas, important targets and special high density places. The fire risk of the natural <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> was acceptable. Finally, the corresponding preventing and controlling suggestions to guarantee the safety of the transportation have been proposed in this paper.
