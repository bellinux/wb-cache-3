5|$|Multiple Aboriginal villages {{rebelled against}} the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Dutch ordered {{aboriginal}} women for sex, deer pelts, and rice {{be given to}} them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 {{at the same time}} as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.|$|E
5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red and Green, and was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E
25|$|The {{new wave}} of {{immigration}} that was sparked by the gold rush would {{continue to have a}} disastrous impact on California's native population, which continued to precipitously decline mainly due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity. <b>Like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Spanish missions in California were established the native inhabitants were often forcefully removed from their traditional tribal lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. There were a number of massacres, including the Yontoket Massacre, the Bloody Island Massacre at Clear Lake, and the Old Shasta Massacre, in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.|$|E

500|$|Following {{this public}} support, Boycott resumed writing for The Daily Telegraph and commentating on Channel Four for the Cheltenham and Gloucester Championship Final and the {{following}} summer's cricket. Radio Five Live then hired Boycott in early 2004. His fellow commentators state that his illness has altered his voice {{and led to a}} more pleasant personality, but that he is still prone to unpleasant behaviour. Channel Four producer Gary Francis stated [...] "I think Geoff is a lot more mellow now. He still has his moments, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> taxi does not arrive and he is not happy, as he makes extremely clear. But overall he's great fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{called the}} episode [...] "another {{standout}} holiday episode", and applauded {{the return of}} Holly, calling her [...] "welcome". He enjoy the episode largely because {{it was full of}} [...] "darkness"; he noted that [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>The</b> Office aims for something non-comic, so long as it takes its characters seriously, which it did here." [...] Sepwinwall also complimented that subplot featuring Jim being terrorized by Dwight, applauding both Kaling's writing and Wilson's directing. Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine argued that the reappearance of Holly—a signal that Steve Carell's exit was approaching—"gifted [...] with some of the show's best writing in a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Running {{throughout}} McNeile's {{books is}} {{the metaphor of}} warfare as sport. His war stories include descriptions of fights between individuals that carry a sporting motif: in Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E., he writes, [...] "To bag {{a man with a}} gun is one thing; there is sport—there is an element of one against one, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> quality goes big game shooting. But to bag twenty men by a mine has not the same feeling at all, even if they are Germans". The motif was continued into the Drummond novels. McNeile reinforces this theme through his use of the language of public school sports, or of boxing, poker or hunting. The titles of his books also use sporting imagery: The Third Round, The Final Count, Knock-Out and Challenge.|$|E

500|$|... "Skyfall" [...] was {{composed}} {{in the key}} of C minor using common time at 76beats per minute (Adagietto). Adele's vocal range spans , from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5, on the song. The lyrics closely follow the narrative of the film {{rather than focusing on}} romanticism. According to Epworth, the song is about [...] "death and rebirth", saying [...] "It's <b>like,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> world ends and everything comes down around your ears, if you've got each other's back, you can conquer anything. From death to triumph, that was definitely something we set out to try and capture". The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick described the lyrics as [...] "slightly sinister" [...] and containing references to a number of Bond tropes and motifs.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Ricky Gervais {{acknowledged}} {{that there were}} feelings of hesitation from certain viewers. The first season of The Office was met with a mixed response from critics {{with some of them}} comparing it to the short-lived NBC series Coupling which was also based on a British version. The New York Daily News called it [...] "so diluted there's little left but muddy water," [...] and USA Today called it a [...] "passable imitation of a miles-better BBC original." [...] A Guardian Unlimited review panned its lack of originality, stating, [...] "(Steve Carell) just seems to be trying too hard ... Maybe in later episodes when it deviates from Gervais and Merchant's script, he'll come into his own. But right now he's a pale imitation." [...] Tom Shales of the Washington Post said it was [...] "not the mishmash that [...] turned out to be, but again the quality of the original show causes the remake to look dim, <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> copying machine is just about to give out." ...|$|E
500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great because I feel like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E

500|$|Retrospectively, {{the website}} GamersHell found {{the lack of}} any text {{messages}} and dialogue in the game to be [...] "an interesting design element." [...] However, Gry-Online included the lack of even partial descriptions of objects among the reasons why Curse of Enchantia failed to become an outstanding game, along with a too many user interface icons and [...] "useless" [...] features. Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the 27th best Amiga game, but noted that [...] "proponents of adventure genre's purity" [...] to this day dislike the game for its [...] "unwise flirt" [...] with action-adventure, as well as the 19th best adventure game in history, opining that the lack of written text [...] "perfectly" [...] fits with the game's story and specific type of humor. It was also ranked as the 26th best Amiga game by Polish console gaming magazine PSX Extreme, noted for its strong playability. Curse of Enchantia was also the first Amiga video game owned by Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw, who in 2012 made a Let's Play video of the PC version of the game, saying it had [...] "great graphics, great animation, appalling game design.", and lamented much {{on the fact that the}} game contained [...] "no kind of logic whatsoever" [...] Yahtzee had earlier, in a 2005 interview, said, [...] "it was a game I had difficulty putting down, with beautiful scenery and a great sense of humour, although I understand it's looked down upon by modern standards", something which he opposed in the 2012 Let's Play, then stating that the game lacked humour, and got a warning from co-comentator Gabriel Morten regarding Rose-tinted glasses. An advertisement for Curse of Enchantia was featured in GamesRadar's humor article about [...] "what game ads looked <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> SNES was alive".|$|E

His childhood friend, EMT Micah Ehling, is quoted by The Wichita Eagle as saying [...] "I know what a face looks <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> soul leaves the body. And that's what Nick looked like". Some bystanders attribute Dellasega's survival to the devotion of his cousin, Jonah Dellasega, who fell to his knees at the scene and prayed to Kapaun. In a strange coincidence not reported by The Eagle, Dylan Meier, in whose memory the 5K was being held, was slated to teach English in Korea {{at the time of his}} death.|$|E

2500|$|Churidars, or more {{properly}} churidar pyjamas, are tightly fitting trousers worn by {{both men and}} women in South Asia. Churidars are a variant of the common salwar pants. Salwars are cut wide at the top and narrow at the ankle. Churidars narrow more quickly, so that contours of the leg are revealed. [...] They are usually cut on the bias, making them naturally stretchy. Stretch is important when pants are closefitting. They are also longer than the leg and sometimes finish with a tightly fitting buttoned cuff at the ankle. The excess length falls into folds and appears like a set of bangles resting on the ankle (hence 'churidar'; 'churi': bangle, 'dar': <b>like).</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> wearer is sitting, the extra material is the [...] "ease" [...] that makes it possible to bend the legs and sit comfortably. [...] The word churidar is from Urdu and made its way into English only in the 20th century. Earlier, tight fitting churidar-like pants worn in India were referred to by the British as Moghul breeches, long-drawers, or mosquito drawers.|$|E
2500|$|Milošević {{denounced the}} {{declaration}} of independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia in 1992, and said that [...] "Bosnia and Herzegovina was illegally proclaimed as an independent state and recognized. That recognition was <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Roman Emperor Caligula appointed his horse as a Senator: they recognized a state that never existed before. The Serbs there said, 'We want to stay within Yugoslavia. We don't want to be second-class citizens.' And then the conflicts were started by Muslims, no doubt. And the Serbs, in defending themselves, were always better fighters, no doubt. And they achieved results, no doubt. But please, we were insisting on peace. The international community gave premature recognition first of Slovenia and then of Croatia and supported the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina on a totally irregular basis." [...] A telephone conversation between Milošević and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzić in September 1991 talking about the prospects of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was tapped by Yugoslav intelligence, which reported the transcript to Yugoslav prime minister Ante Marković, who released the transcript to the public to discredit Milošević. The transcript involved Milošević ordering Karadzic to [...] "Go to Uzelac , he'll tell you everything. If you have any problems, telephone me", and said [...] "As long as there is the army no one can touch us... Don't worry about Herzegovina. Momir [...] said to his men: 'Whoever is not ready to die in Bosnia, step forward five paces.' No one did so." [...] The conversation revealed that Milošević controlled the military strategy for the war in Bosnia and that Montenegro was under his control.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his text}} Buddho Ajahn Thate {{describes}} {{what it is}} <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> mind has finally rid itself of preoccupation with sensual distractions {{and is able to}} focus on the breath, mantra, or a part of the body, in meditation: [...] "When you first enter concentration, this is what it's like: [...] You'll have no idea at all of what concentration or one-pointedness of mind is going to feel like. You are simply intent on keeping mindfulness firmly focused on one object – and the power of a mind focused firmly on one object is what will bring you to a state of concentration. You won't be thinking at all that concentration will be like this or like that, or that {{you want it to be}} like this or like that. It will simply take its own way, automatically. No one can force it. At that moment you will feel as if you are in another world (the world of the mind), with a sense of ease and solitude to which nothing else in the world can compare. When the mind withdraws from concentration, you will regret that that mood has passed, and you will remember it clearly. All that we say about concentration comes from the mind which has withdrawn from that state. As long as it is still gathered in that state, we aren't interested in what anyone else says or does. You have to train the mind to enter this sort of concentration often, so as to become skilled and adept, but don't try to remember your past states of concentration, and don't let yourself want your concentration to be like it was before – because it won't be that way, and you will just be making more trouble for yourself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Official synopsis: [...] "After one of {{his friends}} is killed in Iraq, Geoffrey Waters prays for help in {{understanding}} God's purpose for humanity. He is whisked forward in time to witness what a world could be <b>like</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> prophesies from Isaiah bring about peace on earth, and the lines 'Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven' come to fruition. The people on the planet he visits explain that God's kingdom will be established on Earth no matter what, even if a horrible calamity must occur." [...] The Bahá'í author notes that this book is her impression of what the future may be like based on the premise of fulfilled Biblical prophecy, with specifics from Bahá'í sources. There are several quotes and paraphrases from the Bahá'í Writings as well as examples of attitudes among various characters that believe as guided by these references, and the book was approved by the Special Materials Review Committee. Directly it only refers to the Bahá'í Faith as one of many religions mentioned in the foreword (which also mentions that it is meant to be the first of a trilogy.) Internally the strongest reference perhaps {{is the name of the}} Book of the religion of the future - [...] "Qadas", which is similar to [...] "Aqdas" [...] - the central Book of Laws, of the Bahá'í Faith. However [...] "Qadas" [...] could also be rather more obscure references ("the holiness of God", or a Muslim style of prayer for example.) The overall feel of the story is much like Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time - of grand themes being played out not through technological achievements, but of spiritual beings and achievements. Ralya has also published children’s stories, two full-length musicals, a weekly newspaper column in a Minnesota paper for about 2 years, and a novel for 9- to 15-year-olds which also has significant reference to the Bahá'í Faith.|$|E
