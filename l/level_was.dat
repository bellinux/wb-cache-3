5|$|A pinball minigame {{based upon}} Sonic the Hedgehog 2s Casino Night <b>level</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} as downloadable content via Steam on December 26, 2011. The minigame {{was included in}} the collector's edition and offered as a pre-order incentive for the console version.|$|E
5|$|A stone {{building}} {{to the east of}} the main complex is thought to have been the abbot's house. It contains two levels of vaulted apartments consisting of two halls, bedchambers, a private chapel and service rooms. The upper <b>level</b> <b>was</b> reached by an external staircase, which allowed this floor to be used independently if needed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and woolly {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea <b>level</b> <b>was</b> lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|Follicle-stimulating hormone and {{luteinizing hormone}} <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{considerably}} elevated (30-33 mIU/mL and 34-37 mIU/mL, respectively) and estradiol and estrone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> markedly elevated (145 pg/mL and 119-272 pg/mL, respectively), while testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> normal (445 ng/dL). Sex hormone-binding globulin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (6.0-10.0 nmol/L), while thyroxine-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, and prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> all normal. Osteocalcin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> both substantially elevated (18.7-21.6 ng/mL and 33.3-35.9 ng/mL, respectively).|$|R
50|$|One of {{her famous}} aphorisms compares the occidental {{economic}} model to a cake with four levels, with {{glass on the}} top: the first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> nature, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the subsistence economy, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> {{the public and private}} economy, and the last <b>level</b> <b>is</b> finance.|$|R
50|$|C4 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> low and C3 <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> normal.|$|R
5|$|As well as this, {{an entire}} {{sequence}} involving Tremble {{going to the}} front for the underground James Bond training school (which {{turns out to be}} under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest <b>level)</b> <b>was</b> never shot, thus creating an abrupt cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.|$|E
5|$|At Roosevelt Avenue on the IND Queens Boulevard Line, a two-track upper <b>level</b> <b>was</b> {{built for}} the Winfield Spur towards the line to the Rockaways. Unlike the other stations, this one was completed, except for track.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{territorial}} changes during World War II, {{this style of}} administration did not last, and the administration at the județ <b>level</b> <b>was</b> reintroduced after the war. Between 1941–1944, Romania administered the territory between the Dniester and Southern Bug rivers known as Transnistria, which consisted of 13 separate counties.|$|E
50|$|DDSN uses a {{capability}} {{model that}} consist of four levels. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Reacting, the second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Anticipating, the third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Collaborating {{and the last}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> Orchestrating. The first two levels focus on the internal supply chain while the last two levels concentrate on external relations throughout the Extended Enterprise.|$|R
50|$|Lowest <b>level</b> <b>is</b> A1 {{indicating}} beginner, top fluency <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> C1 and C2.|$|R
50|$|The serum {{fibrinogen}} <b>level</b> <b>is</b> usually {{low and the}} D-dimer <b>level</b> <b>is</b> elevated.|$|R
5|$|Empresas Departamentales de Acueducto y Alcantarillado (ACUAS) or Departmental Water and Sewerage Companies were created, {{consisting}} of the departments, the municipalities and INSFOPAL, which took care of managing and maintaining the infrastructure of the member communities. In that way, investment at the national <b>level</b> <b>was</b> channelled into this important area of public health.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different. Whereas {{today it is}} surrounded by sea, the water <b>level</b> <b>was</b> much lower in prehistoric times, when the polar ice caps were larger. The current peninsula {{was surrounded by a}} fertile coastal plain, with marshes and sand dunes supporting an abundant variety of animals and plants.|$|E
5|$|Kubota's income <b>level</b> <b>was</b> 205,000 koku, {{and it was}} {{classified}} as an outside (tozama) daimyō. The income level remained constant throughout its history. The domain often had agricultural crises, which resulted in several peasant uprisings {{throughout the course of}} its history. It was also beset by an internal o-ie sōdō conflict, the , which was brought on by financial issues.|$|E
50|$|In video systems, nominal <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> 1 VP-P for synched systems, such as {{baseband}} composite video, and 0.7 VP-P for systems without sync. Note {{that these}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> measured peak-to-peak, while audio <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> time averages.|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} has six stories, {{three of}} which are allocated for passenger processing. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for arrivals, the sixth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for departures, and the fourth <b>level</b> <b>is</b> for boarding. There are two partial levels: the mezzanine service level and the mezzanine <b>level</b> (which <b>is</b> the uppermost <b>level).</b>|$|R
30|$|Different <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{considered}} for centers and eventually one capacity <b>level</b> <b>is</b> selected for each center.|$|R
5|$|Above {{the small}} family/chaplain's {{room on the}} third floor, was the servant's room with a corner {{fireplace}} and two windows on the mezzanine floor, accessed via the main staircase. Above, on the roof <b>level,</b> <b>was</b> the Warder's Chamber containing a stone-hooded fireplace, beamed ceiling, two small windows in the east wall and a garderobe. There were also four closet-chambers in the turrets on the roof, used by staff.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the other GNP stations, the station {{building}} was designed by Leslie Green, though at Holborn the station frontage was, uniquely, constructed in stone rather than the standard red glazed terracotta. This was due to planning regulations imposed by the London County Council which required the use of stone for façades in Kingsway. The station entrance and exit sections of the street façade were constructed in granite with the other parts of the ground and first floors in the same style, but using Portland stone. The rest of the building above first floor <b>level</b> <b>was</b> constructed contemporaneously with the station. Access to the platform levels of the station was provided by trapezium-shaped electric lifts manufactured by Otis in America. These operated in pairs in shared circular shafts, with an escape stair in a separate, smaller shaft.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1943, {{following}} {{the capture of}} southern Italy, Allied aircraft started to appear over the Balkans. NDH military command was aware of this danger {{and was trying to}} persuade the Germans to provide at least two squadrons of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters to the ZNDH. However, instead of Bf 109s, the only reinforcement fighters that came from Germany were the first of a batch of 36 overhauled captured French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters in October, plus another dozen which arrived in December. The Germans also supplied 25 Beneš-Mráz Beta-Minor sporting two seater monoplanes, which were dispatched between the squadrons for liaison duty, as the lack of radio communications equipment at squadron <b>level</b> <b>was</b> still evident.|$|E
50|$|Points are tallied {{up at the}} end of each level, {{successful}} completion of which will unlock additional <b>levels.</b> <b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> rated in difficulty using a star system; one star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> relatively easy, while five star <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> the most difficult.|$|R
50|$|<b>Levels</b> <b>are</b> square mazes {{that grow}} larger as the player descends, {{simulating}} {{the design of}} a pyramid. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 3x3, totalling 9 squares. Each succeeding <b>level</b> <b>is</b> one step larger in each dimension (so the next <b>level</b> <b>is</b> 4x4 steps, for a total of 16 squares, and so on). A key on each must be found to unlock the next <b>level.</b> Ascension <b>is</b> impossible, which can strand players if an important item is left behind.|$|R
50|$|Estrogen <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> {{dramatically}} and persistently elevated (estradiol <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 2340 pg/mL, regarded as being about 10 times the normal level, and ranged from 750-3500 pg/mL), gonadotropin <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> mildly elevated (follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> 6.7-19.1 mIU/mL and 5.8-13.2 mIU/mL, respectively), and testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> slightly elevated (33-88 ng/dL). Inhibin A <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also markedly elevated. Sex hormone-binding globulin, corticosteroid-binding globulin, thyroxine-binding globulin, prolactin, and triglycerides, which {{are known to}} be elevated by estrogen, were all within normal ranges in spite of the extremely high levels of estrogen, and inhibin B <b>levels</b> <b>were</b> also normal. Her relatively mildly elevated <b>levels</b> of gonadotropins <b>were</b> attributed to retained negative feedback by progesterone as well as by her elevated levels of testosterone and inhibin A, although it was acknowledged that possible effects of estrogen mediated by other receptors such as ERβ could not be excluded.|$|R
5|$|During August and September 1326, Edward mobilised his defences {{along the}} coasts of England {{to protect against the}} {{possibility}} of an invasion either by France or by Roger Mortimer. Fleets were gathered at the ports of Portsmouth in the south and Orwell on the east coast, and a raiding force of 1,600 men was sent across the English Channel into Normandy as a diversionary attack. Edward issued a nationalistic appeal for his subjects to defend the kingdom, but with little impact. The regime's hold on power at the local <b>level</b> <b>was</b> fragile, the Despensers were widely disliked, and many of those Edward entrusted with the defence of the kingdom proved incompetent, or promptly turned against the regime. Some 2,000 men were ordered to gather at Orwell to repel any invasion, but only 55 appear to have actually arrived.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the EU {{directive}} 80/181/EEC had required that dual unit labelling of goods sold within the EU cease by the end of 2009. This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal <b>level</b> <b>was</b> to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, the EU postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Examinations in Maltese {{secondary}} schools are taken at both age 16 and 18, {{with the latter}} being a final optional set of matriculation examinations. The examinations taken at age 16 are the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) exams, which have operated since 1994, before which the GCE Ordinary <b>Level</b> <b>was</b> used as a secondary certificate examination. The examinations taken at 18, those enabling entry into university, are the Matriculation Certificate examinations, based on the International Baccalaureate. These examinations replaced the GCE Advanced Levels.|$|E
5000|$|Estradiol and LH <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{dramatically}} elevated due to loss {{of negative}} feedback by estradiol on the HPG axis. FSH <b>levels,</b> in contrast, <b>are</b> normal. Testosterone <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> also substantially elevated. Prolactin <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> decreased by 5-fold, which {{is due to}} a loss of its estradiol-induced secretion from the anterior pituitary.|$|R
50|$|Zimbabwe's {{public health}} care is {{delivered}} at four <b>levels,</b> which <b>are</b> meant {{to function as a}} referral chain. The first <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the primary <b>level</b> consisting of Rural Health Centres, Rural Hospitals and Urban Clinics (services do not require an attending Physician). The second <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the first referral level consisting of District Hospitals. The third <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the second referral level consisting of Provincial and General Hospitals. The fourth and final <b>level</b> <b>is</b> the third referral level to Central and Special Hospitals.|$|R
50|$|The {{first four}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> {{essentially}} cognitive (thinking), while {{the last four}} <b>levels</b> <b>are</b> affective (feeling) in nature.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording <b>level</b> <b>was</b> so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E
5|$|For the series' twentieth {{anniversary in}} 2011, Sega {{released}} Sonic Generations, {{a game that}} remade aspects of various past games from the franchise. A remake of the Sky Sanctuary stage was made for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game, while the Mushroom Hill <b>level</b> <b>was</b> remade for the Nintendo 3DS version of the game. Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing features a track inspired by the Death Egg as downloadable content along with the Metal Sonic character. The sequel, Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, featured the same race course, and an additional new one inspired by the Sky Sanctuary stage. Re-imagined versions of the Flying Battery and Lava Reef stages, along with the Blue Sphere bonus game, appear in the 2017 game Sonic Mania.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{received}} a call-up {{to the full}} England squad and won his first cap on 27 March 1996 as a substitute in a friendly against Bulgaria. His first start at international <b>level</b> <b>was</b> against Croatia which was the England game following his substitute appearance. Fowler {{was part of the}} England squad for Euro 1996, making two appearances in the tournament. On 14 December 1996, he scored four against Middlesbrough, including his hundredth for Liverpool. This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games.|$|E
