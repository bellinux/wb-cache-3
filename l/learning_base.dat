40|$|Abstract- Venous {{thrombosis}} is {{a common}} pathology that creates serious problems in public health. The diagnostic of thrombosis, particularly the determination of their relative ages can be efficiently accomplished by ultrasound imaging. This study intends to classify automatically the thrombosis ages by using a predefined <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> that depends on a prior knowledge of physicians. In practice, this <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> is affected by information imperfections of the type ambiguity since physicians cannot give exact thrombosis ages. Thus, the proposed <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> is constructed in a 3 -tuple: observation, label, membership value in term of fuzzy logic for each class and not a 2 -tuple as in the usual supervised Bayes classification application. By considering this “fuzzy learning base”, a method modeling simultaneously the concept of probabilistic uncertainty and ambiguity is proposed. In this approach, the probability for a given observation is considered on the membership value of each class {{and not on the}} class itself. At this level, the discussion focuses on two types of applications: the thrombosis ages classification and the definition of membership function by using a fuzzy <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> for classification...|$|E

40|$|International audienceRobot {{learning}} is a challenging – and somewhat unique – research domain. If a robot behavior {{is defined as a}} mapping between situations that occurred in the real world and actions to be accomplished, then the supervised learning of a robot behavior requires a set of representative examples (situation, desired action). In {{order to be able to}} gather such <b>learning</b> <b>base,</b> the human operator must have a deep understanding of the robot-world interaction (i. e., a model). But, there are many application domains where such models cannot be obtained, either because detailed knowledge of the robot’s world is unavailable (e. g., spatial or underwater exploration, nuclear or toxic waste management), or because it would be to costly. In this context, the automatic synthesis of a representative <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> is an important issue. It can be sought using reinforcement learning techniques – in particular Q-learning which does not require a model of the robot-world interaction. Compared to supervised learning, Q-learning examples are triplets (situation, action, Q value), where the Q value is the utility of executing the action in the situation. The supervised <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> is obtained by recruiting the triplets with the highest utility...|$|E
30|$|Parameter Space Extension methods {{increase}} the number of AAM parameters, in order to model the variability introduced in the <b>learning</b> <b>base,</b> which was used to create the face model. In Light modeling, a subspace in the parameter space is learned and built, in order to control the illumination variation. A modeling throughout the Illumination Cone [15, 16] or Light Fields [17, 18] is suggested. The illumination direction can also be estimated through the construction of a <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> of faces, which were acquired under a number of different illuminations, each of them being created by the variation of a single light source position [19]. The illumination variations are then modeled by the principal component analysis embedded in the AAM. All of those methods make the algorithm cumbersome, since the number of parameters needing optimization is increased, and the parameter space is broken up. The optimization, carried on a bigger and noncompact space parameter, is then more difficult to control. In 3 D modeling, the face pose variability is transferred from the appearance parameter space to the sub-space which controls the pose (face position and angle). Reference [20] introduces a new parameter to be optimized, using the pose information associated to each face represented in the <b>learning</b> <b>base.</b> A 3 D AAM can also be used either from the shapes and textures acquired from a scanner [21], or with a frontal and profile face view of each of the <b>learning</b> <b>base</b> face [22 – 24]. Reference [25] enriches the 3 D AAM's parameters by using the Candide model parameters related to Action Units to deform the mouth and eyebrows. The 3 D approach is clearly relevant to {{increase the}} AAM robustness related to the pose variability. Nevertheless, as the 3 D model becomes more complex, a real-time implementation remains difficult.|$|E

Moreover, the proposed novel system is able to infer the healthy status of human's daily eating. In the proposed system, the domain experts first define the nutrient facts of the common food to construct the fuzzy food ontology. Meanwhile, the involved Taiwanese students of National University of Tainan (NUTN) record their daily meals for a constant period of time.
