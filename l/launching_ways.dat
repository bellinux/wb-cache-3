In a holster at his hip, for instant use, cocked and with the safety on, was a large-caliber {{automatic}} pistol. With a final inspection and overhauling he took his seat in the aeroplane. He started the engine, and with a wild burr of gas explosions the beautiful fabric darted down the <b>launching</b> <b>ways</b> and lifted into the air. Circling, as he rose, to the west, he wheeled about and jockeyed and maneuvered for the real start of the race.|$|E
60|$|Women {{they had}} inevitably stolen after {{successful}} combats, and, in the end, being burdened {{with women and}} progeny, Somo had descended upon the mainland shore, driven the bushmen back, and established the salt-water fortress of Somo. Built it was, on its sea-front, like any island fortress, with walled coral-rock to oppose the sea and chance marauders from the sea, and with <b>launching</b> <b>ways</b> through the walls for the long canoes. To the rear, where it encroached on the jungle, it was like any scattered bush village. But Somo, the wide-seeing father of the new tribe, had established his boundaries far up in the bush {{on the shoulders of}} the lesser mountains, and on each shoulder had planted a village. Only the greatly daring that fled to him had Somo permitted to join the new tribe. The weaklings and cowards they had promptly eaten, and the unbelievable tale of their many heads adorning the canoe-houses was part of the myth.|$|E

The ships were pulled sideways from <b>launching</b> <b>ways</b> {{on the west side of}} the river onto a railway cradle and from there were lowered into the water. Canadian winters prevented the launching of ships from December to March.|$|E
5000|$|In 1916 the {{remaining}} land on Poplar Island {{was turned over}} to the BC Government. [...] During World War I the New Westminster Construction and Engineering Company built both a massive shipyard on the island and a bridge connecting it to New Westminster.

The facilities {{included a}} sawmill measuring 600 by 200 feet, various auxiliary shops, 1,000 feet of <b>launching</b> <b>ways,</b> and 1.5 miles of rail siding that was laid by the Long Island Rail Road. A news report published before the yard's opening said that construction would take 30 days, that the yard would employ about 250 people, and that its first contract was a U.S. government order for 30 barges of 100 feet in length and 32 feet abeam. Among the other work done by the Arverne shipyard was {{the construction of a}} 10,000-ton floating wooden drydock for $800,000 for the Emergency Fleet Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|The year 1923 was a {{particularly}} chaotic one on the Yangtze. By the early 1920s, the Patrol found itself fighting river bandits while maintaining neutrality between the regional warlords that were battling the Nationalist Kuomingtang forces and Communist Forces in an ongoing civil war. To accommodate this difficult military balancing act and the increased perils to U.S. citizens and economic interests, in 1925 Congress authorized the construction of six new shallow-draft gunboats. Construction took place in Shanghai at Kiangnan Dock and Engineering Works during 1926-27, with the [...] "new six" [...] launched in 1927-28, and all commissioned by late 1928 during Stirling's time as [...] "COMYANGPAT". These powerful new river gunboats, expressly designed to navigate the treacherous Yangtze and the 250 miles of rapids [...] "upriver" [...] from Ichang (1,000 mi. upriver) to Chungking, were to replace the three coal-fired Spanish-American War gunboats seized from Spain in the Philippines {{more than a quarter}} century earlier. Elcano, Villalobos, and Quiros had been patrolling the Yangtze since 1903; however age and their deeper drafts were proving increasingly problematic. The two gunboats built in the United States for service on the Yangtze, Palos and Monocacy were [...] "obsolete even as they slid down the <b>launching</b> <b>ways</b> in 1914." ...|$|E

40|$|Stratospheric airship is {{a special}} near-space air vehicle, and has more {{advantages}} than other air vehicles, such as long endurance, strong survival ability, excellent resolution, low cost, and so on, which make it an ideal stratospheric platform. It is of great significance to choose a reasonable and effective <b>way</b> to <b>launch</b> a stratospheric airship to the space for both academic research and engineering applications. In this paper, the non-forming <b>launch</b> <b>way</b> is studied and the method of differential pressure gradient is used to study the change rules of the airship’s envelope shape during the ascent process. Numerical simulation {{results show that the}} head of the envelope will maintain the inflatable shape and the envelope under the zero-pressure level will be compressed into a wide range of wrinkles during the ascent process. The airship’s envelope will expand with the ascent of the airship and the position of the zero-pressure level will move downward constantly. At the same time, the envelope will gradually form a certain degree of stiffness under the action of the inner and external differential pressure. The experimental results agree well with the analytical results, which shows that the non-forming <b>launch</b> <b>way</b> is effective and reliable, and the analytical method has exactness and feasibility...|$|R
5000|$|The LCT needed lifting {{onto the}} deck of the ship, being carried on {{wedge-shaped}} support blocks; at the time of launching she was set down on the [...] "launch ways" [...] by simply slacking off bolts in the wedge blocks, allowing the <b>launch</b> <b>way</b> to take the weight. To carry out a launch, the LST was simply heeled over about 11 degrees by careful flooding of tanks in the hull. The height of the drop was about 10 ft, and immediately after the launch the craft's engines were started and they were ready for operation.|$|R
50|$|The Eastern Company {{began the}} task of {{completing}} the ship. Work recommenced in May and took longer than expected to complete.

However, the <b>launch</b> <b>ways</b> and cradles would not be ready in time since the contract for their construction had only been placed in January 1857. Under pressure from all sides, the lease of the shipyard costing £1,000 a month, and against his better judgement, Brunel agreed to launch the ship on 3 November 1857 to catch the high tide.|$|R

5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found driven into the <b>launching</b> <b>way,</b> where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel keel plate. The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any unauthorized person attempting to approach the ship.|$|R

50|$|When {{the good}} news hit Pictou on October 9, 1941, the Pictou {{shipyard}} consisted of a marine slip with refit and repair capability. Major changes thus had to be made, <b>launch</b> <b>ways</b> had to be built, and more space had to be created. To create more space, the landmark of Battery Hill, Pictou, Nova Scotia was bulldozed {{to make room for}} the new yard. Along with the new developments, the new yard was taken over by Foundation Maritime Shipbuilding Limited. This allowed for the Ferguson brothers to retain the operations of the original marine slip and carry out repairs and refits to naval vessels. The first ship of the twenty-four ships built was the S.S. Victoria Park. It was launched on October 22, 1942, twenty-three in all would follow.|$|R

5000|$|These Liberty {{ships were}} {{completed}} in two-thirds {{the amount of}} time and at a quarter {{of the cost of the}} average of all other shipyards. The Liberty ship [...] was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods. They pre-assembled major parts of the ship including the hull sections at various locations in the shipyard and then, when needed, moved them with heavy lift cranes to the shipyard launching site where they welded the pre-built sections together.
