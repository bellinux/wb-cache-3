5000|$|Given {{the lack}} of {{integration}} of the subjects covered: arboriculture, empire, entail and, evolution, with most commonality between the latter pair, it strongly suggests that the manuscript submitted for printing solely comprised the main body text of Matthew's management rules, and his criticism of other planters. The references to appendices are printed in the footer area of the pages 2, 3, 4 and 135 (the only place where they are called appendices, abbreviated [...] "App.") and in the footer of page 293 (not abbreviated: [...] "* See Appendix F."), plus an additional reference to Note B from within the body text on page 374. Note D is omitted from direct mention, save the Contents page. Interestingly, the title to Note D on page 376 reads, Note D, p. 4., as if accommodating the oversight in the second instalment (see below) was easier and less costly than reprinting, or adding to page 4, even at the proofing stage. The addendum is not mentioned throughout the body text, but is appended to the <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>appendices</b> on the eighth Contents page.

40|$|Background: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s (NHANES) biospecimen {{program was}} formed to manage the {{collection}} of biospecimens (including serum, plasma, urine, and DNA) from NHANES cycles, the storage of biospecimens in NHANES biorepositories, accessing of biospecimens by researchers, and the providing of resulting data to future researchers. Data from biospecimen research can be combined with existing NHANES data. Objective: This report provides background {{on the development of}} NHANES biorepositories and describes the collection, processing, and storing of biospecimens; ethical considerations and informed consent; and the proposal process for accessing biospecimens and resulting data. The number and types of biospecimens collected in each survey cycle from NHANES III (198822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1994) through NHANES 199922 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 2014 are discussed so that researchers can understand what biospecimens are available if they are considering using NHANES biospecimens in their research.

40|$|Background: As {{the nation}} 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s {{principal}} health statistics agency, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides statistical {{information that can}} be used to guide actions and policy to improve the health of the American people. As part of its ongoing efforts to fulfill this mission, NCHS conducts several population-based and establishment surveys that provide rich cross-sectional information on risk factors such as smoking, height and weight, health status, and socioeconomic circumstances. Although the survey data collected provide information on a wide range of health-related topics, they often lack information on longitudinal outcomes. Methods: This report describes the second linkage conducted between several NCHS surveys and administrative records from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Social Security Administration, and the United States Renal Data Systems. A brief overview of the data sources, the methods used for linkage, descriptions of the resulting linked data files, and analytic guidance is provided. Conclusions: Through its record linkage program, NCHS has been able to enhance the survey data it collects by augmenting survey information with information from administrative data sources. These linkages of survey information with administrative data provide the unique opportunity to study changes in health status, health care utilization, and expenditures in specialized populations, such as low-income families with children, the elderly, and the disabled.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has been}} {{submitted to the}} Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade do Porto in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the PhD degree in Astronomy. The scientific results presented herein follow from the research activity performed {{under the supervision of}} Dr. Mário João Monteiro at the Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto and Dr. Hans Kjeldsen at the Institut for Fysik og Astronomi, Aarhus Universitet. The dissertation is composed of three chapters and a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>appendices.</b> Chapter 1 serves as an unpretentious and rather general introduction to the field of asteroseismology of solar-like stars. It starts with a historical account of the field of asteroseismology followed by a general review of the basic physics and properties of stellar pulsations. Emphasis is then naturally placed on the stochastic excitation of stellar oscillations and on the potential of asteroseismic inference. The chapter closes with a discussion about observational techniques and the observational status of the field. Chapter 2 is devoted to the subject of data analysis in asteroseismology. This is an extensive subject, therefore, a compilation is presented of the relevant data analysis methods and techniques employed contemporarily in asteroseismology of solar-like stars. Special attention has been drawn to the subject of statistical inference both from the competing Bayesian and frequentist perspectives. The chapter ends with a description of the implementation of a pipeline for mode parameter analysis of Kepler data. In the course of these two first chapters, reference is made to a series of articles led by the author (or otherwise having greatly benefited from his contribution) that can be found in Appendices A to E. Chapter 3 then goes on to present a series of additional published results. Comment: Author's PhD thesis (Universidade do Porto, June 2012...|$|E

40|$|Transnational {{communities}} are social groups {{that emerge from}} mutual interaction across national boundaries, oriented around a common project or 'imagined' identity. This common project or identity is constructed and sustained through the active engagement and involvement of {{at least some of}} its members. Such communities can overlap in different ways with formal organizations but, in principle, they do not need formal organization to be sustained. This book explores the role of transnational communities in relation to the governance of business and economic activity. It does so by focusing {{on a wide range of}} empirical terrains, including discussions of the Laleli market in Istanbul, the institutionalization of private equity in Japan, the transnational movement for open content licenses, and the mobilization around environmental certification. These studies show that transnational communities can align the cognitive and normative orientations of their members over time and thereby influence emergent transnational governance arrangements.

Co-creating drama can best be described as the coming together of teacher and students in a creative enterprise. The experience centres on the notion of the teacher as a co-artist, whereby they enliven qualities of creativity such as a “willingness to play, experiment, be a partner with learners, and to take risks” (Craft 1997, p 89). Co-creating is distinguished by the autonomous behaviour of the students and the artistic act of creating something of value to the group. It resonates distinctly within the theoretical frame of constructivism, as well as with more current inquiries of collaborative and creative drama practices. Classroom drama in an Irish context remains largely under-researched. It is argued that the knowledge base for teacher education should come from the teachers’ experiences in the classroom, but there has yet to be an in-depth study of teachers’ lived experiences of drama education in Ireland. In order to address this, a phenomenological inquiry was conducted into the experiences of teachers cocreating drama, with a view to gaining an in-depth understanding of the experience as perceived by them. Through a series of interventions and interviews, the teachers’ experiences and reflections were explored in order to portray the essence of the phenomenon. The analysis of the interviews has led to a multi-faceted understanding of co-creating drama. Three main themes emerged. The teachers discuss the practical implications of navigating the co-creating experience, the importance of teacher commitment, and the outcomes of co-creating drama. N...|$|E

40|$|A mutant M 47286 with a stunted growth, low {{fertility}} and dark-brown phenotype was identified from a T-DNA-tagged rice mutant library, the Taiwan Rice Insertional Mutant (TRIM). This mutant contained {{a copy of}} T-DNA tag inserted at the location where the expression of two putative tryptophan decarboxylase genes, TDC- 1 and TDC- 3, were activated. Enzymatic assays of both recombinant proteins showed tryptophan decarboxylase activities that converted tryptophan to tryptamine, which would be converted to serotonin by a constitutively expressed tryptamine 5 ' hydroxylase (T 5 H) in rice plants. Over-expression of TDC- 1 or TDC- 3 in transgenic rice recapitulated the stunted growth, dark-brown phenotype and resulted in a low fertility similar to M 47286. The degree of stunted growth and dark-brown colored phenotypes was proportional to the expression levels of transgenes TDC- 1 or TDC- 3. The level of tryptamine and serotonin accumulation in these transgenic rice lines were also directly correlated with the expression levels of TDC- 1 and TDC- 3. A mass spectrometry assay demonstrated that the dark-brown leaves and hulls in the TDC over-expressing transgenic rice were resulted by the accumulation of serotonin dimer and that the stunted growth and low fertility were also caused by the accumulation of serotonin and serotonin dimer, but not tryptamine. These results represent the first evidence that over-expression of TDC results in stunted growth, low {{fertility and}} the accumulation of serotonin, which when converted to serotonin dimer, leads to a dark brown plant color. 水稻T-DNA插入突變株M 47286 具有發育遲緩、低稔實與深褐色外表性狀。此突變株帶有單一T-DNA標誌，其插入位置造成兩個色胺酸脫羧酶 (tryptophan decarboxylase) 基因TDC- 1 與TDC- 3 的活化。TDC重組蛋白質之酵素活性分析結果顯示，二者皆具有色胺酸脫羧酶活性，可將色胺酸 (tryptophan) 轉化成色胺 (tryptamine) 。色胺進一步被水稻中的色胺酸- 5 -羥化酶 (tryptamine 5 ’hydroxylase, T 5 H) 轉化成血清素 (serotonin) 。大量表現TDC- 1 與TDC- 3 之轉殖水稻亦呈現與M 47286 相似之農藝性狀，如發育遲緩、深褐色外表性狀、低稔實等，其影響程度取決於轉殖水稻中TDC- 1 及TDC- 3 之表現量。轉殖水稻中之色胺與血清素的累積亦發現與TDC- 1 及TDC- 3 之表現量有正相關。質譜分析結果證實，TDC轉殖水稻之深褐色葉片與穀殼是由於血清素二聚體 (serotonin dimer) 之累積所造成的現象；發育遲緩與低稔實是因為血清素與血清素二聚體的累積所引起，而非色胺所導致的結果。本研究結果提供了初步的證據顯示，大量表現TDC之轉殖水稻具有發育遲緩與低稔實之農藝性狀，而其植株內所累積的血清素及血清素二聚體則會導致植株呈現深褐色的外表性狀。中文摘要 ……………………………………………………………………………………i Abstract ……………………………………………………………………………………ii List of Tables. ……………………………………………………………………………. vi List of Figures …………………………………………………………………… [...] . ……vi <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Appendices</b> …………………………………………………………………… [...] viii Abbreviations …………………………………………………………… [...] . ……………. ix Introduction ……………………………………………………………… [...] ……………. 1 Materials and Methods 	 1.
