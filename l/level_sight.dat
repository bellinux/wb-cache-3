50|$|Additionally, {{because the}} wind {{tends to be}} lower at low altitudes, and the {{aircraft}} generally travel faster, the relative effect of the wind is significantly less. Moreover, the pilot can easily adjust for any cross-wind visually without help from the bombsight. For this reason, a low-level bombsight simply doesn't need {{the same sort of}} windage correction complexity, and can ignore it completely in most cases. This {{was the case in the}} Low <b>Level</b> <b>sight,</b> who's only inputs were speed and altitude.|$|E
50|$|The Low <b>Level</b> <b>sight</b> {{used this}} angular {{velocity}} principle {{to time the}} drop. The aircraft's altitude {{and the type of}} bomb being used produced the time that the bomb would take to reach the ground, and when that was multiplied by the airspeed, the range was produced. The ballistics {{did not have to be}} more complex than that, there simply wasn't enough time for drag to be significant. The derivative of this calculation reveals the angular velocity of an object at that range as seen from the bomber's altitude and speed. To simplify operation, all of this was carried out in a simple mechanical computer.|$|E
50|$|The Ca.20 {{was derived}} from the Ca.18, an {{observation}} monoplane that had been developed starting in 1913 from the previous models Ca.8 and Ca.16. It used a more powerful engine, the Rhône. It used an unusual rounded nose cover for the wooden propeller which was cowled smoothly to match the fuselage. The cover was pierced to allow cooling of the engine. The improved aerodynamics helped speed and manoeuvrability. Designed as a fighter, a Lewis machine gun was installed above the pilot, placed above the propeller disc, with an eye <b>level</b> <b>sight.</b> The first synchronization devices, which allowed a weapon to shoot with confidence through the blades of a propeller in motion, would not make their appearance until the Fokker Eindecker during 1915, although many experiments had been conducted by the French since 1913.|$|E

50|$|The GP38-2 differs {{externally}} {{from the}} earlier GP38 only in minor details. Its most distinctive identifying feature is the cooling water <b>level</b> <b>sight</b> glass {{on the right side}} of the long hood. The battery box covers of the Dash 2s are bolted down instead of hinged. It can be distinguished from the contemporary GP39-2 and GP40-2 in that its Roots blown engine had two exhaust stacks, one on each side of the dynamic brake fan, if equipped, while the turbocharged GP39-2 and GP40-2 has a single stack. The GP39-2 has two radiator fans on the rear of the long hood like the GP38-2, while the GP40-2 has three. It was also available with either a high-short-hood, common on Norfolk Southern units, or a low-short-hood, which is found on most other railroads.|$|E
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15 is a {{derivative}} {{of the classic}} 1899 K-frame (medium frame) Military and Police [...]38 S&W Special (aka [...]38 Special) six-shot double-action revolver. The M&P underwent steady evolution throughout the 20th century and S&W spun off several variations as separate models in the post World War II years. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included {{a number of new}} and/or special features, including a six-inch barrel with a narrow rib to provide a <b>level</b> <b>sight</b> plane, a Patridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W’s [...]375” short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for overtravel, and improved grips. Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four-inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The major distinction between the K-38 Target Masterpiece and the K-38 Combat Masterpiece is the barrel length and the front sight.|$|E

The M16 uses an L-type flip, {{aperture}} rear sight {{and it is}} adjustable with two setting, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post, adjustable for elevation in the field. The rear sight can be adjusted {{in the field for}} windage.

The M16 also has a [...] "Low Light <b>Level</b> <b>Sight</b> System", which includes a front sight post with a small glass vial of (glow-in-the-dark) radioactive Tritium H3 and a larger aperture rear sight. The M16 can mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the M16A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be dialed in for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current issue M16A4s and M4s have detachable carrying handles and use Picatinny rails which allow for the use of various scopes and sighting devices. The current United States Army and Air Force issue M4 Carbine comes with the M68 Close Combat Optic and Back-up Iron Sight. The United States Marine Corps uses the ACOG Rifle Combat Optic and the United States Navy uses EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight.|$|E

5000|$|The M16's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original design, where the carry handle served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is 2.5 in over the bore, the M16 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15-20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The M16 has a 500 mm (19.75 inches) sight radius. The M16 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the effects of reading {{racetrack}} and flashcards when teaching phonics, sight words, and addition facts. The participants for the sight word and phonics portion of this study were two seven-year-old boys in the second grade. Both participants were diagnosed with a learning disability.

However, the results show that some students had more success with it than others. These outcomes clearly warrant further research...|$|E

The investigation involved three middle school students with moderate disabilities who participated in the state’s alternate assessment.
