5|$|Larry Silverstein of Silverstein Properties, the <b>leaseholder</b> and {{developer}} of the complex, retains {{control of the}} surrounding buildings, while the Port Authority has full control of the tower itself. Silverstein signed a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center site in July 2001, and remains actively involved in most aspects of the site's redevelopment process.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Square {{has also}} been used as name for the {{immediate}} surrounding area, roughly corresponding with Coventry Street, Cranbourn Street, Charing Cross Road and St Martin's Street. This includes Bear Street, Haymarket, Hobhouse Court (named after Sir John Cam Hobhouse), Hunt's Court (after Samuel Hunt, 17th century carpenter and <b>leaseholder),</b> Irving Street (after actor Henry Irving), Orange Street (named after William III, Prince of Orange), Oxdendon Street (after Sir Henry Oxenden, 1st Baronet), Panton Street (after local property dealer Thomas Panton), and Trafalgar Square.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, Koubek {{was hired}} to help {{renovate}} the long-shuttered, historic Willard Hotel. The original hotel (consisting of six townhouses joined together) was built in 1816, renovated and enlarged by <b>leaseholder</b> Henry Willard in 1847, and the current 12-story structure erected in 1901. Due to mismanagement and competition from more modern hotels, the Willard closed in 1968. With the redevelopment of Pennsylvania Avenue in the 1960s and 1970s, the Willard was threatened repeatedly with demolition. In May 1974, the National Trust for Historic Preservation paid Koubek $25,000 to study saving the hotel, either as a hotel, as a mixed-used structure, or as an office building. The Willard's owners, Charles Benenson and Robert Arnow, had earlier commissioned Koubek to design a modern office building for the site which would have required demolition of the structure.|$|E
50|$|The 1832 {{legislation}} {{left the}} Irish county electorate much the same, but some new qualifications {{added to the}} electorate. From 1832 the qualifications were £10 freeholders, <b>leaseholders</b> for lives and copyholders of estates of £10, <b>leaseholders</b> for at least 60 years and the assignees of the same or <b>leaseholders</b> for at least 14 years of £20 estates.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} two {{land tenure}} modes leasehold and freehold and models hous-ing maintenance incentives under land tenure security in Japan. Compared with freeholders, <b>leaseholders</b> are equally {{likely to remain}} in the premises, but spend less on home mainte-nance, because <b>leaseholders</b> are not full residual claimants, even under land tenure security. The empirical results show that maintenance expenditures of <b>leaseholders</b> are about 30 % lower than those of freeholders in the Japanese residential land market. Empirical evidence also indicates that <b>leaseholders</b> are equally likely {{to remain in the}}ir premises even when they undermaintain their dwellings...|$|R
40|$|Land tenure {{security}} law in Japan gives <b>leaseholders</b> a dual right: {{either they}} can renew the lease {{at the market}} rent, or {{they can make a}} claim on the landowner to purchase the premises at the market price. There is, however, a market imperfection {{because of the fact that}} <b>leaseholders</b> must incur a transaction cost in exercising the right of claim. Therefore, <b>leaseholders</b> are not full residual claimants even under land tenure security. Under this condition, we find theoretically and empirically that compared with freeholders, <b>leaseholders</b> are equally likely to remain in the premises, but they spend less on maintenance. ...|$|R
5|$|The damaged {{section of}} the Pentagon was rebuilt and {{occupied}} {{within a year of}} the attacks. The temporary World Trade Center PATH station opened in late 2003 and construction of the new 7World Trade Center was completed in 2006. Work on rebuilding the main World Trade Center site was delayed until late 2006 when <b>leaseholder</b> Larry Silverstein and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey agreed on financing. The construction of One World Trade Center began on April 27, 2006, and reached its full height on May 20, 2013. The spire was installed atop the building at that date, putting 1 WTC's height at 1,776 feet (541m) and thus claiming the title of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. One WTC finished construction and opened on November 3, 2014.|$|E
5|$|During the {{suspension}} of competitive football in the First World War, Hyde Road was used to stable 300horses. Later in the wartime period the club became the sole <b>leaseholder</b> of the ground, no longer dependent upon support from Chesters brewery. At this point the annual rent was £500. In 1920, the ground became the first football venue outside London to be visited by a reigning monarch; King George V attended the ground to watch a match between Manchester City and Liverpool. In November a fire caused by a cigarette end destroyed the Main Stand, and Manchester City began to seek a new home. Initial discussions {{raised the possibility of}} sharing Old Trafford with neighbours Manchester United, but United's proposed rent was prohibitive, so repair work was undertaken and Manchester City continued to play at Hyde Road.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool F.C. {{were formed}} in 1892, {{following}} a rent {{dispute between the}} <b>leaseholder</b> of Anfield, John Houlding, and Everton Football Club, which left Houlding with a ground but no club playing in it. In their first season Liverpool won the Lancashire League, and were elected to the Football League Second Division for the 1893–94 season, going {{on to win the}} title without losing a match. Their first season in the First Division ended in relegation, before they were promoted back the following season. Liverpool won the First Division {{for the first time in}} the 1900–01 season, and reached their first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. They won their first back-to-back titles in the 1921–22 and 1922–23 seasons; this was their last success until the 1946–47 season, when they regained the league title. Relegated in the 1953–54 season, they did not regain their place in the First Division until the 1962–63 season under the management of Bill Shankly.|$|E
50|$|August 2012 — the {{remaining}} <b>leaseholders</b> {{on the estate}} were served with a Compulsory Purchase Order by Southwark Council. The group of <b>leaseholders</b> said they intended to object to the Order {{on the grounds that}} the redevelopment plan proposes no affordable housing and does not have a provision for renewable energy.|$|R
50|$|The Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 is, amongst other things, very {{significant}} to <b>leaseholders</b> in England and Wales. Significant alterations {{were made to}} sections 18 - 30 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The 1987 Act also introduced three new things of lasting significance to long <b>leaseholders</b> of particular relevance {{in relation to their}} service charge liabilities. Firstly, it gave <b>leaseholders</b> and landlords specific rights to apply to a Court or Tribunal to vary the terms of a lease. Secondly, it introduced specific rules about retaining service charge contributions in designated trust accounts. Thirdly, it introduced an obligation for Landlords to provide their name and address when issuing service charge demands. Sections 47 and 48 of the 1987 Act state that without this information, service charge demands to <b>leaseholders</b> in England and Wales are invalid.|$|R
25|$|The KCTMO has a board {{comprising}} eight residents (tenants or <b>leaseholders),</b> four council-appointed {{members and}} three independent members. The tower was built as council housing, but 14 of the flats had been bought under the Right to Buy policy. These were occupied by <b>leaseholders,</b> or were privately rented out by {{them on the}} open market.|$|R
25|$|On March 23, 1828, Tayloe's father, Col. John Tayloe III, died. In 1816 Col. Tayloe {{had built}} six two-story houses facing Pennsylvania Avenue at 14th Street NW, and in 1817 had leased them to John Tennison who ran {{them as a}} hotel. The {{structures}} served as a hotel {{for the next three}} decades, the <b>leaseholder</b> and name changing several times: Williamson's Mansion Hotel, Fullers American House, and the City Hotel.|$|E
25|$|In 1536, Waverley Abbey was {{dissolved}} and {{the manor}} passed into secular ownership. St Bartholomew's Church was in regular use {{until at least}} 1675. By 1794, as <b>leaseholder,</b> the Quaker Morris Birkbeck was farming an estate of 1,500 acres (6.1 km2) at Wanborough, where he joined others in England and France who were experimenting with crossbreeding Merino sheep and innovating with modern techniques. He used {{the church as a}} wood store and barn. The church's architectural importance is reflected in its Grade I listing.|$|E
25|$|Betjeman {{was given}} the {{remaining}} two-year lease on Victorian Gothic architect William Burges's Tower House in Holland Park upon <b>leaseholder</b> Mrs E.R.B. Graham's death in 1962. Betjeman felt he could not afford the financial implications of taking over the house permanently, with his potential liability for £10,000 of renovations upon the expiration of the lease. After damage from vandals, restoration began in 1966. Betjeman's lease included furniture from the house by Burges, and Betjeman gave three pieces, the Zodiac settle, the Narcissus washstand, and the Philosophy cabinet, to Evelyn Waugh.|$|E

25|$|As {{the lease}} {{termination}} date approached, the <b>leaseholders</b> requested renewals. In the mid-1990s {{the park service}} told <b>leaseholders</b> it lacked the authority to renew leases and suggested they pursue a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Several preservation groups took up the cause, but Stiltsville twice failed to earn National Register status, primarily because the surviving houses weren't 50 years old.|$|R

25|$|Wik Peoples v The State of Queensland, (commonly {{known as}} the Wik {{decision}}) is a decision of the High Court of Australia delivered on 23 December 1996 on whether statutory leases extinguish native title rights. The court found that the statutory pastoral leases under consideration by {{the court did not}} bestow rights of exclusive possession on the <b>leaseholder.</b> As a result, native title rights could co-exist depending on the terms and nature of the particular pastoral lease. Where there was a conflict of rights, the rights under the pastoral lease would extinguish the remaining native title rights.|$|E
25|$|In July 1995, {{police were}} called in to {{investigate}} the sudden and unauthorised road transfer of two Mid-Norfolk Railway Society Mk 2 coaches to a breaker's yard at nearby Lenwade. In July 1996 Breckland District Council issued a threat to stop trains running at County School station, as {{it was found that}} someone other than the <b>leaseholder</b> was operating trains at the site; the lease being non-transferable. In November 1996 Breckland District Council brought in 24-hour security guards at the County School site in order to prevent the stripping of the property after having served an eviction order on the GER(1989) in mid-October.|$|E
25|$|Jurisdictions {{and states}} created fines and {{sentences}} {{for a wide}} variety of minor crimes, and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence blacks. Under convict leasing programs, African American men, often guilty of no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the <b>leaseholder.</b> Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the north and south. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor Anglo Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid 1960s to the late 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The Board of Trustees, {{composed}} of twelve resident <b>leaseholders</b> of Mount Tabor, manages affairs.

25|$|William Carpenter (Gen. 1) born about 1575 in England. He {{died after}} 2 May 1638 (Bevis {{passenger}} list) and certainly before 1644 when his son, William settled in Rehoboth. He was of Newtown, Shalbourne Parish, Wiltshire, England, by 1608, {{when he became}} a copyholder (semipermanent <b>leaseholder)</b> at Westcourt Manor (Westcourt Recs 7). Shalbourne, completely in Wiltshire since 1895, previously it straddled the line separating Wiltshire and Berkshire, with Westcourt comprising the Wiltshire part of the parish (Shalbourne Map); the Hampshire border was/is about four miles away. It is likely that William was born in one of these three counties. William's renewal of his Westcourt tenancy on 22 June 1614 gives his age as 40 (Westcourt Recs 7). The passenger list of the Bevis, the ship on which he left England, is dated 2 May 1638 and states William's age as 62 leading to an estimate of about 1575 for his birth.|$|E
25|$|In 1802, Taney {{still held}} {{the status of}} a Rural Deanery, {{including}} the churches of Taney itself (St. Nahi's), Kilgobbin, Rathfarnham, Stillorgan, Crumlin and Tallaght. As the local population (notably of Dundrum and Churchtown) and the parish membership grew, the old church became too small, and by 1809, discussions were well underway on replacing the parish church with a new and more spacious structure. The first formal proposal, for the site now occupied by Christ Church, was considered by the Select Vestry on 22 October 1809, but failed. However, after discussion with the <b>leaseholder</b> and the landowner, and other representations, moneys were sought from the Board of First Fruits, and £4,300 were lent. The decision to build was finally made in 1814, after a visit to the new church at Monkstown, which design was used as a model. Richard Ryan became curate in that year and oversaw construction, which commenced in mid-1815, with additional funds being raised by the sale of pews in 1816, as the budget was exceeded.|$|E
25|$|Title to {{the land}} under the future HUD {{building}} was held by the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, and site preparation began in November 1965. Groundbreaking and construction had already begun {{by the spring of}} 1966. John McShain, Inc., one of the largest federal building contractors in the Washington metro area, was named the lead construction contractor. A strike by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America temporarily delayed construction in May 1966. The building's cornerstone was laid by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey in November of that year. Unfortunately, during the HUD building's construction, the footings for the western portion of the building were accidentally built 1.5 to 3.5 feet (0.46 to 1 metre) over the property line. The three-feet-thick (1 metre) footings were 23 feet (7 metres) underground. When L'Enfant Properties, <b>leaseholder</b> of the property abutting the HUD site, began construction of L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in 1971, the company was forced to sue John McShain, Inc. and the Redevelopment Land Agency for removal of the footings, stabilization of the HUD structure, and associated costs. The action spawned several lengthy court battles which lasted through the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Despite the acclaim {{that the}} {{development}} has received from the design community, the complex design {{and management of the}} public realm has caused difficulties for the <b>leaseholders.</b> Most obviously, maintenance of such an environment is an expensive operation placing severe pressure on service charges and this has created a tension between <b>leaseholders</b> and the Managing Agents. These remain relatively affordable properties whose buyers may not be willing or able to pay significant additional costs to maintain the estate as a whole.|$|R
25|$|Much of Chelsea (SW3) and Knightsbridge (SW1X) {{is still}} owned by Earl Cadogan, through the Cadogan Estates. Most of the {{property}} owned is in and around Cadogan Square. This has {{a major influence on}} the markets as the Earl is the freeholder and generally has no desire to sell; although changes in legislation now mean the freeholder is obliged to sell lease extensions to a <b>leaseholder</b> at prices which are determined by the Leasehold valuation tribunal. Lord Cadogan is generally regarded as an effective and successful property developer/landlord being responsible, together with his management team, for bringing all of the fashion labels to Sloane Street, and also forward thinking developments on his own account at Duke of York Square on Kings Road, at Peter Jones and on Sloane Street. The Cadogan Estate has a considerable portfolio of retail property throughout Chelsea but notably on Fulham Road, Kings Road, and Sloane Street including Peter Jones, Harvey Nichols, and 12 hotels including the Cadogan Hotel. The Estate maintains many of the garden squares, (to which local residents can gain access by subscribing for an annual fee – and optionally the tennis courts where applicable). The area is home to several open spaces including Albert Bridge Gardens, Battersea Bridge Gardens, Chelsea Embankment Gardens, Royal Hospital Chelsea: the grounds of which are used by the annual Chelsea Flower Show and Chelsea Physic Garden.|$|E

On August 5, 2005, Horan and O'Malley filed a lawsuit against the assessor, asking that a judge prohibit the county from imposing property taxes. The owners asserted that their contract to run Park Grill was a property tax exempt concessionaire agreement and not a taxable lease. The state's attorney's office, which defended the assessor in the case, said [...] "our position is that the Park Grill is a <b>leaseholder</b> and as a <b>leaseholder</b> they are subject to taxes." [...] In 2009, an appellate court affirmed the circuit court's finding that the agreement to run Park Grill was not a lease but a license. In December, 2010 the Illinois Supreme Court with a 4-3 vote affirmed the lower court decisions maintaining the Park Grill’s [...] "agreement with the Park District created an untaxable license as opposed to a taxable lease" [...] to do business.|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} backing of several Jewish investors, {{including one of}} the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an informal lease agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940.

He initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers (including Abraham Bankier, who helped him manage the company) and 250 non-Jewish Poles. At its peak in 1944, the business employed around 1,750 workers, a thousand of whom were Jews.
