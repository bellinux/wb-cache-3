It was worthy of note that, of the dysentery patients examined, those in the age group 3 - 8 showed {{a higher level of}} ketone bodies as compared with other age groups. The level obtained with 23 dysentery patients was 14. 01 ≧ m ≧ 6. 69 mg/dl, which seemed to increase with the progress of the disease, reaching the maximum a few days after onset of the disease. Though the level obtained with ekiri patients, which was 29. 34 ≧ m ≧ 14. 04 mg/dl, was higher than that prevailing among dysentery patients, it was nearly equal to the level obtained with dysentery patients in the age group 3 - 8. In patients with Japanese encephalitis, the increase in the formation of ketone bodies both in the blood and spinal fluid was proved. In 3 among 8 patints examined, ketone bodies found in the spinal fluid were of higher concentration than those found in the blood. The prognosis of the patients with this phenomenon, which is presumed to be due to the promotion in permeability of the meninges, was poor in most cases. There was no uniform relation between the concentration of ketone bodies, the cell level in the spinal fluid and complement fixation reaction. Although the administration of <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose</b> for the treatment of dysentery and ekiri showed also an effect on the control of ketosis, the amount sufficient for inducing this action was 4. 0 g per kg of body weight in 24 hours, the dose of 2. 0 g per kg of body weight having resulted in a rise of the level of ketone bodies again {{because of the lack of}} sugar after a temporary fall.

40|$|The {{difficulties}} in the storage of fruit juice {{and the use of}} juice powder in various food processing industries has made the juice powder attractive to consumers and producers. Making powder from fruit juice {{is one of the most}} complex methods of fruit processing. The hygroscopic nature of fruit juice component and its thermoplastic properties has caused the drying time control and the transportation of the product from the drying zone to the next stage to become very difficult. In this investigation with laboratory spray dryer, the effective parameters on orange juice powder deposit on the wall of the spray dryer was studied. The results indicate that the powder can not be made without the use of additives. Using <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose</b> as an additive to orange juice concentration increased the dryer performance and reduced the wall deposit considerably. With the help of <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose</b> additive, spray dryer optimum conditions were obtained with a feed flow rate of 15 ml/min, inlet air temperature of 130 oC and outlet air temperature of 85 oC. The results from the statistical analysis of the experimental data show that the parameters of inlet air temperature and feed flow rate have significant effects on the dryer yield and wall deposit both individually and jointly. By increasing inlet air temperature and feed flow rate, the dryer yield decreased but wall deposit increased. In spite of using suitable additives, the wall deposit was still in the range of 14 to 65 %. The results of experiments indicate that the main cause of wall deposit can be attributed to the wall high temperature. It is, therefore, necessary to keep the wall temperature below the orange powder sticky point temperature to prevent rising temperature in wall deposit. For the orange powder containing 2 % moisture, the sticky point temperature is 44 oC. To control the wall temperature, a dryer with double partition wall chamber and a cooling system is proposed...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{cells in}} a {{developing}} culture of Acetobacter xylinum in a static <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose</b> medium were swept {{to the surface}} by the flotation of a submerged cellulose ndt. The net was probably pulled to the surface by adsorbed carbon dioxide given off by the metabolizing cells. The relatively high oxygen pressure at the aerated surface of a static liquid culture mediated the rapid production of cellulose in the surface layer. A. xylinum produced less cellulose in swirled than in static nutrient medium. Cellulose in the swirled medium occurred {{in the form of}} remarkable bodies, spherical, jointed or stellate in form, up to 10 mm. in size. The swirling favoured the overgrowth of the wild type organism by mutants which were specifically deficient in the ability to form cellulose. On the basis of the type of colonial growth and of the pellicle characteristics, two groups of A. x y h u m mutants with an extreme deficiency in cellulose-forming ability and one with an intermediate degree of deficiency were differentiated. An extracellular framework consisting of cellulose characterizes the growth habitat of Acetobacter xylinum (Franz & Schiebold, 1943; Aschner & Hestrin, 1946; Frey-Wyssling & Muhlethaler, 1946). The understanding of the morpho-genesis of this remarkable structure is relevant to efficient technical use of A, xylinum as an oxidizing organism and as a cellulose source (Evans & Hibbert, 1947) and {{to the use of the}} organism as a model system in which physical and chemical aspects of cell-wall production can be examined outside the cel...|$|E

A beverage was formulated with hydrolyzed WPC, skim milk powder, cocoa, <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose,</b> sugar and vegetable fat and analyzed for physicochemical properties, sensory attributes and keeping quality. Results revealed that the protein content of WPC was 75. 6 % and decreased slightly on enzyme treatment (69. 6 %). The water absorption capacity of WPC was 10 ml/ 100 g and increased in enzyme treated samples from 16 to 34 ml/ 100 g with increase in the time of hydrolysis. Emulsion capacity (45 ml of oil/g of control WPC) showed a decreasing trend with increasing time of hydrolysis. Enzyme treatment slightly increased the foam capacity in three samples but lowered foam stability in all. The gel filtration pattern of enzyme treated samples showed an increase in low molecular weight fractions. The amino acid profile showed higher content of methionine in samples treated with enzymes, compared to the control. The in vitro protein digestibility of untreated WPC was 25 % and increased in all treated samples to varying degrees (69 - 70 %). Formulated beverage had 52 % protein, 10 % fat and 6. 6 % ash.

The release of nicotine was studied in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer using a mastication device which simulated the mastication of chewing gum in human. The Latin Square design was used for the evaluation of organoleptic characteristics of the formulations at different stages of development. Results: Most formulations released 79 - 83 % of their nicotine content within 20 min. Nicotine-containing sugar-coated gums in which aspartame as sweetener and cherry and eucalyptus as flavoring agents were incorporated (i. e. formulations F 19 -SC and F 20 -SC, respectively) had optimal chewing hardness, adhering to teeth, and plumpness characteristics, as well as the most pleasant taste and highest acceptability to smokers.

The synthesis of surfactants was evaluated by emulsification index of cultural liquid, conditional concentration and concentrations of extracellular surfactants, which were determined gravimetrically after their extraction from supernatant with the mixture of methanol and chloroform. It was shown that addition of citrate and fumarate (0. 01...|$|R
40|$|In acute studies guar flour, guar {{powder and}} guar {{granules}} reduced mean post prandial insulin levels in normal subjects following <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose.</b> The flour and powder also reduced mean plasma GIP levels compared to glucose alone. Guar granules {{had no effect}} on the mean plasma glucose, insulin or GIP responses of either normal or non insulin dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects to a solid mixed meal but guar powder reduced mean post prandial plasma glucose, insulin, and GIP levels in both groups. Guar flour was not investigated. The mean glycosylated haemoglobin level of seven NIDDM subjects taking 25 g guar powder in bread daily for eight weeks was reduced after four weeks. Mean total serum cholesterol levels were also reduced whilst subjects were following the regimen but on termination returned to pretrial levels. In addition, the response to a meal immediately before and after supplementation was similar indicating guar powder has no carry over effect. Guar flour prevented the hypoglycaemia caused in two of six subjects by consumption of a drink containing alcohol and sucrose and a high carbohydrate snack. However it also caused higher blood alcohol levels and they appeared more intoxicated for five hours after the meal. When guar gum was given with a fat load it did not affect chylomicronaemia implying it is unlikely to impair bile salt reabsorption as has been suggested. Guar flour incorporation into a predominantly protein meal did not affect the rate of liquid or solid gastric emptying in normal subjects but significantly increased mean post prandial gastrin secretion. This {{may be due to the}} significant reduction in mean post prandial GIP levels also seen or to the buffering capacity of guar flour. None of the subjects enjoyed guar containing foods and it was difficult to prepare acceptable products. Therefore until a better formulation is available guar gum is of limited use in diabetic management...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 67 - 69) Through {{years of}} observation, diet recall checks and research, inadequate nutrition {{seems to be}} an important variable in learning behavior in school. Our extensive literature review substantiated three main views. They are: that a diet adequate in protein positively affects the ability to concentrate; that a diet high in sugar content often negatively affects the ability to concentrate; and, that the ability to concentrate greatly affects academic performance. This study sought {{to examine the effects of}} a liquid protein lunch versus the effects of a <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose</b> lunch upon specific tasks. Those tasks were to perform the following tests: reading comprehension, numerical ability, and hand coordination. The subjects were twenty boys enrolled in a private school and boarding during the week in a dormitory adjoining the school. The boys ranged in age from 14 to 18 years. The boys were all given identical breakfasts; then they took morning tests. For lunch, half the boys were given only the glucose drink and the other half, the protein drink. They were then retested in the afternoon. Each group's morning mean score was measured against the group's own afternoon mean score. Our hypothesis was that the glucose ingesting group would perform significantly less well on their post-test as compared to their pre-test than would subjects who had protein lunches. We found the protein group did do somewhat better than the glucose group. Diet may have an effect on learning that can be immediately measured. More studies need to be done on this relationship. Perhaps the ultimate value of this pilot study is that it provides guidelines that could be expanded upon for more sophisticated studies that might be extended over a longer period of time...|$|E
40|$|Cassava is an {{important}} crop in India, with an area of 289, 000 ha and production of 5. 6 million t of fresh roots in 1991. It is mainly cultivated in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and in the Northeastern states. A large variation in cassava consumption exists between {{urban and rural areas}} in India. About 70 % of cassava production in Kerala is used for food. In Tamil Nadu, however, only 25 % is used for human consumption, while the rest is used for industrial utilization, mainly for starch production. About 17 % of cassava production in the country is used for animal feed. Cassava is used in industry for production of starch, sago, <b>liquid</b> <b>glucose,</b> dextrin, vitamin C, gums and high-fructose syrup. Earlier agronomy research concentrated on the development of cultural practices and soil fertility management for cassava grown in monoculture. Recently, research has focused on the development of cassava-based cropping systems, soil fertility management with emphasis on micronutrients and bio-fertilizers (especially VA-mycorrhiza), low-input technology, water management and production practices for non-traditional areas. Short-duration cassava cultivars were shown to produce higher root yields at closer spacing of 75 x 75 cm, while for cassava grown under coconuts a plant population of 8000 /ha was found to be optimum. Under intercropping with groundnut or cowpea the paired-row cassava system performed best. In acid infertile soils in Kerala, continuous cropping of cassava with application of only NPK chemical fertilizers resulted in a depletion of Ca, Mg, Cu and Zn in the soil. From the study on interrelationships of cations the optimum doses of K, Ca and Mg were found to be 146 kg K^O, 56 kg Ca and 37 kg Mg/ha. Incorporation of ZnSO at 12. 5 kg/ha increased the root yield 12 %. An NPK application of 50 : 62 : 62 kg/ha was sufficient for the cassava-ground nut intercropping system if the haulms of groundnut were turned back into the soil. For cassava grown under coconut an NPK rate of 50 : 50 : 100 kg/ha gave higher net returns. For rice-cassava sequential cropping on paddy soils the P application rate to cassava could be reduced to 25 kg P O /ha. In calcareous soils of Tamil Nadu short duration cassava cultivars performed better at lower levels of NPK (75 : 25 : 75 kg/ha). Application of a liquid NPK fertilizer at the rate of 8 - 8 - 8 kg/ha was equally effective as the same rate applied in solid form. Inoculation of VA mycorrhiza (VAM) enhanced the dry matter production, root yield and uptake of P, Cu and Zn in cassava. For successful field inoculation a nursery techniquewas developed. To realize the production potential of high-yielding cassava, the application of NPK at 150 : 100 : 150 kg/ha and supplementary irrigation at an IW/CPE ratio of 1 were found necessary. In cassava-groundnut intercropping systems, supplementary irrigation during drought periods at 25 mm/week enhanced the yield of both crops. Studies on effects of subsoil moisture on cassava showed that a shallow water table (around 40 cm from the surface) depressed root yields...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} {{aflatoxin}} accumulation in the filamen-tous fungus Aspergillus parasiticus is modulated {{by a variety}} of environmental cues. The presence of glucose (a preferred carbon source) in <b>liquid</b> and solid <b>glucose</b> minimal salts (GMS) growth media strongly stimulated aflatoxin accumulation. Peptone (a non-preferred car-bon source) in peptone minimal salts (PMS) media stimulated only low levels of aflatoxin accumulation. Glucose stimulated transcription of the aflatoxin structural genes ver- 1 and nor- 1 to similar intermedi-ate levels in liquid GMS, while on solid media, ver- 1 transcription was stimulated to 20 -fold higher levels than nor- 1. PMS liquid and solid media stimulated very low or non-detectable levels of transcription of both genes. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis using...|$|R

It is useful for decreasing the effect of inhibitors when the substrate through the capsule. It can be considered as a spherical pored catalyst, which contains yeast within the capsule. The capsule has 3 main parts, i. e. capsule membrane, cell pellet and <b>liquid</b> core. <b>Glucose</b> consumption by encapsulated yeast was modeled as a diffusion and reaction process. The diffusion included effects of different diffusivities of the capsule membrane (Dm) and cell pellet (Dc). The reaction was assumed by following Monod kinetics. Comsol Multiphysics was used to simulate mass transfer effect in encapsulated cells using the finite element method. Simulation was set in 2 D and geometry was set in axis stmmetry. Steady state concentration profiles were obtained after 24 hours depending on the diffusivity in membrane and cell pellet. Steady state glucose limitation was only apparent if Dc or Dm was ≤ 1 % of the diffusivity in water. However, temporary glucose limitation was observed after 1 and 2 hours cultivation in many cases. The internal diffusion is more affect to rate concentration limiting because of cell diffusivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} and coordination properties of complexes formed upon {{the interaction of}} copper(II) and chromium(II) chlorides with dialkylimidazolium chloride (RMIm+Cl-) ionic <b>liquids</b> and <b>glucose</b> are studied {{by a combination of}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). In the absence of the carbohydrate substrate, isolated mononuclear four-coordinated MeCl 42 - species (Me = Cu, Cr) dominate in the ionic liquid solution. The organic part of the ionic liquid does not directly interact with the metal centers. The interactions between the RMIm+ cations and the anionic metal chloride complexes are limited to hydrogen bonding with the basic Cl- ligands and the overall electrostatic stabilization of the anionic metal complexes. Exchange of Cl- ligands by a hydroxyl group of glucose is only favorable for CrCl 42 -. For Cu 2 + complexes, the formation of hydrogen bonded complexes between CuCl 42 - and glucose is preferred. No preference for the coordination of metal chloride species to specific hydroxyl group of the carbohydrate is found. The formation of binuclear metal chloride complexes is also considered. The reactivity and selectivity patterns of the Lewis acid catalyzed reactions of glucose are discussed in the framework of the obtained results...|$|R
