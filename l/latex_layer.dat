40|$|Three-layer systems (membrane – {{composite}} layer (cells + polymer) – membrane) {{are important}} in different biochemical applications. Models of latex layered-membranes were evaluated and compared with experimental data in order to predict the diffusivity of substrates in the composite layer containing living E. coli microbial cells. Diffusivity predictions are dependent on the presence or {{the absence of a}} ‘skin’ layer, on the degree of polymer particle coalescence and on the thickness of each layer. Simulations with layered models were made to identify the dominant mechanisms in the three-layer system. It was found that the layered system is sensitive to the latex coatings porosity when the composite layer occupies less than 50 % of the total membrane system thickness. Whenever the control of polymer particle coalescence and of the layers (coating/composite layer) thickness may be achieved, multi-layer systems presenting a wide range of relative diffusion conductivities may be built for different types of living cells and {{for a wide variety of}} practical applications. The diffusivity of the <b>latex</b> <b>layer</b> is proportional to the square of latex porosity. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT); FEDER...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mould {{cleaning}} {{process is}} the process of removal build-up deposited or residue material on the mould surface after repeated cycles of production. The currently used mould cleaning process is sand blasting (abrasive process) and dry rubber mould cleaning compounds (depends on the skill of the operators during rubber compounding). Latex laminated compounds will be beneficial as a new substitute for mould cleaning because of its excellent strength properties and the lamination process to increase its thickness. The main focus of this research is to investigate the effect of lamination process on tensile properties and mould cleaning efficiency of laminated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (NBR) latex composites. Laminated NBR latex films with cleaning agent and waste latex compound was prepared by arranging half-cured latex sheets with various thicknesses of outer layer (NBR latex films with cleaning agent) and core layer (waste NBR latex film). The core and outer layers are prepared through casting method with different thickness. The laminated films were subjected to compression moulding using hot press at 120 oC. Reinforcement of the core layer gives laminated latex composite with better tensile properties, but excessive of core layer portion reduced the elongations of laminated films. The efficiency of mould cleaning of laminated NBR latex films were dependent on the flow ability and adhesion properties of the fresh <b>latex</b> <b>layer</b> with mould cleaning agent (outer layer) ...|$|E

To {{prepare the}} {{nano-scale}} silver carboxylate emulsions and investigate their {{applications in the}} preparation of nano-scale silver films, the silver citrate emulsion was synthesized through the reaction of silver nitrate with sodium citrate in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surface modification agent in water. The emulsion was coated onto the surface of the PET substrate to form a thin <b>latex</b> <b>layer</b> of silver citrate. And this was followed by drying at about 100 °C. Then, the silver citrate thin film was deoxidized by aqueous ascorbic acid. Finally, a translucent silver thin film was formed {{on the surface of the}} PET substrate. Properties of the silver citrate emulsion and the silver film on the PET were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), laser particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry(TG),UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy(AFM) and digital multimeter analysis. It was found that the silver citrate particle surface-modified by PVP has a nano-rod structure and homogeneous size distribution. The nano-rod was about 20 nm in diameter and 200 nm in length. For the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the thin film exhibited an absorption peak at 430 nm, the silver thin film prepared on the surface of the PET substrate was a typical nano-scale sliver film.

40|$|Due to the {{worldwide}} aging population, {{methods have been}} sought to improve the efficiency of health care services. It is envisaged that remote monitoring of patients would form part of the solution. Monitoring of patients would be via the use of functionalised undergarments with the required technology embedded within. There have been significant advances in flexible electronics but metal wires are still required for electrical interconnects which compromise the comfort that the garment offers when in contact with skin. Electrically conductive polymers are considered as viable replacements for these metal wires. Electrically conductive polymers can have high electrical conductivities {{but they can be}} brittle due to their inherent stiffness. From studies reported in this thesis, various routes to the synthesis of PEDOT, which would lend itself to function in crease and wash resistant conductive inks, were investigated. The task was highly challenging due to the confliction between high conductivity and structural rigidity of typical conductive molecules. A series of monomers, described within, were designed, synthesised and characterised. These monomers provide a foundation for further syntheses to the subsequent novel electrically conductive polymers. In order to assess potential challenges in the formulation of crease and wash resistant conductive inks based on conductive polymers, systems containing PEDOT:PSS were designed, prepared and characterised. It was found that the use of just PEDOT:PSS as the coating for cotton fabric provided an electrically conductive coating which was susceptible to degradation during creasing and washing. To overcome this challenge, a composite of a synthesised latex and PEDOT:PSS was devised which provided an electrically conductive coated cotton fabric with an electrically insulating surface. The electrical resistance could still be measured by incorporating electrodes prior to the application of the final <b>latex</b> <b>layer.</b> Encouragingly, this composite provided a formulation having very low electrical resistances pre- and post-wash...|$|E
40|$|The pH-responsive {{behavior}} {{for a series}} of lightly cross-linked, sterically stabilized poly(tertiary amine methacrylate) - based latexes adsorbed onto mica and silica was investigated using in situ tapping mode AFM at room temperature. The adsorbed layer structure was primarily determined by the glass transition temperature, Tg of the latex: poly[2 -(diethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] - based particles coalesced to form relatively featureless uniform thin films, whereas the higher Tg poly[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl methacrylate] latexes retained their original particulate character. Adsorption was enhanced by using a cationic poly[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] steric stabilizer, rather than a nonionic poly(ethylene glycol) -based stabilizer, since the former led to stronger electrostatic binding to the oppositely charged substrate. Both types of adsorbed latexes acquired cationic microgel character and swelled appreciably at low pH, even those that had coalesced to form films. Fluorescence spectroscopy was used to study the capture of a model hydrophobic probe, pyrene, by these adsorbed <b>latex</b> <b>layers</b> followed by its subsequent release by lowering the solution pH. The repeated capture and release of pyrene through several pH cycles was also demonstrated. Since these poly(tertiary amine methacrylate) latexes are readily prepared by aqueous emulsion polymerization and adsorption occurs spontaneously from aqueous solution, this may constitute an attractive route for the surface modification of silica, mica and other oxides...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{introduction}} of legislation restricting the manufacture and use of coatings containing volatile organic solvents, alternative waterborne coatings are increasingly being adopted for adhesive, protective, and decorative applications. Better understanding is therefore sought of the behaviour of waterborne coatings during drying and film formation, and of their physical characteristics after film formation is complete. This thesis describes one-dimensional Magnetic Resonance Imaging studies {{of the distribution of}} water and solid particles through the depth of aqueous <b>latex</b> <b>layers</b> during drying which investigate how particle distribution and concentration are influenced by the competing forces of diffusion and evaporation. The manner in which the balance of these forces affects the formation of a crust or dry layer at the latex-air interface is also investigated.

This {{study was designed}} to investigate whether, and to what extent, aneurysm wall compliance influences intra-sac pressure. Design. In vitro experimental study. Methods. Aneurysm models with six and 12 <b>latex</b> <b>layers</b> were produced, resulting in elastic and stiff circumferential compliance (3. 5 ± 0. 5 and 0. 9 ± 0. 3 %/ 100 mmHg, respectively). The models with an 18 mm internal neck and maximum aneurysm diameter of 60 mm were inserted into an in vitro circulation system. The systemic mean pressure (SPmean) was varied from 50 to 120 mmHg. After the aneurysm was excluded with a knitted polyethylene graft, aneurysm sac mean pressure (ASPmean) and aneurysm sac pulse pressure (ASPpulse) were measured. Data are presented as mean±SD. Statistics were performed using repeated measurements of variance; p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. In the model EVAR created a closed chamber without endoleak, but with an aneurysm sac pressure related to wall compliance. In the elastic aneurysm model with six latex coats the aneurysm sac mean pressure (ASPmean) and the aneurysm sac pulse pressure (ASPpulse) at all systemic pressures were significantly lower {{than they were in the}} stiffer model with 12 latex coats (p< 0. 05). At a SPmean of 90 mmHg, the ASPmean was 21. 0 ± 0. 9 mmHg (six latex coats) and 26. 0 ± 0. 2 mmHg (12 latex coats) (p< 0. 05), the ASPpulse was 5. 7 ± 0. 2 mmHg (six latex coats) and 8. 8 ± 0. 3 mmHg (12 latex coats) (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of nanosized copolymer latexes by the polymerization in miniemulsions prepared by the classical high energy and the low energy phase inversion concentration (PIC) methods. In addition, the encapsulation of various organic pigments with copolymer <b>latex</b> <b>layers</b> was carried out {{on the basis of}} miniemulsion polymerization. The obtained nanosized copolymer particles or encapsulated pigments have been successfully used as binders or hybrid binders for textile printing applications. The first part {{deals with the}} preparation of nanosized copolymer latexes in a diameter size range between (50 - 100 nm) by the classical miniemulsion polymerization method. The copolymer latexes composed mainly of a high content of the soft butyl acrylate monomer (BA) and a low content of the hard methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer. The addition of small amounts of functional monomers such as methacrylic acid MAA and N-methylol acrylamide NMA to some miniemulsion recipes allowed to impart cross-linking sites and functionality to the copolymer chains. The particle size analysis, structure characterization and thermal properties of the latexes were investigated by many analytical techniques such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The optimized miniemulsion latexes were applied successfully as binders for the pigment printing and inkjet printing of cotton fabrics. The main objective of this part was to examine the application of the miniemulsion latexes as binders in the textile printing processes {{in order to reduce the}} risk of agglomeration and cloaking of the printer screens and nozzles during the printing process. The evaluation of the printed fabrics showed that the miniemulsion binders with their smaller size offered technological advantages over the conventional processes for the conventional and inkjet printing processes as well as the better print properties. Accordingly by optimized use of the miniemulsion method one is not only able to control the particle size but also to improve the properties of these latexes for textile applications. In the second part, we studied the encapsulation of organic pigments with polymer <b>latex</b> <b>layers</b> by miniemulsion polymerization. Such polymer-encapsulated pigments then can be applied for inkjet printing without addition of separate binder additives, thereby reducing the risk of unfavorite interactions between the separate latex and pigment particles. The encapsulation of C. I. Pigment red 112 was systematically studied by a miniemulsion polymerization of pigment/butyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate (BA-MMA) or styrene-co-butyl acrylate (St-BA) copolymers. The ratio of monomer to pigment was varied in order to find optimum conditions for the preparation of self-curable hybrid pigment inks for the textile inkjet printing application. The particle size and polydispersity of the pigment dispersions and pigment hybrid latex particles were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), disc centrifuge particle size analyzer and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The efficiency of the polymer encapsulation and the thermal properties of the hybrid inks were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The evaluation of the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics with different encapsulated and non-encapsulated pigment colors showed that the encapsulated inks without addition of separate polymer latex binder generate fully satisfying values that compare favourably in terms of color strength, rubbing and washing fastness to the non-encapsulated conventional inks, while avoiding problems of clogging and colloidal instability. In the last part, the low energy phase inversion composition (PIC) method was used for the formation of monomer based nanoemulsions from a system composed of monomer/Brij 78 /water. These nanoemulsions were used as templates for generating polymer and copolymer nanoparticles. Styrene was used as monomer for studying the phase diagram, where parameters such as the O/S ratio and water addition rate influence the formation of the nanoemulsion and the structure of the final polymer particles. Hexadecane was added to the oil phase with a concentration 4 wt% (relative to the oil) to achieve stability against Oswald ripening. Nanoemulsions with a fixed water content of 80 wt% and O/S ratios from 0. 25 to 9 generated polymer particles with diameters between 30 to 110 nm as determined from dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The polydispersity of the polymer nanoparticles was found to be dependent on the O/S ratio. Different copolymer latexes based on styrene, butyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate were prepared with a fixed O/S ratio 9 and water content 80 %, applied successfully as binders for the inkjet printing of cotton fabrics and compared to corresponding copolymer latexes prepared by the high-energy methods or the conventional methods. The results indicated that PIC method constitutes a very interesting and innovative way to generate nanosized polymer latex particles using a simple setup of emulsification experiments. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die Herstellung von Copolymer Latices durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation und die bisher hierfür noch wenig eingesetzte Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode untersucht. Zudem wurde die Verkapselung verschiedener Pigmentfarben über das Konzept der Miniemulsionspolymerisation durchgeführt. Die durch die verschiedenen Methoden hergestellten Copolymer Teilchen bzw. die verkapselten Pigmente wurden erfolgreich als Bindemittel für Textildruckanwendungen angewendet. Das erste experimentelle Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit der Herstellung von Copolymer Latices im Größenbereich von 50 - 100 nm hergestellt durch die klassische Miniemulsionspolymerisation. Diese Copolymer Latices bestehen hauptsächlich aus einem hohen Anteil an weichem Butylacrylat-Monomers (BA) und einem niedrigen Gehalt an hartem Methylmethacrylat (MMA) Monomer. Die strukturelle Charakterisierung und die thermischen Eigenschaften der Latex Teilchen erfolgte durch viele analytische Verfahren, wie dynamische Lichtstreuung (DLS), Kleinwinkelneutronenstreuung (SANS), Transmissionselektronenmikroskopie (TEM), Gel-Permeations-Chromatographie (GPC) und Registrierende Differentialkalorimetrie (DSC). Die optimierten Miniemulsion Latices wurden dann erfolgreich als Bindemittel für den Pigmentdruck und Tintenstrahldruck von Gewebe aus Baumwolle eingesetzt. Das Hauptziel dieser Teil der Arbeit war es, die Anwendung der Miniemulsion Latices als Bindemittel in Textildruckverfahren zu untersuchen, wobei diese das Risiko von Agglomeration und damit das Verstopfen der Düsen während des Druckprozesses verringern sollen. Dieser Nachteil resultiert meist aus unerwünscht hohen Partikelgrößen, der Form der herkömmlichen Bindemitteln oder auch anderen Bestandteilen. Die Auswertung der Druckexperimente ergaben, dass die Miniemulsion basierten Bindemittel mit ihrer geringeren Größe technologische Vorteile gegenüber den herkömmlichen Verfahren bieten, sowohl für das konventionelle Druckverfahren als auch für das Tintenstrahldruckverfahren und dabei auch zu verbesserten Druckeigenschaften führen. Der zweite Teil der Dissertation befasst sich mit der Verkapselung des organischen Pigments durch Polymerlatex Schichten, um die Agglomeration der Pigmentpartikel zu minimieren und ihre Stabilität und Dispergierbarkeit zu verbessern, was zu deren verbesserten Anwendbarkeit beitragen soll. Die Verkapselung der Pigmente wurde durch Miniemulsionspolymerisation mit verschiedenen Monomeren wie Styrol, Methylmethacrylat oder Butylacrylat durchgeführt. Die Analyse der Partikelgröße sowie der Einkapselungseffizienz der verkapselten Pigmente wurde mit Hilfe vieler analytischer Methoden untersucht und mit den nicht verkapselten Pigmenten verglichen. Die verkapselten Pigmente wurden dann erfolgreich als Tinten formuliert und ohne technische Probleme, wie das Verstopfen der Düsen der Druckmaschinen, für das Tintenstrahldrucken von Gewebe aus Baumwolle verwendet. Der letzte Teil des Projektes beschäftigte sich mit der Herstellung von Latex Teilchen mit einem Durchmesser von ca. 30 - 100 nm, die durch Nanoemulsionspolymerisation hergestellt wurden, wobei die Nanoemulsionen durch die Phase Inversion Concentration (PIC) Methode hergestellt wurden. Die monomerhaltigen Nanoemulsionen waren Systemen bestehend aus Wasser, Monomer und nichtionischen Tensids. Wir verwendeten Styrol als Monomer für die systematische Untersuchung des Phasenverhaltens und der Bildung der Monomer-Nanoemulsion sowie deren anschließender Polymerisation. Das Phasenverhalten des Systems aus Wasser / Brij 78 (Polyoxyethylen (20) Stearylether) / Styrol ergab den geeigneten Bereich, in dem mit Monomer Nanoemulsionen gebildet werden können. Die Polymerisation in den PIC Nanoemulsionen wurde dann mit verschiedenen Monomeren durchgeführt, um entsprechend unterschiedliche Copolymerpartikel zu synthetisieren.

The adhesion of layers is based on electrostatic attractions. Several dual-layer capillaries were characterised for their EOF and ion-exchange capacity and this showed that coatings could be prepared reproducibly by a simple flushing procedure.

Additional compression of the <b>latex</b> and grease <b>layers</b> (at the top and bottom caps) associated with possible inaccuracies of the employed bedding error correction method (Sarsby et al. 1980; Russell and Khalili 2004) may have also contributed to the larger compressibility of the smaller specimens.

The lower deviator stresses of the larger specimens (in Figs.  4 and 6) could be associated with the more intense strain-softening resulting from shearing along longer and larger number of shear bands formed in larger specimens and the differences in the available space or freedom for particle rearrangement in the specimens of different sizes. Similar mechanisms leading to specimen size effects have been also observed in compression tests (Andrews et al. 2001; Bastawros et al. 2000; Chen and Fleck 2002; Hakamada et al. 2007; Jeon and Asahina 2005; Park and Nutt 2001) and in numerical modeling studies (Chen and Fleck 2002; Onck et al. 2001; Tekoglu et al. 2011) of foam materials.

The particle and layer densities are calculated by two independent methods, namely one {{based on the measured}} aerodynamic and mobility diameters and the other based on the measured mobility diameter and particle mass. The uncertainty estimates for density calculated by the second method are two to three times greater than those of the first method. Both methods indicate that the layer density increases from 0. 89 to 1. 12 g·cm - 3 with increasing ozone exposure. Aerosol mass spectrometry shows that, concomitant with the increase in the layer density, the oxygen content of the reacted layer increases. Even after all of the oleic acid has reacted, the layer density and the oxygen content continue to increase slowly with prolonged ozone exposure, a finding which indicates continued chemical reactions of the organic products either with ozone or with themselves. The results of this paper provide new insights into the complex changes occurring for atmospheric particles during the aging processes caused by gas-phase oxidants...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time {{pervaporation}} separation of miscible liquids have been investigated with three and five layered composite membranes with layers of Natural Rubber <b>Latex</b> (NRL) and <b>layers</b> of hydrophilic, hydrophobic or organophilic polymers which are placed {{on top of each}} other. NRL was used in all different types of the membranes, mixed with hydrophilic polymers in blend membranes and in a layer shape in the three or five layered composite membranes. Methyl Cellulose (MC), Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) and Hydroxypropyl Methyl Cellulose (HMC) were used as hydrophilic polymers to increase the water selectivity of the membrane and in contrast, Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) and Polydimethylsilane were used to increase organic component selectivity in the membranes. These membranes were used to separate miscible liquid solutions including ethanolwater, propanol 2 -water and acetone-waterT. he composition of organic componenti n the feed was varied within the range of 20 to 90 % w/w. The temperature of operation was kept constant to 20 'C. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) has been used to study the distribution of polymers within the membranes. Morphological features of the cross section and top surface of the membranes have been used to develop a probable mechanism of water or organic component transfer through the membrane. For {{the first time}} ever, DMTA technique has been used to identify the type of membranes which can be used to increase the water selectivity (by studying the changes in the glass transition temperatureo f the NRL, blend and compositem embranes). Both SEM and DMTA techniques have proved that the presence of hydrophilic polymers as in layer forms in the three or five layered composite membranes was the reason for good distribution of polymers throughout the membrane. It has been established that a very strong correlation exists between a good distribution of the polymer bridged clusters of rubber particles within the membrane and the maximum increase in water selectivity. The influence of using different types of alcohols (ethanol, propanol 2 and acetone) on the pervaporation separation performance of the membranes has been thoroughly examined. Using ethanol, having the lowest molecular weight as compared with the other solutions, leads to the best performance in pervaporation separation.
