5|$|At the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, a {{preliminary}} teaser trailer (labeled as TR2N {{and directed by}} Joseph Kosinski) was shown {{as a surprise to}} convention guests. It depicted a yellow Program engaged in a <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> battle with a blue Program, and it prominently featured Jeff Bridges reprising his role as an aged Kevin Flynn (from the first film). At the end of the trailer, the yellow Program showed his face, which appeared identical to Flynn's earlier program Clu (resembling the younger Flynn in Tron).|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives a page from the disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E

500|$|After being {{freed from}} police custody for {{his most recent}} prank, Sam is asked by Alan Bradley, an ENCOM {{executive}} and Flynn's old friend, to investigate a strange pager message originating from Flynn's shuttered video arcade. Sam discovers a large computer in a hidden basement, which suddenly teleports him to the Grid, a virtual reality created by Flynn that exists within ENCOM’s computer mainframe. He is quickly captured and sent to [...] "the Games", where he is forced to fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and begins bleeding, Rinzler realizes that Sam is a human [...] "User" [...] and takes him before Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program who resembles a younger Kevin Flynn. Clu nearly kills Sam in a <b>Light</b> <b>Cycle</b> match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an [...] "apprentice" [...] of Flynn, who conveys him to his father's hideout outside Clu's territory.|$|E
500|$|On July 21, 2009, several film-related {{websites}} posted {{they had}} received via mail a pair of [...] "Flynn's Arcade" [...] tokens along with a flash drive. Its content was an animated GIF that showed CSS code lines. Four of them were put together {{and part of the}} code was cracked, revealing the URL to Flynnlives.com, a fictitious site maintained by activists who believe Kevin Flynn is alive, even though he has been missing since 1989. Clicking on a tiny spider in the lower section of the main page led to a countdown clock that hit zero on July 23, 2009, 9:30pm PDT. Within the Terms of Use Section, an address was found. It lies in San Diego, California, USA near the city's convention center where the Comic-Con 2009 took place and some footage and information on the sequel was released. Flynn's Arcade was re-opened at that location, with several Space Paranoids arcade machines and a variety of '80s video games. A full-size <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> from the new film was on display.|$|E
2500|$|The {{producers}} {{also added}} Easter eggs: during {{the scene where}} Tron and Ram escape from the <b>Light</b> <b>Cycle</b> arena into the system, Pac-Man can be seen behind Sark (with the corresponding sounds from the Pac-Man arcade game being heard in the background), while a [...] "Hidden Mickey" [...] outline (located at time 01:12:29 on the re-release Blu-ray) can be seen below the solar sailer during the protagonists' journey.|$|E

2500|$|In newer designs, {{cracking}} {{takes place}} using {{a very active}} zeolite-based catalyst in a short-contact time vertical or upward-sloped pipe called the [...] "riser". Pre-heated feed is sprayed into {{the base of the}} riser via feed nozzles where it contacts extremely hot fluidized catalyst at [...] The hot catalyst vaporizes the feed and catalyzes the cracking reactions that break down the high-molecular weight oil into lighter components including LPG, gasoline, and diesel. The catalyst-hydrocarbon mixture flows upward through the riser for a few seconds, and then the mixture is separated via cyclones. The catalyst-free hydrocarbons are routed to a main fractionator for separation into fuel gas, LPG, gasoline, naphtha, <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> oils used in diesel and jet fuel, and heavy fuel oil.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Gummi Ship minigame, minigames feature prominently in certain worlds. All appearances of the 100 Acre Wood consist entirely of minigames based on classic Winnie the Pooh shorts, with Sora taking {{on the role of}} Christopher Robin. Olympus Coliseum features optional fighting tournaments; due to Hades' popularity, the Underworld was added in Kingdom Hearts II, where Hades has opened his own tournament. While Atlantica is a normal world in Kingdom Hearts, albeit with a special [...] "underwater" [...] control scheme, it becomes an interactive rhythm game in Kingdom Hearts II which is completely unrelated to the overall story and serves as mere filler. Finally, Space Paranoids features a <b>Light</b> <b>Cycle</b> mini-game that strongly deviates from the original film. Nomura included this minigame because he knew people associated the Light Cycles with Tron.|$|E
2500|$|The {{flowers of}} Cannabis sativa are {{unisexual}} and plants {{are most often}} either male or female. It is a short-day flowering plant, with staminate (male) plants usually taller and less robust than pistillate (female) plants The flowers of the female plant are arranged in racemes and can produce hundreds of seeds. Male plants shed their pollen and die several weeks prior to seed ripening on the female plants. Although genetic factors dispose a plant to become male or female, environmental factors including the diurnal <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> can alter sexual expression. Naturally occurring monoecious plants, with {{both male and female}} parts, are either sterile or fertile but artificially induced [...] "hermaphrodites" [...] can have fully functional reproductive organs.

2500|$|On January 12, 2005, Disney {{announced}} it had hired screenwriters Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal {{to write a}} sequel to Tron. In 2008, director Joseph Kosinski negotiated to develop and direct TRON, described as [...] "the next chapter" [...] of the 1982 film and based on a preliminary teaser trailer shown at that year's San Diego Comic-Con, with Lisberger co-producing. Filming began in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009. During the 2009 Comic-Con, {{the title of the}} sequel was revealed to be changed to [...] The second trailer (also with the [...] logo) was released in 3D with Alice In Wonderland. A third trailer premiered at Comic-Con 2010 on July 22. At Disney's D23 Expo on September 10–13, 2009, they also debuted teaser trailers for Tron: Legacy as well as having <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> and other props from the film there. The film was released on December 17, 2010, with Daft Punk composing the score.|$|E
2500|$|Flynn's ex-girlfriend Lora Baines and {{her current}} boyfriend, fellow ENCOM {{engineer}} Alan Bradley, visit Flynn at his arcade {{to warn him}} that Dillinger is aware of his hacking attempts and has tightened security at ENCOM. Flynn explains his situation to them and then persuades them to sneak {{him back into the}} facility where he forges access for the three. Lora takes Flynn to the terminal in her lab to continue searching for evidence of Dillinger's theft. In response, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and download Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe, particularly an area the MCP calls the Game Grid, where programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human [...] "Users" [...] who created them. [...] Once inside, Flynn quickly learns that the system is under the totalitarian rule of the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, who enslave and intimidate other programs to renounce their [...] "belief" [...] in the Users; those who refuse are imprisoned in the Game Grid and forced to play in lethal competition against other programs. Flynn meets Tron and Ram as they are about to compete in a <b>Light</b> <b>Cycle</b> match; the three defeat their opponents and escape from the Grid and into the system, but Flynn and Ram are attacked by a pursuit force of game tanks that Flynn himself created; Flynn is only stunned, but Ram is mortally wounded. [...] They stop to rest, but to Flynn and Ram's surprise, Flynn learns that as a User he can manipulate energy and matter within the system, effectively allowing him to control its environment. With his newfound User power Flynn reassembles a destroyed pursuit ship (called a [...] "Recognizer"). [...] Just before he de-rezzes, Ram begs Flynn to help Tron.|$|E
50|$|The {{additional}} <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> mode {{contains no}} campaign; instead, the player is {{presented with a}} choice of several <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> arenas.|$|E
50|$|Similar to lighting, a {{decrease}} in temperature might be needed for the simulated night periods, thus keeping living species healthy. Such variation need to be coherent {{to those found in}} the natural habitats of the species. Thermo-control systems are often used to regulate <b>light</b> <b>cycles</b> and heating, as well as humidity (coupled to built-in misting or rain systems). Light-dependent resistors or photo-diodes connected to the lighting are frequently used to simulate daytime, evening and nighttime <b>light</b> <b>cycles,</b> as well as timers to switch lighting and heating on and off when necessary.|$|R

50|$|Tron 2.0 {{offers some}} {{multiplayer}} scenarios, both in campaign mode and in <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> mode. Internet and LAN play are available, although the vendor does not {{recommend that the}} <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> mode be used over the Internet due to its generally high lag.|$|E
50|$|Next, {{the diesel}} {{is mixed with}} HDS <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> oil (LCO). The HDS <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> oil is a poor diesel fuel due to its high sulfur content and poor engine {{ignition}} performance, thus it is mixed with H-Bio. The two are combined to produce {{the maximum amount of}} high-quality fuel possible, with the given amount of supply. When HDS <b>Light</b> <b>Cycle</b> Oil and H-Bio are blended, the fluid viscosity is modified for maximum performance, resulting in high-quality diesel. The resulting diesel has great ignition performance with very little sulfur content.|$|E
5000|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to be the last player riding. Cycles can be boosted with a limited turbo. There are various {{gameplay}} styles, including switching the gameplay from [...] "booster" [...] to [...] "wall accel." [...] to [...] "both". [...] "Booster" [...] has an extra button for boosting, in addition to the standard left, right, glance left, glance right buttons, while [...] "Wall ride" [...] increases a player's <b>light</b> <b>cycle's</b> speed automatically depending on how close they are to an opponent's wall. [...] "Both" [...] incorporates both options for increasing the player's <b>light</b> <b>cycle's</b> speed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Mac, the game was ported to mobile phones in two versions: the first, called Tron 2.0: <b>Light</b> <b>Cycles,</b> which was released on November 21, 2003; and the second, called Tron 2.0: Discs of Tron, which was released on May 12, 2004. The same game was later ported to the Xbox with significant changes to the single and, especially, the multiplayer modes. The Xbox version is titled Tron 2.0: Killer App. Changes to the single player mode include optional jumping sequences, and overall console-tailored controls. The real changes {{were made to the}} multiplayer modes. Added is up to sixteen player multiplayer disc arena, <b>light</b> <b>cycles,</b> or overRide modes for system link or Xbox Live. The new overRide mode allows for first person mayhem with the ability to ride <b>light</b> <b>cycles</b> at any time. There is also a version of Tron 2.0: Killer App for the Game Boy Advance that has different story and gameplay from its Xbox counterpart. A version of the game was planned for the Gizmondo, but was canceled during development.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>light</b> <b>cycles</b> {{segment of}} Tron {{has led to}} snake games {{sometimes}} being called [...] "Matrix Blaster" [...] or [...] "Light Cycles" [...] games. Some post-Tron snake games use themes or terminology from the film.|$|R
5000|$|Interspersed {{with the}} first-person-shooter levels are several <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> races. As {{seen in the}} movie, these races are {{actually}} arena duels in which each <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> attempts to destroy its opponents by driving them into its jetwall. The arenas contain 'improvements' (such as speed zones that affect the cycles' speed), more complex layouts with walls and other artifacts (instead of the [...] "empty box" [...] {{as seen in the}} movie), and power-ups that can be collected during races. In addition to Tron's regular <b>light</b> <b>cycle,</b> Jet can also gain access to the super <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> that sports a more modern design and offers more speed. Tron 2.0 initially required the player to win the <b>light</b> <b>cycle</b> races in order to advance the campaign. Consumer feedback revealed that many felt the computer-controlled light cyclers were impossibly precise in their controls (turning at speeds a human could not, or boxing themselves in,for example), forcing players to wait for the enemy light cycles to destroy themselves. As a result, the vendor released a patch eliminating this rule.|$|E
