With the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization in China, many of industrial enterprises have relocated {{from the original}} sites, which have produced {{a large number of}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> The environmental risk assessment and management must be carried out imminently. This paper analyzes the removal of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> happened in China currently, and through combing the <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> features and aspects of human health pathways, analyzed environmental risks of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> recycling. As for the health risk assessment, we focus on data collection, toxicity assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterization. The paper also describes the regulations and technical standards of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> risk assessment, which is used in our country currently.

With the aim of synthesizing useful services delivered by land reuse for environmental, social and economic benefits, effective management measures have been taken nationally and regionally to rehabilitate <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> The unacceptable risks, large number of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and urgent demand for land supply make it necessary to centralize limited resources within <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> In reference to the classification rationale in developed countries {{trying to deal with}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in an integrated, saving and timely manner, we design a conceptual framework that considers the unique context in China. We classify <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in five steps, namely: listing, investigating, filing, classifying and managing. Based on the classification results, effective suggestions are proposed for graded and classified management and further decision-making at the highest level of design. The results show that potential <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> can be divided into high, medium and low priority based on four factors (social concern, redevelopment demand, health risk and ecological risk). Site-specific management strategies focusing on environmental monitoring, detailed site survey and immediate remediation, respectively, are suggested that focus on corresponding <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in different priorities.

40|$|This audit {{assessed}} {{how well}} {{the risks associated with}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in New South Wales are being managed. Executive summary Effective management of contaminated land makes an important contribution to the government’s goal to ‘Protect our natural environment’; Goal 22 of the State Government’s ‘NSW 2021 : A plan to make NSW number one’. The Contaminated Land Management Act 1997 (CLM Act) establishes a framework for the regulation and management of land that becomes significantly contaminated. The Act gives the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) powers to require the investigation and management of sites where contamination is significant enough to warrant regulation. This audit assessed {{how well the}} risks associated with <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> are being managed. It examined the EPA’s regulation of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> on both private and public land under the CLM Act. It also examined the management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> by government agencies on their land. It focused on the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services (DTIRIS), which is the largest landholder by area and extensively involved in the management of a range of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This detailed examination was supplemented by a survey of over 30 large landholding government agencies in New South Wales and their management arrangements for dealing with <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This audit draws upon the December 2013 Auditor-General’s Report to Parliament and previous reports that raised concerns regarding the management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970 s, <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> {{had emerged}} as one of the most complex and urgent {{environmental}} issues affecting industrialized countries. The authors show that small and prosperous Switzerland is no exception to the pervasive problem of sites contamination, the legacy of past practices in waste management having left some 38, 000 <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> throughout the country. This book outlines the problem, offering evidence that open and polycentric environmental decision-making that includes civil society actors is valuable. They propose an understanding of environmental management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> as a political process in which institutions frame interactions between strategic actors pursuing sometimes conflicting interests. In the opening chapter, the authors describe the influences of politics and the power relationships between actors involved in decision-making in <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> management, which they term a "wicked problem. " Chapter Two offers a theoretical framework for understanding institutions and the environmental management of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> The next five chapters present a detailed case study on environmental management and <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in Switzerland, focused on the Bonfol Chemical Landfill. The study and analysis covers the establishment of the landfill under the first generation of environmental regulations, its closure and early remediation efforts, and the gambling on the remediation objectives, methods and funding in the first decade of the 21 st Century. The concluding chapter discusses the question of whether the strength of environmental regulations, and the type of interactions between public, private, and civil society actors can explain the environmental choices in <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> management.

40|$|Abstract—Three {{previous}} studies at Chernobyl, Ukraine, documented elevated mitochondrial DNA diversity in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) from radioactively <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> Little evidence {{was found to}} link patterns of diversity in contaminated areas to radiation exposure, but the experimental design precluded discriminating among alternative explanations for elevated diversity in exposed groups. Reference sites selected for the studies were relatively distant from <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and, additionally, were separated from <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> by large river systems; thus, we hypothesized that differences among sites were correlated with geographic isolation rather than with radiation exposure. For the present study, we added three reference sites, which were selected based on minimal radioactive contamination, proximity to <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> and absence of obvious barriers to dispersal. We hypothesized that neighboring reference sites should exhibit levels and patterns of diversity {{similar to those of}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> if the previously detected differences were, in fact, caused by geographic isolation. Indeed, levels of diversity in nearby reference sites are comparable to levels in <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> Additionally, nearby reference sites contain several haplotypes not observed at other study sites. Our results suggest that levels of diversity in contaminated regions are more plausibly explained by ecological and historical factors than by increased mutational pressure resulting from exposure to Chernobyl radiation.

40|$|The {{large number}} of {{industrial}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> within Australia not only cause harm to the environment, but also require {{a significant amount of}} financial resources to fund remediation works. Motivated by the notion that corporations should be held accountable for their actions (or inactions), and providing Australian evidence on the issue of environmental disclosures, this research seeks to explore Australian companies’ disclosure practices as they pertain to <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> and to provide explanations for the current disclosure practices. To achieve this research objective, a four-phase research design is employed. These four phases are separate but related, with each phase forming the basis for the next phase. The first phase of the study described the processes that must be undertaken to identify Australian <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This phase revealed that publicly available sources of information are widely dispersed between various state and local government agencies and departments, and when considered together, provide incomplete information about <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> The second phase of the study, investigated the disclosure practices of four high profile Australian publicly listed companies that have been identified as being in control of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> After reviewing these companies’ financial reports, the results showed that there appeared to be uniform non-compliance with the requirements (and spirit) of Australian financial reporting requirements. Phase Three, aimed to explore which theory or theories in social and environmental accounting, offer explanatory power to the findings of Phase Two. This phase provided extensive discussion on each of the two ‘mainstream theories’—legitimacy theory and institutional theory—in both the organisation and accounting literature, as well as the connections between them. An institutional theoretical framework is then proposed in which the concept of organisational legitimacy is incorporated. The last phase, Phase Four, applies the theoretical framework developed from Phase three, to provide explanations for the findings of Phase Two. A qualitative research methodology was employed, and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted as the method of data collection. The findings indicated that {{there is a lack of}} institutional pressures on <b>contaminated</b> <b>site</b> disclosures and awareness of risks associated with site remediation obligations. This research offers contributions to the social and environment accounting literature and to the central issue of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> This research provides empirical evidence that ‘negative’ news such as <b>contaminated</b> <b>site</b> information is often ‘hidden’ and ‘suppressed’ by organisations. Current use of legitimacy theory is challenged for its ignorance of its institutional origin and institutional theory is proposed to have greater potential to be applied to social and environmental accounting. In terms of the central issue of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> by highlighting the complexity of the issue, and the difficulties in identifying <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in Australia, this research also implies that there are a {{large number of}} <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> that remain unidentified, and a large amount of remediation obligations remain unaccounted for. Unless all stakeholders collaborate to tackle the issue of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites,</b> ensuring quality financial information in relation to <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> disclosed in annual reports remains a challenging task...|$|R

40|$|Policies for the {{remediation}} of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> emerged relatively late as a subfield {{of environmental}} protection. The policy area is adjacent to other policies, such as waste policy, which often includes provisions {{on how to}} deal with waste dumps, as well as soil and groundwater protection policies, which deal with the prevention of contamination. Nevertheless, most countries introduced policies for the clean-up of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> in the course of the 1990 s while only a handful already tackled this issue in the 1980 s. The policies on contaminated land developed initially at the domestic level. Although in a few cases <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> gained international attention, such as the Love Canal in the USA and Lekkerkerk in the Netherlands, contaminated soil was considered a local problem and the responsibility of national (or subnational) governments.

Similarly, at the wider international level, we find no binding or non-binding international law or agreements on the remediation of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> However, several transnational networks have emerged that have played a role in the international convergence process of <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> policy (see Section 6. 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} contaminants in the environment may influence sex differentiation and reproductive endocrine function in wildlife. Concentrations of organochlorine contaminants (total polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides) were higher in the blood plasma of snapping turtles from <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> than in those from reference sites. The ratio of the precloacal length to the posterior lobe of the plastron (PPR) is sexually dimorphic in snapping turtles. There were significant reductions in the PPR at three <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> versus two reference sites. The magnitude of the response was such that a significantly higher proportion of PPRs of males from a <b>contaminated</b> <b>site</b> (Cootes Paradise) overlapped with those of females than PPRs of males from a reference site (Lake Sasajewun). Observers can incorrectly identify the sex of turtles at the <b>contaminated</b> <b>site</b> based on secondary sexual characteristics alone. Unlike the changes to the morphology, there were few changes in 17 beta-estradiol or testosterone levels, and where differences occurred, there was more variation among reference sites than between the reference and <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> Our results suggest that environmental contaminants may affect sexually dimorphic morphology in snapping turtles without affecting circulating testosterone or estrogen levels in the adults...|$|R

Since complete restoration of all these <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites</b> is economically and often technically not feasible, advanced procedures and guidelines of groundwater risk assessment are needed as innovative tool for the ranking of sites, decision making on further use, and remediation standards. The {{first part of the}} workshop focuses on the discussion of these new, innovative procedures for groundwater risk assessment at <b>contaminated</b> <b>sites.</b> Diffuse pollution can affect large bodies of water where restoration is hardly reversible within reasonable periods of time.
