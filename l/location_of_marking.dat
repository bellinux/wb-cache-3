40|$|The Coscoroba Swan (Coscoroba coscoroba) is {{an unusual}} member of the Anatidae. It has a patchy {{distribution}} and is a partial migrant found from the Falkaland islands and Tierra del Fuego through Chile and Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay {{as far north as}} Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil. This study describes the movements of Coscoroba swans banded outside the boundary of and in side the >Estaçao Ecológica do Taim> Reserve (c. 32 ° 33 'S, 52 ° 32 'W) in the southern coastal plain of the State of Rio Grande do SuI, Brazil and the phenology in this area. The analysis of banding and recapture or recovery data was conducted between 2005 and 2008, and data from birds marked between 1979 and 2006 were also obtained from >Centra Nacional de Pesquisas e Conservação de Aves Silvestres> (CEMAVE). Distance between sites, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>marking</b> and recapture or recovery sites, and sex and age were analyzed. A total of 1070 birds were banded and ringed during the flightless wing moult and 32 recaptures or recoveries were registered during the study period (27 inside the banding area and five outside), the resighting of a Coscoroba in Chubut, Argentina (43 ° 21 'S, 65 ° 03 'W) being most noteworthy. A route between Argentina and Brazil to the central depression of Rio Grande do Sul state (to and from the Taim area) was confirmed as well as fidelity to Taim as a molting site and important breeding area. Recaptures at Taim showed a prevalence of male adults that may indicate a greater male fidelity to the natal area and juvenile dispersal to other areas until sexual maturity is reached. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.

40|$|In {{the typical}} spatial search {{problems}} solved by continuous-time quantum walk, changing the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marked</b> vertices does {{not alter the}} search problem. In this paper, we consider search when {{this is no longer}} true. In particular, we analytically solve search on the "simplex of $K_M$ complete graphs" with all configurations <b>of</b> two <b>marked</b> vertices, two configurations of $M+ 1 $ marked vertices, and two configurations of $ 2 (M+ 1) $ marked vertices, showing that the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marked</b> vertices can dramatically influence the required jumping rate of the quantum walk, such that using the wrong configuration's value can cause the search to fail. This sensitivity to the jumping rate is an issue unique to continuous-time quantum walks that does not affect discrete-time ones. Comment: 29 pages, 15 figure...|$|R

50|$|Community liaison {{refers to}} the systems and {{processes}} used to exchange information between national authorities, mine-action organisations and communities {{on the presence of}} mines, unexploded ordnance and abandoned munitions. It enables communities to be informed about planned demining activities, the nature and duration of the tasks, and the exact <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>marked</b> or cleared areas. Furthermore, it enables communities to inform local authorities and mine-action organizations about the location, extent and impact of contaminated areas. This information can greatly assist the planning of related activities, such as technical surveys, marking and clearance operations, and survivor-assistance services. Community liaison ensures that mine-action projects address community needs and priorities. Community liaison should be carried out by all organizations conducting mine-action operations.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} {{the size and}} <b>location</b> <b>of</b> couplings within a waveguide directional coupler is provided. The method is applied to a waveguide directional coupler having a main transmission waveguide connected to an auxiliary transmission waveguide {{by a number of}} bore hold couplings. The bore hold couplings are in the interior of the waveguide directional coupler and, therefore, are not easily measurable. The method generally includes the steps of applying a two-sided tape to a member, inserting and securing the member within the main transmission waveguide, pouring a fine particulate substance such as talc into the auxiliary transmission waveguide such that a portion of the talc enters the bore hole couplings and adheres to the two-sided tape, and withdrawing the member such that the size and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the bore hole couplings can be determined by measuring the size and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>marks</b> on the two-sided tape caused by the fine particular substance adhering to the two-sided tape...|$|R
