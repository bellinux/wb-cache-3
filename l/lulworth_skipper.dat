5|$|The <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus acteon) is a {{butterfly}} of the Hesperiidae family. Its name {{is derived from}} Lulworth Cove in the county of Dorset, England, where the first specimens in Great Britain were collected in 1832 by English naturalist James Charles Dale.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German entomologist S. A. von Rottemburg in 1775. The butterfly was first discovered in Britain on 15 August 1832, when specimens {{were taken from}} Lulworth Cove in Dorset by English naturalist James Charles Dale [...] It was introduced the following year as the <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> (Thymelicus acteon), a name that has remained unchanged; {{it is the only}} one of Britain's vernacular butterfly names for which there has never been a proposed substitute.|$|E
500|$|With a {{wingspan}} of 24 to 28 millimetres, females being {{larger than}} males, the <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> {{is a small}} butterfly, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus in Europe and among the smallest butterflies in Britain. Aside from the size difference, the sexes are distinguished by females having a distinct circle of golden marks on each forewing. Due to their likeness to the rays around {{the eye of a}} peacock's feather, these are often known as [...] "sun-ray" [...] markings, and they can faintly appear on males.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the novel}} The Return of the Native, by Thomas Hardy, a {{possible}} reference {{is made to}} <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skippers</b> in the [...] "strange amber-coloured butterflies" [...] which [...] "were never seen elsewhere." ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{colonies of}} <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skippers</b> existed in Devon, the species has, beyond single records, {{not be seen}} in the county since the 1930s. Similarly, records of occurrences exist for Cornwall, but they have not been {{verified}} as native colonies.|$|R
50|$|Habitats are {{primarily}} on unfertilised calcareous grassland; this includes chalk download, coastal grassland and undercliffs in Britain. In {{all of these}} habits Tor-grass (Illustration 2), the butterfly's sole food plant and that on which it lays eggs, is widespread. Tall, ungrazed grass is a favoured habitat due to oviposition and larval development; <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skippers</b> {{have benefited from the}} move away from tight grazing by sheep in the last century and recently outbreaks of myxomatosis among rabbit populations, which otherwise maintain a lower grass height. However, there is evidence to suggest that minimal grazing is not detrimental to the species, and may in fact be beneficial in that it encourages the growth of flowers that act as adult nectar sources.|$|R
500|$|The male <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> has a {{wingspan}} of , and {{the female}} 25 to 28mm. This makes it one of Britain's smallest butterflies and, in Europe, the smallest member of the Thymelicus genus. Of Britain's five [...] "golden" [...] skippers—the others being the silver-spotted skipper (Hesperia comma), large skipper (Ochlodes sylvanus), small skipper (Thymelicus sylvestris) and Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola)—the Lulworth is both the smallest and darkest. Beyond its small size, it is distinguished particularly by its dark, dun-coloured wings that appear with tinges of olive-brown; this darkening especially apparent in males.|$|E

50|$|The faint {{chequered}} {{pattern on}} both the upperside and underside, and also the hook-shaped antenna tips, help to distinguish the large skipper from these two orange skippers. The <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> also has patterned wings, but {{does not have the}} hooked antennae.|$|E
50|$|Dale {{received}} his education at Wimborne Grammar School and Sidney Sussex College Cambridge University receiving his MA in 1818. He was a magistrate. On one occasion {{a cloud of}} butterflies was released into Dale's court. His most famous discovery was the <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper.</b>|$|E

50|$|The females {{lay their}} eggs in rows of 5 to 6 (although as many as 15 have been recorded) on the flower-sheath of Tor-grass (Brachypodium pinnatum), preferring the dead sheaths of tall plants. The care taken by females over where to {{lay their eggs}} is {{considered}} the only remarkable part of the <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> breeding process, otherwise it is considered common.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> {{is found}} locally across {{southern}} and central Europe, Asia Minor and North Africa, where its population is considered stable. In northern Europe, its numbers and range have severely declined, {{most notably in}} the Netherlands {{where it is now}} extinct. This decline has led to the butterfly's European status of [...] "vulnerable". Isolated populations of the species in Armenia are also threatened, although not yet included in the National Red List. It is also listed as threatened under the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan.|$|E

50|$|In Great Britain, {{where the}} {{butterfly}} reaches the northern limit of its range, its distribution {{is restricted to}} the southern coastline of the county of Dorset. Here, both the population and range have changed little in recent decades; it is locally abundant, {{with the majority of}} colonies found on the coast between Weymouth and Swanage and on the Purbeck Ridge, a line of inland chalk hills. Two outlying colonies also exist, at Burton Bradstock and on the Isle of Portland; the cause of the colony on Portland is unknown, but has been put down to either natural colonisation or released specimens. There is evidence to suggest that the <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> is now more abundant in Dorset {{than at any other time}} since its discovery in 1832.|$|E
50|$|Upon hatching, the 2.5 cm (1 in) long larva spins {{a compact}} cocoon {{on the site}} of the eggshell. In this, it will overwinter until around the third week of April, at which point it will eat its way out by making a small hole in the side of the sheath. The {{caterpillar}} will then search for tender Tor-grass blades and feed upon them by chewing out notches from the margin. During this time, it will live separately, within a tube composed of the two edges of a blade bound by cords of silk. Fresh tubes will be made as the caterpillar grows larger. <b>Lulworth</b> <b>skipper</b> caterpillars live in the warmest zone of a grass clump, at a height of 20 to 40 cm.|$|E
40|$|HIGHLIGHTS • A major {{milestone}} {{was made}} {{as the number}} of sites monitored in 2009 exceeded a thousand, whilst trends were assessed for 53 of the 59 regularly occurring UK species. • Following two of the poorest years on record for butterflies in the UK, most species made some recovery in {{what turned out to be}} a mixed year, still ranking below average (23) in the 34 - year series. • The year ranked as the second best on record for Painted Lady migration with a huge influx in May/June. • Many expanding species continued to do well, whilst five species produced their highest index of the series – Comma, Green-veined White, Ringlet, Speckled Wood and the habitat specialist, Large Heath. • However, despite a warm, sunny start to the year, much of the butterfly season in July and August was once again characterised by wet weather having an adverse effect on a number of species. • Four species had their worst year with continued declines for some of our most threatened species – Duke of Burgundy, Heath Fritillary, <b>Lulworth</b> <b>Skipper</b> and Wood White. • Other threatened species, as well as some of our commoner species, still produced low indices despite the slight recovery from 2008. • For 47 of the 53 species assessed (89...|$|E
