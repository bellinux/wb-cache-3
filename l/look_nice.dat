500|$|Jo Storm {{wrote that}} the [...] "cleverly {{disguised}} action mini-arc" [...] gives insight into the imperfection of the Asgard and that the [...] "foreign, creepy" [...] Replicators are [...] "conquerors who make the Goa'uld <b>look</b> <b>nice</b> by comparison". [...] He felt that the episode had [...] "all the classic elements of fiction", and lauded Robert C. Cooper's storytelling idea to take the Stargate from the SGC and Don S. Davis's following [...] "best nonspeaking moment". [...] In Storm's mind, the visual effects were well-placed and did not overthrow the story, but he wondered about the [...] "ubiquitous Sam/Jack interest". [...] If not interpreted as [...] "flirtatiousness", Carter could be [...] "truly touched at being let into the 'inner circle' of [...] life, and finally being 'one of the guys'".|$|E
500|$|Modern reviews {{have been}} largely critical– Brett Alan Weiss, writing for AllGame, {{considered}} the game to be a [...] "slower, less intense, less enjoyable" [...] version of Kaboom!. He criticized {{the lack of support}} for the paddle controller, and stated that not even the two-player and terrorist modes made the game enjoyable. In his book Classic Home Video Games, Weiss wrote that Lost Luggage was a [...] "fleeting pleasure", opining that [...] "the airplanes flying overhead <b>look</b> <b>nice,</b> {{but the rest of the}} game is ordinary in appearance" [...] and that the difficulty curve and action were poor. Writing for Atari HQ, Keita Iida commented that [...] "there are good Kaboom! clones (Eggomania) and then there are bad ones (this one)." [...] Iida believed that if the game was not as similar to Kaboom! then it would be [...] "mildly amusing", but that the better alternatives hampered it.|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{shot the}} films {{back-to-back}} {{in the beginning}} of July 2007 with Guerrilla shot first in Spain for 39 days and The Argentine shot in Puerto Rico and Mexico for 39 days. The director conceived The Argentine as [...] "a Hollywood movie" [...] shot in widescreen 'scope aspect ratio, with the camera either fixed or moving on a dolly or a Steadicam. Guerrilla was shot, according to Soderbergh, [...] "in Super-16, 1.85:1. No dollies, no cranes, it's all either handheld or tripods. I want it to <b>look</b> <b>nice</b> but simple. We'll work with a very small group: basically me, the producer Gregory Jacobs and the unit production manager". According to the director, the portion set in Cuba was written from the victor's perspective and as a result he adopted a more traditional look with classical compositions, vibrant color and a warm palette. With Guerrilla, he wanted a sense of foreboding with hand-held camerawork and a muted color palette. Soderbergh told his production designer Antxon Gomez that the first part would have green with a lot of yellow in it and the second part would have green with a lot of blue in it.|$|E

2500|$|Charlie Brown smiles, quietly {{picks up}} the little tree, and {{walks out of the}} auditorium. After {{reflecting}} on what Linus had said, he decides to take the tree home to decorate, to show the others it will work in the play. When he arrives, he stops at Snoopy's decorated doghouse, which now sports a first prize blue ribbon for winning the display contest. He puts an ornamental ball from the doghouse {{on the top of his}} tree. The branch, with the ball still on it, promptly flops over to one side instead of remaining upright, prompting Charlie Brown to declare [...] "I've killed it" [...] and run off in disgust at his perpetual failure. Linus and the rest of the Peanuts gang (who have all become guilty for laughing at Charlie Brown) arrive outside Snoopy's doghouse. Linus gently props the drooping branch back in its upright position by wrapping his blanket around the tree. The group add the remaining decorations from Snoopy's doghouse to the tree, and Lucy admits that the tree does <b>look</b> <b>nice.</b> They start humming [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". Charlie Brown returns, surprised at the humming and the redecorated tree, as his peers greet him with a joyous [...] "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" [...] The entire group begins to sing the first verse of [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," [...] and Charlie Brown joins them as the special ends.|$|E
