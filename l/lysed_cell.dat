In recent years the Microfluidizer method has gained popularity in cell disruption due to its ease of use and efficiency at disrupting {{many different kinds of}} cells. The Microfluidizer technology was licensed from a company called Arthur D. Little and was first developed and utilized in the 1980s, initially starting as a tool for liposome creation. It has since been used in other applications such as cell disruption nanoemulsions, and solid particle size reduction, among others.|$|E
50|$|Comet assays {{are one of}} {{the most}} common tests for genotoxicity. The {{technique}} involves lysing cells using detergents and salts. The DNA released from the <b>lysed</b> <b>cell</b> is electrophoresed in an agarose gel under neutral pH conditions. Cells containing DNA with an increased number of double-strand breaks will migrate more quickly to the anode. This technique is advantageous in that it detects low levels of DNA damage, requires only a very small number of cells, is cheaper than many techniques, is easy to execute, and quickly displays results. However, it does not identify the mechanism underlying the genotoxic effect or the exact chemical or chemical component causing the breaks.|$|E

50|$|Lysins, {{also known}} as endolysins or murein hydrolases, are hydrolytic enzymes {{produced}} by bacteriophages in order to cleave the host's cell wall during {{the final stage of}} the lytic cycle. Lysins are highly evolved enzymes that are able to target one of the five bonds in peptidoglycan (murein), the main component of bacterial cell walls, which allows the release of progeny virions from the <b>lysed</b> <b>cell.</b> Cell-wall-containing Archaea are also lysed by specialized pseudomurein-cleaving lysins, while most archaeal viruses employ alternate mechanisms. Similarly, not all bacteriophages synthesize lysins: some small single-stranded DNA and RNA phages produce membrane proteins that activate the host's autolytic mechanisms.|$|E

Mitotic PtK 2 cells were pretreated with colcemid to remove all endogenous microtubules and were lysed with Triton X- 100 in PIPES- EGTA-Mg++ buffer. This procedure left centrosomes, chromosomes, and kinetochores intact as determined by electron microscopy of thin- sectioned cells.

Treatment of the <b>lysed</b> <b>cell</b> preparations with tubulin antibody before subsequent exposure to the exogenous tubulin resulted in almost complete blockage of microtubule nucleation, especially at kinetochores. Pretreatment of the <b>lysed</b> <b>cell</b> preparations with control antibody or buffer without antibody had no effect on the ability of centrosomes and kinetochores to initiate microtubule assembly.

Cell lysis was determined by staining the embryos with Hoechst 33258 and propidium iodide. <b>Lysed</b> <b>cells</b> take up both stains but non-lysed cells only the Hoechst 33258 stain, resulting in pink fluorescence for <b>lysed</b> <b>cells</b> and blue fluorescence for non-lysed cells under UV excitation. During bisection of morulae, the presence of cytochalasin B decreased the proportion of <b>lysed</b> <b>cells</b> in both the absence (P= 0. 0001) and presence of sucrose (P= 0. 001). During bisection of blastocysts the average proportion of <b>lysed</b> <b>cells</b> was slightly lower {{in the presence of}} cytochalasin than that in the control medium, but the effect was not statistically significant (P= 0. 34). No effect of sucrose was observed in either demi-morulae or demi-blastocysts.

Three different cell types have been considered (lung tumoral, amniocytes, and MG- 63 osteosarcoma cells) in order for sample-dependent effects to be identified. Cell integrity of fresh cells and cells frozen in cryopreservative solution was approximately 70 - 80 %, with the former showing higher membrane degradation, probably enzymatic, as indicated by increased phosphocholine (PC) and/or glycerophosphocholine (GPC).
