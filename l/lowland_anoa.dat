25|$|The {{exhibit is}} opening in phases with phase one {{including}} a boat trip around the enclosures {{for visitors to}} view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, Javan banteng, <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> and North Sulawesi Babirusa; plus a walk-through bird aviary featuring the critically endangered Bali Starling, as well as Java Sparrows, Pied Imperial Pigeons and Yellow-Backed Chattering Lorys.|$|E
25|$|Bordering the paddocks is a {{waterway}} running north-south, {{along which}} the water bus formerly travelled, past island groups of white-faced sakis, Alaotran bamboo lemurs and howler monkeys. A variety of callitrichids, including cotton-top tamarins, were formerly housed on the Bamboo Lemur Island, and the howler monkey and white-faced saki exhibits were formerly home to black-and-white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs. A nearby island viewable from Bats Bridge has previously held <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> {{and is now}} holding babirusia.|$|E
25|$|The north east {{area of the}} zoo {{is where}} many forest-dwelling species are kept. As well as the chimpanzees, okapis, jaguars, condors and Tropical Realm, there are {{enclosures}} for Congo buffalo, red river hogs and <b>Lowland</b> <b>anoa.</b> Nearby is a large paddock and house for the zoo's Rothschild's giraffe herd. The area between the rear of Tropical Realm and the Spirit of the Jaguar has enclosures for various species including a group of native sand lizards, and a mixed enclosure for red-billed curassows and Inca Jays.|$|E
50|$|This 5 acre (2.0 ha) exhibit complex {{which opened}} on July 1, 2004 simulates {{the forests of}} {{southeast}} Asia with a waterfall, streams, and plants native to the region such as bamboo. The complex is designed so that species are rotated to {{different parts of the}} exhibit after several days. Asian Forest Sanctuary includes Sumatran tigers, Malayan tigers, northern white-cheeked gibbons, siamangs, <b>lowland</b> <b>anoas,</b> Indian crested porcupines, Asian small-clawed otters, and Asian elephants.|$|R
40|$|Members of the Bovini genus are {{classified}} as grazers. Smaller species of ruminants {{are not expected to}} be able to digest particularly fibrous diets and are more often classified as intermediate feeders or browsers. Anoas (Bubalus spp.) are interesting in this respect as they are the smallest representatives of the Bovini, being only 10 - 20 % of the body weight of other species of the same genus. A feeding trial was carried out with four <b>lowland</b> <b>anoas</b> (Bubalus depressicornis) at London Zoo, investigating diet digestibility by total fecal collection and passage rates by the simultaneous administration of a fluid (Co-EDTA) and a particle (Cr-mordanted fibre < 2 mm) marker. The diet consisted of legume hay, dairy cow pellets, browse, fruits, and vegetables. The achieved digestibility coefficients averaged 70 ± 4 % for dry matter and 57 ± 7 % for cell walls (NDF). Mean retention times for the total gastrointestinal tract were 25 ± 4. 1 hr for fluid and 39 ± 6. 7 hr for particles, respectively. The ratio of forestomach particle:fluid retention was 2. 14 ± 0. 40. Additional information regarding anoa diets in captivity was collected through a survey targeting all institutions that have anoas in their collection currently. Suitability of the provided diet was evaluated using the ratio of unstructured:structured feeds (unstructured feeds pellets, grains, produce; structured feeds=roughage, browse) on a dry matter basis and an assumed complete consumption of offered unstructured diet items, with only the remaining intake capacity being met by structured items. The use of this ratio reliably predicted one facility that reported chronic diet-related problems. As other ruminants, anoas should receive a diet with restricted amounts of concentrates and fruits. The comparatively high fibre digestibility and the high selective particle retention in the forestomach suggest a classification of an intermediate/grazing ruminant...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to species involved in Species Survival Plans, the zoo {{is home to}} other threatened or endangered species, including African dwarf crocodile, American crocodile, American black bear, Bengal tiger, black howler monkey, Brazilian tapir, Galapagos tortoise, <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa,</b> Nile crocodile, Palawan peacock pheasant, red-handed tamarin, and red kangaroo.|$|E
50|$|Bubalus murrensis, the European water buffalo, is an extinct Bovine {{that lived}} in Europe during the Pleistocene. Its closest living {{relatives}} are the Wild Asian water buffalo (Bubalus arnee), the Tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis), the <b>Lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus depressicornis), the Mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) and the domestic water bufallo (Bubalus bubalis).|$|E
5000|$|Other notable animal {{exhibits}} at Woodland Park Zoo {{include a}} Raptor Center and accompanying flight demonstration, and <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa.</b> The zoo also includes [...] "Family Farm" [...] and Bug World exhibits. In the Adaptations building visitors can find meerkats, added in 2010, {{as well as}} nocturnal animals, including Indian flying fox and sloths.|$|E
50|$|Anoa, {{also known}} as midget buffalo and sapiutan, are a {{subgenus}} of Bubalus comprising two species native to Indonesia: the mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) and the <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus depressicornis). Both live in undisturbed rainforest, and are essentially miniature water buffalo. They are similar in appearance to a deer, weighing 150 - 300 kg.|$|E
50|$|Mountain anoa (Bubalus quarlesi) {{are also}} known as anoa de montana, anoa de Quarle, anoa des montagnes, anoa pegunungan, and Quarle's anoa. Standing at 70 cm at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> and the {{smallest}} of all wild cattle. They also have longer, woolier hair that moults every February to April, showing faint spots on the head, neck, and limbs.|$|E
50|$|Islands showcases {{areas where}} the zoo is {{involved}} in conservation programmes, including Sumatra, the Philippines and Indonesia. Visitors are able to walk between the islands via a series of bridges and also view the animals via on a boat trip. The project also includes educational exhibits, play areas and a restaurant, the Manado Street Kitchen.The exhibit is opening in phases with phase one including a boat trip around the enclosures for visitors to view some of the zoo's key species from South East Asia, including Visayan warty pigs, southern cassowary, banteng and <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa.</b>|$|E

50|$|The <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> (Bubalus depressicornis) {{is a small}} bovid, {{standing}} barely over 90 cm at the shoulder. They {{are also}} known as anoa de Ilanura or anoa des plaines. It is most closely allied to the larger Asiatic buffaloes, showing the same reversal of {{the direction of the}} hair on their backs. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes, and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct buffaloes, the remains of which are found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India. In habits, the animal appears to resemble the Indian buffalo. It is usually solitary, living in lowland forests and wetlands, browsing on plants and understory.|$|E
40|$|While {{little is}} known about the actual diet of free-ranging anoas, a study on their {{digestive}} physiology yielded results similar to other intermediate feeders. Among the ruminants, this species is particularly interesting, as, on the one hand, most of its closer relatives – the bovini, i. e. cattle and buffaloes – show extreme adaptations to grazing niche, but on the other hand, the anoa has a (secondarily) reduced body size usually associated with a more intermediate or browsing dietary niche. Here, we report the digestive macroscopic anatomy of a 21 year-old, 53 kg captive <b>lowland</b> <b>anoa</b> that was euthanised after a longer period of therapy-resistant diarrheoa and inability to stand. The results were compared to measurements published for other ruminants. The anoa showed several anatomical characteristics typical for the bovini (and considered typical for other grazers), such as an unpapillated dorsal ruminal mucosa, unpapillated, thick rumen pillars, pronounced reticular crests with secondary and tertiary crests, four orders of omasal laminae, and a large masseter muscle. In contrast, the omasal laminar area was small compared to data published for other species, and the parotis glands were comparatively large. The findings represent an unusual combination of anatomical characteristics for a ruminant that should be corroborated in more individuals, and could represent a retrograde change from a grazing back to an intermediate adaptation. It could be suspected that the anoa can make better use of grass-based diets than other intermediate feeders...|$|E
