25|$|The British {{government}} accuses Moorthy of provoking {{the townspeople}} to inflict violence and arrests him. Though {{the committee is}} willing to pay his bail, Moorthy refuses their money. While Moorthy spends the next three months in prison, the women of Kanthapura take charge, forming a volunteer corps under Rangamma's leadership. Rangamma instills a sense of patriotism among the women by telling them stories of notable women from Indian history. They face police brutality, including assault and rape, when the village is attacked and burned. Upon Moorthy's release from prison, he is greeted by the loyal townspeople, who are now united regardless of caste. The novel ends with Moorthy and the town <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> and planning to continue their fight for independence.|$|E

He says it concisely, [...] "structure follows strategy."

2500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews, {{with most}} critics commending the song's uplifting theme and lyrical content. Immediately after premiering on radio, Sam Lansky of Idolator remarked: [...] "The song is classic Kelly Clarkson, although much less bruised {{than many of}} her heartbreak anthems: The production is clean and sparkly, with a propulsive back-beat and clear vocals." [...] Neon Limelight wrote, [...] "The upbeat song is really less about her career and more about where she is now in her life and her [...] ability to appreciate what really matters." [...] Hardeep Phull of the New York Post gave the song three stars, saying: [...] "this is the euphoric sound of her (Clarkson) <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The Texan sounds high on life, and it makes [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] {{one of the best}} songs she’s recorded in years — warm, upbeat and boasting a chorus so big, you could land a plane on it." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV News also added, [...] "Kelly Clarkson is still pop's sassy [...] "Miss Independent", but these days, she's a bit more willing to ask for help. Clarkson's uplifting new single [...] "Catch My Breath" [...] not only pays homage to her strong-willed musical persona, but also to the people who have helped her grow into the woman she is today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lancashire {{finished}} third {{for the second}} season in succession. They lost only once (to Somerset) but drew ten and tied one. They were well served by their openers Cyril Washbrook and Winston Place who both scored more than 2,000 runs in all first-class matches, Washbrook playing in all five Tests and Place being selected for the West Indies tour. There were problems in the middle order where only Geoff Edrich performed consistently well, but the two Test all-rounders, Jack Ikin and captain Ken Cranston scored over 1,000 runs. Lancashire's outstanding bowler was paceman Dick Pollard who finished the season strongly after an indifferent early phase and took 144 wickets in all matches. Slow left armer William Roberts bowled steadily and took 74 championship wickets but Playfair remarked that he was short of Test class. As with the batting, the all-rounders Cranston and Ikin shored up the bowling with 56 and 48 championship wickets respectively. <b>Looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> Lancashire made a [...] "find" [...] in wicketkeeper Alfred Barlow and there were good reports of Alan Wharton who became a Lancashire stalwart for many seasons. Batsman Barry Howard played some good innings in his debut season and, along with Cranston, was awarded his county cap. Other players included future county captain Nigel Howard, Tom Brierley, Phil King in his final season, future Test umpire Eddie Phillipson, Eric Price, and Gordon Garlick who joined Northamptonshire in 1948.|$|E
2500|$|As the Chief of the Bureau of Naval Ordnance {{stated in}} his 1897 Small Arms {{report to the}} Secretary of the Navy, [...] "In making what may appear a radical {{departure}} in its selection of a caliber smaller than as yet adopted elsewhere...the Bureau is convinced it is <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> … it is surely wise to attempt to advance with one stride as far as existing conditions allow toward the goal to which the world is moving with slow steps." [...] The report went on to list {{the advantages of the}} smaller 6mm caliber: greatly increased velocity, flatness of bullet trajectory, reduced recoil, a 100% increase in penetration compared to the former [...]45-70 Government cartridge, and the ability to carry twice the number of cartridges per individual sailor or marine. The report acknowledged, however, that the 6mm round had two principal disadvantages: first, as a small-caliber round, the 6mm bullet would not sufficiently wound an enemy to put him out of action, and second, the [...] "shock" [...] or stopping power of the smaller bullet would not [...] "stop the onset of excited men at short range." [...] In answer to these objections, the report gave three responses: first, [...] "the battle of the future will be fought at long range, and men will not live to come to close quarters with an enemy who stands his ground"; second, [...] "99 percent of wounded enemy soldiers were unlikely to investigate the severity of their wound, but simply retire to the rear", and last, [...] "the explosive effect of a small-caliber, high-velocity bullet against the human body—the bullet tumbles or fragments to produce devastating wounds against bone or fluid-filled organs—would be more incapacitating at all ranges than wounds made by a slow-moving bullet of large caliber.|$|E

6000|$|Every one {{has read}} the treaty {{which has just}} been {{concluded}} between the United States and China. Everyone has read it, but in it there are expressions which not every one understands. There are clauses which seem vague, other clauses which seem almost unnecessary, and still others which bear the flavor of [...] "surplusage," [...] to speak in legal phrase. The most careful reading of the document will leave these impressions--that is, unless one comprehends {{the past and present}} condition of foreign intercourse with China--in which case it will be seen at once that there is no word in the treaty without a meaning, and no clause in it but was dictated by a present need or a wise policy <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> It will interest many of your readers to know why this, that, and the other provision was incorporated in the treaty; it will interest others to know in what manner and to what extent the treaty will affect our existing relations with China.

60|$|Organs, however little developed, if of use, {{should not}} be called rudimentary; they cannot {{properly}} {{be said to be}} in an atrophied condition; they may be called nascent, and may hereafter be developed to any extent by natural selection. Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are essentially useless, as teeth which never cut through the gums; in a still less developed condition, they would be of still less use. They cannot, therefore, under their present condition, have been formed by natural selection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications; they have been retained, as we shall see, by inheritance, and relate to a former condition of their possessor. It is difficult to know what are nascent organs; <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> we cannot of course tell how any part will be developed, and whether it is now nascent; looking to the past, creatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been supplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more perfect and developed condition. The wing of the penguin is of high service, and acts as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state of the wings of birds; not that I believe this to be the case, it is more probably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the Apteryx is useless, and is truly rudimentary. The mammary glands of the Ornithorhynchus may, perhaps, be considered, in comparison with the udder of a cow, as in a nascent state. The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes, which are only slightly developed and which have ceased to give attachment to the ova, are nascent branchiæ.|$|E
