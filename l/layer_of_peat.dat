5|$|The {{detailed}} {{design for the}} project was completed during summer 2006 and construction began in January 2007. The first task was to build a stable access road, but the moor was covered in a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> with a low load-bearing capacity. The whole area had also been subjected to extensive coal mining during the 19th and early 20th centuries, {{so there was a}} potential for subsidence. To address these problems, the mining voids were grouted and a floating road was constructed, using a complex system of geotextiles and geogrids to prevent the road from sinking. This was achieved by laying a crushed-gravel base, reinforced with polyester and polypropylene grids, to bridge any potential mine voids and ensure that the weak shear strength of the subsoil was exceeded by the base course material.|$|E

25|$|Located off {{the western}} end of the Newfoundland's Burin Peninsula, the {{archipelago}} of Saint Pierre and Miquelon is composed of eight islands, totalling , and of which only two are inhabited. The islands are bare and rocky, with steep coasts, and only a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> to soften the hard landscape.|$|E
5000|$|Beneath {{a strand}} swamp are <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b> Established strand swamps {{with a large}} amount of {{vegetation}} have deep peat layers. These deep peat layers can serve as a wick to draw water from underground into the swamp during droughts.|$|R
50|$|When {{the coal}} beds were forming, the climate {{in the area}} was subtropical, {{averaging}} about 120 in of rainfall a year. For some 25 million years, the basin floor was covered with lakes and swamps. Because of the large area of the swamps, the organic material accumulated into <b>peat</b> bogs instead <b>of</b> being washed to the sea. Periodically the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> were covered with sediments washed in from nearby mountains. Eventually the climate became drier and cooler. The basin filled with sediment and buried the <b>peat</b> under thousands <b>of</b> feet, compressing the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> and forming coal. Over the last several million years, much of the overlying sediment has eroded away, leaving the coal seams near the surface.|$|R
2500|$|Peatlands {{are areas}} of land with {{naturally}} formed <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b> They {{can be found}} in at least 175 countries and cover around 4 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles); that is 3% of the world’s land area. In Europe, peatlands extend to about [...] About 60% of the world's wetlands are made <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b>|$|R
25|$|The desert {{mangroves}} {{restricted to}} rocky inlets on the rugged coast of Baja California {{have been growing}} over their own root remains over thousands of years to compensate for sea-level rise, accumulating a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> below their roots. However, mangroves in flat coastal floodplains have accumulated a thinner peat layer.|$|E
25|$|Wanister Bog {{occupies}} a depression in which rainwater from higher up the fell has accumulated and created fen conditions. The characteristic species are Sphagnum mosses, which have also contributed {{largely to the}} thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> that now underlies the bog. Other species that are locally dominant are rushes, Juncus spp., and sedges, Carex spp.|$|E
25|$|The area is {{underlain}} by Carboniferous coal measures, {{which are}} capped by glacial deposits of varying thickness. Spring-lines are prominent {{on the lower}} valley slopes and {{have a significant effect}} on the vegetation. The soils are predominantly gley and acidic, well-drained and covered with a thin peaty layer on the higher ground, wetter and with a deeper <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> in less well-drained areas.|$|E
5000|$|The area prospered in the 18th {{century when}} <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> were dug up, dried, {{and used as}} fuel for {{industries}} in Gouda.

50|$|The city of Wiesmoor lies in {{the middle}} part of the East Frisian raised bog, which was formed by glaciation, and {{contained}} up to 1900 <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> up to 8m deep. Originally the bog had an area of around 100km2 {{although the majority of}} that is now covered by the city.|$|R
50|$|Much North American coal {{was created}} in subsiding areas {{adjacent}} to the Appalachian Mountains during the Pennsylvanian subperiod. A vast network of swamps covered large parts of North America at this time {{and much of the}} organic material created in these wetlands accumulated to form thick <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> (the precursor to coal) that were buried faster than they could decay.|$|R
25|$|A {{programme}} {{of surface}} prospecting was undertaken at once {{in an attempt}} to find a lateral extension of the vein. The hillside was covered with a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat,</b> and a number of Italian prisoners of war were employed to try to trace the outcrop of the vein. To help with the search, an electrical resistivity survey was carried out towards the end of 1943, and trenches were dug to investigate places on Hart Side where there were promising indications. However, only small stringers of barren quartz were found there. Underground prospecting was also done, by extending both the Lucy Level and the 120Fathom Level to the north, but without success. A thorough review of the geology by the British Geological Survey in February 1944 pointed the way to some small deposits of ore but confirmed that no major extension to the reserves existed.|$|E
500|$|Ireland has 12,000km² (4,633miles²) of bogland, {{consisting}} of two distinct types, blanket bogs and raised bogs. Blanket bogs are the more widespread of the two types. They are essentially a product of human activity aided by the moist Irish climate. Blanket bogs formed on sites where Neolithic farmers cleared trees for farming. As the land so cleared fell into disuse, the soil began to leach and become more acidic, producing a suitable environment {{for the growth of}} heather and rushes. The debris from these plants accumulated and a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> formed. [...] One of the largest expanses of Atlantic blanket bog in Ireland {{is to be found in}} County Mayo.|$|E
500|$|Titchwell has a {{long history}} of human occupation. Populations of both Modern and Neanderthal people were present in Norfolk before the last [...] {{glaciation}} between 100,000 and 10,000years ago, and returned as the ice retreated north. The archaeological record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly due to the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present, so that many sites are now under the sea. Early Mesolithic flint tools with characteristic blades up to [...] long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was [...] from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the Upper Paleolithic to the Neolithic. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the North Sea, and bringing the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line; the remains of submerged forests can still be detected at low tide. By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone, and peat marshes had formed behind an offshore barrier island or spit. A <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> formed between 1920 and 1680BC and another between 1020 and 830BC, indicating marshy conditions; polished Neolithic axes found in those layers were blackened by exposure to the peat.|$|E
50|$|With {{increasing}} paludification, {{which is}} thought to have set in during the periods of occupation, the sites were covered and protected by thick <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> and survive in excellent condition. Due to increased peat harvesting during the 19th and 20th centuries, the as yet unexcavated portions are now close to the surface and no longer protected by this natural cover.|$|R
50|$|The 2013 {{investigations}} by the Camborne School of Mines project team, show a {{chart of}} {{a cross-section of}} part of the valley between Loe Bar and Helston as being built up from a depth of twenty-five feet of silt, upon a belt seven feet deep of sea sand, above <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> from the remains of vegetation or of the ancient forest, that once covered Mount's Bay.|$|R
50|$|Peat swamp {{forests are}} swamp forests where {{waterlogged}} soils prevent woody debris from fully decomposing, which over time creates a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> acidic <b>peat.</b>|$|R
500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, hand cutting mainly affected the surface of the moors. It left behind trenches and ditches, which soon became waterlogged, and were re-colonised {{to become part of the}} diverse habitat. Once the cutting process was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to hand cutting, in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area. As early as the late 1960s, academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not worth saving.|$|E
500|$|The next {{development}} was {{the introduction of}} surface milling, which began at Hatfield in 1986 and at Swinefleet in the following year. Once an area had been drained, all vegetation {{was removed from the}} surface, and a thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> was removed by a mechanical harvester. It was stockpiled on the moors, and later loaded into wagons by a Hymec loader, to be bagged at the works. Most peat by this time was used for compost or in growbags. The milled peat was much finer than the previous peat sods, and the mesh-sided wagons were unsuitable for transporting it. A programme of fitting wooden boards to the insides of the wagons was begun, but by 1989, solid steel wagons were being fabricated, reusing the frames from the original wagons. All the wagons at Hatfield had been upgraded by May 1990, with those at Swinefleet completed afterwards. Trains of the new wagons were much heavier, particularly when loaded with milled peat, and the existing locomotives were inadequate. Tenders were invited for some more powerful locomotives, and three machines were ordered from Schöma of Germany. Two were delivered to Hatfield in 1990, and the third went to Swinefleet in 1991. Each consisted of a CHL-60G master unit, rated at [...] with a bonnet and cab, and a CHL-60T slave unit, looking more like a flat-bed truck, with a second hydraulic motor. They were much more powerful than the engines they replaced, with the four-axle arrangement ensuring that the axle loading was low enough for the existing track, and they were very popular with their operators. By the late 1990s, they were wearing out, and enquiries were made, with a view to purchasing replacements. Alan Keef designed a Bo-Bo locomotive for use on the moors, but the cost was too great, and the company rebuilt two of the Schoma locomotive and slave units. The work included replacing the original 5-cylinder engines with 6-cylinder models, improving the sanding gear and driver's seating arrangements, and fitting a more reliable air-conditioning system for the cab. Lack of funds prevented the third Schoma being upgraded. They worked on Thorne Moors removing stockpiled peat until 21 October 2005, and on Hatfield Moors until 2006. They were stored at Hatfield once rail operation had ceased, and were still there in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The Windover dig {{site is a}} small pond, about [...] in area, {{that has}} held water {{continuously}} since sometime between 9000 and 8000 BC. It is next to the Atlantic coastal ridge about [...] from Cape Canaveral. As the sea level was considerably lower 7,000 to 8,000 years ago than it is today, the pond originally sat above the water table, and was filled only by rainfall and runoff from the surrounding land. At that time the pond had a relatively thin <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> under {{a thin layer of}} water. The subsequent rise in sea level raised the local water table, and in more recent times the pond has been fed by groundwater as well as rainfall. In 1984 the pond had a thick <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat,</b> with five strata described by the archaeologists who excavated the pond. The peat {{in the center of the}} pond was covered by [...] of water.|$|E
50|$|The swamp {{contains}} numerous {{islands and}} lakes, along with vast areas of non-forested habitat. Prairies cover about 60,000 acres (240 km2) of the swamp. Once forested, these expanses of marsh were created {{during periods of}} severe drought when fires burned out vegetation and the top <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat.</b> The prairies harbor a variety of wading birds: herons, egrets, ibises, cranes, and bitterns.Refuge staff manages 33,000 acres (130 km2) of uplands which are being restored to once-abundant longleaf pine and wiregrass habitat.|$|R

During the winter storms of 2014, parts of the lost ancient forest of Borth, which 4,500 years ago stretched on the boggy land to Ynyslas, reappeared on the shoreline in the form of preserved exposed tree stumps. Due to climate change and rising sea levels, the forest was buried under <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat,</b> sand and saltwater.|$|R
25|$|During {{the end of}} {{the last}} Devensian glacial period the {{formation}} of Lake Humber in the lowest reaches of the river, meant that substantial lake bed clays and silts were laid down to create the flat landscape of the Humberhead Levels. These levels extend across the Trent valley, and include the lower reaches of the Eau, Torne and Idle. In some areas, successive <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> were built up above the lacustrine deposits during the Holocene period, which created lowland mires such as the Thorne and Hatfield Moors.|$|R
2500|$|Soil borings in {{the area}} of the 17th Street Canal breach showed a <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> {{starting}} at about [...] below the surface, and ranging from about [...] to [...] thick. Engineers misjudged the strength of the peat which is from the remains of the swamp on which some areas of New Orleans (near Lake Ponchartrain) in the 20th century were built. The shear strength of this peat was found to be very low and it had a high water content. According to Robert Bea, a geotechnical engineer from the University of California, Berkeley, the weak soil made the floodwall very vulnerable to the stresses of a large flood. [...] "At 17th Street, the soil moved laterally, pushing entire wall sections with it.... As Katrina's storm surge filled the canal, water pressure rose in the soil underneath the wall and in the peat layer. Water moved through the soil underneath the base of the wall. When the rising pressure and moving water overcame the soil's strength, it suddenly shifted, taking surrounding material– and the wall– with it." ...|$|E
60|$|Rain {{water is}} seldom pure. It carries in it {{carbonic}} acid; and that acid, beating in shower after shower against {{the face of}} a cliff-- especially if it be a limestone cliff--weathers the rock chemically; changing (in case of limestone) the insoluble carbonate of lime into a soluble bicarbonate, and carrying that away in water, which, however clear, is still hard. Hard water is usually water which has invisible lime in it; there are from ten to fifteen grains and more of lime in every gallon of limestone water. I leave you to calculate the enormous weight of lime which must be so carried down to the sea every year by a single limestone or chalk brook. You can calculate it, if you like, by ascertaining the weight of lime in each gallon, and the average quantity of water which comes down the stream in a day; and when your sum is done, you will be astonished to find it one not of many pounds, but probably of many tons, of solid lime, which you never suspected or missed from the hills around. Again, by the time the rain has sunk through the soil, it is still less pure. It carries with it not only carbonic acid, but acids produced by decaying vegetables--by the roots of the grasses and trees which grow above; and they dissolve the cement of the rock by chemical action, especially if the cement be lime or iron. You may see this for yourselves, again and again. You may see how the root of a tree, penetrating the earth, discolours the soil with which it is in contact. You may see how the whole rock, just below the soil, has often changed in colour from the compact rock below, if the soil be covered with a dense <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> or growing vegetables.|$|E

50|$|After {{his return}} to Germany, Rust worked for an {{electricity}} company and pursued his vocation as an amateur archaeologist.

With hard work {{and the spirit of}} innovation, Rust used new methods (soil coring, excavation in floodplains with drainage by pumps) to examine the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> around the areas left by the melting of the ice sheet which currently form the Meiendorfer Ahrensburg valley, near Hamburg (in the district of Stormarn, State of Schleswig-Holstein).|$|R
50|$|The Wauconda Bog is a wetland {{created by}} the Wisconsin glaciation, the most recent of the {{so-called}} ice ages to affect the Illinois landscape. Core samples have been extracted from the peat layers contained within the bog, and they have told a vivid story of climate change in central North America during the postglacial period. Different levels of temperature and precipitation encouraged the growth of very different kinds of plant life during this period; these diverse species released large quantitites of characteristic pollen, which was trapped within the <b>layers</b> <b>of</b> <b>peat</b> preserved here.|$|R

5000|$|Much {{more rain}} falls on Dartmoor {{than in the}} {{surrounding}} lowlands.
