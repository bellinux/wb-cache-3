This question is answered by exploring short and long-term wage mobility for males across 14 EU countries between 1994 and 2001 using ECHP. Mobility is evaluated using rank measures which capture positional movements in the distribution of earnings. All countries recording an increase in cross-sectional inequality recorded also a decrease in short-term mobility. Among countries where inequality decreased, short-term mobility increased in Denmark, Spain, Ireland and UK, and decreased in Belgium, France and Ireland. <b>Long-term</b> <b>mobility</b> is higher than short-term mobility, but long-term persistency is still high in all countries.

40|$|International audienceLittle {{is known}} about {{individual}} economic mobility in the 19 th century. This article examines this question by studying the group of franchised Parisian voters of the 1840 s. Different sources are matched in order to follow longitudinally the trajectories of the individuals who belong to this particularly rich and politically important group over time. Both short-term and <b>long-term</b> <b>mobility</b> are analyzed. Short-term mobility is observed by matching individuals who appear in the electoral lists of the years 1845 and 1846. These lists show the direct taxes that were paid by the voters. <b>Long-term</b> <b>mobility</b> is revealed by exploiting the Parisian Tables of successions and absences (TSA) of the years 1845 to 1859. These contain information about the wealth at death of individuals. Because the tax-based voting franchise and wealth {{do not have the}} same structure, this article studies the comparability between these two variables and explores the question of the political representation of wealth. Despite the difference in definition between the tax-based voting franchise and wealth, the data set shows consistent correlations across time. Moreover, both in the short and long term, economic mobility proves to be substantial. 14 percent of individuals changed quintile between 1845 and 1846, which is considerable over a one-year period.

40|$|Using the {{framework}} of a dynamic intertemporal optimization model of an open economy, it is shown that the long-run investment-saving correlation follows directly from the economy's dynamic budget constraint and this does not depend on the degree of international capital mobility. Therefore, unless the budget constraint is violated, the time series of investment and saving should be cointegrated, and this should be true for any degree of capital mobility. Using an improved econometric technique, which encompasses the tests used by previous authors and avoids some of the pitfalls associated with their tests, I show that their conflicting findings can be explained by a simple but important, omitted variables problem.

The latter usually involve alterations in the spatial distribution of activities and, hence, in the activity space, thereby also influencing the daily travel behavior. In this context, the ownership of mobility tools, such as cars and different public transport season tickets, also plays an important role, since people commit themselves to particular travel behaviors as they trade large one-time costs for a low marginal cost {{at the time of}} usage. At the same time, decisions concerning mobility tool ownership have lasting effects, as have the decisions concerning location choices.

40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on human mobility ranges and their regional impacts. We first introduce an interpretative framework that situates place populations within {{a continuum of}} transiences and intensities: according to this, short- and <b>long-term</b> <b>mobilities,</b> generally associated with a binary of work-related migration and tourism, can be revisioned as a spectrum of fluid situations by which the permanence of people into places results from an articulated range of factors of attraction or place characteristics, and dynamically modifies this context. Indeed we postulate that different attraction factors attract different flows that could be characterised in this way as "regional audiences"; {{the fact that the}} same factors could be attractive to different audiences means that regions have to "tune" to an accommodate different users and uses, and as foreseen by Martinotti (1992) in his "four populations" urbanisation model, the success in doing that is a fundamental aspect of sustainable development We then use results from the ESPON 2013 Program (ATTREG project) to classify regions according to the populations {{that they were able to}} attract in the 2001 - 2008 period, and reflect upon the complex process of embedding different "audiences" into places in terms of attraction strategies and issues of resiliency. Our findings challenge the conventional wisdom that migrants are attracted by economic buoyancy and tight labour markets for highly skilled workers, and cast an interesting light about the synergetic effects of different population groups. We show for instance that "tourist regions", or regions that are particularly endowed for (and have been able to) attracting short-term mobilities, have had a good score in attracting longer-term forms of mobility, but only until economic conditions were favourable and some upper threshold have been reached; whereas regions with lower attractiveness scores have been better able to face the direct effects of the global crisis...|$|R

40|$|<b>Long-term</b> and mid-term <b>mobility</b> {{of people}} {{involves}} {{on the one}} hand decisions about their residential locations and the corresponding moves. At the same time, the places of education and employment play an important role. On the other hand the ownership of mobility tools, such as cars and different public transport season tickets, is a complementary element in this process, which also binds substantial resources. These two aspects of mobility behaviour are closely connected to one another. A longitudinal perspective on these relationships is available from people's life courses, which link different dimensions of life together. Besides the personal and familial history, locations of residence, education and employment as well as the ownership of mobility tools can be taken into account. These life course dimensions are usually not independent from one another. Events in one area are frequently connected to changes in other areas. At the same time, this longitudinal approach provides the possibility to observe developments over time. In order to study the dynamics of <b>long-term</b> and mid-term <b>mobility</b> decisions, a longitudinal survey covering the 20 -year period from 1985 to 2004 was carried out at the beginning of 2005 in a stratified sample of municipalities in the Zurich region, Switzerland.

Thereby the mobility tool ownership remains comparably stable over longer periods of time. Concerning the ownership of the various mobility tools, the analyses indicate that car ownership and public transport season ticket ownership substitute one another. During the life course car ownership is highest among those who are 35 to 55 years old today. At the same time, men have noticeably more frequently a car at their disposal than women of the same age. Concerning the ownership of national and regional season tickets, the opposite trend is visible...|$|R

We explore this question in sediments representative of the Sellafield Ltd. site, UK, over multiple reduction and oxidation cycles spanning ~ 1. 5 years. We found the amount of Tc remobilised from the sediment into solution significantly decreased after repeated redox cycles. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed that sediment bound Tc was present as hydrous TcO 2 -like chains throughout experimentation and that Tcâ€™s increased resistance to remobilisation (via reoxidation to soluble TcO 4 -) resulted from both shortening of TcO 2 chains during redox cycling and association of Tc(IV) with Fe phases in the sediment.

Finally, direct numerical simulations illustrate that our models yield considerably higher mobility of strongly nonlinear solutions than the well-known "standard" discretizations, even in the case of highly discrete systems when the coupling between the adjacent nodes is weak.
