50|$|A career average pension {{is a type}} of {{occupational}} pension scheme, where people saving for retirement pay for a benefit after retirement where they will receive a sum that is calculated according to their average earnings over their career. Particularly in UK pensions, this model has been introduced as an alternative to both defined contribution pensions, which may run out and lead to old age poverty if they live longer, and final salary pensions which give people a benefit based on the <b>last</b> <b>salary</b> they earned before retirement. It is thought that career average pensions are more fair than final salary pensions, when people have not, for instance in their last few years of work, jumped up to management positions with much higher salaries: career average pensions mean that lower earners do not subsidise much higher pension benefits for just a few people.|$|E

50|$|In 1653 Froberger {{passed through}} Heidelberg, Nuremberg and Regensburg before {{returning}} to Vienna in April.

His relationship with Ferdinand's successor, Leopold I, was strained for a number of political reasons (numerous forces were opposed to Leopold's election, and among them were the Jesuit order and Johann Philipp von Schönborn, Elector-Archbishop of Mainz; Froberger's mentor and friend Kircher was an important figure in the former, and Froberger had strong ties with the court of the latter.

The final scene is where Henry Nash, played by Brad Johnson, is in the desert, presumably Arizona, and is talking to the headstones of Buckey O'Neill and George Neville.
