There has {{been a great deal of}} work over the past decade analyzing the geometry and the dynamics of the rigid body motion with n controls, 0 n 2. We can mention here the papers of Brockett [4], Aeyels [1], Aeyels and Szafranski [2], Bloch and Marsden [3], Holm and Marsden [6] and Puta [9], [10]. In general, in all the above papers the involved controls are of polynomial type of degree two. The goal of our paper is to consider the case of the <b>linear</b> <b>controls.</b> More precisely we present some geometrical properties of the rigid body with two particular <b>linear</b> <b>controls</b> about the minor and respectively the major axes. 2.

2500|$|Processes in {{industries}} like robotics and {{the aerospace industry}} typically have strong nonlinear dynamics. In control theory it is sometimes possible to linearize such classes of systems and apply linear techniques, {{but in many cases}} it can be necessary to devise from scratch theories permitting control of nonlinear systems. These, e.g., feedback linearization, backstepping, sliding mode control, trajectory linearization control normally take advantage of results based on Lyapunov's theory. Differential geometry has been widely used as a tool for generalizing well-known <b>linear</b> <b>control</b> concepts to the non-linear case, as well as showing the subtleties that make it a more challenging problem. [...] Control theory has also been used to decipher the neural mechanism that directs cognitive states.|$|E
2500|$|Dijkstra's thesis {{was that}} departures from <b>linear</b> <b>control</b> flow were clearer if allowed only in disciplined higher-level {{structures}} such as the if-then-else statement and the while loop. This methodology was developed into structured programming movement, {{the title of his}} 1972 book, coauthored with C.A.R. Hoare and Ole-Johan Dahl. Considered by many as the first significant movement in history of computer programming, structured programming became the new programming orthodoxy during the 1970s. Bertrand Meyer remarked that, [...] "The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Linear</b> <b>control</b> theory – This {{applies to}} systems made of devices which obey the {{superposition}} principle, which means roughly that the output {{is proportional to}} the input. [...] They are governed by linear differential equations. [...] A major subclass is systems which in addition have parameters which do not change with time, called linear time invariant (LTI) systems. [...] These systems are amenable to powerful frequency domain mathematical techniques of great generality, such as the Laplace transform, Fourier transform, Z transform, Bode plot, root locus, and Nyquist stability criterion. [...] These lead to a description of the system using terms like bandwidth, frequency response, eigenvalues, gain, resonant frequencies, poles, and zeros, which give solutions for system response and design techniques for most systems of interest.|$|E
