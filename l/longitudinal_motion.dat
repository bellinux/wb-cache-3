Then the second ship will come closer in the same direction but a bit faster. When the vessels are navigating side to side, they can be moored. First of all, the spring lines will be tensioned to maintain the vessels at the same speed. Then the breast lines will keep the vessels as close as possible.

50|$|At {{the next}} level of approximation, as the {{particle}} orbits and moves along the field line, along which the field changes slowly, the radius of the orbit changes so as to keep the magnetic flux enclosed by the orbit constant. Since the Lorentz force is strictly perpendicular to the velocity, it cannot change the energy of a charged particle moving in it. Thus the particle's kinetic energy remains constant. Then so also must its speed be constant. Then it can be shown that the particle's velocity parallel to the local field must decrease if the field is increasing along its z motion, and increase if the field decreases, while the components of the velocity transverse to the field increase or decrease so as to keep the magnitude of the total velocity constant. Conservation of energy prevents the transverse velocity from increasing without limit, and eventually the longitudinal component of the velocity becomes zero, while the pitch angle, of the particle with respect to the field line, becomes 90°. Then the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>motion</b> is stopped and reversed, and the particle is reflected back towards regions of weaker field, the guiding center now retracing its previous motion along the field line, with the particle's transverse velocity decreasing and its longitudinal velocity increasing.|$|E

The {{problem of}} calculating the {{response}} of an aircraft in rolling manoeuvres when the mass distribution of the aircraft is such that the inertia terms in the equations of motion effect a cross-coupling of the usual lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>motions</b> is considered.

40|$|We perform {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} nonlinear MHD waves in a gravitationally stratified molecular cloud that is bounded by a hot and tenuous external medium. We study {{the relation between}} the strength of the turbulence and various global properties of a molecular cloud, within a 1. 5 -dimensional approximation. Under the influence of a driving source of Alfvénic disturbances, the cloud is lifted up by the pressure of MHD waves and reaches a steady-state characterized by oscillations about a new time-averaged equilibrium state. The nonlinear effect results in the generation of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>motions</b> and many shock waves; however, the wave kinetic energy remains predominantly in transverse, rather than <b>longitudinal,</b> <b>motions.</b> There is an approximate equipartition of energy between the transverse velocity and fluctuating magnetic field (as predicted by small-amplitude theory) in the region of the stratified cloud which contains most of the mass; however, this relation breaks down in the outer regions, particularly near the cloud surface, where the motions have a standing-wave character. This means that the Chandrasekhar-Fermi formula applied to molecular clouds must be significantly modified in such regions. Models of an ensemble of clouds show that, for various strengths of the input energy, the velocity dispersion in the cloud σ ∝ Z 0. 5, where Z is a characteristic size of the cloud. Furthermore, σ is always comparable to the mean Alfvén velocity of the cloud, consistent with observational results...|$|R
40|$|Bifurcation {{analysis}} and stability design for aircraft <b>longitudinal</b> <b>motion</b> are investigated when the nonlinearity in flight dynamics takes place severely at high {{angle of attack}} regime. To predict the special nonlinear flight phenomena, bifurcation theory and continuation method are employed to systematically analyze the nonlinear motions.
