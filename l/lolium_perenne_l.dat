40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate ryegrass seedling characteristics that, by themselves, or combined with presently known characters, could improve varietal identification tests. Thirteen characters were studied on 30 varieties of <b>Lolium</b> multiflorum Lam., <b>L.</b> <b>perenne</b> <b>L.,</b> L. rigidum Gaud, and L. hybridum Hausskn., including leaf size and area, epidermal characteristics, structural elements, and leaf blade vernation. Mean differences among species occurred in the following characteristics: Lolium multiflorum. and L. perenne: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor and major vascular bundles, lower and upper sclerenchyma fiber groups, hair density, number of vascular bundles, and leaf blade vernation, Lolium multiflorum and L. hybridum; leaf width, leaf length, leaf area and leaf vernation. <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> and <b>L.</b> hybridum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, and total of sclerenchyma fiber groups, and leaf vernation. <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> and <b>L.</b> rigidum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, and leaf vernation. Lolium multiflorum and L. rigidum: leaf blade vernation. Lolium hybridum and L. rigidum: leaf blade vernation. Tetraploids and diploids were significantly different on the average, within their respective species, as follows: Lolium multiflorum: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, stomata density. Lolium perenne: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, stomata density. Lolium hybridum: stomata density, and number of major vascular bundles. Some significant differences among varieties within species and ploidy levels were observed in the following characteristics: Lolium multiflorum tetraploids: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles. Lolium multiflorum diploids: leaf width, leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles, total vascular bundles. <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> tetraploids: leaf area. <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> diploids: leaf length, leaf area, minor vascular bundles. Although varietal means differed for many of the characters, individual plants could not be identified on the basis of a single character. An illustration was prepared to show how a combination of morphological characters might be used in varietal identification. With a table of varietal means for nine characters, only two (Jolanda and Tetrone [...] both tetraploids of L. multiflorum) of the 30 varieties studied were indistinguishable. The leaf blade vernation of Wimmera (L. rigidum) and.

On the one hand, this discrepancy may be attributed to genotypic differences or variability in seed lot quality of the tested seed material but it may also be the test conditions. Interestingly, it has been shown that different techniques of MWCNT application, such as dispersal in agar medium or spraying onto the seed surface did not change the beneficial effects on the germination of barley (H. vulgare), soybean (G. max) and maize (Z. mays) [128]. However, the chemical composition of the growth media used for the germination tests may play an important role. These media can contain simply distilled water [158, 159], but also agar with and without supplementation of mineral nutrients [127] or even complete media used for plant tissue cultures, such as Murashige-Skoog medium [128, 154], supplemented with minerals, amino acids, vitamins and hormones as bioactive compounds [161].

40|$|The {{influence}} of two sward treatments and soil cultivation on the composition, the structure, {{and the evolution}} of the biomass of vineyard weed communities was examined. The 3 -year study (2002 - 2004) was carried out in a sloping, non-irrigated vineyard, cv. ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’, in the Estremadura winegrowing region of Portugal. The experimental treatments were: soil tillage (control); permanent sown cover crop - <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> ‘Nui’, <b>L.</b> multiflorum ‘Bartíssimo’, Festuca ovina ‘Ridu’, F. rubra ssp. rubra ‘Echo’, Trifolium incarnatum. ‘Red’, T. repens ‘Huie’ and T. subterraneum ‘Claire’; and permanent resident vegetation. Total weed biomass in the spring did not reveal significant differences between treatments, but varied annually. The management practices – e. g. time and number of soil cultivations and inter-row mowing – were determinant in weed biomass evolution. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed significant treatment effects on community structure. Three years after the experiment was set up, in the soil tillage treatment weed composition was dominated by annual broad-leaved species, namely five Geraniaceae species, Medicago polymorpha and Sonchus oleraceus. The perennial broad-leaved species Oxalis pes-caprae was also a dominant species in soil tillage. In both sward treatments there was an increase in the perennial broad-leaved and grass species. Compared to soil tillage, in the resident vegetation treatment there was a significant increase in perennial species, such as Rumex crispus, Veronica anagallis-aquatica and Polypogon monspeliensis, and in the annuals Melilotus indica and Avena sterilis. The increase in these perennial species, which are considered to compete with vines, requires more frequent mowing in the summer. In the permanent sown cover crop treatment, <b>L.</b> <b>perenne</b> and T. repens displayed the ability to re-establish successfully, and their abundance decreased or suppressed most of the annual and perennial weed species...|$|R

The present study tested the hypotheses that: (1) defoliation-induced changes in xylem amino acid composition occur in <b>L.</b> <b>perenne</b> within the first 24 h following defoliation, irrespective of phasing with respect to the diurnal light/dark cycle; and (2) the increase in Asn : Gln ratio in the xylem fluid of <b>L.</b> <b>perenne</b> following defoliation is due to an increase in Asn content. Plants of <b>L.</b> <b>perenne</b> <b>L.</b> ?Aurora? were grown in flowing solution culture for 40 d.

Xylem samples were collected over the subsequent 24 h period with amino acids speciated by GC-MS. There was support for the first hypothesis: increased Asn : Gln ratios occurred within the first 24 h, irrespective of the phasing of defoliation with respect to light/dark cycles. The second hypothesis was not supported: the concentration of all amino acids in the xylem exudate declined after defoliation, and the increased Asn : Gln ratio was accounted for by a disproportionately large reduction in Gln levels. Low concentrations of amino acids in the xylem of defoliated plants precluded accurate discrimination of their nitrogen content into pre- and post-defoliation sources. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay varied across the seven chromosomes and the conspicuous pattern of LD between the HF and LF population confirmed their divergence in freezing tolerance. Furthermore, two Fst outlier methods; finite island model (fdist) by LOSITAN and hierarchical structure model using ARLEQUIN detected six loci under directional selection. These outlier loci are most probably linked to genes involved in freezing tolerance, cold adaptation and abiotic stress and might be the potential marker resources for breeding perennial ryegrass cultivars with improved freezing tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> <b>L.,</b> Festuca rubra L., Festuca arundinacea Schreb., Poa pratensis L. and Poa annua L. aqueous {{extracts}} on germination rate and total germinability of Poa annua L. seeds {{and length of}} Poa annua L. leaves and roots was studied in a laboratory experiment. Germination of seeds was conducted in the growth chamber at the light and temperature regime – day/night – 12 / 12 hours, 23 / 15 ˚C, rh 70 %, for 42 days. Extracts significantly affected the total germinability and germination rate of Poa annua L. seeds (p = 0. 000). The lowest germinability (27. 3 ± 7. 1 %) and germination rate (0. 7 ± 0. 2 seeds per day) had Poa annua L. seeds germinated in Poa pratensis L. aqueous extract. Used extracts (except for Festuca rubra L. extract) had significantly inhibitory effect on length of Poa annua L. roots in comparison with control variant. The positive effect of extract from <b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> <b>L.</b> and Festuca rubra L. (not– significant) and the negative effect of extract from Poa pratensis L. and Poa annua l. (significant) were apparent on length of Poa annua L. leaves...|$|E

Resulting yields for native and introduced cool season perennial grasses were fairly positive, however, all sites were rain fed and some seedings were unsuccessful due to dry conditions. Timothy (Phleum pratense L.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis L.), perennial ryegrass (<b>Lolium</b> <b>perenne</b> <b>L.),</b> and orchard grass (Dactyls glomerata L.) dominated the early test plantings...|$|E
