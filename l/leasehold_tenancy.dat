40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that land markets, including both land sales and tenancy markets, are neither efficient nor conducive to social equity. It is often argued that tenants, particularly share tenants, do not have proper incentives to work and invest, {{partly because of the}} disincentive effects of output sharing and partly because of the tenure insecurity. It is also widely accepted that land sales transactions tend to exacerbate the social equity and rural poverty by facilitating the concentration of land ownership by hands of a few wealthy landlords. Based on these presumptions, land reform programs have been implemented in a number of developing countries. This article critically reviews these presumptions both theoretically and empirically. Firstly, we identify why land tenancy transaction is more common than land sales transactions and why share tenancy is more common than <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenancy.</b> Secondly, we critically review the theories of share tenancy, tenure security, and adjustment costs of farm size. Thirdly, we empirically review the efficiency and equity effects of land markets as well as the impacts of conventional land reform programs. It has become clear from the literature review that land reform polices have generally failed to improve land use efficiency and social equity. It is also found that tenancy contracts, including share tenancy, are generally efficient and conducive to social justice. In conclusion, we propose to encourage tenancy transactions, in general, and share tenancy, in particular. Farmers, Farm Production and Farm Markets...|$|E
50|$|In North America and {{elsewhere}} {{where it is}} common for public and private corporations to raise funds through the issue of bonds, the term is normally used in this context. However, in the United Kingdom {{and elsewhere}} where the issue of bonds (other than government bonds) is unusual, and where long-term <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenancies</b> are common, the term is only normally used in the context of replacement or renewal of capital assets, particularly the common parts of buildings.|$|R
40|$|In 2011, Professor Adrian J Bradbrook {{retired from}} a {{distinguished}} scholarly career spanning over forty years. During this time, {{he made a}} significant contribution to teaching and scholarship not only in property law — specifically to <b>leasehold</b> <b>tenancies</b> law and easements and restrictive covenants — but also to energy law, especially the emerging and growing field of solar energy. This book brings together those people who worked closely with Bradbrook, each an expert in their own right, to honour a career by critically engaging with the contributions Bradbrook made to property and energy law. Each author has chosen a topic that both fits with their own cutting-edge research and explores the related contributions made by Bradbrook. Most unusually, this collection ranges widely across property law, energy law and human rights...|$|R

Its stated mission is assist {{communities}} in the conversion of their apartheid-era <b>leasehold</b> title (<b>tenancy)</b> to freehold title (ownership). Khaya Lam is Xhosa for [...] "My Home." [...] The project makes use of the Upgrading of Land Tenure Rights Act (112 of 1991), or 'ULTRA', which [...] "places an obligation on councils to transfer municipal land to tenants".|$|R

40|$|The land {{development}} process involves decision-making by landowners, developers and builders {{in the context}} of a changing socioeconomic environment. Essential to that process is the transfer of property rights either wholly (freehold) or partly (leasehold) from landowners to builders. This process is examined in Huddersfield between 1770 and 1911. Development from 1770 to 1850 was dominated by, the Ramsden Estate. Building was undertaken in an ad, hoc and informal manner by small capitalists from all ranks of society. Some limited building took place on freehold land but most houses were built on <b>leasehold</b> tenure or <b>tenancy</b> at will, the latter being available on the Ramsden Estate. After 1850 an increasing number of landowners participated in {{land development}} as suburbanisation took place, firstly amongst the upper middle classes and after 1880 amongst the lower middle classes. Consequently the Ramsden Estate's near monopoly of development land declined" and that Estate found it increasingly difficult to let land on the terms and conditions it wished. Builders, however, had a widening choice of locations in which to build and exhibited a preference for land available on long-term leasehold. By 1867 this had become the tenure on which land was available throughout Huddersfield. During the final years of the nineteenth century a number of changes were manifest in the mechanics of land development. Construction costs rose, primarily as a result of the introduction of byelaws governing house-building. Thus, not only did builders increasingly concentrate on building for the lower middle classes at the expense. of the working classes, but they also increased the size of building projects. Moreover, house building was now chiefly initiated by members of the lower middle classes or building contractors on a speculative basis rather than the contractual basis that had been the practice. Meanwhile, landowners found themselves in increasing competition with each other in the supply of land. By the beginning of the twentieth century some of the smaller landowners were offering land for development on freehold as well as leasehold tenure, whichever a builder preferred...|$|R
