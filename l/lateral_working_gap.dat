40|$|The pulsed {{electrochemical}} machining (PECM) with oscillating cathode is a manufacturing technology {{which is used}} for shaping and surface structuring of different workpieces, e. g. impact extrusion punches. The principle behind the ECM-process is the controlled anodic dissolution of the workpiece material without any thermal or mechanical impact and independent from workpiece material hardness. In this study, a new multi-scale approach for the modelling of PECM with oscillating cathode was created integrating the short and long time scale physical phenomena. In the short time scale simulation step (t 10 s). Within this simulation step, the anodic dissolution was simulated by deforming the geometry. This approach allows simulations for long overall time ranges (t > 1000 s) while considering the short times scale processes in combination with a relatively small computational effort. This multiscale and multiphysics model helps to analyze the differences between front and <b>lateral</b> <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> and supports the process design for the pulsed {{electrochemical machining}} with oscillating cathode...|$|E
40|$|In several {{fields of}} {{mechanical}} engineering internal precision geometries are applied. For this, application requirements like high shape accuracy, sufficient stability, high wear resistance or an increase of life time have to be fulfilled. However, {{there is also a}} demand on quick and precise manufacturing processes that are flexible in machining various internal geometries. Electrochemical machining (ECM) is a process which meets these requirements. This process allows surface structuring and shaping of metal components with high shape accuracy independently of the materials strength and hardness [1]. This study presents investigations on a developed process design for manufacturing internal precision geometries by pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) with help of multiphysics simulations. The peculiarity of this process is the shaping of the workpiece by the <b>lateral</b> <b>working</b> <b>gap.</b> Multiphysics simulations were carried out to understand the respective interactions between several physical phenomena. Especially, fluid dynamical effects are described in detail within the developed model. Furthermore, Joule heating and cathodic hydrogen formation are included. The fluid flow ensures the removal of heat and hydrogen and a continual supply with fresh electrolyte, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the electrolyte is modeled as a function of hydrogen volume concentration and temperature. Hence, both effects, Joule heating and hydrogen formation, influence the current density distribution which in turn determines the material removal...|$|E

The relaxation speed of the machine has the great bearing on whether the solution can be read out fast enough [1]. Although the fast read-out has been proved in Ref. [1], one may still have some small questions. (1) In the proof [1], the relaxation is assumed to start within the <b>working</b> <b>gap.</b> Will it be a problem if the machine is initially at some crashing mode so that the relaxation starts from a level beyond the <b>working</b> <b>gap?</b> No. It is just for convenience to assume the start point of the relaxation within the <b>working</b> <b>gap.</b> In fact, if one tailors the logic gates {{so that when they}} fail to carry out the logic function correctly, the energy will always be increased by some integral multiples of Eg. Then there will be crashing levels of Eg, 2 Eg, 3 Eg, · · · for crashing modes. If the falling ratios for the crashing levels are polynomially bounded, the same argument of working-mode-relaxation applies as well to crashing-mode-relaxation. The relaxation takes at most polynomial time. (2) If it happens, although rarely, that the transition matrix elements of a state φ on the level En = n ∆ to other states with lower energy all vanish, will this state be a deadly trap of the static quantum computer? No. Even if that worst situation happens, one can keep the computer at the temperature T which satisfies δ ≪ kT ≪ ∆ so that it is very easy for the machine to jump out of this trap to other states on the same level En via thermal hopping...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{electrochemical}} etching requires {{the existence of}} an electrolytic bath and two electrodes with a certain distance in between, which is called the gap width. For an intensive etching process the gap between the electrodes should vary over short periods. The increase of the gap provides the possibility to rinse the removed material. Material which is ablated by the process of electrochemical etching in an electrolytic bath must be removed by rinsing. A periodic expanding of the <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> between electrode and work piece is essential for an intensive etching process. The duration of the rinsing process should be kept short for the reason of efficiency. Small <b>working</b> <b>gaps</b> lead to high contour accuracy during the etching process itself. The arising process forces reach to kilo Newton range. Thereby, a short circuit between electrode and work piece must be avoided. By the usage of new high dynamic actuators instead of powered drive solutions a profile of the electrode movement could be realized, which is better adapted to the process requirements. This article introduces a Simulinkr model (under simplifying assumptions) for the determination of relations between the movement of the electrode and the arising forces in the <b>working</b> <b>gap.</b> The results are fundamental input data for dimensioning of actuating elements. State-of-the-art for the adjustment of the gap size is to use a powered drive. A motor-driven tappet provides a sinusoidal curve of the gap width over time. A rectangular-shaped gap over short periods would be optimal. Moreover, the motor-driven approach requires large electrical engine power and high effort for the positioning accuracy of the tiny etching gaps. To overcome these problems high dynamic actuators, for example piezo-stacks, can be used because they can act with relatively high frequency and high accuracy while providing high reaction forces and the necessary stroke. To prove the usability of different actuators simulations were done, which are introduced in the first section. This section also introduces the physical model of the system from which the differential equations and the Simulinkr model are derived. The behavior of the system and conclusions concerning dimensioning of certain input parameters are discussed in the following section. Finally, the last section provides conclusions and an outlook. As the simulations show, the realization of a piezo-based vibration drive is very promising. Since the estimated spring stiffness of the piezo actuator as well as the electrode mass are realistic values, they are retained. The <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> can be forced to be relatively constant caused by the nonlinear system properties and by applying a drive frequency which is advantageous to the resonance frequency. Additionally, a trapezoid excitation performed by the piezo actuator is reasonable to achieve the desired gap shape. The large reaction forces limit the minimal <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> to approximately 10 micrometer at relatively small electrode shell areas. The resulting opened gap should be large enough for the rinsing. The next step is to verify the simulation results by doing measurements of the system. On basis of the results the model can be improved by considering the masses of the actuator and the linear drive as well as its stiffness. Additionally, the shell area can be calculated depending on the gap width and the real dynamic viscosity of the liquid should be used...|$|R

40|$|Jet Electrochemical Machining (Jet-ECM) is an {{innovative}} micro-production technique for machining complex and highly accurate geometries in electrically conductive materials [1, 2, 3]. In Jet-ECM a continuous electrolytic free jet {{is used in}} which extremely high current densities up to 2000 A/cm² can be applied [4]. Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration of the Jet-ECM principle. The electrolytic solution is pumped continuously through a micro nozzle, which usually has a diameter of 100 µm. The electrolyte is ejected with an average speed of approximately 20 m/s perpendicularly to the work piece surface. Thus a free jet is formed on the surrounding atmospheric air, {{which leads to a}} highly localized current density and to a highly localized machining area. Micro structures are actually machined by moving the nozzle horizontally over the work piece surface and switching the process voltage in dependence of the nozzle’s position. For this purpose a prototype setup based on a three-axes positioning system was designed and realized [5]. The electrolytic jet can be seen as an ohmic resistor, whereat the value of resistance is proportional to the length of the jet and thus changes according to the actual <b>working</b> <b>gap.</b> Hence, the actual current density depends on the actual <b>working</b> <b>gap,</b> which directly influences the shape of the eroded structures.

40|$|In {{addition}} to anodic dissolution there are secondary reactions during electrochemical machining (ECM) of metal materials. Among others the secondary reactions include {{the generation of}} hydrogen and oxygen. These gases {{are present in the}} <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> in form of bubbles and influence the local conductivity of the electrolyte, and thus also the local current density. During machining the <b>working</b> <b>gap</b> is flushed with fresh electrolyte and so a distribution of gas bubbles in flush direction has to be expected. The described influence of the gas generation is one significant challenge in ECM process design. [1, 2] In this study the generation of gas during pulsed electrochemical machining (PECM) will be examined. Therefore a device is created to analyse the amount of generated gas in a PECM process. The device realises a quantitative ascertainment of the generated gas volume and was implemented into a commercial PECM setup. The generated gas is directed into a measuring cylinder. This enables the analysis of the gas amount through the displacement principle [3]. The gas collector is implemented at the electrolyte outlet of the flushing chamber. In this connection the diameter from the electrolyte outlet to the measuring cylinder becomes bigger and the electrolyte-gas-mixture slows down. Thereby the gas bubbles up in the measuring cylinder and is gathered in the upper part. For correct measuring during a machining process the gas level is measured before and after the machining process. The determination of gas generation is shown on selected removal experiments by variation of the current density and pulse duration...|$|R

With small <b>working</b> <b>gaps</b> in ranges down to 10 μm, the anodic shape evolution during machining is getting difficult to monitor. Therefore understanding the shaping phenomena during the PECM process is key factor in achieving precision during the manufacturing of dies and molds, as well as precision parts in e. g. automotive or aircraft industry. In this contribution an experimental approach towards visual in-process observations of the PECM shaping process during the use of mechanical vibrations up to 50 Hz and high pulsed current densities will be presented.
