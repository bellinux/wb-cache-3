50|$|Apart {{from the}} qualities already mentioned, several other {{properties}} of photochromics {{are important for}} their use. These include quantum yield, fatigue resistance, photostationary state, and polarity and solubility. The quantum yield of the photochemical reaction determines {{the efficiency of the}} photochromic change with respect to the amount of light absorbed. The quantum yield of isomerization can be strongly dependent on conditions.In photochromic materials, fatigue refers to the loss of reversibility by processes such as photodegradation, photobleaching, photooxidation, and other side reactions. All photochromics suffer fatigue to some extent, and its rate is strongly dependent on the activating light and the conditions of the sample. Photochromic materials have two states, and their interconversion can be controlled using different wavelengths of light. Excitation with any given wavelength of light will result in a mixture of the two states at a particular ratio, called the photostationary state. In a perfect system, there would exist wavelengths {{that can be used to}} provide 1:0 and 0:1 ratios of the isomers, but in real systems this is not possible, since the active absorbance bands always overlap to some extent. In order to incorporate photochromics in working systems, they suffer the same issues as other dyes. They are often charged in one or more state, leading to very high polarity and possible large changes in polarity. They also often contain <b>large</b> <b>conjugated</b> <b>systems</b> that limit their solubility.|$|R

Three probe reactions were used: oligomerization of styrene, methanol-to-olefin (MTO) conversion and aromatization of light naphtha (LNA) derivatives. Oligomerization of styrene leads {{to the formation of}} optically active carbocationic oligomers. Different styrene substitutions indicate the conversion ability of the catalyst acid core, a preferred alignment of the oligomers within the straight zeolite channels and a Brønsted acidity gradient throughout the zeolite crystal. Both the MTO conversion and the LNA process lead to limited carbonaceous deposition within the external silicalite- 1 layer. This outer shell furthermore prevents the growth of extended coke species at the zeolite external surface. During MTO, the formation of carbonaceous compounds initiates {{at the center of the}} H-ZSM- 5 zeolite core and expands towards the zeolite exterior. This coke build-up starts with a 420 nm UV-Vis absorption band, assigned to methyl-substituted aromatic carbocations, and a second band around 550 nm, which is indicative of their growth towards <b>larger</b> <b>conjugated</b> <b>systems.</b> Aromatization of linear and branched C 5 paraffins causes negligible darkening of the zeolite crystals though it forms fluorescent coke deposits and their precursors within the H-ZSM- 5 catalyst.

Methods to achieve red-shifted FPs have evoked widespread interest and continuous engineering efforts (Chang et al. 2012; Enterina et al. 2015; Grimm et al. 2015; Newman et al. 2011; Niu and Guo 2013; Shu et al. 2009; Subach et al. 2011; Subach and Verkhusha 2012).

Through this technology, key factors can be determined for the design of FPs with significantly red-shifted excitation and emission spectra. When the 66 Tyr residue of the chromophore in various FPs is substituted with HqAla, excitation and emission spectra red-shifted by 30  nm are achieved (Liu et al. 2013).

40|$|The {{generation}} of intense, femtosecond-duration laser pulses using near-IR to IR wavelengths of light {{opened a new}} frontier of highly nonlinear physics characterized by the resolution of electronic dynamics on their natural time scale {{through the application of}} attosecond-duration coherent light. These developments were made possible through the strong-field induced phenomenon of high-order harmonic generation (HHG), which results from the tunnel ionization, propagation, and recombination of an electron wavepacket with an atomic or molecular system. By emitting a broad spectrum of coherent radiation, this process enabled the development of attosecond-duration light. Due to its fundamental dependence upon electronic dynamics ongoing within the generative system, high-order harmonic generation has promise as a spectroscopic tool capable of resolving structural and dynamical processes within molecules. In this thesis, we apply numerical methods to study the time-resolution afforded by HHG in atomic and molecular systems. We also develop and validate new methods for simulating the single-electron response of multi-electron systems in the presence of intense laser fields. To begin, we demonstrate the capacity for high-order harmonic generation to function as a signal of the dynamics of a propagating electron wavepacket. Through the use of an isolated attosecond pulse we gate the moment of ionization, selecting for or against electron trajectories that revisit the parent ion multiple times. With this control, we identify spectral and temporal signals which conclusively demonstrate the presence of these multiple revisitations. In addition to imaging electron dynamics during propagation, we also show that high-order harmonic generation can be used to resolve electron dynamics inside of molecules. As driving field sources become available with increasingly long wavelength, electron dynamics in <b>large</b> and <b>conjugated</b> <b>systems</b> show evidence of a highly nonadiabatic response. Using the model system of H 2 +, we demonstrate that the frequency-dependent amplitude and phase of emitted high-order harmonic generation is highly demonstrative of these dynamics.

We {{provide a}} {{straightforward}} generalization of Peterson’s 1 -dimensional family of deformations in C 3 of 2 -dimensional quadrics with common <b>conjugate</b> <b>system</b> to deformations in C 2 n− 1 of n-dimensional quadrics with common <b>conjugate</b> <b>system,</b> non-degenerate joined second fundamental forms and thus as an easy {{consequence of the}} Ricci equations flat normal bundle. Inspired by this generalization a differential system in involution for deformations in C 2 n− 1 of n-dimensional quadrics with common <b>conjugate</b> <b>system</b> and non-degenerate joined second fundamental forms is derived and the above deformations of Peterson’s are extended to a maximal (n − 1) -dimensional family of deformations.
