5|$|The Churchill Machine Tool Co was {{a founder}} member of Associated British Machine Tool Makers Ltd (ABMTM) in 1917, an {{organisation}} {{that might be}} classed as a cartel but which was then perfectly. It was a joint-venture marketing company to develop export markets. Charles Churchill & Co continued to handle domestic sales. A further note of inter-company co-operation was informal Saturday afternoon exchange visits between <b>local</b> <b>machine</b> shops to aid the exchange of ideas and appreciate differences in development and working practice which lasted {{for a few years}} before 1923. Companies involved in this included Churchill, Mather & Platt, Hans Renold, John Hetherington, B & S Massey, British Westinghouse and Browett, Lindley & Co of Patricroft. In January 1919, Charles Churchill & Co bought a one-third share in Cornelius Redman & Sons Co Ltd, planer and lathe-makers at Pioneer Works between Parkinson Lane and Warley Road in Halifax, Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Voltron: Defender of the Universe {{is played}} {{primarily}} as a twin stick shooter. During most levels players control one of five Voltron lions. The lions are equipped with multi-directional cannons, controlled with the right thumbstick, while the left thumbstick coordinates movement. Each lion is equipped with pounce and melee attacks. Each lion features a unique special attack and individual strengths and weaknesses. These levels consist of both ground and space-based levels, with only secondary controls changing between the two environments. The game features cooperative gameplay with up to five players. Up to two players can play on a <b>local</b> <b>machine,</b> and the game supports any combination of local and online players up to five. The game features leaderboards and a downloadable challenge mode in which players must combat increasingly difficult waves of enemies.|$|E
25|$|Nier: Automata {{opens with}} 2B and 9S opening {{the way for}} a future {{incursion}} into machine territory, working to clear out machine threats for the local Resistance. With help from Anemone and later Pascal, 2B and 9S defeat multiple machine threats. During their missions, they witness the birth of and later fight Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago. 2B and 9S also encounter A2, who is on the run from YoRHa. It is revealed that the machines are beginning to feel emotions and gather in groups, and some like Pascal's group have grown tired of fighting. 9S is eventually captured by Adam, who is killed by 2B. Deprived of his brother, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve, but 9S is infected with the machine's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. Despite his body dying, 9S's personality is saved in the <b>local</b> <b>machine</b> network, allowing his transfer into a new body. The second playthrough follows the opening narrative from the perspective of 9S, offering new insight into the machines and Adam and Eve. 9S also learns that humanity has been extinct since the events of Nier aside from a server on the moon holding humanity's DNA and history. YoRHa and its mission were created to keep the androids from losing morale. He also encounters a glitch when performing a standard server sync, and halts the procedure for both himself and 2B.|$|E

40|$|Association rule mining is an {{important}} term in data mining. Association rule mining generates important rules from the data. These rules are called frequent rules and the whole concept is known as frequent rule mining. Earlier this technique was used to be implemented at <b>local</b> <b>machines</b> to generate rule. But when the data size increases as transaction on data increases then <b>local</b> <b>machines</b> took large time to compute the frequent rules. To reduce the time, <b>local</b> <b>machines</b> started upgrading their machine with higher configuration like expanding RAM or Hard-Disk etc. In our {{paper we propose a}} technique in which the data is divided between the machines and each machine compute the frequent rules based the data which is given to them after division of data. This technique is related to distributed data mining. Existing framework such as IDMA, EMADS, suffers the communication overhead. In this paper, the proposed framework will attempt to reduce the communication overhead. For providing more security against unauthorized clients, we are using RC 4 algorithm for encryption and decryption of messages {{which is going to be}} passed between the clients...|$|R
30|$|The above {{statement}} is joining the two datasets x_distributed and y_distributed where both datasets are distributed over several machines. The JOIN operation is performed locally by pairing the {{records from the}} left dataset (x_distributed) and the right dataset (y_distributed) with the same node_id values. The LOCAL keyword results in the two records to be joined locally. The transform function returns the local dot product value for each node_id. Using a simple SUM statement provides the final dot product result. The dot product result can then be used in any operation without any explicit reference {{to the fact that}} this is a global value that needs to broadcast to <b>local</b> <b>machines.</b> The HPCC Systems platform implicitly broadcasts such global values on <b>local</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R

2500|$|...NET Framework {{has its own}} {{security}} mechanism with two general features: Code Access Security (CAS), and validation and verification. CAS is based on evidence {{that is associated with}} a specific assembly. Typically the evidence {{is the source of the}} assembly (whether it is installed on the <b>local</b> <b>machine</b> or has been downloaded from the Internet). CAS uses evidence to determine the permissions granted to the code. Other code can demand that calling code be granted a specified permission. The demand causes CLR to perform a call stack walk: every assembly of each method in the call stack is checked for the required permission; if any assembly is not granted the permission a security exception is thrown.|$|E

2500|$|Acorn {{strongly}} discouraged programmers from directly {{accessing the}} system variables and hardware, favouring official system calls. This was ostensibly {{to make sure}} programs kept working when migrated to coprocessors that utilised the Tube interface, but it also made BBC Micro software more portable across the Acorn range. [...] Whereas untrappable PEEKs and POKEs were commonly used by other computers to reach the system elements, programs in either machine code or BBC BASIC would instead pass parameters to an operating system routine. In this way the MOS could translate the request for the <b>local</b> <b>machine</b> or send it across the Tube interface, as direct access was impossible from the coprocessor. Published programs largely conformed to the API except for games, which routinely engaged with the hardware for greater speed, and thus required a particular Acorn model.|$|E

He obtained a state law in 1911 to establish a small commission to manage the city. The city retained a form of commission government until 1967 But Crump was in full control at all times, Using all the familiar techniques of the big city boss, who is willing to engage in ballot manipulation, patronage for friends, and frustrating bureaucratic obstacles for the opposition. [...] Crump build a complex alliance with established power figures at the local state and national levels. He ensured the dissidents had little or no voice. [...] At the center of his network was Cotton Row—The business elite that dominated the cotton industry. Second he included the modernizers, the business-oriented progressives who were most concerned with upgrading the infrastructure in terms of the waterfront, parks, highways and skyscrapers, as well as a moderately good school system. Working-class whites got their share of jobs. AFL labor unions were of marginal influence; CIO unions were not tolerated. [...] Roger Biles argues that the political system was virtually unchanged from 1910 into the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to Crump's wire-pulling. Crump Was the leading Tennessee supporter of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal [...] In turn the city received ample relief programs – which provided jobs for the unemployed, as selected by <b>local</b> <b>machine</b> lieutenants. As well the city was provided with major federal building projects, which helped fund the business community. [...] Crump incorporated the black leadership in his outer circle, dispensing patronage in return for the black vote. Memphis was one of the largest southern cities in which blacks could vote, but segregation was as rigid as anywhere. Crump successfully lobbied Washington for large-scale public housing projects.|$|E
