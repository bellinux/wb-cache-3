5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's <b>large</b> <b>size,</b> it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the <b>large</b> <b>size</b> {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. The fact that no juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>large</b> <b>size</b> of {{the heavy}} s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The <b>large</b> <b>size</b> of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E

At present, {{crankshafts}} with <b>larger</b> <b>size</b> {{are finished}} mostly by abrasive cloth and manual steel brush, {{which is not}} ideal on finishing quality, efficiency and cost, especially cleanness degree does not meet design and use request. So horizontal spindle barrel finishing has been developed and has good finishing effects for crankshafts with small size.

Aimed at the size, shape and weight of crankshafts with <b>larger</b> <b>size,</b> theoretic research is done, and main factors for finishing uniformity are analyzed.
