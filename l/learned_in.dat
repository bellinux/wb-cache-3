40|$|To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between category and perceptual learning, we examined both category and perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> patients with treated Wilson's disease (WD), whose basal ganglia, known to be important <b>in</b> category <b>learning,</b> were damaged by the disease. We measured their learning rate and accuracy in rule-based and information-integration category learning, and magnitudes of perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> {{a wide range of}} external noise conditions, and compared the results with those of normal controls. The WD subjects exhibited deficits in both forms of category <b>learning</b> and <b>in</b> perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise. However, their perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise was relatively spared. There was no significant correlation between the two forms of category learning, nor between perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise and either form of category <b>learning.</b> Perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise was, however, significantly correlated with information-integration but not with rule-based category learning. The results suggest {{that there may be a}} strong link between information-integration category learning and perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise. Damage to brain structures that are important for information-integration category learning may lead to poor perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> high external noise, yet spare perceptual <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> low external noise.

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of the companion volume Researching <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds in 2010, there has been a growth not only in the range and number of educational initiatives taking place in virtual worlds, but also in the depth of analysis of the nature of that education. Understanding <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds reflects those changes through a collection of chapters that are extended versions of research presented at the second Researching <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Environments conference (ReLIVE 11), an international conference hosted by the Open University UK. Included in this book are chapters that explore the philosophical and methodological underpinnings of understanding <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> virtual worlds, identify and analyse the factors that support <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> these environments, and present case studies that demonstrate some of the various ways in which virtual worlds can be applied to facilitate learning and teaching. The links between <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> a virtual world and <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> the physical world are made apparent throughout, and the authors reveal how understanding <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> one informs the other. Understanding <b>Learning</b> <b>in</b> Virtual Worlds is an important book not only to those who teach in virtual worlds, but to anyone for whom understanding <b>learning,</b> <b>in</b> all its forms, is of interest...|$|R

40|$|In 10 {{experiments}} spatial <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> computer-simulated environments was investigated. Part 1 of {{the thesis}} examined whether navigational <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> real and computer-simulated environments is comparable. Two methods {{were used to}} fulfil this aim. First, <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> equivalent real and computer-simulated environments was directly compared. Second, the properties of mental representations from <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> a simulated environment were investigated {{in an attempt to}} examine whether they are similar to the properties of mental representations from comparable <b>learning</b> experiences <b>in</b> the real world. The results of both methods indicated that the cognitive processes involved <b>in</b> <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> real and computer-simulated environments are similar. Part 2 of the thesis was concerned with the effect of landmarks on <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> large-scale and small-scale computer-simulated environments. With respect to <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> large-scale environments, the results showed that landmarks can aid route-learning. A positive effect of landmarks on route-learning was found to be dependent on a successsful suppression of alternative learning strategies. With respect to <b>learning</b> <b>in</b> small-scale environments, landmarks were shown to aid people's memory for spatial locations. It is concluded that computer simulations have a great potential for research into spatial learning.

5|$|North American Aviation won the {{contract}} to build the CSM, and also {{the second stage of}} the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA. Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous, the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon, and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight. Also, there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module. A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing, while Block II, the actual lunar spacecraft, would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> Block I development.|$|E

5|$|Attendees at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943 {{took the}} {{decision}} to launch a cross-Channel invasion within the next year. Churchill favoured making the main Allied thrust into Germany from the Mediterranean theatre, but his American allies, who were providing {{the bulk of the}} men and equipment, over-ruled him. British Lieutenant-General Frederick E. Morgan was appointed Chief of Staff, Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), to begin detailed planning. The initial plans were constrained by the number of available landing-craft, most of which were already committed in the Mediterranean and in the Pacific. In part because of lessons <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, the Allies decided not to directly assault a heavily defended French seaport in their first landing. The failure at Dieppe also highlighted the need for adequate artillery and air support, particularly close air support, and specialised ships able to travel extremely close to shore. The short operating-range of British aircraft such as the Spitfire and Typhoon greatly limited the number of potential landing-sites, as comprehensive air-support depended upon having planes overhead for as long as possible. Morgan considered four sites for the landings: Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula, Normandy, and the Pas de Calais. As Brittany and Cotentin are peninsulas, the Germans could have cut off the Allied advance at a relatively narrow isthmus, so these sites were rejected.|$|E
5|$|Founder Steve Ells {{attended}} the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York. Afterward, {{he became a}} line cook for Jeremiah Tower at Stars in San Francisco. There, Ells observed {{the popularity of the}} taquerías and San Francisco burritos in the Mission District. In 1993, Ells took what he <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> San Francisco and opened the first Chipotle Mexican Grill in Denver, Colorado, in a former Dolly Madison Ice Cream store at 1644 East Evans Avenue, near the University of Denver campus, using an $85,000 loan from his father. Ells and his father calculated that the store would need to sell 107 burritos per day to be profitable. After one month, the original restaurant was selling over 1,000 burritos a day. The second store opened in 1995 using Chipotle's cash flow, and the third was opened using an SBA loan. To fund more growth, Ells' father invested $1.5 million. Afterwards, Ells created a board of directors and business plan, raising an additional $1.8 million for the company. Ells had originally planned to use funds from the first Chipotle to open a fine-dining restaurant, but instead focused on Chipotle Mexican Grill when the restaurants saw success.|$|E
5|$|General Atkinson, who <b>learned</b> <b>in</b> early July that Scott {{would be}} taking command, hoped to bring the war to a {{successful}} conclusion before Scott's arrival. The Americans had difficulty locating the British Band, however, {{thanks in part to}} false intelligence given to them by area Native Americans. Potawatomis and Ho-Chunks in Illinois, many of whom had sought to remain neutral in the war, decided to cooperate with the Americans. Tribal leaders knew that some of their warriors had aided the British Band, and so they hoped that a highly visible show of support for the Americans would dissuade U.S. officials from punishing the tribes after the conflict was over. Wearing white headbands to distinguish themselves from hostile Natives, Ho-Chunks and Potawatomis served as guides for Atkinson's army. Ho-Chunks sympathetic to the plight of Black Hawk's people misled Atkinson into thinking that the British Band was still at Lake Koshkonong. While Atkinson's men were trudging through the swamps and running low on provisions, the British Band had in fact relocated miles to the north. Potawatomis under Billy Caldwell also managed to demonstrate support for the Americans while avoiding battle.|$|E
