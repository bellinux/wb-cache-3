60|$|Now {{and then}} {{he turns to the}} camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the basin, presses it against his brow. Now he <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, as if to give up; but again bends over and plods.|$|E

6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, unsympathetically: [...] "Nothing of {{the kind}} has happened. This car has simply come uncoupled, {{and the rest of}} the train has gone on ahead, and left us {{standing}} on the track, nowhere in particular."

60|$|Sir Leicester is {{generally}} in a complacent state, and rarely bored. When {{he has nothing}} else to do, he can always contemplate his own greatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society.|$|E

6000|$|... [He {{turns and}} goes {{out into the}} hall. TENCH makes two {{attempts}} [...] to speak; but meeting his Chairman's gaze he drops his eyes, [...] and, turning dismally, he too goes out. ANTHONY is left alone. [...] He grips the glass, tilts it, and drinks deeply; then sets it [...] down with a deep and rumbling sigh, and <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> [...] chair.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely you know? Asparagus Adjusters are {{the fellows}} who sell those rope-and-pulley affairs {{by means of}} which the Smart Set lower {{asparagus}} into their mouths--or rather Francis the footman does it for them, of course. The diner <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> chair, and the menial works the apparatus in the background. It is entirely superseding the old-fashioned method of picking the vegetable up and taking a snap at it. But I suspect {{that to be a}} successful Asparagus Adjuster requires capital. We now come to Awning Crank and Spring Rollers. I don't think I should like that. Rolling awning cranks seems to me a sorry way of spending life's springtime. Let's try the B's." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{music video}} for this song was {{directed}} by Anton Corbijn and features a drug-addled youth watching a television, with every channel featuring Metallica in some way. A Western movie titled Load is featured, starring Newsted and Hetfield, followed by a boxing match with Hetfield as coach, and Newsted and Kirk Hammett as the fighters. After a drink called [...] "Load" [...] is advertised by Ulrich and Hetfield in matching suits, a game show called [...] "Hero of the Day" [...] (which is a parody of Jeopardy!) is seen being played of which Jason Newsted is the host. Then, it cuts to the news with the anchorman played by Hammett and featuring a clip of Hetfield singing the lyrics to the song. A girl calls at the youth's house and they later try having sex, but the young man is unaroused, and visibly disappointed, <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bed. The girl later leaves. At the end, the youth passes out and dreams of tiny robot creatures, rendered in stop motion, emerging from his ear. He awakes from the dream and vomits into his toilet. http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=18708 ...|$|E
5000|$|Watching Astaire and Rogers {{finish their}} dance, two tutu-wearing {{figures on the}} box front of [...] "Gold Rust Twins Washing Powder", {{one of whom is}} a {{caricature}} of Fats Waller wearing a tiny bowler hat, shout, [...] "swing it, brother", to a Bisquit chef banging upon an oversized drum.

Two roosters on the front of [...] "Chicken Feed" [...] follow the rhythm, Aunt Emma steps off the box of her pancake flour, executing dance steps and waving her arms, while triplicate packages feature [...] "Yea Man" [...] chefs singing in unison. Fats Waller <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> piano chair and continues to play with great speed, now using his toes, while Louis Armstrong energetically picks up the [...] "Nagasaki" [...] melody on his jazz trumpet, with closeup of his fingers pressing the valves.|$|E
5000|$|Patric(...) {{had been}} writing a Texan column, [...] "Simon Legree," [...] since December, {{consistently}} lambasting politicians, deans, Dekes, and Pi Phi's. He had an impish Schopenhauerish streak that {{caused him to}} delight in attacking anything pretentious or powerful. And he was quite good at it. Shivers did not escape his wrath. When Patric was ordered by his [...] "boss" [...] to stop writing about politics, he ran the order in a funeral-black border in his column for several days, then wrote another political column. Thereafter - no column. Not to be denied, Patric defied an administration threat of expulsion and printed [...] "The Blunderbuss," [...] a devilish rebel newspaper of ten pages that caustically insulted Shivers and his friends. Patric distributed [...] "The Blunderbuss" [...] on a Saturday evening (...) of May 13, 1933 (when the) two protagonists met and traded heavy blows; one was the tramp journalist who later wrote for Reader's Digest and National Geographic, {{the other was the}} student president who later did all right for himself, too. Shivers won the fight, but the selfdubbed [...] "hobo" [...] rushed forthwith to the police station and filed charges. On May 18, the University expelled him for writing [...] "The Blunderbuss." [...] Nine days after the fight, Allan Shivers paid a $1 fine and a $10.80 costs in Corporation Court for [...] "making an affray by fighting together with John Patric(...)
