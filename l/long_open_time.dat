40|$|The {{contributions}} of specific residues in γ- and ɛ-subunits to the developmental changes in conductance and open time of Xenopus muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were investigated. This study was directed primarily at residues in the M 2 domains of γ- and ɛ-subunits; however, {{the results of}} additional mutations in the extracellular region flanking M 2 and in the amphipathic region between M 3 and M 4 are also described. The M 2 domains of γ- and ɛ-subunits differ at only three amino acid residues, {{two of which are}} adjacent to each other and located near the narrowest part of the pore. These two residues (NI in γ, SV in ɛ) were found to be major determinants of the difference in conductance and open time of AChRs bearing γ- or ɛ-subunits. Mutation of N to S in the γ-subunit converted the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> of receptors bearing the γ-subunit (γ-AChRs) to the brief open time characteristic of receptors bearing an ɛ-subunit (ɛ-AChRs). Conversely, ɛ-AChRs with SV mutated to NI in the ɛ-subunit exhibited a <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> characteristic of γ-AChRs. Mutation of N to S in the γ-subunit increased the conductance of γ-AChRs but did not confer the full conductance of wild-type ɛ-AChRs. Conversely, mutation of SV to NI in the ɛ-subunit reduced the conductance of ɛ-AChRs, but not completely to the level of wild-type γ-AChRs...|$|E
40|$|In mammals, two {{combinations}} of muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are used: α 2 βγδ (γ-AChR) or α 2 βɛδ (ɛ-AChR). After birth, γ-AChRs {{are replaced by}} ɛ-AChRs (γ/ɛ-switch). The two receptors have different conductances and open times.

Homozygotes born alive survived for 2 days in a stable condition, and were able to move their forelimbs. Endplate AChRs included ɛ-subunits, and muscle fibers had multiple neuromuscular junctions. Both pre- and postsynapses were abnormal and spontaneous action potentials generated from mEPPs were totally absent.

Today, they play a multifunctional role also acting as a stability component in the vehicle. Since the glass and body in white have a difference in coefficient of thermal expansion and the windows are wide there is a need of a flexible adhesives. Therefore, glass bonding in automotive manufacturing is often performed with a 1 C PUR adhesive. The adhesives are flexible moisture curing adhesives that consists of binder, plasticizer, filler, carbon black, additives and catalysts. Some contain silane as adhesion promoter and they are applied in thick triangular beads. When bonded they are compressed to a thickness of approximately 6  mm. The bonding is performed on either the ceramic frit surface or the naked tin or fire side of the glass. To improve the bonding between the glass and adhesive a primer with <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> is applied at the glass manufacturer.

These kinase-independent effects represent a novel opportunity to advance our understanding of calcium channel function and calcium-triggered neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, such actions on calcium channels may direct the development of Ros derivatives as new therapeutic agents. We used patch clamp recordings to characterize mechanisms that underlie the agonist effects of Ros on unitary N-type calcium channel gating. We found that N-type channels normally gate with either a short or long mean open time, that Ros significantly prolonged the mean open time of the long gating component and increased the probability of observing channels that gated with a <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time,</b> but had no effect on single channel conductance. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a single channel kinetic model and Ros interactions, we were able to reproduce our experimental results and investigate the model’s microscopic dynamics.

Normal and RyRMH channels responded similarly to all reagents. DTNB (1 mM), either cytoplasmic (cis) or luminal (trans), or 1 mM 4, 4 ′-DTDP (cis) activated RyRs, introducing an additional <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> constant. 4, 4 ′-DTDP (cis), but not DTNB, inhibited channels after > 5 min. Activation and inhibition were relieved by DTT (1 – 10 mM). DTT (10 mM, cytoplasmic or luminal), without oxidants, activated RyRs, and activation reversed with 1 mM DTNB. Control RyR activity was maintained with 1 mM DTNB and 10 mM DTT {{present on the}} same or {{opposite sides of the}} bilayer. We suggest that 1) 4, 4 ′-DTDP and DTNB covalently modify RyRs by oxidizing activating or inhibiting thiol groups; 2) a modified thiol depresses mammalian skeletal RyR activity under control conditions; 3) both the activating thiols and the modified thiols, accessible from either cytoplasm or lumen, reside in the transmembrane region; 4) some cardiac sulfhydryls are unavailable in skeletal RyRs; and 5) Cys 615 in RyRMH is functionally unimportant in redox cycling...|$|E

Both y- and c-mRNAs are expressed early in muscle development in vivo, and in aneural embryonic muscle and myogenic cell lines in vitro, though +y-mRNA is at least 20 -fold more abundant than c-mRNA in these circumstances. While during normal development, 7 -mRNA decreases to an undetectable level by postnatal day 12, r-mRNA first increases 1 O-fold between day 2 and day 12 - 15, then decreases to the level characteristic of adult muscle. We {{have found that the}} transition form y- to c-mRNA is influenced by the levels of thyroid hormones. Indeed, high and low levels of thyroid hormones, respectively, accelerated and delayed the switch between y- and e-mRNAs. Neither the dramatic postnatal rise in c-mRNA nor its sensitivity to thyroid hormones was observed in denervated newborn animals. By contrast, denervation was without effect on c-mRNA expression in adult muscle. These results suggest that, although not required for the initial activation of the c-gene nor its maintenance in adult muscle, the nerve {{plays a major role in}} the perinatal regulation of c-gene transcription. During the maturation of the neuromuscular junction, the electrophysiological properties of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) channels are progressively modified.

40|$|Purified bovine renal {{papillary}} Na+ channels, when reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, {{reside in}} three conductance states: a 40 -pS main state, and two subconductive states (12 - 13 pS and 24 - 26 pS). The activity of these channels is regulated by phosphorylation and by G-proteins. Protein kinase A (PKA) -induced phosphorylation increased channel activity {{by increasing the}} open state time constants from 160 +/- 30 (main conductance), and 15 +/- 5 ms (both lower conductances), respectively, to 365 +/- 30 ms for all of them. PKA phosphorylation also altered the closed time of the channel from 250 +/- 30 ms to 200 +/- 35 ms, thus shifting the channel into a lower-conductance, <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> mode. PKA phosphorylation increased the PNa:PK of the channel from 7 : 1 to 20 : 1, and shifted the amiloride inhibition curve to the right (apparent K(i) amil from 0. 7 to 20 microM). Pertussis toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation of either phosphorylated of either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated channels decreased the PNa:PK to 2 : 1 and 4 : 1, respectively, and altered K(i) amil to 8 and 2 microM for phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated channels, respectively. GTP-gamma-S treatment of either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated channels resulted in an increase of PNa:PK to 30 : 1 and 10 : 1, respectively, and produced a leftward shift in the amiloride dose-response curve, altering K(i) amil to 0. 5 and 0. 1 microM, respectively. These results suggest that amiloride-sensitive renal Na+ channel biophysical characteristics are not static, but depend upon the biochemical state of the channel protein and/or its associated G-protein...|$|E
40|$|Recordings of the {{activity}} of the large conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ (BK) channel from over 90 % of inside-out patches excised from acutely dissociated hippocampal CA 1 neurones revealed an inactivation process dependent upon the presence of at least 1 μM intracellular Ca 2 +. Inactivation was characterized by a sudden switch from sustained high open probability (Po) <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> behaviour to extremely low Po, short open time channel activity. The low Po state (mean Po, 0. 001) consisted of very short openings (time constant (τ), ≈ 0. 14 ms) and rare longer duration openings (τ, ≈ 3. 0 ms). Channel inactivation occurred with a highly variable time course being observed either prior to or immediately upon patch excision, or after up to 2 min of inside-out recording. Inactivation persisted whilst recording conditions were constant. Inactivation was reversed by membrane hyperpolarization, the rate of recovery increasing with further hyperpolarization and higher extracellular K+. Inactivation was also reversed when the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration was lowered to 100 nM and was permanently removed by application of trypsin to the inner patch surface. In addition, inactivation was perturbed by application of either tetraethylammonium ions or the Shaker (Sh) B peptide to the inner membrane face. During inactivation, channel Po was greater at hyperpolarized rather than depolarized potentials, which was partly the result of a greater number of longer duration openings. Depolarizing voltage steps (− 40 to + 40 mV) applied during longer duration openings produced only short duration events at the depolarized potential, yielding a transient ensemble average current with a rapid decay (τ, ≈ 3. 8 ms). These data suggest that hippocampal BK channels exhibit a Ca 2 +-dependent inactivation that is proposed to result from block of the channel by an associated particle. The findings that inactivation was removed by trypsin and prolonged by decreasing extracellular potassium suggest that the blocking particle may act at the intracellular side of the channel...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} GABAA {{receptor}} development in culture on the modulation of GABA-induced currents by external H+ was examined in cerebellar granule cells using whole-cell and single-channel recording. Equilibrium concentration-response curves revealed a lower potency for GABA between 11 and 12 days in vitro (DIV) {{resulting in a}} shift of the EC 50 from 10. 7 to 2. 4 μM. For granule cells before 11 DIV, the peak GABA-activated current was inhibited at low external pH and enhanced at high pH with a pKa of 6. 65. For the steady-state response, low pH was inhibitory with a pKa of 5. 56. After 11 DIV, the peak GABA-activated current was largely pH insensitive; however, the steady-state current was potentiated at low pH with a pKa of 6. 84. Single GABA-activated ion channels were recorded from outside-out patches of granule cell bodies. At pH 5. 4 - 9. 4, single GABA channels exhibited multiple conductance states occurring at 22 - 26, 16 - 17 and 12 - 14 pS. The conductance levels were not significantly altered over the time period of study, nor by changing the external H+ concentration. Two exponential functions were required to fit the open-time frequency histograms at both early (11 DIV) development times at each H+ concentration. The short and <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> constants were unaffected either by the extracellular H+ concentration or by neuronal development. The distribution of all shut times was fitted by the sum of three exponentials designated as short, intermediate and long. At acidic pH, the long shut time constant decreased with development as did the relative contribution of these components to the overall distribution. This was concurrent {{with an increase in}} the mean probability of channel opening. In conclusion, this study demonstrates in cerebellar granule cells that external pH can either reduce, have no effect on, or enhance GABA-activated responses depending on the stage of development, possibly related to the subunit composition of the GABAA receptors. The mode of interaction of H+ at the single-channel level and implications of such interactions at cerebellar granule cell GABAA receptors are discussed...|$|E

With nanomolar [Ca 2 +] in both bilayer chambers, the addition of 2 mM cytosolic ATP greatly {{increased the number of}} short channel openings. As lumenal [Ca 2 +] was increased from < 0. 1 microM to approximately 250 microM, increasing channel activities and events with <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>time</b> constants were seen at negative holding potentials. Channel activity remained low at positive holding potentials. Further increase in lumenal [Ca 2 +] to 1, 5, and 10 mM resulted in a decrease in channel activities at negative holding potentials and increased activities at positive holding potentials. A voltage-dependent activation by 50 microM lumenal Ca 2 + was also observed when the channel was minimally activated by < 1 microM cytosolic Ca 2 + in the absence of ATP. With microM cytosolic Ca 2 + in {{the presence or absence of}} 2 mM ATP, single-channel activities showed no or only a weak voltage dependence. Other divalent cations (Mg 2 +, Ba 2 +) could not replace lumenal Ca 2 +. On the contrary, cytosolic ATP-activated channel activities were decreased as lumenal Ca 2 + fluxes were reduced by the addition of 1 - 5 mM BaCl 2 or MgCl 2 to the lumenal side, which contained 50 microM Ca 2 +. An increase in [KCl] from 0. 25 M to 1 M also reduced single-channel activities. Addition of the "fast" Ca 2 + buffer 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophenoxy) ethanetetraacetic acid (BAPTA) to the cls chamber increased cytosolic ATP-, lumenal Ca(2 +) -activated channel activities to a nearly maximum level. These results suggested that lumenal Ca 2 + flowing through the skeletal muscle Ca 2 + release channel may regulate channel activity by having access to cytosolic Ca 2 + activation and Ca 2 + inactivation sites that are located in "BAPTA-inaccessible" and "BAPTA-accessible" spaces, respectively...|$|E

Four effects on channel activity were seen, two on <b>open</b> <b>time</b> distributions and two on closed times. When clusters of openings were elicited {{in the absence of}} steroid, the <b>open</b> <b>time</b> distribution contained three components. ACN produced concentration-dependent alterations in the <b>open</b> <b>time</b> distribution. The prevalence of the longest duration class of <b>open</b> <b>times</b> was increased from about 15 % to about 40 % (EC 50 about 180 nm ACN), while the duration of the longest class increased from 7. 4 ms to 27 ms (EC 50 about 35 nm ACN). B 285 also increased the prevalence of the <b>longest</b> duration <b>open</b> <b>times</b> (EC 50 about 18 nm B 285) but increased the duration only at concentrations close to 10 μm. The differences in the actions of these two steroids suggest that the effects on proportion and duration of the <b>long</b> duration <b>open</b> <b>time</b> component are produced by independent mechanisms and that there are separate recognition sites for the steroids which are associated with the two functional actions. The closed time distributions also showed three components in the absence of steroid. The rate of occurrence of the two brief duration closed time components decreased with increasing ACN, with an EC 50 of about 50 nm ACN. In contrast, B 285 did not reduce the rate of occurrence of the brief closings until high concentrations were applied. However, both B 285 and ACN reduced the rate of occurrence of the activation-related closed state selectively, with comparable IC 50 concentrations (about 40 nm ACN, 20 nm B 285). As in the case for action on <b>open</b> <b>times</b> these data suggest that there are two recognition sites and two independent mechanisms, perhaps the sites and mechanisms associated with actions on <b>open</b> <b>times.</b> The presence of 1 μm ACN had no effect on the estimated channel opening rate or on the apparent affinity of the receptor for GABA. Mutation of the carboxy terminus of the γ 2 subunit, but not the α 1 or β 2 subunits, abolished the ability of ACN to increase the duration of OT 3 but had no effect on the reduction of the rate of occurrence of the activation-related closed state. These observations are also consistent with {{the idea that there is}} more than one distinguishable steroid recognition site on the GABAA receptor...|$|R
40|$|Striatal neurones are {{particularly}} vulnerable to hypoxia/ischaemia-induced damage, and free radicals {{are thought to be}} prime mediators of this neuronal destruction. It has been shown that hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2), through the production of free radicals, induces rat insulinoma cell death by activation of a non-selective cation channel, which leads to irreversible cell depolarization and unregulated Ca 2 + entry into the cell. In the study presented here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of striatal neurones (medium spiny neurones) is depolarized by H 2 O 2 through the production of free radicals. Cell-attached recordings from rat cultured striatal neurones demonstrate that exposure to H 2 O 2 opens a large-conductance channel that is characterized by extremely <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>times</b> (seconds). Inside-out recordings show that cytoplasmically applied β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide activates a channel with little voltage dependence, a linear current-voltage relationship and a single-channel conductance of between 70 and 90 pS. This channel is permeable to Na+, K+ and Ca 2 + ions. Fura- 2 imaging from cultured striatal neurones reveals that H 2 O 2 exposure induces a biphasic intracellular Ca 2 + increase in a subpopulation of neurones, the second, later phase resulting in Ca 2 + overload. This later component of the Ca 2 + response is dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca 2 + and is independent of synaptic activity or voltage-gated Ca 2 + channel opening. Consequently, this channel may be an important contributor to free radical-induced selective striatal neurone destruction. These results are remarkably similar to those observed for insulinoma cells and suggest that this family of non-selective cation channels has a widespread distribution in mammalian tissues...|$|R
40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{properties of}} single Ca-activated K channels in excised patches of surface membrane from cultured rat muscle cells were studied using the patch-clamp technique. The distribution of all open intervals {{was described by}} the sum of two exponential distributions of short and <b>long</b> mean <b>open</b> <b>time,</b> suggesting at least two major open-channel states. Increasing the concentration of Ca at the inner membrane surface, [Ca]i, increased the mean duration of the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> distribution, while having {{little effect on the}} mean duration of the short open distribution. The frequency of openings to each distribution increased with [Ca]i. The rate of increase was a much steeper function of [Ca]i for openings in the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> distribution than for openings in the short open distribution; about 80 % of the openings were to the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> distribution with 0. 1 microM-Cai, increasing to 97 % with 1 microM-Cai (+ 30 mV). These results suggest that openings in both open distributions are Ca-dependent, with openings in the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> distribution requiring the binding of more Ca ions than openings in the short open distribution. The distribution of all shut intervals at 0. 5 microM-Cai and + 30 mV was described by the sum of three exponential distributions with mean durations of: 0. 21 msec (short shut distribution), 1. 90 msec (intermediate shut), and 44 msec (long shut). These results indicate that the channel typically enters at least three closed channel states during normal channel activity. In addition, a few longer shut intervals not accounted for by the above distributions suggested that there was a fourth infrequently occurring inactivated closed-channel state. The mean duration of the distribution of long shut intervals decreased with a power of about 2 with increasing [Ca]i under conditions where most openings were to the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> state (+ 30 mV, 0. 25 - 1 microM-Cai). This observation suggests that openings to the <b>long</b> <b>open</b> distribution typically require the binding of two or more Ca ions. The mean intermediate shut interval appeared to increase slightly with increasing [Ca]i while the mean short shut interval was relatively Cai-independent. The percentage of all shut intervals that were short shut intervals increased with increasing [Ca]i while the percentage of long shut intervals decreased. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

The currents were compared when measured from cell-attached patches and from the same patch but at least 20 minutes after manual excision. The averaged currents showed a distinctly delayed decay in the excised patches due to the appearance of long lasting openings or bursts of openings. In contrast to control patches, the <b>open</b> <b>time</b> distribution in excised patches requires at least two exponentials. A short mean <b>open</b> <b>time</b> was voltage independent for cell-attached patches (0. 38 ms +/- 0. 07 ms between - 60 and - 20 mV, 6 cell-attached patches; and 0. 41 +/- 0. 1 ms, 7 excised patches). The <b>long</b> mean <b>open</b> <b>time</b> found in excised patches was clearly voltage dependent and increased from 0. 48 +/- 0. 14 ms (- 80 mV) to 2. 87 +/- 0. 35 ms (- 20 mV, regression coefficient + 0. 88, 7 patches). Sweeps with long openings appeared in clusters. The clustering of records with long openings, short openings, or without openings (nulls) was quantified by a runs analysis which showed a highly significant nonrandom ordering.

40|$|The {{closely related}} cation {{channels}} TRPM 2 and TRPM 8 show completely different requirements for stimulation and are regulated by Ca 2 + in an opposite manner. TRPM 8 is basically gated in a voltage-dependent process enhanced by cold temperatures and cooling compounds such as menthol and icilin. The putative S 4 voltage sensor of TRPM 8 is closely {{similar to that}} of TRPM 2, which, however, is mostly devoid of voltage sensitivity. To gain insight into principal interactions of critical channel domains during the gating process, we created chimeras in which the entire S 5 -pore-S 6 domains were reciprocally exchanged. The chimera M 2 -M 8 P (i. e. TRPM 2 with the pore of TRPM 8) responded to ADP-ribose and hydrogen peroxide and was regulated by extracellular and intracellular Ca 2 + as was wild-type TRPM 2. Single-channel recordings revealed the characteristic pattern of TRPM 2 with extremely <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>times.</b> Only at far-negative membrane potentials (− 120 to − 140 mV) did differences become apparent because currents were reduced by hyperpolarization in M 2 -M 8 P but not in TRPM 2. The reciprocal chimera, M 8 -M 2 P, showed currents after stimulation with high concentrations of menthol and icilin, but these currents were only slightly larger than in controls. The transfer of the NUDT 9 domain to the C terminus of TRPM 8 produced a channel sensitive to cold, menthol, or icilin but insensitive to ADP-ribose or hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that the gating processes in TRPM 2 and TRPM 8 differ in their requirements for specific structures within the pore. Moreover, the regulation by extracellular and intracellular Ca 2 + and the single-channel properties in TRPM 2 are not determined by the S 5 -pore-S 6 region...|$|R
40|$|The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih), {{mediated}} by HCN channels, contributes to intrinsic neuronal properties, synaptic integration and network rhythmicity. Recent studies have implicated HCN channels in neuropathological conditions including epilepsy. While native HCN channels {{have been studied}} at the macroscopic level, the biophysical characteristics of individual neuronal HCN channels have not been described. We characterize, for the first time, single HCN currents of excised inside-out patches from somata of acutely dissociated rat hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal cells. Hyperpolarization steps elicited non-inactivating channel openings with an apparent conductance of 9. 7 pS, consistent with recent reports of native and recombinant HCN channels. The voltage-dependent Po had a V 1 / 2 of − 81 ± 1. 8 mV and slope − 13. 3 ± 1. 9 mV. Blockers of macroscopic Ih, ZD 7288 (50 μm) and CsCl (1 mm), reduced the channel conductance to 8 pS and 8. 4 pS, respectively. ZD 7288 was slightly more effective in reducing the Po at depolarized potentials, whereas CsCl was more efficacious at hyperpolarized potentials. The unitary neuronal HCN channels had voltage-dependent latencies to first channel opening and two open states. As expected, ZD 7288 and CsCl increased latencies and decreased the properties of both open states. The major endogenous positive modulator of macroscopic Ih is cAMP. Application of 8 Br-cAMP (10 μm) did not affect conductance (9. 4 pS), but did increase Po and short and <b>long</b> <b>open</b> <b>times.</b> Thus, sensitivity to Ih modulators supports the single h-channel identity of these unitary currents. Detailed biophysical analysis of unitary Ih conductances is likely to help distinguish between homomeric and heteromeric expression of these channels – findings that may be relevant toward the pathophysiology of diseases such as epilepsy...|$|R

Various OS-derived molecules must {{be involved in}} subsequent processes including the induction of plant defence reactions. Using the planar lipid bilayer membrane technique, isolated OS were analyzed {{with respect to their}} membrane activities. Transmembrane ion fluxes were generated by OS of eight different lepidopteran larvae, all of which form comparable ion channels in artificial membranes. Currents were characterized by <b>long</b> lasting <b>open</b> <b>times</b> and conductivities from 250 pS up to 1100 pS. Channels formed by Spodoptera exigua secretions showed a preference for cations over anions. OS also induced a transient increase of the cytosolic calcium concentration in soybean cells, determined by the aequorin technique. Known compounds of the OS, fatty-acid–glutamine conjugates, also interfered with the membrane but were unable to form stable channels. Since ion fluxes and depolarization are early responses upon insect feeding, OS-derived components may be involved in the elicitation process by direct interaction with the plant membranes...|$|R

40|$|We have {{reported}} that the large impermeant organic cations tetrabutyl ammonium (TBA+), tetrapentyl ammonium, and the charged local anesthetic QX 314 produce unique reduced conductance states in the purified sheep cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release channel when present at the cytoplasmic face of the channel. We have interpreted this {{as a form of}} partial occlusion by the blocking cation in wide vestibules of the conduction pathway. Following modification with ryanodine, which causes the channel to enter a reduced conductance state with <b>long</b> <b>open</b> dwell <b>time,</b> these cations block the receptor channel to a level that is indistinguishable from the closed state. The voltage dependence of TBA+'s interaction with the Ca 2 + release channel is the same before and after ryanodine modification. The concentration dependence is different, in that the ryanodine-modified channel has one-third the affinity for TBA+, which is accounted for predominantly by changes in the TBA+ on rate. The data are compatible with a structural change in the vestibule of the conduction pathway consequent upon ryanodine binding that reduces the capture radius for blocking ion entry...|$|R
