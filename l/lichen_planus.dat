5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, <b>lichen</b> <b>planus,</b> atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

A 50 -year-old male, suffering from lymphatic leukemia, came to our observation due to <b>lichen</b> ruber <b>planus</b> and ejaculatory pain. The patient underwent a trans-perineal ultrasound-guided biopsy of the right seminal vesicle and of a hypoechoic area documented by ultrasonography. 48 hours after the procedure, the patient had developed: cold sores, shortness of breath with dyspnea, and high fever (40 °C). The patient was hospitalized, underwent an emergency CT which documented a right presacral and pararectal liquid mass (abscess). The patient underwent emergency laparotomy and drainage of the abscess. The lesion histological examination revealed a retroperitoneal schwannoma with inflammatory phenomena and hyperplasic lymphadenitis. The retroperitoneal schwannoma is a silent disease whose only clinical manifestation coincides with the compression of adjacent anatomical structures.

40|$|Introduction Presuming that {{psoriasis}} is an autoimmune skin disease, {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to establish its association with other autoimmune skin diseases. The material was obtained at the Dermatovenereological Clinic Clinical Center Novi Sad. Material and methods This 10 -year retrospective study (1990 - 1999) included 1743 psoriasis patients. The control group consisted of 7492 nonpsoriatic dermatological patients. Results Association of psoriasis with other dermatological diseases of autoimmune nature has been established in 13 (0. 74 %) patients. The most frequent association was with <b>lichen</b> ruber <b>planus</b> in five patients, with alopecia areata and vitiligo in three patients, and in one with bullous pemphigoid and herpetiform dermatitis. Using Fisher's test no significant association was established. Discussion and conclusion According to literature data association of psoriasis with other autoimmune diseases is well known, but rare, which is in accordance with our results. The question arises whether this association is the matter of poor coexistence or the matter of genetic mutations. However, once established, these associations can further highlight the autoimmune nature of psoriasis.

40|$|The authors examine some {{specific}} forms of precancerous {{states of the}} oral cavity, selecting them from among the 4 classes defined by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Precancerous Lesions. The immunological system is given particular emphasis. In fact, as studies progress, {{it appears to be}} more and more involved not only in the increase in the incidence of such pathologies, but also in the most difficult, if not unknown, genesis of these pathologies. Highly significant examples of this involvement are: Kaposi's Sarcoma, Hairy Cell Leukoplakia, Lichen and Mycoses. Particularly significant aspects for Erythroplasia consist in the following: slow development, frequent and rapid changes in the clinical aspects and its strict connection with Bowen's Disease and Queirat's Erythroplasia. The latter lend further confirmation of its definite precancerous nature and as such, it requires radical surgical treatment. Compared to other forms, the Epidemic variety of Kaposi's sarcoma more frequently affects the oral-salivary glands and structures, the lymph nodes and the laterocervical area. Together with non-Hodgkin tumors, this represents the class of neoplasms most frequently occurring in subjects affected by AIDS. Its "atypical" aggressiveness involves the liver and pancreas and develops over much shorter time periods than the other varieties. In any case, when possible, the treatment required is the excision of the lesions. Neither radiation therapy nor polychemotherapy have yielded encouraging results as yet. In the case of Leukoplakia, it should be kept in mind that today, this pathology is defined "negatively" be exclusion that is the condition must exist that this lesion cannot be clinically or pathologically defined as another lesion. It thus follows that the clinician must maintain an extremely cautious approach in such cases. As concerns prognosis, particular attention should be given to raised, hardened, irregular and fissured forms, which manifest the greatest degenerative capacity. for the classic forms, the treatment adopted is complete exeresis, whereas the use of antiviral drugs is recommended for Hairy Cell Leukoplakia. <b>Lichen</b> Ruber <b>Planus</b> is a papuliferous eruption that is relatively common and affects the skin and mucosa often exclusively involving the oral cavity in the great majority of cases. Besides the clinical picture, the diagnosis of this disease is based on the triad consisting of hyperkeratosis, destruction of the cells of the stratum basale and subepithelial lymphocyte infiltration at distinctly low levels. In uncertain cases, however, the detection of Fluorescent Bodies grouped in large clusters near the hyaline membrane, acquires particular importance for the specification of the diagnosis. Gli autori compiono ricerche di casistica patologica e clinica prendendo in esame alcuni specifici stati cancerizzabili del cavo orale scegliendoli nell'ambito delle 4 classi elaborate dal WHO Collaborating Centre for Oral Precancerous Lesions. Particolare risalto è offerto alla trattazione del distretto immunitario che, col progredire degli studi, appare sempre più coinvolto, non solo nel semplice incremento di incidenza di tali patologie, ma nella genesi più recondita delle stesse. Sotto tale ottica sono stati presi in considerazione il sarcoma del Kaposi (particolarmente nella sua varietà epidemica propria degli HIV positivi), le Leucoplachie, il <b>Lichen</b> Ruber <b>Planus,</b> le Candidiasi e la Papillomatosi florida orale.

We studied the expression of both IDO 1 and the related tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO) in several different subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and evaluated the kynurenine (KYN) pathway in the local TME and in patient sera. Specimens from the total of 90 CTCL patients, including mycosis fungoides (MF, n = 37), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP, n = 36), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL, n = 4), subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL n = 13), and 10 patients with inflammatory <b>lichen</b> ruber <b>planus</b> (LRP), were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), quantitative PCR, and/or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Three CTCL cell lines also were studied. Expression of both IDO 1 and TDO was upregulated in CTCL. In MF specimens and in the MF cell line MyLa 2000, IDO 1 expression exceeded that of TDO, whereas the opposite was true for LyP, ALCL, and corresponding Mac 1 / 2 A cell lines. The spectrum of IDO 1 -expressing cell types differed among CTCL subtypes and {{was reflected in the}} clinical behavior. In MF, SPTCL, and LyP, IDO 1 was expressed by malignant cells and by CD 33 (+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells, whereas in SPTCL CD 163 (+) tumor-associated macrophages also expressed IDO 1. Significantly elevated serum KYN/Trp ratios were found in patients with advanced stages of MF. Epacadostat, an IDO 1 inhibitor, induced a clear decrease in KYN concentration in cell culture.

We describe that after 4 weeks of UVA- 1 patients were better capable to maintain clinical improvement than after 3 weeks of therapy. Furthermore, UVA 1 therapy proved to be better than placebo therapy in patients with dyshidrotic eczema. Also, we described the favorable effect of UVA 1 therapy in chronic, generalized <b>lichen</b> ruber <b>planus.</b> Because of deep penetration of UVA 1, it could not only influence dermal inflammatory infiltrates in T-cell mediated diseases mentioned above, but also reach circulating activated B-cells in dermal capillaries in SLE. We investigated the effect of 6 and 12 J/cm 2 UVA 1 in SLE patients, in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross over study. Three weeks of 12 J/cm 2 resulted in improved disease activity and proved to be more effective than placebo. Furthermore, a decrease of auto-antibody titers was observed in several patients. In vitro we showed that 40 % of UVA 1 reached the dermis and increasing numbers of PBMCs died after rising doses of UVA- 1. Also, immunoglobulin production by activated B cells decreased after increasing doses of UVA 1. It would be interesting to investigate UVA 1 therapy for other auto immune diseases. Promotor: R.

Materials and Methods. By means of CP OCT there have been examined 33 patients with intestinal inflammatory diseases and oral inflammations: CD, UC, <b>lichen</b> ruber <b>planus</b> of oral cavity and aphthous stomatitis. The control group consisted of 11 people without intestinal and oral inflammatory diseases. The CP OCT-images obtained have been numerically analyzed. Buccal mucous collagen from the area of CP OCT-scanning has been assessed histologically by fluorescence in polarized light in picrosirius red staining. The comparison of the intensity of yellow-red fluorescence on histologic specimens and the OCT-signal intensity in an orthogonal image has shown their close agreement. Numerical analysis of CP OCT-images {{has been used as}} an additional tool for their visual assessment. There has been made numerical analysis of average signal intensity from submucosal level of buccal mucosa in orthogonal CP OCT-images. In Crohn’s disease average OCT-signal intensity has been stated to be significantly higher (р < 0. 01) than in ulcerative colitis, and the signal intensity of 7. 5 dB (within the range of 7. 0 – 8. 0 dB) — to provide maximum diagnostic efficiency of CP OCT in CD and UC differential diagnosis, the test-sensitivity of CP OCT amounting to 0. 72, specificity — 0. 89, diagnostic accuracy — 0. 78, predictive validity of a positive test — 0. 93, and predictive validity of a negative test — 0. 62.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if vulvar cutaneous candidosis and dermatophytosis can be distinguished by routine histopathology. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four cases of periodic acid-Schiff–stained vulvar biopsies with a diagnosis of cutaneous mycosis were reviewed and histopathological characteristics on both periodic acid-Schiff and hematoxylin and eosin were recorded. Data were collected on age, clinical impression, microbiological results, and treatment, and all specimens underwent multiplex polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results: The mean age was 60 years, and all but 3 women had at least 1 risk factor for mycosis including 15 (62. 5 %) with <b>lichen</b> sclerosus and/or <b>planus</b> managed with topical corticosteroids. A clinical suspicion of tinea or candidosis was documented in 12 (50 %) of the cases. Vulvovaginal swabs showed Candida species in 9 women; one skin scraping was positive for Trichophyton rubrum. Microbiology was not obtained in 8 patients, 5 had a negative swab, and 1 had negative skin scrapings. No histopathological or morphological features distinguished Candida species from dermatophytes. Organisms appeared as basophilic structures in the stratum corneum in 15 (62. 5 %) hematoxylin and eosin–stained slides. Polymerase chain reaction results were positive for Candida species in 5 (21 %) and for dermatophytes in 3 (13 %), negative in 13, and unassessable in 3 cases. Conclusions: Vulvar cutaneous candidosis and dermatophytosis cannot be reliably distinguished by routine histopathology or specific polymerase chain reaction. A high index of suspicion combined with adequate microbiological testing remains the best approach to differentiating between the 2, which impacts on counseling, treatment, and prognosis...|$|R
