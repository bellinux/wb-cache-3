40|$|Reliable {{knowledge}} of a ship’s position and movement {{in relation to other}} traffic participants and obstacles is a fundamental requirement for navigation and avoiding collisions and groundings. Consequently, the onboard provision of resilient position, navigation and time data (PNT) is emphasized by the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) e-navigation strategy, solution S 3 “Improved reliability, resilience and integrity of bridge equipment and navigation information” and by the assigned risk control option RCO 5 “Improved reliability and resilience of onboard PNT systems”. An initial step towards resilient PNT has been realized by the maritime community with the development of the performance standards for shipborne multi-system radionavigation receiver equipment (MRR). This MRR performance standard (PS) supports the full use of data coming from current and future <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> and services. Consequently, the combined use of several global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) and the additional use of space based augmentation systems (SBAS) as well as optional terrestrial <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> (e. g. eLoran or R-Mode) will be supported to increase the performance of positioning and timing. As a second step, the development of guidelines for an onboard PNT (data processing) unit has been identified as supplementary and necessary.

Redundancy in the available data enables the application of integrity monitoring functions to evaluate the current usability of safety-critical data and components.

40|$|The communication, {{navigation}} and surveillance (CNS) infrastructure in the sector of civil aviation is currently undergoing a major innovation process: old legacy systems, often developed {{as early as}} the 1950 s, are being replaced by new, more efficient systems. The change is necessary as the future airspace will demand higher traffic volumes and more efficient flight operations. In the field of navigation, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) will become the primary source of aircraft navigation. Nevertheless, ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> will still play a vital role as alternative positioning {{navigation and}} timing (APNT) systems in the future navigation infrastructure [1]. APNT systems are used as backup in case the primary means of navigation using GNSS becomes unavailable. An unavailability of GNSS may be due to intentional or unintentional interference or system failures. According to current plans in the US and Europe, distance measurement equipment (DME) will be the first APNT system employed using two way ranging [2],[3]. The use of DMEs limits the economic impact as most of its infrastructure already exists. However, over the long term a transition to modern systems such as the L-band digital aeronautical communication system (LDACS) or automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) might be indispensable [4], [5] as only highly bandwidth efficient systems in combination with passive ranging schemes can enable higher capacity and improved ranging and positioning performance [6]. A major challenge is to guarantee that APNT systems meet the performance requirements on accuracy, integrity, capacity, and coverage to guarantee safe and efficient airspace operations in case of a GNSS outage. Legacy systems such as DME were developed to support less stringent requirements on ranging accuracy compared to today’s and tomorrow’s GNSS. Yet it is unclear how well ground based navigation systems perform compared to the more stringent performance requirements of GNSS based navigation [7]. The propagation characteristics of the air-ground (AG) radio channel, and hereby especially multipath propagation, have been identified as the main source of ranging errors for ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The ranging performance of individual ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> like DME, LDACS 1, or ADS-B over the AG channel has been measured in the past by means of flight trials [8],[9],[10]. However, flight trials are very complex and cost extensive and require a long lead time: the number of flight trajectories, systems or configurations which can be covered is limited. Thus, flight trials are not practical for an extensive testing of different current or future ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Flight trials can be augmented by computer simulations applying a sound and accurate theoretical model of the AG propagation characteristics. Hereby, the evolution of propagation characteristic over time should be modeled. This includes the exact knowledge of the propagation delays, amplitudes, and “lifetimes” of all multipath components. Currently, no accurate channel model in the relevant L-band exists for testing the ranging performance of ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Previously developed statistical AG channel models are only relevant for a rough analysis of communication systems and not suitable for an accurate performance evaluation of ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> [11]. Therefore, in this paper we present a novel type of AG channel model which is based on a comprehensive geometrical statistical channel model (GSCM) approach. Compared to a purely statistical channel model, a GSCM represents propagation effects more closely connected to their original physical cause, e. g., a MPC is not modeled as a purely statistical event but as a reflection originating from a specific obstacle. Thus, a GSCM is able to describe not only the statistical channel properties but also the evolution of the various propagation properties over time. This makes a GSCM very attractive in the context of range estimation. The parameters of the novel GSCM for AG propagation should be based on data collected during different propagation measurements [12],[13]. In our model, we cover the main propagation effects which are the line of sight (LoS) path, the ground or earth surface MPC, lateral MPCs, as well as diffuse MPCs. A brief description of these components follows. The line of sight (LoS) path is the direct propagation path between a ground station and aircraft. The received power of the LoS component usually follows free space loss conditions but may also be attenuated according to the Tx and Rx antenna patterns and by obstructions (often buildings or terrain). The bending of the electromagnetic waves due to the troposphere’s composition can be modelled using existing methods [14]. Ground multipath propagation originates from a reflection off the ground with (for most practical link distances) short delay relative to the LoS component; from its phase variation with path length, this usually manifests itself by the attenuation of the LoS component (the well-known 2 -ray effect). Thus, ground multipath propagation causes fades of the received LoS power. However, measurements have shown that the ground MPC is not always present or exhibits only weak power levels [15]. Therefore, we propose modelling ground multipath propagation by characterization of specific reflecting areas on the ground. Once such an area is defined, the interaction of the ground MPC with the LoS component, and the resulting attenuation or amplification of the latter, follows directly from the underlying geometry. By lateral MPCs we mean signal components that originate from reflections outside the two-dimensional plane defined by the LoS and primary surface reflection. In most cases these are attributable to buildings, large structures or terrain; unlike the primary surface reflection, lateral MPCs have a relatively large delay relative to the LoS path. We propose modelling those MPCs as point reflectors. Each of these point reflectors has a specific location. Diffuse MPCs are caused by clusters of point reflectors or scattering. Thus, diffuse MPCs can usually not be modelled as a single point reflector. As their power level is generally significantly lower than the power level of the other types of MPCs, their influence on range estimation is usually minor. Diffuse MPCs, therefore, can be modelled as a statistical process. In the final paper we present the details of the new AG channel model in a comprehensive way, and show that the model components we have described follow the findings of the propagation measurement campaigns. For each of the propagation effects, we give examples from different sets of measurement data. The presented model allows to test the range estimation performance of different ground based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems</b> for any flight trajectories. References [1]	L. Eldredge, P.

In such a situation characteristics of radio-navigation systems such as: availability, reliability, continuity, integrity and ambiguity of position, which are equally important but often neglected, turn out to be essential. One may risk a claim that integrity and characteristics of reliability theorem origin: availability, reliability, continuity, treated on various levels of structures of <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems,</b> now seem {{to be one of the}} main areas of research. This article presents an analysis of meanings like: availability, reliability and continuity based on navigation literature in the last twenty years.

THE COMPARABLE CRITERIA OF NAVIGATION SYSTEMS The parametric assessment of navigation systems during the last decade has been the most common way of their classification according to their quality. Within the scope of this evaluation critical space is given. This space is very closely related to the navigation requirements faced by its various forms. The comparable criteria of navigation systems are often presented in world literature [ERP, 1996] [FRP, 1999] as well as in polish works [Kopacz, 1996]. These criteria have been overestimated as a result of technological development and the needs of navigation process, but are accompanied by the change of the rank of each of them. This overestimation reflects the technical development by choosing the appropriate way and increasing number of research held by various research institutions that based their work on diverse aspects leading to underling the given exploitation features...|$|R
40|$|The NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based <b>radionavigation</b> <b>system</b> {{designed}} for positioning, velocity determination and timing. The relative movement between a GPS receiver and a GPS satellite causes the received signal frequency to {{differ from the}} transmitted frequency due to the Doppler effect. This frequency difference, an observable in GPS measurements, {{is referred to as}} the Doppler shift. However, the Doppler shift is biased by the inherent errors in the signal propagation. Since velocities of GPS satellites are known, the velocity of a user can be determined through observing four or more satellites, similar to GPS positioning. When the GPS selective availability (SA) was activated, errors imposed on the ephemeris and satellite clocks significantly affected the accuracy of both GPS positioning and velocity determination. The removal of SA has enabled a significant improvement on the accuracy of both GPS satellite orbits and clocks. As a result, velocity accuracy at sub-centimetre per second level is achievable for standalone GPS users if all the errors associated with the Doppler observables are corrected for properly. This paper overviews the developments in precise velocity determination and investigates all error sources associated with the Doppler measurement. The properties of errors in the Doppler shift are analysed and the methods to eliminate or mitigate these errors are discussed. The relativistic errors such as the orbit eccentricity and the Sagnac effect are derived and formulated in easy forms for correction. Algorithms for modelling the atmosphere delay rates are also presented.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} design {{and the development of}} a software called RAPIT (RNAV and APV Procedures Integration Tool), with the objective of making easy and to speed up the obstacle’s assessment task involved when designing instrumental navigation procedures. The program allows creating surfaces to identify obstacles, by means of some basic CAD tools, and it has an algorithm for the detection of the penetrating obstacles, taking into account natural and artificial ones. Moreover, the program is able to manage a database of obstacles, airports, waypoints, navaids, etc. The main goal of the program is the definition of RNAV-APV procedures, even though its flexibility allows the use into any type of conventional navigation procedure. RNAV procedures allow flying approaches and instrumental arrivals for the different airport operators when unfavourable meteorological conditions exist. Currently, instrumental operations are only possible in big airports equipped with expensive <b>radionavigation</b> <b>systems.</b> With the use of the GNSS system it could be defined RNAV procedures into secondary aerodromes which nowadays are basically operated in visual conditions. RAPIT has been implemented starting from a basic and open source code corresponding to a cartographical map visualizer. From this point, some tools and specific modules to resolve the different needs that are required in the design of a RNAV procedure, have been added. The cartographical Catalan data has been provided by the Catalan Cartographic Institute (ICC). The cartographical coordinates were in ED 50 datum and using UTM projection. On the other hand, for aeronautical operations is mandatory working and publish all the coordinates in WGS 84 reference system. For that reason, one of the most important parts of this project is focused into the coordinate’s transformation between both datums. For testing the program, in this project it has been drawn the limitation obstacle’s surfaces (defined in the ICAO’s Annex 14) for Girona’s airport and the infringing obstacles have been identified. On the other hand, a whole RNAV-APV approach procedure for Igualada-Odena’s aerodrome (Anoia) is designed by using RAPI...|$|R

Large experience is accumulated in creation of super-wide-band signal synthesizers. Methods are developed for designing the control unit of the synthesizers with the polynominal frequency modulation. Recommendations are given on the selection of the parameters of the code storage with delayed transfer and on the selection of the synthesizers with controllable phase shifters and with delay devices. Proposed are new structures of the synthesizers and their units with improved characteristics. Seven synthesizers are introduced.

40|$|Nowadays, {{using the}} {{services}} provided by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is ubiquitous in geodesy, cadastre and Geographic Information Systems. Galileo, the GNSS system which is under development by the European Union, will transmit navigation signals in four subbands (E 5 a/L 5, E 5 b, E 6 and E 1 /L 1) within the L band. GNSS systems {{are not the only}} users of the L band around the world; other telecommunication systems also use it. Papers analyzing real RF measurement campaigns have shown that loss-of-lock on the navigational signals is possible to GNSS receivers in the vicinity of radio and TV broadcast transmitters. It has also been demonstrated that, in the nearby area of airports, <b>radionavigation</b> or communication <b>systems</b> (e. g. Very High Frequency Omindirectional Radio Range or Instrument Landing System) can cause interference to GNSS receivers. These interferences are unwanted because they can affect the precision of the GNSS receivers and can compromise the topographical measurements. Therefore it is essential to understand better the negative effects of RF interferences on GNSS receivers and to optimize the solutions against the interferences. This paper deals with the particular matter of filtering the narrowband interferences affecting Multiplexed-Binary-Offset-Carrier (MBOC) Galileo navigation signal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Besides their {{intended}} use in <b>radionavigation,</b> global positioning <b>system</b> (GPS) satellite signals provide convenient radio beacons for ionospheric studies. Among other propagation phe-nomena, the ionosphere affects GPS signal propagation through amplitude scintillations that develop after radio waves propagate through ionospheric electron density irregularities. This paper out-lines the design, testing, {{and operation of}} a specialized GPS re-ceiver to monitor L-band amplitude scintillations: the Cornell scin-tillation monitor. The Cornell scintillation monitor consists of a commercial GPS receiver development kit with its software modi-fied to log signal strength from up to 12 channels at a high data rate (50 samples/s). Other features of the receiver include the optional assignment of a channel to monitor the receiver noise level {{in the absence of}} signal tracking and the means to synchronize measure-ments between nearby independent receivers to perform drift mea-surements and correlation studies. The Cornell scintillation mon-itor provides characterization of the operational L-band scintilla-tion environment and additionally permits study of the multipath environment of a static antenna. GPS scintillation monitors can provide information about the state of ionospheric irregularities for pure research purposes as well. Here their strength {{lies in the fact that}} they are inexpensive and compact and therefore can be readily proliferated. Even a single scintillation monitor can supple-ment radar spatial coverage of irregularities in a limited way be-cause it monitors several satellite lines of sight simultaneously. This article introduces some of the potential of the scintillation mon-itor for research, primarily through examples associated with field testing the instrument.
