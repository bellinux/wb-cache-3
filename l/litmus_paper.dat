25|$|Chemical eye {{injury is}} due to either an acidic or alkali {{substance}} getting in the eye. Alkalis are typically worse than acidic burns. Mild burns will produce conjunctivitis, while more severe burns may cause the cornea to turn white. <b>Litmus</b> <b>paper</b> is {{an easy way to}} rule out the diagnosis by verifying that the pH is within the normal range of 7.0—7.2.

Lemons that were not saleable as produce were made into pectin or citric acid, with sulfur dioxide used as a preservative. Sunkist needed to know the acidity of the product at any given time, and the colorimetric methods then in use, such as readings from <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> did not work well because sulfur dioxide interfered with them. [...] Chemist Glen Joseph at Sunkist was attempting to measure the hydrogen-ion concentration in lemon juice electrochemically, but sulfur dioxide damaged hydrogen electrodes, and non-reactive glass electrodes produced weak signals and were fragile.|$|E

2500|$|Scheele {{made one}} other very {{important}} scientific discovery in 1774, arguably more revolutionary than his isolation of oxygen. [...] He identified lime, silica, and iron in a specimen of pyrolusite (impure manganese dioxide) {{given to him}} by his friend, Johann Gottlieb Gahn, but could not identify an additional component (this was the manganese, which Scheele recognized was present as a new element, but could not isolate). When he treated the pyrolusite with hydrochloric acid over a warm sand bath, a yellow-green gas with a strong odor was produced. [...] He found that the gas sank to the bottom of an open bottle and was denser than ordinary air. He also noted that the gas was not soluble in water. It turned corks a yellow color and removed all color from wet, blue <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> and some flowers. He called this gas with bleaching abilities, [...] "dephlogisticated muriatic acid" [...] (dephlogisticated hydrochloric acid, or oxidized hydrochloric acid). Eventually, Sir Humphry Davy named the gas chlorine.|$|E
2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I reach for my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with <b>litmus</b> <b>paper.</b> All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E

40|$|Background: Detergents {{are used}} by almost every {{household}} in the developed and developing world. Soap and most detergents are anionic surfactants and attack the horny layer of the skin and increase its permeability {{with little or no}} inflammatory change and may result in hand eczema, which is very distressing and incapacitating. Aim: To evaluate the irritant potential of common household detergents (laundry and dish wash) used by the Indian population using a 24 -hour patch test and to convincingly educate the patients on the detergents less likely to cause irritation in the particular individual. Methods: Seventeen commonly used detergents found in Indian market were included in the study, of which, 12 were laundry detergents (powders - seven, bar soap - five) and five were dish wash detergents (powder - one, liquid - one, bar soap - three). The irritant potential of the 17 detergents were evaluated in 30 volunteers. Thirty microliters of each of the detergent bar solutions, distilled water (negative control), and 20 &#x 0025; SDS (positive control) were applied to Finn chambers with a micropipette and occluded for 24 hours. Erythema, scaling, and edema were graded in comparison to the reaction at the negative control site (distilled water) for each volunteer separately. The scoring of erythema / dryness and wrinkling on a 0 - 4 point scale and edema on another 0 - 4 point scale was based on the Draize scale. The pH of each of the detergent solutions was determined using <b>litmus</b> <b>papers</b> (Indikrom papers from Qualigens fine chemicals). Results: The difference between detergents (F value) was significant for erythema / dryness and wrinkling (F = 3. 374; p = 0. 000), but not significant for edema (F = 1. 297; p = 0. 194). [Table 2] lists the means for erythema / dryness and wrinkling, and edema. The F value of the totals of the means for erythema / dryness and wrinkling and edema was significant (F = 2. 495; p = 0. 001). The pH of all the detergents was found to be alkaline except Pril utensil cleaner which tested acidic (pH 6). The positive control, 20 &#x 0025; SDS also tested acidic (pH 6). Conclusion : Similar to patch testing in allergic contact dermatitis, 24 -hour patch testing with detergent solutions (8 &#x 0025; w/v), will educate the patient on what detergent to avoid. This may bring down the total medication requirement and frequent hospital consultations for these patients...|$|R

Finally, {{a series}} of four small {{compound}} conductors, consisting of <b>litmus</b> and turmeric <b>paper</b> (fig. 51.) moistened in solution of sulphate of soda, were supported on glass rods, in a line at a little distance from each other, between the points p and n of the machine and discharging train, so that the electricity might pass in succession through them, entering in at the litmus points b, b, and passing out at the turmeric points a, a. On working the machine carefully, {{so as to avoid}} sparks and brushes (322.), I soon obtained evidence of decomposition in each of the moist conductors, for all the litmus points exhibited free acid, and the turmeric points equally showed free alkali.|$|R
6000|$|... 455. The {{pieces of}} <b>litmus</b> and {{turmeric}} <b>paper</b> were now placed each upon a separate plate of glass, and connected by an insulated string four feet long, moistened {{in the same}} solution of sulphate of soda: the terminal decomposing wire points were placed upon the papers as before. On working the machine, the same evolution of acid and alkali appeared as in the former instance, and with equal readiness, notwithstanding that the places of their appearance were four feet apart from each other. Finally, a piece of string, seventy feet long, was used. It was insulated in the air by suspenders of silk, so that the electricity passed through its entire length: decomposition took place exactly as in former cases, alkali and acid appearing at the two extremities in their proper places.|$|R

60|$|Not {{content with}} this cheap experiment, the {{stranger}} then took Concho's breath away by reddening some <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> with the nitrate, and then completely knocked over the simple Mexican by restoring its color by dipping {{it in the}} salt water.|$|E
6000|$|... 317. A {{piece of}} <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> {{moistened}} in solution of common salt or sulphate of soda, was quickly reddened at p. A similar piece moistened in muriatic acid was very soon bleached at p. No {{effects of a}} similar kind took place at n.|$|E
6000|$|... 906. A little {{nitric acid}} {{was added to}} the liquid in the vessel r, so as to make a mixture which I shall call diluted nitro-sulphuric acid. On repeating the {{experiments}} with this mixture, all the substances before decomposed again gave way, and much more readily. But, besides that, many which before resisted electrolyzation, now yielded up their elements. Thus, solution of sulphate of soda, acted upon in the interstices of <b>litmus</b> and turmeric <b>paper,</b> yielded acid at the anode and alkali at the cathode; solution of muriatic acid tinged by indigo yielded chlorine at the anode and hydrogen at the cathode; solution of nitrate of silver yielded silver at the cathode. Again, fused nitre and the fused iodide and chloride of lead were decomposable by the current of this single pair of plates, though they were not by the former (903.).|$|R
6000|$|... 321. Finally, the {{experiment}} was extended into the following form, supplying {{in this case the}} tidiest analogy between common and voltaic electricity. Three compound pieces of <b>litmus</b> and turmeric <b>paper</b> (319.) were moistened in solution of sulphate of soda, and arranged on a plate of glass with platina wires, as in fig. 45. The wire m was connected with the prime conductor of the machine, the wire t with the discharging train, and the wires r and s entered into the course of the electrical current by means of the pieces of moistened paper; they were so bent as to rest each on three points, n, r, p; n, s, p, the points r and s being supported by the glass, and the others by the papers; the three terminations p, p, p rested on the litmus, and the other three n, n, n on the turmeric paper. On working the machine for a short time only, acid was evolved at all the poles or terminations p, p, p, by which the electricity entered the solution, and alkali at the other poles n, n, n, by which the electricity left the solution.|$|R
6000|$|... 976. On placing {{solution}} of iodide of potassium in paper {{at one of}} the decomposing localities, and {{solution of}} sulphate of soda at the other, so that the electric current should pass through both at once, the solution of iodide was slowly decomposed, yielding iodine at the anode and alkali at the cathode; but the solution of sulphate of soda exhibited no signs of decomposition, neither acid nor alkali being evolved from it. On placing the wires so that the iodide alone was subject to the action of the current (900.), it was quickly and powerfully decomposed; but on arranging them so that the sulphate of soda alone was subject to action, it still refused to yield up its elements. Finally, the apparatus was so arranged under a wet bell-glass, that it could be left for twelve hours, the current passing during the whole time through a solution of sulphate of soda, retained in its place by only two thicknesses of bibulous <b>litmus</b> and turmeric <b>paper.</b> At the end of that time it was ascertained by the decomposition of iodide of potassium at the second place of action, that the current was passing and had passed for the twelve hours, and yet no trace of acid or alkali from the sulphate of soda appeared.|$|R
60|$|The {{secretion}} {{from the}} taller glands differs {{in a remarkable}} manner from that of Drosera, in being acid before the glands have been in any way excited; and judging from the changed colour of <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> more strongly acid than that of Drosera. This fact was observed repeatedly; on one occasion I chose a young leaf, which was not secreting freely, and had never caught an insect, yet the secretion on all the glands coloured <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> of a bright red. From the quickness with which the glands are able to obtain animal matter from such substances as well-washed fibrin and cartilage, I suspect that a small quantity of the proper ferment must {{be present in the}} secretion before the glands are excited, so that a little animal matter is quickly dissolved.|$|E
6000|$|... 325. By {{moistening}} a {{very small}} slip of <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> in solution of caustic potassa, and then passing the electric spark over its length in the air, I gradually neutralized the alkali, and ultimately rendered the paper red; on drying it, I found that nitrate of potassa had resulted from the operation, and that the paper had become touch-paper.|$|E
6000|$|... 457. The {{negative}} {{point of}} the discharging train, the turmeric paper, and the string were then removed; the positive point was left resting upon the <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> and the latter touched by a piece of moistened string held in the hand. A few turns of the machine evolved acid at the positive point as freely as before.|$|E

6000|$|... 454. I endeavoured {{to apply}} this {{facility}} of transmitting the current of electricity through {{any length of}} a conductor, to {{an investigation of the}} transfer of the elements in a decomposing body, in contrary directions, towards the poles. The general form of apparatus used in these experiments has been already described (312. 316); and also a particular experiment (319.), in which, when a piece of <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> and a piece of turmeric paper were combined and moistened in solution of sulphate of soda, the point of the wire from the machine (representing the positive pole) put upon the <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> and the receiving point from the discharging train (292. 316.), representing the negative pole, upon the turmeric paper, a very few turns of the machine sufficed to show the evolution of acid at the former, and alkali at the latter, exactly in the manner effected by a volta-electric current.|$|E

6000|$|... 458. The {{end of the}} {{moistened}} string, {{instead of}} being held in the hand, was suspended by glass in the air. On working the machine the electricity proceeded from the conductor through the wire point to the <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> and thence away by {{the intervention of the}} string to the air, so that there was (as in the last experiment) but one metallic pole; still acid was evolved there as freely as in any former case.|$|E
6000|$|... 322. In all {{experiments}} of electro-chemical decomposition by the common machine and moistened papers (316.), {{it is necessary}} to be aware of and to avoid the following important source of error. If a spark passes over moistened litmus and turmeric paper, the <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> (provided it be delicate and not too alkaline,) is reddened by it; and if several sparks are passed, it becomes powerfully reddened. If the electricity pass a little way from the wire over the surface of the moistened paper, before it finds mass and moisture enough to conduct it, then the reddening extends as far as the ramifications. If similar ramifications occur at the termination n, on the turmeric paper, they prevent the occurrence of the red spot due to the alkali, which would otherwise collect there: sparks or ramifications from the points n will also redden <b>litmus</b> <b>paper.</b> If paper moistened by a solution of iodide of potassium (which is an admirably delicate test of electro-chemical action,) be exposed to the sparks or ramifications, or even a feeble stream of electricity through the air from either the point p or n, iodine will be immediately evolved.|$|E
60|$|Acetate of Quinine.--Four {{leaves were}} immersed, each in thirty minims of a {{solution}} of one part to 437 of water. The solution was tested with <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> and was not acid. After only 10 m. all four leaves were greatly, and after 6 hrs. immensely, inflected. They were then left in water for 60 hrs., but never re-expanded; the glands were white, and the leaves evidently dead. This salt is far more efficient than the sulphate in causing inflection, and, like that salt, is highly poisonous.|$|E

6000|$|Prof. Frankland, {{as well as}} his assistant, {{observed}} (and this is {{an important}} fact) that the fluid, [...] "when acidified with sulphuric acid, emitted a powerful odour like that of pepsin." [...] The leaves from which the secretion had been washed were also sent to Prof. Frankland; they were macerated for some hours, then acidified with sulphuric acid and distilled, but no acid passed over. Therefore the acid which fresh leaves contain, as shown by their discolouring <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> when crushed, must be of a different nature from that present in the secretion.

6000|$|... 468. Similar litmus and {{turmeric}} paper {{points were}} now placed upon glass plates, and {{connected by a}} string six feet long, both string and paper being moistened in solution of sulphate of soda; a needle point connected with the machine was brought opposite the <b>litmus</b> <b>paper</b> point, and another needle point connected with the discharging train brought opposite the turmeric paper. On working the machine, acid appeared on the litmus, and alkali on the turmeric paper; but the latter was not so abundant as in former cases, {{for much of the}} electricity passed off from the string into the air, and diminished the quantity discharged at the turmeric point.|$|E
6000|$|... 463. A similar {{piece of}} <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> dipped in {{solution}} of sulphate of soda n, fig. 49, was now supported upon {{the end of}} the discharging train a, and its extremity brought opposite to a point p, connected with the conductor of the machine. After working the machine for a short time, acid was developed at both the corners towards the point, i.e. at both the corners receiving the electricities from the air. Every precaution was taken to prevent this acid from being formed by sparks or brushes passing through the air (322.); and these, with the accompanying general facts, are sufficient to show that the acid was really the result of electro-chemical decomposition (466.).|$|E
6000|$|... 496. After {{a little}} while the voltaic {{communication}} was broken, and the platina poles removed with as little agitation {{as possible from the}} water and solution, for the purpose of examining the liquid adhering to them. The pole c, when touched by turmeric paper, gave no traces of alkali, nor could anything but pure water be found upon it. The pole b, though drawn through a much greater depth and quantity of fluid, was found so acid as to give abundant evidence to <b>litmus</b> <b>paper,</b> the tongue, and other tests. Hence there had been no interference of alkaline salts in any way, undergoing first decomposition, and then causing the separation of the magnesia at a distance from the pole by mere chemical agencies.
