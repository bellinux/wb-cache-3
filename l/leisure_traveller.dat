40|$|The travel {{industry}} has experienced major changes {{and continues to}} do so. The airline industry is no longer paying commission to travel agents, and agents are now charging fees to clients for various types of services, as business and leisure travel become increasingly specialised. The role of the travel agent has changed from that of an agent for the supplier to an agent for the customer. For business travel, the travel agent {{has evolved into a}} travel management company serving the business and corporate travel market. Traditional travel agencies have started to focus more on the <b>leisure</b> <b>traveller.</b> The development of the Internet has resulted in a proliferation of channels that can be accessed by the <b>leisure</b> <b>traveller,</b> further eroding the role of the travel agent as a provider of travel information and a mechanism for reservations and transactions. The question that arises is whether the customers of a leisure travel agency {{are willing to pay for}} services that could feasibly be obtained elsewhere. In this study, customers of a travel agency franchise group were surveyed with respect to their willingness to pay for the services rendered by a travel agent.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} {{findings}} from an ethnographic study (2008 – 09) {{conducted in a}} village with a significant population of local surfers in Cornwall (Southwest England).

We suggest that similar to findings from other subcultural studies on sports careers the local surfing career in this context contains shared experiential stages: the nurtured stage, the possible competitive stage, the serious <b>leisure</b> <b>traveller</b> stage, the responsible stage, and the legends stage. We conclude that the shared experiences and pathways of a local surfing career can play a positive cultural role, not just for individuals but also for the construction and maintenance of local community life...|$|E
40|$|The {{figure of}} the migrant has become a {{paradigmatic}} representative of globalised postcoloniality. Yet, not all ‘postcolonial’ mobilities can be equated with migration. Cases in point are the travelling African protagonists of two diasporic Nigerian short stories, Sefi Atta's ‘Housekeeping’ (2010) and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s ‘Transition to Glory’(2006). The short stories feature the figures of the African <b>leisure</b> <b>traveller,</b> tourist, and, in particular, hotel guest. The hotel articulates different dimensions of a site that is frequently conceived, both in fiction and in theory, as a place and symbol of in-between-ness, deviance and displacement. In ‘Housekeeping’, the hotel serves as a setting for exploring the socio-economic differences between migrant travellers and symbolises a sense of diasporic nbelonging. In ‘Transition to Glory’, the hotel room {{is used as a}} setting and symbol for an adulterous relationship. It comes across as a space of deviance which is not properly inscribed either in the private/domestic or the public. While set in spaces of in-between-ness and transit, both texts articulate metaphorical senses of longing for home. By analysing the literary representation of the hotel trope, this article contributes to widening the scope of how postcolonial mobilities can be understood. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This study {{combined}} {{two significant}} areas in marketing, {{customer relationship management}} (CRM) and variety-seeking behaviour (VSB), which are paradoxical constructs due to their contradictory intentions. While organisations implement various customer relationship management practices with an intention of retaining customers and generating loyalty, a preference for variety-seeking behaviour can make customers switch. This study investigated the impact of variety-seeking behaviour on generating outcomes of customer relationship management practices in the hotel context, by focusing exclusively on <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers.</b> Even though customer relationship management is widely adopted in the hotel domain, much of its discussions are on implementation related aspects, {{rather than on the}} practices that manifest due to CRM implementations. Thus, only a few studies have investigated the effectiveness of CRM from a customer point of view. Numerous factors affecting customer switching behaviour have also been discussed in the hotel literature. Variety-seeking behaviour is identified as a key factor influencing customer loyalty and switching in numerous other services in the tourism domain. However, variety-seeking behaviour in the hotel domain has not received scholarly attention. This study investigated the customer relationship management practices experienced by <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers</b> in their hotel visits. Based on the observations from the literature, and also from studies on variety-seeking behaviour in other contexts, this study explored whether <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers</b> seek variety in the hotel context. Combining the two domains, it then investigated the impact of variety-seeking behaviour on the effectiveness of customer relationship management to generate its outcomes. In turn, it also determined the impact of customer relationship management on influencing the variety-seeking behaviour of <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers.</b> This study adopted a sequential mixed method design. The initial qualitative stage explored the concepts in-depth, and addressed four exploratory research questions. It also generated items to initiate the subsequent quantitative phase, and to generate hypotheses. The quantitative phase involved pilot testing, validating a new measurement scale, testing the hypotheses and making generalisations to a larger population. The qualitative phase involved five focus groups which consisted of 22 participants in total. The quantitative stage involved a survey which consisted of 400 responses. Prior to the survey a pilot test was conducted with a sample of 100 respondents. The samples for both qualitative and quantitative stages were selected based on the criterion ‘leisure travellers who have been to the same international destination two or more times’ This criterion was important in identifying hotel selection patterns which in turn provides grounds to understand variety-seeking behaviour of <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers.</b> The qualitative findings identified numerous customer relationship management practices experienced by <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers.</b> They were categorised as: pre-encounter, encounter and post-encounter practices. It was also found that while some seek familiarity many <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers</b> do seek variety in the hotel context. The data revealed that <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers</b> can be categorised into three groups based on their degree of variety-seeking behaviour, those who visit: 1) the same location and the same hotel 2) the same location and different hotels, and 3) different locations and different hotels. They were named the familiarity/familiarity seeking group (FF), the familiarity/variety seeking group (FV), and the variety/variety seeking group (VV) respectively. The quantitative stage commenced with validating a new measurement scale. The findings indicated that even though customer relationship management leads to word-of-mouth recommendation, it does not lead to repeat visitation. Through multi-group moderation analysis it was further identified that the outcomes of customer relationship management do not vary based on the degree of variety-seeking behaviour of travellers. The relationship between CRM and VSB was found to be two fold—while on the one hand customer relationship management leading to repeat visitation is fully mediated by the intrinsic factors affecting variety-seeking behaviour, on the other hand customer-relationship management does have a significant influence on variety-seeking behaviour. This study contributes to the body of knowledge on customer relationship management and variety-seeking behaviour. The theoretical contribution includes the identification of the impact of customer relationship practices on generating repeat visitation and word-of-mouth and the extension of the theory of VSB to the hotel context. This study pointed to some effective segmentation dimensions and methods to improve targeted communication that can be used by hotel practitioners. The mixed method approach enhanced the methodological rigor used in realising the above contributions...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{experience}} of older people who travel through an airport. The research reported {{took place at the}} interface of population ageing, tourism travel and airport management. Although air transport is influenced by population ageing, older people’s experiences within this specific environment are largely untold. This is surprising, as flying is the preferred form of travel for much of international tourism and airports represent key infrastructure for the provision of dependable services. Thus, there are gaps in knowledge on older travellers at an airport and the airport’s role in this part of leisure travel. In particular, a holistic examination of older travellers’ experiences within the airport environment is missing. This research uses different approaches to the experience concept to explore the expectations, needs and demands of older travellers. It investigates the airport experience of older travellers, in light of the changing roles of airports in society. In the form of a qualitative single-case study, it examines the situation of the older <b>leisure</b> <b>traveller</b> at Frankfurt Airport in Germany. Data was collected through 66 interviews with older leisure travellers, frontline employees and managers, complemented by 50 observations. This provides a comprehensive perspective of the older travellers’ airport experience and represents a novel approach. The thesis makes several contributions to experience, travel and tourism literature. On the demand side, the findings allow for {{a better understanding of the}} experience of the older passengers. The effect of ageing on an airport’s customer base is investigated. It is discussed whether this group needs special treatment within the regular passenger process. On the supply side, the emerging role of the airport as part of the overall holiday journey is explored. Furthermore, the findings show how airport management deals with this particular passenger group...|$|E

The results of the study showed that the 18 - 30 year old travellers from Spain possess a strong need for cultural novelty and the following major secondary needs: a need for entertainment, a need for mental relaxation, a need for social interaction and a need to disconnect from a routine. The Australian tourist experience is perceived as relatively able to satisfy these needs when compared with other western English-speaking destinations. For these young <b>leisure</b> <b>travellers,</b> Australia’s exotic appeal, its multiculturalism and the attractiveness of its unique fauna, flora, natural beauty, and climate play a large role in the satisfaction of their needs.
