25|$|In {{the pension}} industry, actuarial methods {{are used to}} measure the costs of {{alternative}} strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign of pension plans. The strategies are greatly influenced by short-term and <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> rates, the funded status of the pension and benefit arrangements, collective bargaining; the employer's old, new and foreign competitors; the changing demographics of the workforce; changes in the internal revenue code; changes in the attitude of the internal revenue service regarding the calculation of surpluses; and equally importantly, both the short and long term financial and economic trends. It is common with mergers and acquisitions that several pension plans have to be combined or at least administered on an equitable basis. When benefit changes occur, old and new benefit plans have to be blended, satisfying new social demands and various government discrimination test calculations, and providing employees and retirees with understandable choices and transition paths. Benefit plans liabilities have to be properly valued, reflecting both earned benefits for past service, and the benefits for future service. Finally, funding schemes have to be developed that are manageable and satisfy the standards board or regulators of the appropriate country, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|The {{liquidity}} premium theory is {{an offshoot of}} the pure expectations theory. [...] The {{liquidity premium}} theory asserts that long-term interest rates not only reflect investors' assumptions about future interest rates but also include a premium for holding long-term bonds (investors prefer short term bonds to long term bonds), called the term premium or the liquidity premium. This premium compensates investors for the added risk of having their money tied up for a longer period, including the greater price uncertainty. Because of the term premium, <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> yields tend to be higher than short-term yields and the yield curve slopes upward. Long term yields are also higher {{not just because of the}} liquidity premium, but also because of the risk premium added by the risk of default from holding a security over the long term.

40|$|We {{solve the}} {{portfolio}} {{problem of a}} long-run investor when the term structure is Gaussian and when the investor has access to nominal bonds and stock. We apply our method to a three-factor model that captures {{the failure of the}} expectations hypothesis. We extend this model to account for time-varying expected inflation, and estimate the model with both inflation and term structure data. The estimates imply that the bond portfolio of a long-run investor looks very different from the portfolio of a meanvariance optimizer. In particular, time-varying term premia generate large hedging demands for <b>long-term</b> <b>bonds.</b> THE EXPECTATIONS HYPOTHESIS OF INTEREST RATES states that the premium on longterm bonds over short-term bonds is constant over time.

40|$|In recent years, Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers {{have come}} to rely on <b>{{long-term}}</b> <b>bond</b> yields to measure the public’s long-term inflationary expectations. The <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> rate plays a central role in Goodfriend’s (1993) narrative account of Fed behavior, 1979 – 1992, which links policyrelated movements in the federal funds rate to changes in the yield on long-term U. S. Treasury bonds. According to Goodfriend, Fed officials interpreted rapid increases in <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> rates as the product of rising inflationary expectations, reflecting a deterioration in the credibility of their fight against inflation. To restore that credibility, they responded by tightening monetary policy, that is, by raising the federal funds rate. Mehra (1995) presents statistical results that support Goodfriend’s view. Using an econometric model, he demonstrates that changes in <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> rates help explain movements in the federal funds rate during the 1980 s. While these studies provide convincing evidence of a link between Fed policy and <b>long-term</b> <b>bond</b> rates, both start with the untested hypothesis that movements in such rates primarily reflect changes in long-term inflationary expectations. And while economic theory does identify expected inflation as one determinant of nominal bond yields, it suggests that there are other determinants as well. Using theory as a guide, this article seeks to measure the contribution each determinant makes in accounting for movements in longterm bond yields. By doing so, it attempts to judge the extent to which Fed policymakers are justified in using these bond yields as indicators of inflationary expectations...|$|E
