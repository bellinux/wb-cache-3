The noteworthy biological characteristics of Se-pioteuthis lessoniana are (1) this species is behaviorally and morphologically well suited to the laboratory envi-ronment; (2) the life cycle is completed in 4 - 6 months; (3) growth is rapid (12 % and 5 % wet body weight d- ’ for 100 d and for the life span, respectively), with adult size ranging from 0. 4 - 2. 2 kg; (4) feeding rates are high (30 % wet body weight d-l), {{and a variety of}} <b>live</b> <b>crustaceans</b> and fishes are eaten; (5) crowding is tolerated (about 4 squids mm 3); (6) the incidence of disease and cannibalism is low; and (7) reproduction in captivity allows culture through three successive generations. Engineering factors contributed to culture success: (1) physical design (i. e., size, shape, and painted pattern) of the culture tanks; (2) patterns of water flow in the culture tanks; (3) water fil-tration systems; and (4) spawning substrates.

40|$|The dried cysts of the brine shrimp Artemia salina {{are used}} {{all over the}} world as a most {{convenient}} source of <b>live</b> <b>crustacean</b> nauplii which are indispensable for the larval stages of many fishes and crustaceans. With the expansion of mariculture, the demand for the resting eggs of Artemia has greatly increased and at certain moments of the year it exceeds the offer. Hence it is even more regrettable that in most mariculture farms a considerable wastage of this precious live food occurs: the nauplii are usually hatched in uncontrolled conditions, and the instar stage at which the Artemia larvae are offered to the predator is not considered and varies from one experiment to another. From fundamental research on the hatching and molting rate of Artemia larvae it appears that the water temperature has an important influence on the latter two processes. The biochemical data reported in this paper, reveal drastic changes in the dry- and ash weight and in the caloric- and lipid content of Artemia nauplii when they molt from the 1 st into the 2 nd and 3 rd instar stages. In order to keep the energetic value as high as possible, {{it is clear that the}} cysts should be hatched under strictly controlled conditions and should be fed to the larval fishes or crustaceans as soon as possible after hatching...|$|R
40|$|According to {{conceptual}} models, {{the distribution}} of resources plays {{a critical role in}} determining how organisms distribute themselves near habitat edges. These models are frequently used to achieve a mechanistic understanding of edge effects, but because they are based predominantly on correlative studies, there is need for a demonstration of causality, which is best done through experimentation. Using artificial seagrass habitat as an experimental system, we determined a likely mechanism underpinning edge effects in a seagrass fish. To test for edge effects, we measured fish abundance at edges (0 - 0. 5 m) and interiors (0. 5 - 1 m) of two patch configurations: continuous (single, continuous 9 -m 2 patches) and patchy (four discrete 1 -m 2 patches within a 9 -m 2 area). In continuous configurations, pipefish (Stigmatopora argus) were three times more abundant at edges than interiors (positive edge effect), but in patchy configurations there was no difference. The lack of edge effect in patchy configurations might be because patchy seagrass consisted entirely of edge habitat. We then used two approaches to test whether observed edge effects in continuous configurations were caused by increased availability of food at edges. First, we estimated the abundance of the major prey of pipefish, small crustaceans, across continuous seagrass configurations. Crustacean abundances were highest at seagrass edges, where they were 16 % greater than in patch interiors. Second, we supplemented interiors of continuous treatment patches with <b>live</b> <b>crustaceans,</b> while control patches were supplemented with seawater. After five hours of supplementation, numbers of pipefish were similar between edges and interiors of treatment patches, while the strong edge effects were maintained in controls. This indicated that fish were moving from patch edges to interiors in response to food supplementation. These approaches strongly suggest that a numerically dominant fish species is more abundant at seagrass edges due to greater food availability, and provide experimental support for the resource distribution model as an explanation for edge effects.

He enters the restaurant seeing few people (played by the other band members). He is greeted by an attractive Asian waitress. After being seated Grohl is waited on by a male Asian double of himself, including his tattoos and T-shirt, minus the Motörhead logo. Nate Mendel starts to get bored looking at the <b>live</b> <b>crustacean</b> in his cup and starts balancing a fork and a spoon {{on the rim of}} a glass. Taylor Hawkins tries to better this by balancing a salt shaker in a small pile of salt. Grohl hums and sings along to his own song being played on a radio and television. In an extended daydream sequence, Grohl envisions himself as the scuba suited toy in the restaurant's aquarium as a mermaid, who resembles the restaurant's waitress, swims towards him. (The bottle at his feet with the red liquid is a reference to the video for [...] "DOA") After a moment of bubbling love hearts at each other, she detaches his air hose and the glass in his helmet cracks. At the same time, Mendel knocks the glass off the table and Hawkins knocks over the salt shaker. Before the glass hits the ground, Chris Shiflett catches it and puts it back on the table. Still daydreaming, Grohl finds he is able to breathe under water and he swims away with the mermaid. As Shiflett asks Mendel to show him how to balance the fork and spoon on the glass, Grohl is snapped back to reality by the waitress handing him the bill.

An alkaline pH (8. 5) was optimal both for attachment and multiplication of V. cholerae, as compared with pH 6. 5 and 7. 5.

40|$|Benthic {{crustaceans}} are {{an important}} component of the coral reef fauna, yet our understanding of their ecological significance is incomplete. To determine the community structure, abundance, biomass and productivity of benthic Crustacea at Lizard Island, a mid-shelf reef on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, we investigated 5 major microhabitats: dead coral, coral rubble, sand, epilithic algal matrix (EAM) and fine-branching <b>live</b> coral. <b>Crustacean</b> communities differed significantly among habitats, with the exception of dead coral and coral rubble. Dead coral was the most important microhabitat type in terms of crustacean abundance (7838 ± 628 ind. 100 cm- 2, mean ± SE), biomass (0. 75 ± 0. 13 g m- 2, wet weight) and estimated productivity (0. 17 ± 0. 043 g 100 cm- 2 yr- 1 ash free dry weight). These values were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than those for the least important habitats (EAM and fine-branching live coral). Despite their abundance, the average crustacean body length was just 0. 79 ± 0. 32 mm, largely due to the dominance of harpacticoid copepods. In contrast, decapods exhibited very low abundances, but yielded the greatest biomass and productivity and were particularly abundant in dead coral and coral rubble. The results highlight the importance of small crustaceans and dead coral microhabitats as valuable contributors to the trophic structure of coral reefs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Most <b>crustaceans</b> <b>live</b> in aquatic {{environments and}} chemoreception is their {{dominant}} sensory modality. Crustacean chemoreception is mediated by small cuticular sense organs (sensilla) occurring on all body parts, with the antennules (first antennae), second antennae, legs, and mouthparts representing the major chemosensory organs. Chemoreceptive sensilla of crustaceans {{are divided into}} bimodal sensilla which comprise a few mechano- and some chemoreceptor neurons and occur on all appendages and aesthetascs which are innervated by 40 – 500 olfactory receptor neurons and exclusively occur on the antennular outer flagellum. Olfactory receptor neurons differ from chemoreceptor neurons of bimodal sensilla in having spontaneous activity, inhibitory responses, and autonomous bursting, but both types of receptor neurons mainly respond to small water-soluble molecules such as amino acids. The dichotomy in sensilla structure {{is reflected in the}} organi-zation of the associated CNS pathways. Olfactory receptor neurons selectively innervate a synaptic region in the midbrain, the olfactory lobe, which is organized into dense substructures called glomeruli. As is typical of the first synaptic relay i...|$|R

The spectral sensitivity data indicate that all of these species have blue sensitive visual pigments, but G. spinifer also appears to possess a UV sensitive visual pigment. The temporal resolution of all these eyes is quite low, indicating that these photoreceptors have a long integration time. The temporal resolution of Booralana tricarinata, is so low that it is unlikely that this isopod could track any moving object. Rather, its photoreceptors appear to be designed for finding bioluminescence that glows rather than flashes, such as detritus covered with bioluminescent bacteria...|$|R
40|$|While {{instances}} of parasitism {{are well known}} in the isopod crustaceans, especially among the epicarideans and cirolanids, relatively little information has hitherto been documented on their commensal relationships with other invertebrate animals (cf.

One of such commensal relationships rather commonly observed is that between sphaeromatid isopods and certain groups of mollusks, and recently Glynn (1968) made an intensive study on the association of a sphaeromatid Dynamenella peiforata (Moore, 1901) with the chitons Acanthopleura granulata and Chiton tuberculata in Puerto Rico.

50|$|Sanderlings feed on {{invertebrate}} prey {{buried in}} the sand in the upper intertidal zone. In North America, this diet largely consists of the isopods Excirolana linguifrons, Excirolana kincaidii, and the mole crab, Emerita analoga. When the tide is out, these <b>crustaceans</b> <b>live</b> in burrows some way beneath the surface. When the tide comes in, they move into the upper layers of sand and feed on the plankton and detritus that washes over them with each wave. They then burrow rapidly down again as the water retreats. They leave no marks on the surface, so the sanderlings hunt for them by plunging their beaks into the sand at random, consuming whatever they find. Their bills can penetrate only 2 or 3 cm and as the water swirls around and retreats, the sand is softer; this {{makes it easier for}} the birds' beaks to penetrate further. In the spring, when much breeding activity is taking place in the benthic community, there may be as many as 4000 invertebrates per square metre, but their average size is smaller than later in the year.

40|$|The green {{mandarin}} fish, Synchiropus splendidus (Herre, 1927) is a small, brilliantly coloured benthic marine fish {{distributed in}} the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is within the group of fish known as dragonets (Family: Callionymidae) and {{is among the most}} desirable species to marine aquarium hobbyists worldwide. Unfortunately, the current supply of S. splendidus for the aquarium trade comes solely from the wild. Moreover, it has been observed that most specimens on sale are males, suggesting probably selective harvesting from the wild populations. As a result, the captive breeding of S. splendidus is urgently required as an alternative to ensure a sustainable supply of this popular species for the aquarium trade to reduce the pressure on its natural populations. S. splendidus is a pelagic-spawner and has been considered as a relatively hard-to-breed species due to its adults generally feeding on <b>live</b> small <b>crustaceans,</b> hence this species is difficult to maintain under captive condition. In addition, there is limited knowledge on its larval feeding habitat. Newly hatched larvae of S. splendidus is among the smallest larvae of marine fish, on average only 1. 5 mm. The high vulnerability of pre-feeding larvae to handling stress and advent environmental conditions make their rearing even more difficult. A series of experiments were conducted to improve captive breeding techniques for S. splendidus, which could also serve as a model species for ornamental marine pelagic-spawners. The present thesis consists of 9 chapters: following the first general introduction chapter (Chapter 1), the second chapter describes general materials and methods used (Chapter 2). The subsequent 6 data chapters can be largely grouped into three main themes: 1) Chapter 3, 4 and 5 focused on the first feeding preys and culturing regimes for newly hatched and early larvae of S. splendidus, and investigated the underlying mechanisms for the superior performance of copepods as live prey from the perspectives of behavioral and lipid nutrition. 2) Chapter 6 then focused on the strategy and best timing for larval prey transition from copepods/rotifers to Artemia nauplii, and subsequently to larger enriched metanauplii during the critical metamorphosis period of S. splendidus. 3) Chapters 7 and 8 finally focused on optimizing the growth rate of post-settlement S. splendidus by their feeding with enriched Artemia metanauplii containing graded concentration of two key dietary LC-PUFAs, DHA and ARA. The final chapter (Chapter 9) summarizes the main results from all data chapters and posits implications for future research directions. The experiments from Chapter 3 confirmed that S. splendidus newly hatched larvae fed on rotifers (10 mL⁻¹) alone had very low survival (3...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 280 {{species of}} decapod <b>crustaceans</b> <b>live</b> {{along the west}} coast of North America between Puget Sound and Magdalena Bay, Baja California, Mexico. Species of the shrimp {{families}} Crangonidae, Hippolytidae and Pandalidae and crabs of the Cancridae, Lithodidae, Majidae and Paguridae are particularly abundant. Many of the genera and species either are unique to the North Pacific or are found only along {{the west coast of}} North America. Compared to other marine invertebrates, decapods tend to be large and recognizable. Larger crabs, shrimp and lobsters are fished commercially for food or bait. Many species are important in food webs, feeding on small mollusks, worms, crustaceans or detritus and in turn being eaten by fishes, birds, seals or sea lions. Intertidal species have been used in behavioral or physiological research on regeneration, color changes, respiration and symbiotic relationships. Interested visitors to kelp beds and tide pools photograph and observe decapods. One must identify a species in order to study it or label its photograph. Without the needed literature or training in the anatomy of decapod crustaceans, the interested biologist must seek out the few specialists who can identify northeastern Pacific decapods. The fauna of the northeastern Pacific differs greatly at the level of genera from that of tropical regions or the western Atlantic. A person familiar with decapods of other regions may have no idea where to find information on the fauna of the northeastern Pacific, especially if the pertinent literature is in Russian. It is my hope to remedy the lack of a technical guide to decapods of the warm and cold temperate regions of the northeastern Pacific.

40|$|Effective {{methods of}} {{traceability}} are urgently required {{for use in}} research {{as well as in}} different types of aquaculture operations and to control trade in aquatic animals and products. In regard to the marking of fish, many different tagging methods have been described and the method to be used depends on the purpose and need for tagging. In contrast, for molluscs and crustaceans, only a few methods of marking such animals have been described, due to the practical difficulties. The authors first describe the different methods for tracing fish and fishery products, by means of external tags, such as Floy tags, Carlin tags and passive integrated transponder tags; chemical marking using inorganic substances such as silver nitrate or potassium nitrate, pigments, oxytetracycline, etc.; and several different types of electronic devices in which basic information such as the strain of fish, farm of origin or weight can be stored. Genetic traceability using deoxyribonucleic acid profiling is developing quite rapidly for cultured brood stocks and wild populations. This technique may be used with very high degrees of confidence to assign to or exclude animals or products from their claimed origin, paternity or strain, and may be used as evidence in court proceedings. The second section of this paper describes the traceability of live molluscs for restocking and for human consumption. In these applications, genetic markers have been demonstrated to be suitable. Mechanical tagging on a small scale for research purposes has also been used. Otherwise, the only means of tracing live molluscs are the movement documents and the labelling on boxes that certifies the origin of the commodity. The third section describes the methods available for tracing <b>live</b> and dead <b>crustaceans.</b> A large variety of physical tagging methods for decapod crustaceans is described, such as the injection of biological stains (fast green, Niagara sky blue, trypan red and blue) and external tags such as coloured streamer tags, wire tags and a variety of anchor tags. Furthermore, a number of different internal coding methods, such as the coded micro-wire tags and injected elastomer tags are discussed in detail. As is the case for fish, genetic molecular techniques are also applied in population studies of crustaceans; some of the molecular genetic methods are described. Prawns for human consumption are most frequently packed whole or as tails after the necessary sorting, washing and freezing and the only way of performing a traceback is through documents relating to movement, invoices, health certificates and labelling of the boxes. The minimum requirements for labelling would be the content of the packages, i. e. species, quantity, identification of the manufacturer (name and address), packing place, importer/exporter or vendor of the product, in addition to the loading bill number.
