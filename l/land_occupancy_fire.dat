40|$|High <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> {{for farming}} {{activity}} {{particularly in the}} upstream area was causing land degradation problem in many tropical watersheds. Land cultivation without good agricultural practice was resulting disasters in the downstream during wet season in form of debris flow flood and sedimentation and in dry season in form of drought. Land conservation practices are required to conserve the function of watershed as rain water catchment area. Information about degradation level in the watershed is required for determining conservation strategies. This study was focusing on degradation level assessment in watershed scale by using Geographic Information System GIS in a tropical watershed. Five indicators {{were used for the}} assessment such as soil erosion farm <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> index vegetation coverage index sediment delivery ratio and land slope average. The assessment was performed by applying scoring and weighting factor in each indicator. All parameters were analyzed using data from various sources. The result showed that indicator of farm <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> index and vegetation coverage index has bad category. Meanwhile soil erosion land slope index and sediment delivery ratio has good category respectively. Total score of indicators was 2. 6 means that the watershed was in moderate degradation level. GIS provides a good tool for degradation level assessment in the sub watershed scale...|$|R

On April 7, 2014, Pierre Moreau was re-elected for a third consecutive term in Châteauguay in an election where the Liberals formed a majority government. On April 23, 2014, Philippe Couillard named him Minister of Municipal Affairs and <b>Land</b> <b>Occupancy</b> and Minister responsible for the Montérégie region.|$|R
50|$|The first regular <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> {{began in}} 1673 when French settlers, {{along with the}} allied Natives, built a {{fortified}} storehouse in present-day Johnstown, then called La Veille Gallette. The storehouse was situated {{on the shores of}} Old Breeches River, now called Johnstown Creek, and was used to hold supplies headed upriver to fur trading posts such as Fort Frontenac (Now, Kingston). It was in use until 1758.|$|R
50|$|Resulting from this, The Valuation Office {{was set up}} {{to assess}} and record the value of each property. The result was a {{nationwide}} survey of all workshops, houses, farms etc., which recorded details such as the owner, occupier, value and the number of rooms of each property. The surveyors used Ordnance Survey maps to identify each property and then enter the detailed information into 'Field Books'. These records are useful for exploring land values, land ownership and <b>land</b> <b>occupancy.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1975, Brody {{resigned}} {{from his position}} in the Canadian Civil Service. He was then based at the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, where he became an Honorary Associate. In 1976-78 {{he worked on the}} Inuit <b>Land</b> Use and <b>Occupancy</b> Project, in the Northwest Territories, where he was co-ordinator for the land use mapping carried out in the North Baffin region. He also assembled an Arctic-wide account of Inuit perceptions of <b>land</b> <b>occupancy,</b> building a collage of Inuit voices from all the communities of the Northwest Territories. He later worked on a similar project with Inuit and settlers of Labrador, which was published in Our Footsteps Are Everywhere (1978).|$|R
40|$|Cadastres, <b>Land</b> <b>Occupancy,</b> and the Ancient Countryside Ancient {{geometrical}} land {{divisions are}} being identified in increasing numbers. Technological advances (coherent light filtering and automatically-drawn modular grids) and new methods (rigorous choice of criteria for orientation and modules) have improved our knowledge in this area. The results obtained in Italy and Gaul in particular reveal the great morphological diversity of land-division {{systems and the}} flexibility of their application. Because of its widespread success, the Roman centuriation into 20 -actus units is the most striking system. Each conquest and regional planning project featured specific modes of territorial organization and patterns of <b>land</b> <b>occupancy.</b> These modes and patterns reveal the adaptability and variety of cadastres, which served as sophisticated and efficient instruments for organizing {{all the elements of}} a territory. As normative and restrictive frameworks for the local population, cadastral grids paved the way for systematic control of space and landscapes. They created tangible matrixes that had a deep influence on human behavior, left lasting imprints on the collective imagination, and are still embedded in the vestiges being analyzed today.

25|$|Whatever {{the case}} may be, the system founded on private {{property}} ended up dominating {{at the expense of}} the concession-based system, which was further threatened by the development of the colonat partiaire, a form of metayage specific to the French outre-mer, inspired by slavery and not abolished until 2006. These new forms of <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> signalled, when the ensuing transactions were made, an approach of economic opportunism rather than geographic logic.

30|$|Not {{only the}} excess of {{existing}} under-performing buildings {{but also the}} aversion that has come about in Europe towards sprawl and ever-extending urbanised areas, will definitely confirm the shifts {{in the role of}} the architect in this aspect. He will be concentrating on the improvement of present urban areas instead of creating newly built environments. Increasing density, complexity and compactness in cities will be the big-scale variant of renovating houses. That also will be an expression of enhancing sustainability, now through the reduction of transportation, higher efficiency, more social cohesion and less <b>land</b> <b>occupancy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Until {{measures}} such as the Reform Acts of 1832 and 1867, the electoral franchise was very restricted. In the 1826 General Election, there were nine people eligible to vote due to their freehold interests in Amble, of which six actually lived there; another voter lived in Amble but was enfranchised due to freehold interests held elsewhere. Twelve voters living in Amble qualified as freeholders or through <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> in the 1841 election, whilst another lived there but qualified due to property held elsewhere, and one lived elsewhere but held qualifying property in the township.|$|R

5000|$|The {{power of}} {{indigenous}} counter-mapping can be exemplified {{through the creation}} of Nunavut. In 1967, Frank Arthur Calder and the Nisaga’a Nation Tribal Council brought an action against the Province of British Columbia for a declaration that aboriginal title to specified land had not been lawfully extinguished. In 1973, the Canadian Supreme Court found that there was, in fact, an aboriginal title. The Canadian government attempted to extinguish such titles by negotiating treaties with the people who had not signed them. As a first step, the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada studied Inuit <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> in the Arctic, resulting in the publication of the Inuit <b>Land</b> Use and <b>Occupancy</b> Project. Diverse interests, such as those of hunters, trappers, fishermen and berry-pickers mapped out the land they had used during their lives. As Usher noted: ...|$|R

40|$|Urban fringe {{natural areas}} {{on public land}} are {{important}} resources for tourism and recreation use. However these contested areas are also in demand {{for a range of}} other land uses. How the land is managed can strongly influence opportunities for nature based tourism and recreation, and the benefits that these bring to participants and host communities. This paper examines the case of tourism and recreation access to the forested urban fringe of Perth, Western Australia (WA) using a typology of <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> and management priorities originally devised for private land use. A review of legislation and policy relating to tourism and recreation access to land in WA was conducted. Tourism and recreation groups and land managers associated with access to the Perth urban fringe natural areas were interviewed regarding their perceptions of land access management. Most land in the WA study area is publically owned and is therefore technically accessible to the public. In regions dominated by multiple private land owners such as Europe and the UK, varying approaches to land use management may be classified according to a predictable <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> typology that tends to be consistently applied. By contrast, the single public land holder in this area of WA, the State Government, lacks consistency in its approach to recreational and tourist access to land. This creates both public and governmental uncertainty and confusion regarding where and how land may be accessed on the Perth urban fringe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{green tree frog}} is {{native to}} {{northern}} and eastern regions of Australia and to the lowlands of New Guinea. Distribution is limited mostly to areas with warm, wet tropical climates. Its range spans from Irian Jaya to Port Moresby, and is most abundant on Daru Island. The International Conservation Union (IUCN) suggests [...] "scattered locations" [...] in both New Guinea and Indonesia. In Australia its range extends from the Kimberley region of Western Australia through the Northern Territory and Queensland to north and central New South Wales and the extreme northeasterly part of South Australia. Its total extent of <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> is approximately 4078600 km2.|$|R
40|$|Aboriginal {{peoples in}} Canada have been mapping {{aspects of their}} {{cultures}} {{for more than a}} generation. Indians, Inuit, Métis, non-status Indians and others have called their maps by different names at various times and places: land use and occupancy; <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> and use; traditional use; traditional land use and occupancy; current use; cultural sensitive areas; and so on. I use “land use and occupancy mapping” in a generic sense to include all the above. The term refers to the collection of interview data about traditional use of resources and <b>occupancy</b> of <b>lands</b> by First Nation persons, and the presentation of those data in map form. Think of it as the geography of oral tradition, or as the mapping of cultural and resource geography. (PDF contains 81 pages. ...|$|R
50|$|The Horns Bridge that {{replaced}} the original (1840) brick arch in 1932 still carries the mainline over Hasland Road. The road is, however, closed to traffic, that having diverted onto the Hasland Bypass (A617) {{before reaching the}} roundabout. Today the only indication that the LD&ECR's massive engineering, <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> and buildings ever existed West of Horns Bridge is some blue brickwork beside this bridge, shown on an attached photograph. To the East of Horns Bridge the remnants of an embankment and cutting at Spital give {{some idea of the}} scale and cost of that undertaking. The GCR's Chesterfield Loop leaves no trace either, though the year stone from the construction of the tunnel has been restored by kindred spirits at the Chesterfield Canal.|$|R
40|$|This study {{suggests}} that cultural acknowledgement of the integral partnership between a human community and the environment it inhabits {{is central to the}} development of positive human-environment relationships. The comparison of two community environmental projects illustrates cultural implications of human <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> through comparisons of their governing land use institutions as well as social and individual experiences. In the Paakumshumwaau-Wemindji project environmental responsibility is strongly motivated by the interaction of shared cosmological understandings with direct experience in the landscape. The creation of Edgewater Park in suburban Pointe Claire is a clear indication of community environmental responsibility working its way towards new partnerships with lakeshore ecological communities. The fundamental difference in these partnerships inheres however in the distinct ways the two human communities understand the voice of the non-human elements within the partnership...|$|R
5000|$|Freeman's {{earliest}} {{effort was}} to help get trees planted on the street where she lived. Responding to the invasion of nightlife in Little Italy, Freeman mobilized the community, researching and arguing before the local community board. She also worked with the Houston/Broadway MTA Station fight and the DeSalvio Park renovation. When the neighborhood was threatened with a Las Vegas-style burlesque cabaret, she spearheaded the community's successful opposition. Freeman’s research identified application plans that failed to adhere to DOB and SLA regulations, nonconformance to Certificates of <b>Occupancy,</b> <b>fire</b> codes, work without permits, and ADA law. Working in collaboration with Sook Ling Lai, Director of UPK of NY Board of Education Chinatown Head Start and Robin Goldberg, now a CB2 Manhattan Board Member, she monitored new liquor license applications at CB2, informed and mobilized the community when these proposals were projected to be disruptive to neighbors.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{advantages}} including strong adaptability {{to complex}} terrain, low <b>land</b> <b>occupancy,</b> moderate freight volume and low construction cost, straddle-type monorail transportation systems have already {{become the first}} choice of urban railway systems in small–medium cities, mountainous cities and cities with topographic and geological complexity [1]. The straddle-type monorail vehicle is mainly supported, guided and stabilized by a single-track beam. The vehicle straddles and runs on the track beam, with the center of gravity of its body located above the track. Comparing to traditional railway vehicles, the running gears of straddle-type monorail vehicles use rubber tires, with guide wheels and steady wheels set {{on both sides of the}} track beam. The track beam has a simple structure, playing the roles of bearing structure and track structure. Thus, the performance of the structure can be fully maximized while the maintenance workload of the track beam is of little requirement [2].|$|R
40|$|The idea of microcirculation {{transportation}} {{was proposed}} to shunt heavy traffic on arterial roads through branch roads. The optimization model for designing micro-circulation transportation network {{was developed to}} pick out branch roads as traffic-shunting channels and determine their required capacity, trying to minimize the total reconstruction expense and <b>land</b> <b>occupancy</b> subject to saturation and reconstruction space constraints, while accounting for the route choice behaviour of network users. Since micro-circulation transportation network design problem includes both discrete and continuous variables, a discretization method was developed to convert two groups of variables (discrete variables and continuous variables) into one group of new discrete variables, transforming the mixed network design problem into {{a new kind of}} discrete network design problem with multiple values. The genetic algorithm was proposed to solve the new discrete network design problem. Finally a numerical example demonstrated the efficiency of the model and algorithm...|$|R

The professional planner is concerned with, as expressed in the American Institute of Planner's Constitution: "The planning of the unified development of urban communi-ties and their environs; and of states, regions and the nation [...] " Yet this author, after examining the general performance record of physical planning, must conclude that the comprehensive arrangement of national land uses and national <b>land</b> <b>occupancy,</b> and the regulation thereof, is still in a shocking and sorely underdeveloped condition {{while the rest of the}} profession has been advancing, especially on the urban scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to map the <b>land</b> use and <b>occupancy</b> classes and to analyze and quantify the structural changes of scenery, between the years 1970 and 2007, surrounding the Conservation Unit (UC) Private reservation of natural patrimony (PRNP) Cafundó, through the use of landscape ecology indexes. With the land use and occupation map itwas possible to characterize quantitatively, in terms of area, the present classes in the surroundings of the reservation. On the 37 evaluated years there were a few changes in the <b>land</b> use and <b>occupancy</b> surrounding the unit, with the areas mostly dominated by grazing. Landscape ecology metrics or indexes were obtained through the Patch Analyst extension by landscape and class level, and values were obtained for the 10 classes of <b>land</b> use and <b>occupancy.</b> The results of quantitative analysis by the use of metrics pointed to an increase in the fragmentation of the landscape surrounding the Units of Preservation PRNP Cafundó...|$|R
40|$|The {{cost of the}} {{electricity}} generated from onshore wind is assessed through a method based on an estimation of the geographical distribution of the technical potential and a cost structure for the estimation of the local unit cost. Generation-cost curves are then employed to portray {{the evolution of the}} specific generating cost with the increase of the generated energy, until the limit of the technical potential is reached. The study also relates the energy cost to the <b>land</b> <b>occupancy,</b> the installed power and the capacity factor, and includes an assessment of the interplay between land usage and the cost of wind electricity. An analysis is presented to determine the uncertainty in the costs of the several model parameters. The method is applied to Spain, and allows to establish that, for an electricity-generation level of 300 Â TWÂ h/y (roughly equal to the overall demand in Spain in 2008), the specific marginal cost is around 8. 5 Â c[euro]/kWÂ h.

40|$|The {{problem of}} price {{scissors}} difference between industrial products and agricultural products {{is one of}} the important problems in China. It impacts not only the living standard improvement of farmers but also the economic value of cultivated land, furthermore results in the direct and indirect loss of cultivated land resources. China's cultivated land area has decreased dramatically in recent years. An important reason for the decrease is the relatively low cost of cultivated <b>land</b> <b>occupancy,</b> which results from the distortion of economic value of cultivated land due to the existence of scissors difference. This study firstly analyzed the dynamic change of scissors difference and calculated the absolute and relative magnitude of scissors difference from 1997 to 2002, then computed the economic value of cultivated land before and after scissors difference adjustment in 2002, and finally discussed the inverted scissors difference. Results suggest that the scissors difference has a remarkable impact on the economic value of cultivated land, and the adjustment of scissors difference even inverted scissors difference to the economic value of cultivated land is indispensable...|$|R
