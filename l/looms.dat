5000|$|The Roberts <b>Loom</b> was a {{cast-iron}} power <b>loom</b> introduced by Richard Roberts in 1830. It {{was the first}} <b>loom</b> that was more viable than a hand <b>loom,</b> it was easily adjustable and reliable thus widely used in Lancashire cotton industry.|$|R
50|$|A Dandy <b>loom</b> was a hand <b>loom,</b> that {{automatically}} ratchetted the take-up beam. Each time the weaver moved the sley to beat-up the weft, a rachet and pawl mechanism advanced the cloth roller. In 1802 William Ratcliffe of Stockport patented a Dandy <b>loom</b> with a cast-iron frame. It was {{this type of}} Dandy <b>loom</b> {{that was used in}} the small dandy <b>loom</b> shops.|$|R
50|$|From pre-history {{through the}} early middle ages, for most of Europe, the Near East and North Africa, two main types of <b>loom</b> {{dominate}} textile production. These are the warp-weighted <b>loom</b> and the two-beam <b>loom.</b> The length of the cloth beam determined {{the width of the}} cloth woven upon it, and could be as wide as 2-3 meters. The second <b>loom</b> type is the two-beam <b>loom.</b> Early woven clothing was often made of full <b>loom</b> widths draped, tied, or pinned in place.|$|R
5|$|As of 2013 {{there were}} just nine {{commercial}} woollen mills still in operation, often run by small families producing traditional Welsh cloth on old <b>looms.</b>|$|E
5|$|More {{information}} {{is known about}} the <b>looms</b> used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk. It repeatedly claims the Chinese <b>looms</b> to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the draw loom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BCE, four-shafted <b>looms</b> and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades.|$|E
5|$|Power <b>looms</b> {{introduced}} in the early 19th century {{put an end to}} the last remnants of the domestic system in Crompton, but not without resistance. Weavers and spinners were paid according to the amount of cloth they produced; independent hand loom weavers saw a drop in their income, and could not compete with the mechanised mass production that was gathering pace in the township. Luddites rioted in the township in 1826, smashing 24power <b>looms</b> at Clegg's mill at High Crompton in protest against their worsening standard of living.|$|E
50|$|The Rainbow <b>Loom</b> is {{a plastic}} {{pegboard}} measuring 2 in by 8 in. It has push pin-type pegs over which small, colored rubber bands are looped and pulled by a rainbow <b>loom</b> crochet hook. The resulting looped knots, known as Brunnian links, can be assembled on the <b>loom</b> into bracelets and other shapes. The Rainbow <b>Loom</b> kit includes the <b>loom</b> (the pegboard), a rainbow <b>loom</b> hook, 24 special C-shaped clips to connect {{both ends of}} the bracelet, and 600 small rubber bands in assorted colors.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Ng {{worked with}} The Beadery and Toner Plastics {{to produce the}} Wonder <b>Loom,</b> a {{redesigned}} version of the Rainbow <b>Loom</b> that {{is made in the}} United States. The Wonder <b>Loom</b> is sold by Wal-Mart. In April 2014, Ng released a travel-sized version of the Rainbow <b>Loom</b> called the 'Monster Tail,' which allows simple bracelets to be made on only 8 pegs, arranged in a rectangle. In September 2014 Ng introduced a finger <b>loom</b> in response to complaints that children were unable to manipulate the tightly-woven rubber bands on the regular <b>loom.</b> The finger <b>loom</b> is a travel-sized <b>loom</b> with four pegs arranged in a diamond shape. It is similar to the Monster Tail and is designed to make the same style of bracelets, but the pegs are wide enough to let users pull bands over with their fingers, instead of with a hook that the other Rainbow <b>Loom</b> products require. The travel <b>loom</b> is fitted with a clip that can be attached to bracelets or to clothing or a rucksack.|$|R

5|$|Globe Town was {{established}} from 1800 {{to provide for}} the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green, attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 <b>looms</b> being operated in people's own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these <b>looms</b> had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.|$|E
5|$|Mill {{owners were}} not always men. There are records of three women mill owners in Wales in 1840, Mary Powell with 16 <b>looms</b> and 8 men, Ann Harris with 14 {{employees}} including 6 men, and Ann Whiled with 9 employees.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of spinning and weaving in late prehistoric houses throughout Britain, particularly in the later first millennium B.C.. Finds include scraps of fabric, loom-weights, spindle-whorls and bone needles, and the arrangement of post-holes may indicate they supported <b>looms.</b>|$|E
40|$|Direct {{manipulation}} of optical <b>looming</b> provides convincing {{evidence of the}} contribution of optical <b>looming</b> in estimating time-to-collision (TTC). Precise {{manipulation of}} optical <b>looming</b> cues can be easily accomplished through computational scaling of (real or virtual) objects without impinging upon the naturalness of the task. This paper first discusses three ways to manipulate optical <b>looming</b> by scaling object size in order to influence perception of TTC. Then two principles affecting the implementation of optical <b>looming</b> manipulation are addressed. Next by revisiting the data of previous research, influences {{of knowledge about the}} optical <b>looming</b> manipulation and practice on the effect of optical <b>looming</b> manipulation are discussed. This supports our proposed principles and confirms the possibility of introducing the concept of optical <b>looming</b> manipulation into actual automobile design. Finally a potential application of optical <b>looming</b> manipulation, a dynamic brake light system, is proposed for automobile driving, to reduce the frequency of rear-end collisions. Issues in implementation of such a system and future research to validate it are also identified...|$|R

50|$|The Crompton <b>Loom</b> {{evolved from}} {{multiple}} acquisitions of patents throughout the 1850s and 1860s. Furbush and Crompton held multiple other patents that improved the “narrow looms”, such as double reverse motion improvements. James Greenhalgh patented the first open-shed <b>loom</b> in 1852, but in 1857 the patent {{was found to}} be too close to William Crompton’s power fancy <b>loom,</b> and therefore the Greenhalgh <b>Loom</b> patent was disallowed. William Crompton’s patent expired the next year, and when it did, Crompton and Furbush purchased the rights to the Greenhalgh <b>Loom,</b> improved it in several ways, and called it the Crompton <b>Loom.</b> This 1857 version of the <b>loom</b> would improve again, however, until it became {{one of the best in}} the world at the Paris Exhibition in 1867, and later would become the standard fancy cotton <b>loom</b> of the United States (around 1870).|$|R
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{the growth of}} {{industry}} meant {{the majority of the}} area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power <b>looms.</b> Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many factory workers were children under 12years of age.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{there were}} 32 soap {{factories}} and 400 <b>looms</b> exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity — to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, {{as well as}} linen, cotton, and wool textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus <b>looms</b> larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cities in}} Poland now have {{memorials}} to the massacre in public spaces {{as well as}} within churches and cemeteries. For example, in Wrocław, a composition by Polish sculptor Tadeusz Tchórzewski {{is dedicated to the}} Katyn victims. Unveiled in 2000, it is located in a park east of the city's centre, near the Racławice Panorama building. It shows the 'Matron of the Homeland' despairing over a dead soldier, while on a higher plinth the angel of death <b>looms</b> over, leaning forward on a sword.|$|E
5|$|New {{settlements}} appearing {{along the}} rivers Mureş, Someş, and Târnava reflects {{a period of}} tranquility in Gepidia until around 568. The common people in Biharia, Cenad, Moreşti, and other villages lived in sunken huts covered with gabled roofs but with no hearths or ovens. They were primarily farmers, but <b>looms,</b> combs, and other products evidence the existence of local workshops. Trading contacts between Gepidia and faraway regions is evidenced by finds of amber beads and brooches manufactured in the Crimea, Mazovia or Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper {{as the road}} and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, <b>looms</b> ahead.|$|E

40|$|The <b>looming</b> {{priority}} {{refers to}} organisms&# 39; prior processing of or greater sensitivity to <b>looming</b> signals. The <b>looming</b> priority has been {{commonly found in}} visual, auditory and cross modalities and different kinds of subjects including human and animals. Humanneuroimaging studies suggest that neural substrate associated with the priority involves a massive distributed neural network coordinating and communicating to each other, including the superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction and some motor areas. The neurons and neural pathways selectively sensitive to <b>looming</b> signals {{have been found in}} many kinds of animals. The <b>looming</b> priority is explained from different perspectives, including threatening hypothesis, attentional capture hypothesis and automatic processing hypothesis.

5|$|Starting {{from the}} Long Depression (1873–1896), Lyonnais silk {{production}} had become totally industrialized, and hand <b>looms</b> were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline {{was used to}} make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated {{to the production of}} artificial silk (viscose), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.|$|E
5|$|Tapestry {{production}} {{began with}} design. The designs, or cartoons were typically executed on paper or parchment, {{put together by}} qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive. Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. <b>Looms</b> were active in all the major Flemish cities, {{in most of the}} towns and in many of the villages.|$|E
5|$|The Jacquard loom was {{immediately}} denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon {{it had become}} vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard <b>looms</b> in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E
25|$|The plain Hattersley Domestic <b>Loom</b> was {{specially}} {{developed for}} cottage or home use {{and designed to}} replace the wooden handloom; the Domestic is similar in construction to a power <b>loom.</b> It was introduced ca.1900 and the makers claimed that a speed of 160 picks per minute could be easily attained with from 2 to 8 shafts weaving a variety of fabrics. Because foot pedals, or treadles, operate the <b>loom</b> it is still classed as a handloom, but {{it is much easier}} and faster to weave as all the motions of the <b>loom</b> are connected via crankshaft and gear wheels. Because the <b>loom</b> is designed to use only one shuttle when weaving, giving a solid colour in the weft, it is termed a plain <b>loom.</b> The cast metal chair, manufactured along with the <b>loom,</b> can be raised or lowered to suit, and the seat rocks forward and back as the weaver treadles the <b>loom.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} relationship between the <b>looming</b> maladaptive style (i. e., an enduring and traitlike cognitive pattern to appraise threat as rapidly rising in risk, progressively worsening, or actively speeding up and accelerating) and three different aspects of trait social anxiety (i. e., fear of negative evaluation, social interaction anxiety, and public scrutiny fears) as well as general anxiety and depression. A large nonclinical, female-only sample (n = 152) completed the <b>Looming</b> Maladaptive Style Questionnaire–II (Riskind, J. H., Williams, N. L., Theodore, L. G., Chrosniak, L. D., & Cortina, J. M.

Multiple regression analyses indicated that social <b>looming</b> uniquely predicted fear of negative evaluation, social interaction anxiety, and public scrutiny fears, accounting for 7 %, 4 %, and 3 % of the variance, respectively. However, social <b>looming</b> did not predict depression. These findings support the <b>looming</b> model of anxiety and encourage further attention to the possible role of social <b>looming</b> as an anxiety-specific vulnerability factor in social anxiety...|$|R
