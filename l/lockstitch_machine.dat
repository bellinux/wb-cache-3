40|$|Evaluation of {{the length}} {{distribution}} of needle thread during stitch formation is necessary to determine the dynamic characteristics of a sewing machine, and the thread needed in this process. In this study, physical and mathematical models of the take-up disc are developed. The thread length for the full rotation range is determined as the geometrical distance between the active frictional barriers. The algorithm of calculations is introduced and im-plemented alternatively {{by means of the}} languages Fortran and C++, as well as by genetic algorithms. The length distribution of the needle thread obtained was verified by using simulations of the sequence and geometry of the frictional barriers, as well as experimental research of the purpose-oriented model of the take-up disc prototype.

40|$|To {{develop and}} test control methods for {{real-time}} automatic presser-foot force control in industrial sewing machines. In this work, a closed-loop controller that controls presser-foot maximum vertical displacement is presented and compared to existing solutions that adjust force depending on sewing speed. Automatic force control can reduce {{problems such as}} stitch irregularity, stitch distortions and material damage, besides making material handling easier. Design/methodology/approach An electromagnetic force actuator was integrated in an industrial <b>lockstitch</b> <b>machine.</b> A computer-based control system was designed implementing either speed-variable force control, closed-loop control, or emulating a traditional constant-force system. Maximum presser-foot displacement values were measured and analysed in relevant sewing situations, and seam quality was assessed. Findings Constant-force control does not allow optimal force setting at all speeds. Speed-variable force control is an improvement, but requires empirical setting of the speed-force relation, not always assuring optimal operation. Closed-loop control adapts force to the requirement of each sewing situation more precisely. Sewing quality is good and material handling is eased. Research limitations/implications The actuator has to be optimised regarding response time and maximum force. Some aspects in the behaviour of the control system and actuator have to be further studied. Practical implications The proposed control system enables the automatic setting and adaptation of force to all sewing situations, making material handling easier at low speeds without compromising feeding performance at high speed. The closed-loop controller {{may be used as}} teach-in system for speed-dependent control. Originality/value This is the first prototype of a closed-loop control system for presser-foot force on a lockstitch sewing machine and the first comparative study of control methods for presser-foot force control.

5000|$|The Singer Model 27 {{and later}} model 127 were {{a series of}} <b>lockstitch</b> sewing <b>machines</b> {{produced}} by the Singer Manufacturing Company from the 1880s to the 1960s.

5000|$|An {{overlock}} {{is a kind}} of stitch that sews {{over the}} edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called [...] "sergers" [...] in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a <b>lockstitch</b> sewing <b>machine</b> in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the edges of the fabric are contained within the seam.|$|R

In industries using sewing as assembly process, most processes rely on human labor, being difficult or even impossible to automate. The relations between machine configuration and adjustment, material properties, and the resulting product quality are also complex. This paper describes current work using an instrumented <b>lockstitch</b> sewing <b>machine</b> to study the dynamics and variations {{of one of the}} important process parameters during high-speed sewing of shirts: thread tensions. The objective is study the principles that may allow for an automatic setting of the machines, quality control and for real-time process control.

50|$|A {{model of}} the machine is {{exhibited}} at the London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a barbed needle which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American <b>lockstitch</b> sewing <b>machine</b> was invented by Walter Hunt in 1832. His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854. In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle {{and the use of}} two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.|$|R

Wyróżniając charakterystyczne fazy działania podciągacza, tj. zasilanie nicią oraz wybieranie nici kończące się tzw. zaciąganiem ściegu, zwrócono uwagę na warunki lokowania przeplotu w materiale i możliwość ich poprawiania poprzez budowę podciągacza. Temu celowi służyło modelowanie procesu zaciągania ściegu. Zaprojektowany i zbudowany podciągacz nici pozwolił ponad dwukrotnie obniżyć szczytowe wartości siły zaciągania ściegu, co jest znaczącym osiągnięciem techniczno-technologicznym. Ponadto spowodował spadek strat wytrzymałości nici na zrywanie. Analysis of {{literature}} {{described in the}} dissertation showed the complexity of phenomena of machine stitch creation processes. The reference to the lockstitch proves particularly difficult working conditions of needle thread. Tools forming the stitch (needle, bobbin, needle thread take-up, thread tensioner, transporter of the textile package) cause the weakening of thread inserted into the seam structure, what can lead to thread breakage. Hence, a great {{attention is paid to}} the action on thread of stitch forming mechanisms in the sewing machines. A particular role of thread take-up mechanism was stressed during discussing the process of thread control conditions by the take-up in the <b>lockstitch</b> <b>machines.</b> Characteristic working phases of the take-up were distinguished i. e., supplying by the thread and drawing of thread end during the stitch tightening. One has paid the attention to the conditions of interlacement location in the material and the possibility of correcting them by the improving the structure of the thread take-up mechanism. Changing the stitch tightening modelling process was to achieve this aim. So, a physical model, and next a mathematical model of the zone of stitch creation were elaborated. Due to the possibility of configuration of multibarrier take-ups creation a model of the stitch tightening considering the take-up disc was built. The presented results of model research required the experimental verification. The dynamic tensions in threads and the thread strength decrease after the sewing through process as well as a reaction of the take-up to changes thread length in the link of the stitch were studied. Carrying out the experimental analysis required the building the take-up disc installed on the chosen machine. Thus, {{there is a need for}} elaboration of the methodology of the take-ups disc designing using genetic algorithms as well as a classical programming in Fortan and C++ languages. The determination of requirement take-up disc configuration was preceded by a definition of the curve of the thread controlled by the take-up disc. Next, one made an estimation of defined curve of the thread controlled by take-up disc with a software called "Take-up disc 2. 0 " elaborated on the basis of genetic algorithm. The designed and built thread take-up disc allow decreasing peaks of strength of the stitch tightening over twice of the basic value, which is the significant achievement from a technical-technological point of view. Moreover, it causes the decrease of thread breaking strength losses. In the case of the take-up disc, holding the position of the interlacement in the stitch link on the set level requires the extending the part of machine working cycle corresponding to the stitch tightening in comparison to the generally used take-ups...|$|R
