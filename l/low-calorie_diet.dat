2500|$|<b>Low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> {{are also}} {{referred}} to as balanced percentage diets. Due to their minimal detrimental effects, these types of diets are most commonly recommended by nutritionists. In addition to restricting calorie intake, a balanced diet also regulates macronutrient consumption. From the total number of allotted daily calories, it is recommended that 55% should come from carbohydrates, 15% from protein, and 30% from fats with no more than 10% of total fat coming from saturated forms. For instance, a recommended 1,200 calorie diet would supply about 660 calories from carbohydrates, 180 from protein, and 360 from fat. Some studies suggest that increased consumption of protein can help ease hunger pangs associated with reduced caloric intake by increasing the feeling of satiety. Calorie restriction in this way has many long-term benefits. After reaching the desired body weight, the calories consumed per day may be increased gradually, without exceeding 2,000 net (i.e. derived by subtracting calories burned by physical activity from calories consumed). Combined with increased physical activity, <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> are thought to be most effective long-term, unlike crash diets, which can achieve short-term results, at best. Physical activity could greatly enhance the efficiency of a diet. The healthiest weight loss regimen, therefore, is one that consists of a balanced diet and moderate physical activity.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to lean protein, {{people on a}} PSMF must typically consume supplements to avoid the nutritional deficiencies inherent in such an extreme and <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet.</b> These include essential fatty acid supplements that have EHA and DHA in them (typically obtained from fish oil capsules), vitamins, and minerals typically potassium, magnesium, sodium, and calcium. A general multivitamin supplement, designed to augment a healthy diet, is inadequate - for example, someone on a PSMF needs significant amounts of minerals such as sodium and potassium. Potassium intake, for instance, has been recommended in general {{for both men and}} women to be at 4,700 mg a day [...] Lyle McDonald, in particular, recommends supplementing 3-5 g of sodium, 1 g of potassium (typically as potassium citrate), 500 mg of magnesium (magnesium citrate), and 600 mg of supplemental calcium.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Dietary modifi cation is crit-ical in obesity treatment. Energy intake must {{fall below}} energy expenditure, {{but not so}} low that excess lean tissue is lost, hunger escalates, diet quality declines, and health is compromised. Reductions in energy {{consumption}} of 500 to 1000 kilo-calories per day should result in appro-priate rates of weight loss in most obese patients. Very <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> are some-times used when excess body weight poses an acute risk, but such diets carry poten-tial for many complications, and their long-term results are often no better than <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets.</b> Macronutrient composi-tion is {{not as important as}} overall energy defi cit in terms of weight loss, so dieters have some fl exibility in choosing combi-nations that suit their preferences and needs, as long as they promote long-term healthy weight management. Diets with extremes of macronutrients are usually defi cient in micronutrients and are dif-fi cult to follow for long periods of time, so they should not be advocated. Resources for implementing dietary recommenda-tions include registered dietitians, selected Web sites, and an assortment of products and services. Patients should be guided to resources that are evidence based and do not make unrealistic promises for weight loss. Prevention of recidivism should be built into the treatment plan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveOur study {{estimated}} the cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment of obesity {{in combination with}} a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> in The Netherlands. MethodsCosts and effects of a low-calorie diet-only intervention and of a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> in combination with 1 year of orlistat were compared to no treatment. The RIVM Chronic Disease Model was used to project the differences in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime health-care costs because {{of the effects of}} the interventions on body mass index (BMI) status. This was done by linking BMI status to the occurrence of obesity-related diseases and by relating quality of life to disease status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. In univariate sensitivity analysis, we assessed how sensitive the results were to several key assumptions. ResultsIncremental costs per QALY gained were € 17, 900 for the low-calorie diet-only intervention compared to no intervention and € 58, 800 for the <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> + orlistat compared to the <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> only. Assuming a direct relation between BMI and quality of life, these ratios decreased to € 6000 per QALY gained and € 24, 100 per QALY gained. Costs per QALY gained were also sensitive to assumptions about long-term weight loss maintenance. ConclusionsCost-effectiveness ratios of interventions aiming at weight reduction depend strongly on assumptions regarding the relation between BMI and quality of life.

40|$|Background: Central obesity, a {{major public}} health concern in the Asia-Pacific region, {{is a result of}} genetic {{predisposition}} as well as epigenetic influences. Nutritional factors influence obesity, through the calorie intake and modulating gene expression. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of the efficacy of dietary interventions through clinical trials, in the management of obesity. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for 20 years ending December 30, 2014, to find metaanalyses, systematic reviews, and randomized, placebo-controlled studies for central obesity-related clinical trials. The search terms were “central obesity” and “dietary interventions” or “calorie recommendation”. All clinical trials on the effects of dietary interventions with the key outcome measures as change in BMI, waist-hip circumference and body fat were included. Results: Several dietary regimens with varying macronutrients composition are used to combat obesity, such as <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets,</b> very <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> (VLCD), low-fat diets, high-fiber diets, low-carbohydrate diets, low glycemic index (GI) diets and plant-based diets. However, very low-calorie-ketogenic and high protein diets have demonstrable significant adverse health effects. Conclusion: The studies reviewed show promise of benefits with changes in epigenetic dietary factors. To draw definite conclusions, {{there is a need for}} more long-term studies, with larger sample sizes; and clinical interventions trials, to minimize the risk of false positives and confounding factors influencing the results...|$|R

The objective was to investigate whether moderate weight loss increases the therapeutic response to topical treatment in obese patients with chronic stable plaque-type psoriasis. Material and Method. A 24 -week clinical trial was conducted in 10 patients. The efficacy of a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> with topical treatment was compared with baseline in obese patients with chronic stable plaque-type psoriasis. The primary measure of clinical response was the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index at weeks 12 and 24. Results. At week 12, the mean reduction in body weight was 9. 6 percent. There was an improvement from baseline of 50 percent or more in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index in 50 percent of the patients.

40|$|The {{effect of}} carlorie intake on the {{development}} of spontaneous mammary tumors in virgin C 3 H mice was studied. Only about 10 % of the mice fed a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> [10 kcal/day (1 kcal = 4. 184 kJ) ] since weaning developed mammary tumors, compared to about 60 % of those mice that were reared on high-calorie diets (16 kcal/day or lab chow ad lib). In order to understand the mechanism by which a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> decreases the occurrence of mammary tumors in mice, we compared the sex cycle, the amounts of circulating thyroid-stimulating hormone (thyrotropin), growth hormone, and prolactin, the production of type A and B virus particles in the mammary glands, and the morphology of the mammary glands of mice fed low- and high-calorie diets. The amount of serum prolactin and the synthesis of type A and B particles in mammary tissues of mice fed a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet</b> was markedly decreased compared to those of age-matched mice fed high-calorie diets. In addition, in young mice fed a <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diet,</b> there were fewer mammary alveolar lesions than in mice fed a high-calorie diet, although the size of the lesions was similar.

40|$|AbstractSince {{the last}} {{meeting of the}} American Heart Association, {{a great deal of}} media {{attention}} has been focused on low-carbohydrate–high-protein diets (LC-HP) and their potential impact on the practice of cardiology. It has been suggested that these diets, which were introduced originally as weight-loss regimens, also have a significantly beneficial effect on a variety of cardiovascular risk factors. It is clear that people who consume such diets have a reduced intake of calories, resulting in a predictable degree of weight loss. These diets induce a moderate level of ketosis and, in some studies, have been shown to improve the lipid profile overall. There is also a {{reduction in the number of}} low-density lipoprotein particles. However, these trends also have been observed over periods of 24 weeks or less with <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> that already have an established record of safety and efficacy. Although there is a public perception that LC-HP diets have a near-perfect “success rate,” the attrition rate on these diets varies from 20 % to 43 %, which is similar to other conventional weight-loss regimens. Additionally, from a nutritional standpoint, these diets are seriously deficient in several micronutrients and dietary fiber, thus creating a need for nutritional supplements. In contrast, the conventional weight-loss regimens have a favorable impact on serum lipids without the accompanying ketosis and have the potential to provide a nutritionally balanced diet without the need for supplements. Because of the nutritional deficiencies inherent in LC-HP diets and the absence of long-term data on their efficacy and safety, they cannot be recommended in place of currently advocated low-fat, <b>low-calorie</b> <b>diets</b> that have an established record of safety and efficacy...|$|R
