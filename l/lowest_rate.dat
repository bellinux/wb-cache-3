40|$|Abstract — <b>Low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS {{attacks are}} {{emerging}} {{threats to the}} TCP traffic, and the VoIP traffic in the Internet. They are hard to detect as they intelligently send attack traffic inside the network to evade current router based congestion control mechanisms. We propose a practical attack model in which botnets that can pose {{a serious threat to}} the Internet are considered. Under this model, an attacker can scatter bots across the Internet to launch the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack, thus essentially orchestrating the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack that uses random and continuous IP address spoofing, but with valid legitimate IP addresses. It is difficult to detect and mitigate such an attack. We propose a <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection algorithm, which relies on the core characteristic of the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack in introducing high rate traffic for short periods, and then uses a proactive test based differentiation technique to filter the attack packets. The proactive test was originally proposed to defend DDoS attacks and <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attacks which tend to ignore the normal operation of network protocols, but it is tailored here to differentiate the legitimate traffic from the <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack traffic instigated by botnets. It leverages on the conformity of legitimate flows, which obey the network protocols. It mainly differentiates legitimate connections by checking their responses to the proactive tests which include puzzles for distinguishing botnets from human users. We finally evaluate and demonstrate the performance of the proposed <b>low</b> <b>rate</b> DoS attack detection and mitigation algorithm on the real Internet traces.

In the 2012 U.S. general election, a majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state. In the same election, an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state.

5|$|The U.S. Savings and Loan {{crisis of}} the 1980s and early 1990s was the failure of 747 savings and loan {{associations}} (S) in the United States.

The accompanying slowdown in the finance industry and the real estate market may have been a contributing cause of the 1990-1991 economic recession.

5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, {{which was one of the}} safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the <b>lowest</b> <b>rate</b> of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
