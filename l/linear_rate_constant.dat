The oxidation {{was performed in}} the temperature range 1000 C to 1200 C for samples with nitrogen doping {{in the range of}} 6. 5 e 15 /cm 3 to 9. 3 e 18 /cm 3, showing a clear doping dependence. Samples with higher doping concentrations displayed higher oxidation rates. The results were interpreted using a modified Deal-Grove model. Linear and parabolic rate constants and activation energies were extracted. Increasing nitrogen led to an increase in <b>linear</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> pre-exponential factor from 10 - 6 m/s to 10 - 2 m/s and the parabolic rate constant pre-exponential factor from 10 e 9 m 2 /s to 10 e 6 m 2 /s. The increase in <b>linear</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> was attributed to defects from doping-induced lattice mismatch, which tend to be more reactive than bulk crystal regions. The increase in the diffusion-limited parabolic rate constant was attributed to degradation in oxide quality originating from the doping-induced lattice mismatch. This degradation was confirmed by the observation of a decrease in optical density of the grown oxide films from 1. 4 to 1. 24. The linear activation energy varied from 1. 6 eV to 2. 8 eV, while the parabolic activation energy varied from 2. 7 eV to 3. 3 eV, increasing with doping concentration. These increased activation energies were attributed to higher nitrogen content, leading to an increase in effective bond energy stemming from the difference in C-Si (2. 82 eV) and Si-N (4. 26 eV) binding energies. This work provides crucial information in the engineering of SiO 2 dielectrics for SiC MOS structures, which typically involve regions of very different doping concentrations, and suggests that thermal oxidation at high doping concentrations in SiC may be defect mediated.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{dynamics and}} morphology of undoped and heavily phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon films oxidized at a wide temperature and time range in dry and wet O 2 atmosphere have been investigated. It is {{shown that the}} oxidation rates of polycrystalline silicon films are {{different from that of}} single-crystal silicon when the oxidation temperature is below 1000 -degrees-C. There is a characteristic oxidation time, t(c), under which the undoped polysilicon oxide is not only thicker than that of (100) -oriented single-crystal silicon, but also thicker than that of (111) -oriented single-crystal silicon. For phosphorus-doped polycrystalline silicon films, the oxide thickness is thinner not only than that of (111) -oriented, single-crystal silicon, but also thinner than that of (100) -oriented, single-crystal silicon. According to TEM cross-sectional studies, these characteristics are due to the enhanced oxidation at grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon films.

Our analysis is consistent with other observations where the refractive index (2, 3), density (3), and interfacial stress (4) in Si 02 vary with temperature. These changes account for the apparent anomalous effect of temperature on the activation energy for the parabolic rate constant, B, reported by several in-vestigators (5 - 7). Figure i shows this effect in an Arrhenius plot of these data (5 - 8). The activation energy varies from 0. 9 eV at I 150 ~ to 2. 6 eV at 780 ~ Recent experiments by Irene (i) shed considerable light on the mechanism for this change in activation energy. He grew oxides in dry 02 at 1000 ~ to l~m thick-nesses, then recorded oxidation rates for subsequent oxidations at lower temperatures. The rates measured at lower temperatures should have therefore exhibited the proper-ties of a "I 000 ~ ' oxide, so long as the lower temperature oxidations did not signifi-cantly affect their structure. In a reanalysis of Irene's data, using an improved lag time formulation, we indeed observe this effect (9).

Thermodynamic analysis showed that, in such mixtures, the partial pressure of oxygen lies in the range of 10 (- 23) to 10 (- 20) bar for temperature between 700 and 900 degrees C and that the formation of solid carbon may take place in several conditions.

However, when the temperature reaches 900 degrees C, cracks and pores appear in the oxide scale, carbon can precipitate and diffuse easier than at 800 degrees C and may lead to internal carbide formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{understand}} whether previous styrene exposure {{increases the}} human liver's ability to convert styrene into styrene oxide. METHODS: The hypothesis was tested {{that the average}} <b>linear</b> metabolic <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> kappa was the same in both exposed and unexposed groups, when the exposed group comprised people {{with a history of}} styrene exposure and the unexposed group had no exposure. In an experimental chamber, these two groups of subjects were exposed to a concentration of 80 ppm styrene for two hours. A three compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to define kappa. Based on large sample theory, the comparison of estimated mean values of kappa in the exposed and unexposed groups was shown to be equivalent to a comparison of the estimated mean values of the hepatic clearance X in the two groups. A method was developed to estimate X for each subject in both groups from the subject's height, weight, and estimated asymptotic styrene decay constant alpha. Here, alpha was estimated individually from observed blood concentrations over time when sufficient time had elapsed after the controlled exposure. RESULTS: The proposed methodology of comparing the estimated mean values of kappa in exposed and unexposed groups reduced the number of specific physiological variables involved to three, all of which were estimable from data based on simple direct measurements. In contrast, other methods based on pharmacokinetic models usually involved many variables that were non-estimable on an individual basis. Consequently, statistical comparisons were impossible. These methods were applied to analyse previously published data on the time course of styrene concentrations in arterial blood of subjects in both exposed and unexposed groups. A Wilcoxon non-parametric rank sum test with the individually estimated X values was used, and {{no significant difference in the}} means of X in the two groups was found. CONCLUSION: The <b>linear</b> metabolic <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> kappa for humans is probably not altered by previous exposure to styrene.

The corrosion weight gain exhibited an initial <b>linear</b> <b>rate</b> law region followed by a parabolic rate law one. The rate for both regions was influenced by both relative humidity and O 2 partial pressure. The electrochemical oxidation process of Cu might occur under an adsorbed water layer. It is considered that the water adsorbed as clusters and that Cu oxidation progressed under the water cluster, the thickness and surface coverage of which varied with relative humidity. The rough estimation revealed that the kinetic constants for both first <b>linear</b> <b>rate</b> and parabolic rate laws {{is proportional to the}} ratio of surface coverage by water cluster. However, the <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> is independent of R. H., if normalized by the area of water clusters...|$|R
40|$|Potassium current {{inactivation}} and reactivation in squid axons {{were measured}} from tail current amplitudes after voltage clamp prepulses to the potassium equilibrium potential, EK, in seawater containing {{elevated levels of}} potassium ion concentration, Ko. Little or no inactivation resulted with prepulses lasting less than 100 ms. Longer pulses caused the current to inactivate in two phases, one between 0. 1 and 1 s, and a second phase between 5 and 100 s. Inactivation was incomplete. The time constant of the tail current after a prepulse to EK was independent of pulse duration (0. 1 - 120 s). Inactivation was independent of Ko (10 {{less than or equal}} to Ko {{less than or equal to}} 300 mM), and it was independent of membrane potential, V, for - 40 less than or equal to V less than or equal to 0 mV. Reactivation was measured with a three-pulse protocol. The reactivation time course was sigmoidal with a delay of approximately 100 ms before significant reactivation occurred. These results were described by a model consisting of three inactivated states arranged in a <b>linear</b> sequence. The <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of the model are of the form (A + B exp (CV), or 1 /(A + B exp (CV], which are required to describe the non-inactivating conductance component...|$|R
