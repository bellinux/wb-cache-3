40|$|Background: Children with poorer <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> {{are more}} likely to show externalizing {{behavior}} problems, as well as to become rejected by their peers. Peer rejection has also been found to affect the development of externalizing behavior. This study explored the role of peer rejection in the link between <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> and the development of externalizing behavior. Methods: Six hundred and fifteen (615) children were followed from kindergarten to grade 4. Receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> were measured with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test in grade 2. Teachers reported externalizing behavior and peer reports of social rejection were measured annually. Results: Children with poorer receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> showed increasing externalizing behavior, while children with better receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> showed decreases in externalizing behavior. Children with poorer receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> experienced peer rejection most frequently. The link between receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> and the development of externalizing behavior was mediated by the development of peer rejection. Findings suggested that this mediational link applied mostly to boys. Conclusion: Children with poorer <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> are at increased risk of becoming rejected by mainstream peers, which adds to the development of externalizing behavior. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|Companies in Finland {{are looking}} {{more and more}} for {{employees}} with diverse <b>language</b> <b>skills,</b> however Finnish students have been studying languages less over the past few decades. As a consequence, {{there seems to be an}} imbalance on the current job market. Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate how companies and individuals may answer to the lack in <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> through in-house <b>language</b> training and expatriation. Hence, the focus of this study was the effect of language training and expatriation on <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> and consequently, the effect of <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> on employee career path. The study was conducted as a single case study using a mixed-method approach in the context of the case company Wärtsilä Finland Oy. The qualitative data was collected through four interviews with HR and supervisors as well as from open-ended answers from a survey directed to the employees. The qualitative data was complemented with quantitative survey data regarding the effectiveness of language training and expatriation on <b>language</b> <b>skills.</b> There were altogether 115 employees who answered to the survey, out of which 84 have had participated in language training and 37 have had been on expatriation. According to the results, it appears that <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> are improved thanks to the language training but the participants are still not fully able to communicate effectively in work related situations in a foreign language. However, willingness to communicate does not always correlate with the actual competence. On the other hand, expatriation seems to have mainly a positive effect on employee <b>language</b> <b>skills,</b> although one respondent has stated that her <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> have actually gotten worse due to expatriation. Compared to language training participants, the expatriates were, on average, more confident when communicating in a foreign language in work related situations. Based on the results, <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> have affected employee career paths in various ways in Wärtsilä Finland Oy. Lack of <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> may have had a negative impact on recruitment, international relations as well as networking opportunities. On the other hand, <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> may have helped the individual to get a desired position and enabled them to work in global teams and abroad. Moreover, <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> may have helped individuals to work more efficiently and facilitate communication and networking with colleagues. On another note, contradicting some earlier studies, ultimately, <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> do not seem to have a significant impact on the salary. Furthermore, the importance of English, the official business language of Wärtsilä, and Swedish <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> (due to the location in a bilingual region) were often highlighted in the answers.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the longitudinal trajectory linking childhood receptive <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> to psychosocial outcomes in later life. METHODS: The study comprised 6941 men and women who participated in a nationally representative Birth Cohort Study. Direct assessment of <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> were made at age 5. The sample was studied again at age 34 to assess psychosocial outcomes and levels of adult mental health. Characteristics of the family environment, individual adjustment, and social adaptation in the transition to adulthood were assessed as potential moderating factors linking early <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> to adult mental health. RESULTS: In early childhood, cohort members with poor receptive language experienced more disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances than cohort members with normal <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> and showed more behavior and psychosocial adjustment problems in the transition to adulthood. At age 34, cohort members with poor early <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> reported lower levels of mental health than cohort members with normal language.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to gain insight into "language as a {{professional}} competence" and its role in employees working life and jobs. The context of the research is Finland, specifically Western Finland, where a lot of Swedish-speakers reside. The main objective is to investigate the effects of <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> on employees' working life and do the perceived <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> of the individuals impact the results. The study aims to hear the voice of the employees and understand whether <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> play a role in their career paths in Finland. The chosen method was to use qualitative content analysis as it provided the most suitable tool for evaluating individuals' perceptions of the effect of <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> in their working lives. A survey was sent to the Levón Institute in Vaasa, and the qualitative responses were analyzed in depth. Different categories and subcategories were found with the help of coding, i. e. the author identified in which ways <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> were perceived to affect individuals' working lives and jobs (e. g. categories such as "getting recruited", "receiving tasks" and "attending training" were found). The findings show that <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> have clear effects on employees' working life in Finland. Ultimately <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> were found to impact individuals' job opportunities, skills development, task diversity and work relationships. Being proficient in both national languages (Finnish and Swedish) and in the official business language (English) helped the individuals to be successful in their jobs and receive more responsibility at work. A central theme was "language anxiety" and "courage to use languages", which portrayed how closely tied <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> are to confidence. The language proficiency levels of the respondents affected the perceptions: people who had high proficiency levels saw the positive effects, whereas people with low proficiency levels did not believe <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> mattered that much in their working life or jobs. In sum, <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> can be considered as an essential skill set for employees in Finland, especially if one wants to receive interesting international tasks and responsibility.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of the agency and professional Finnish <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> of international nursing students studying in an English-medium degree program in Finland. The study draws on sociocognitive and ecological perspectives to examine the social nature of language and its use. This ethnographic theoretical-methodological orientation helps to analyze both subjectively experienced and collectively emergent factors. This longitudinal, multidisciplinary, and multimethodological study examines how the professional <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> and agency of international nursing students develop during their practical training. More specifically, the focus is on the situated and experienced development. The focus is also on the interrelation of the key concepts: agency, professional <b>language</b> <b>skills,</b> positions and the resources of the environment. Relevant pedagogical issues are also discussed. The findings of the four substudies are reported in four research articles. The data of my substudies consist of media texts, as well as interviews with international nursing students, teachers, and hospital staff. Interaction data between the student and the mentors are also included. The data are analyzed using dialogical analysis of beliefs, narrative analysis, nexus analysis, and dialogical interaction analysis. The findings show that professional <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> are embodied, distributed, and stratified in time and space. Professional <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> are situational skills to perceive and use the affordances of the work environment. The development of professional <b>language</b> <b>skills</b> is seen as an expansion of the operational environment. However, weak labor market positions as well as positioning in interaction affect the students’ opportunities to exercise agency and promote professional Finnish <b>language</b> <b>skills.</b> Therefore, positions are closely linked to the development of agency and professional <b>language</b> <b>skills.</b> In order to support students’ second language agency, flexible study plans and guidance practices should be established.
