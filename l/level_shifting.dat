5000|$|A digital {{use of a}} {{push-pull}} configuration is the output of TTL and related families. The upper transistor is functioning as an active pull-up, in linear mode, while the lower transistor works digitally. For this reason they are not capable of supplying as much current as they can sink (typically 20 times less). Because of the way these circuits are drawn schematically, with two transistors stacked vertically, normally with a <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> diode in between, they are called [...] "totem pole" [...] outputs. A disadvantage of simple push-pull outputs is that {{two or more of}} them cannot be connected together, because if one tried to pull while another tried to push, the transistors could be damaged. To avoid this restriction, some push-pull outputs have a third state in which both transistors are switched off. In this state, the output is said to be floating (or, to use a proprietary term, tri-stated).|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{time series}} model which is {{stationary}} {{apart from a}} single shift in mean. If the time of a <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is known, the least squares estimator {{of the magnitude of}} this <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is a minimum variance unbiased estimator. If the time is unknown, however, this estimator is biased. Here, we first carry out extensive simulation studies to determine the relationship between the bias and three parameters of our time series model: the true magnitude of the <b>level</b> <b>shift,</b> the true time point and the autocorrelation of adjacent observations. Thereafter, we use two generalized additive models to generalize the simulation results. Finally, we examine to what extent the bias can be reduced by multiplying the least squares estimator with a shrinkage factor.

50|$|The DTL circuit {{shown in}} the picture {{consists}} of three stages: an input diode logic stage (D1, D2 and R1), an intermediate <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> stage (R3 and R4), and an output common-emitter amplifier stage (Q1 and R2). If both inputs A and B are high (logic 1; near V+), then the diodes D1 and D2 are reverse biased. Resistors R1 and R3 will then supply enough current to turn on Q1 (drive Q1 into saturation) and also supply the current needed by R4. There will be a small positive voltage {{on the base of}} Q1 (VBE, about 0.3 V for germanium and 0.6 V for silicon). The turned on transistor's collector current will then pull the output Q low (logic 0; VCE(sat), usually less than 1 volt). If either or both inputs are low, then {{at least one of the}} input diodes conducts and pulls the voltage at the anodes to a value less than about 2 volts. R3 and R4 then act as a voltage divider that makes Q1's base voltage negative and consequently turns off Q1. Q1's collector current will be essentially zero, so R2 will pull the output voltage Q high (logic 1; near V+).|$|E

30|$|A <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> is {{perceived}} better as more observations are seen out-of-control limits, i.e., as n is increasing. However, {{even a single}} out-of- control limit observation can signal a true <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> with a certainty factor of p(B|A′). In other words, with probability 1 −p(B|A′), such a single observation could {{be associated with a}} spike or an outlier and not a true <b>level</b> <b>shift.</b> Thus, our certainty factor improves as more out-of-control limit data are seen (i.e. as n increases), causing the probability p(B|A′) to increase.|$|R

To cope with this uncertainty, we assign a confidence level equal to 1 −α to our perceived <b>level</b> <b>shift</b> event in which α is the Type I error, i.e., the error that seeing an out-of-control value such as a spike or an outlier confuses with a <b>level</b> <b>shift.</b> Also, we introduce the shift arising probability as a new measure of uncertainty and launch the shift change process according to this uncertainty measure as will be considered in the following.|$|R

This {{makes it hard}} to verify whether the true data generating process is a pure fractionally integrated process when employing standard estimation methods based on the autocorrelation function or the periodogram. In this paper, we propose a robust testing procedure, based on an encompassing parametric specification that allows us to disentangle the <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> from the fractionally integrated component. The estimation is carried out {{on the basis of a}} state-space methodology and it leads to a robust estimate of the fractional integration parameter also in presence of <b>level</b> <b>shifts.</b> Once the memory parameter is correctly estimated, we use the KPSS test for presence of <b>level</b> <b>shift.</b> The Monte Carlo simulations show how this approach produces unbiased estimates of the memory parameter when shifts in the mean, or other slowly varying trends, are present in the data. Therefore, this subsequent robust version of the KPSS test for the presence of <b>level</b> <b>shifts</b> has proper size and by far the highest power compared to other existing tests.

The emergence of multilevel inverters has been increased {{since the last}} ten years.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Advances {{in process}} {{technologies}} {{have led to}} the development of low-power high speed digital signal processing blocks that occupy small areas. These advances are critical in the development of portable electronic devices with small feature size and long battery life. However, the design of analog and mixed-signal building blocks, especially analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), becomes complex and power-inefficient with each advance in process node. This is because of decreased headroom and low intrinsic gain. In this thesis, circuit techniques that enable the design of low-complexity power-efficient ADCs in submicron CMOS are introduced. The techniques include improved correlated <b>level</b> <b>shifting</b> that allow the use of simple low gain amplifiers to realize high performance pipelined and delta-sigma ADCs.
