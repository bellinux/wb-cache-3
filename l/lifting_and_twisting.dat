60|$|Take, for {{simplest}} and nearest example, {{this question}} of the stress of wind. It is not the actual power that is immeasurable, if only it would stand to be measured! Instruments could easily now be invented which would register not only a blast that could lift a sailing boat, but one that would sink a ship of the line. But, lucklessly--the blast won't pose to the instrument! nor can the instrument be adjusted to the blast. In the gale of which my friend speaks in his next letter, 26th January, a gust came down the hill above Coniston village upon two old oaks, which were well rooted in the slate rock, and some fifty or sixty feet high--the one, some twenty yards below the other. The blast tore the highest out of the ground, peeling its roots from the rock as one peels an orange--swept {{the head of the}} lower tree away with it in one ruin, and snapped the two leader branches of the upper one over the other's stump, as one would break one's cane over some people's heads, if one got the chance. In wind action of this kind the amount of actual force used is the least part of the business;--it is the suddenness of its concentration, and the <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> strength, as of a wrestler, which make the blast fatal; none of which elements of storm-power can be recognized by mechanical tests. In my friend's next letter, however, he gives us some evidence of the consistent strength of this same gale, and of the electric conditions which attended it:--the prefatory notice of his pet bird I had meant for 'Love's Meinie,' but it will help us through the grimness of our studies here.|$|E

In this paper we prove that for an {{arbitrary}} finite group scheme G, and for any fixed integer n > 0, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of endotrivial modules of dimension n. This provides evidence to support the speculation that the group of endotrivial modules for a finite group scheme is always finitely generated.

40|$|Background: Disc herniations {{are common}} {{and have been}} {{demonstrated}} as one potential source of low back pain. To date epidemiological studies have found associations between lifting, <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> and twisting with increased risk {{in the development of}} disc herniations (Greenough and Fraser, 1994, Kelsey et al., 1984, Mundt et al., 1993). Subsequent, in vitro investigations were able to produce disc herniations through repeatitive flexion extension motions on cervical porcine functional spinal units (Callaghan and McGill, 2001). However, in vitro investigations on axial torque have drawn mixed conclusions and controversy remains on the role it plays with respect to disc herniations (Farfan et al., 1970, Adams et al., 1981). Therefore, the work in this thesis was to investigate the role of dynamic axial torque on the disc herniation mechanism. Methods: Porcine cervical spines were used as they are a good approximation to the human lumbar spine (Yingling et al., 1999). The study design involved repetitive flexion extension motions of the spinal units either preceded or followed by dynamic axial torque. During axial torque the spinal units were loaded to 17. 5 Nm (standard deviation = 0. 5 Nm) of dynamic axial torque for either 2000 or 4000 testing cycles. These spinal units were compared to spinal units that were loaded in repetitive flexion extension motions only and axial torque only. The spinal units were tested in a servohydraulic dynamic testing machine, combined with a custom jigs which allowed loading in flexion/extension, axial torque and compression. Plane film radiographs with contrast in the nucleus were obtained at regular intervals during and following the mechanical testing. Final dissection determined the disc injury patterns. Results and Discussion: Examination of the sectioned intervertebral discs indicated axial torque in combination with repetitive flexion extension motions, regardless of order, encouraged radial delamination. While, repetitive flexion extension motion alone encouraged posterior or posterolateral herniation patterns. Axial torque alone was unable to initiate a disc herniation. There was an increase in both rotation and stiffness of the intervertebral disc in response to repeated axial torque. There were no differences in rotation and stiffness between the groups. Both x-ray images and computed tomography scans were equally as good at identifying posterior or posterolateral herniations but were not good at detecting radial delamination...|$|E

5000|$|Because the {{advancing}} blade has higher airspeed than the retreating blade and generates a dissymmetry of lift, rotor blades {{are designed to}} [...] "flap" [...] - <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> {{in such a way}} that {{the advancing}} blade flaps up and develops a smaller angle of attack. Conversely, the retreating blade flaps down, develops a higher angle of attack, <b>and</b> generates more <b>lift.</b> At high speeds, the force on the rotors is such that they [...] "flap" [...] excessively, and the retreating blade can reach too high an angle and stall. For this reason, the maximum safe forward airspeed of a helicopter is given a design rating called VNE, velocity, never exceed. In addition, it is possible for the helicopter to fly at an airspeed where an excessive amount of the retreating blade stalls, which results in high vibration, pitch-up, and roll into the retreating blade.|$|R

40|$|The solar dynamo is {{the process}} by which the Sun's {{magnetic}} field is generated through the interaction of the field with convection and rotation. In this, it is kin to planetary dynamos and other stellar dynamos. Although the precise mechanism by which the Sun generates its field remains poorly understood despite decades of theoretical and observational work, recent advances suggest that solutions to this solar dynamo problem may be forthcoming. Two basic processes are involved in dynamo activity. When the fluid stresses dominate the magnetic stresses (high plasma beta = 8 (pi) rho/B(sup 2)), shear flows can stretch magnetic field lines {{in the direction of the}} shear (the "alpha effect") and helical flows can <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> field lines into orthogonal planes (the "alpha effect"). These two processes can be active anywhere in the solar convection zone but with different results depending upon their relative strengths and signs.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 29 - 31) Back pain is {{the most}} common and costly musculoskeletal problem in the workplace around the world. No previous study has compared the effects of asymmetrical lifting (lifting with a twist) on both upper body and lower body skeletal muscles with multiple lifting loads. It was hypothesized that the asymmetrical lifts of 20, 35, and 50 pounds could require a significantly higher muscle activation on the nine measured muscles when compared to symmetrical lifts of the same load. The dependent variables were the mean EMG activation of twelve selected muscles during the concentric upward lifting phase. The independent variables were the lifting method with two levels: symmetrical versus asymmetrical, <b>and</b> the <b>lifting</b> load with three levels of 20, 35, and 50 pounds. The results were analyzed with twelve two by three ANOVAs. The results from the twenty-two participants showed no statistical significant differences among the different conditions on mean EMG muscle activation between symmetrical <b>and</b> asymmetrical <b>lifts.</b> These results suggest that untrained individuals that lift heavy objects during their profession may exert the same muscular effort among multiple <b>lifting</b> loads <b>and</b> <b>twisting</b> while <b>lifting</b> may not alter the activation of certain muscles...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} functional and static foot posture and medial tibial stress syndrome in distance runners. Methods: Twenty-eight runners with a clinical diagnosis of medial tibial stress syndrome and 12 asymptomatic runners were assessed with the Foot Posture Index to measure static overpronation. Range of motion was measured at the talocrural joint, with the knee extended and flexed as was range of motion at the first metatarsophalangeal joint and the angular difference between the neutral and relaxed calcaneal stance positions. Each participant was then videotaped while running on a treadmill shod and unshod. This videotape was analyzed using freeze frame to identify abnormal or mistimed pronation at each phase of gait. The results were analyzed using logistic regression to give {{the probability that a}} runner is likely to experience medial tibial stress syndrome, predicted from the static measurements and dynamic observations. Results: Variables identified as being significant predictors of medial tibial stress syndrome were the difference between the neutral and relaxed calcaneal stance positions, range of motion of the talocrural joint with the knee extended, early heel <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> abductory <b>twist</b> during gait, <b>and</b> apropulsive gait. Conclusion: Runners with suspected symptoms of medial tibial stress syndrome should be assessed dynamically and statically for abnormal or mistimed pronation. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: The aim of {{the work}} is to map the {{ergonomics}} in a production cell and propose and compare the solutions to identified problems. In order to identify the problem and come up with some solutions, these questions have been answered. • What factors lead to operations that are harmful to the body?• How can a production cell be designed to be more ergonomic for employees?• What are the advantages / disadvantages of ergonomics in a production company?   Method: To perform the study and achieve the purpose of the work, the authors used a case study company where observations were made in parallel with a literature review mainly on ergonomics variety of analysis and quality. The case study company has been used {{as the basis for the}} case study where ergonomics are mapped by means of observations, interviews and data that were analyzed by means of literature study done in parallel. Study results: The study resulted in a survey of ergonomics in a production cell at the case study company and 5 different suggestions for improvement. The production cell on the case study company is a red cell today, which means that the production cell is in a non-accepted position and in need for urgent changes in ergonomics. Factors leading to bad ergonomics and a non-accepted position as Volvo's requirements have been identified. Many heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> many torque is what has the highest negative impact on the working environment and ergonomics. Lack of adequate lifting tools have led to those not used in the production cell today. This leads to repetitive work and encumbrance at the case study company. Further, also the working height of the paths contributed to an increased workload as operators are in an unnatural posture. All of these factors are the basis of the 5 suggestions for improvement as the study also resulted in. New custom lifting tools, job rotation, reverse the order of the court, new packaging and pallet to the gears and the robot turn. All these proposed solutions lead to reduced stress and improved ergonomics in the production cell as manual <b>lifting</b> <b>and</b> <b>twists</b> are reduced. The solutions also leads to the production cell shifting from a non-accepted position with demands of urgent change to a yellow production cell that requires an action plan for the future.   Implications: The aim of this study was to map the ergonomics in a production cell. With the study in hand, a conclusion is drawn that the aim has been achieved when all three of the questions have been addressed. Factors leading to poor ergonomics are identified. As well the advantages and disadvantages of investing in ergonomics identified and how production cells should be formed. With this information in mind, a number of proposed solutions have been developed.   Recommendations: Further studies on the subject are recommended to increase knowledge and interest. It may be appropriate to carry out more case studies at more industries to strengthen the study’s results and generalizability. Furthermore, studies are recommended where the entire work environment is studied and not only physical ergonomics. By studying the whole working environment and the many factors that interact it can lead to a greater force being created for higher efficiency and quality in production.   Keywords: Ergonomics, Ergonomics, Work, Volvo CE, Load, Lifting Tools, Body Injury, Advantages, Improvements, Qualit...|$|R

Simulations of plunge and pitch of flexible wing at Reynolds number Re= 136 are conducted in hovering condition by using the LBFPM. It is found that both <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> drag forces increase first, then decrease dramatically as the bending rigidity in spanwise direction decreases <b>and</b> that the <b>lift</b> <b>and</b> drag forces are sensitive to rigidity in a certain range. It is shown that the downwash flows induced by wing tip and trailing vortices in wake area are larger for a flexible wing than for a rigid wing, lead to a smaller effective angle of attack, and result in a larger lift force. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|Manual {{materials}} handling of heavy loads {{is a common}} cause of low back disorders. The manual manipulation of a heavy load may be made more comfortable by constraining the load to move along a guide.
