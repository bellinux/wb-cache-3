40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the {{experimental}} investigation of the oxygen enhanced combustion technology (OEC), which uses the combustion air with higher concentration of oxygen, i. e. more than 21 %. The OEC technology is used in those industrial applications, which requires higher thermal efficiency, increased productivity, improved character of the flame, reduced equipment cost, lower volume of exhaust gases and improved product quality. Although this technology involves a number of advantages, it is appropriate to mention some of its disadvantages such as refractory damage, inconsistent heating, increased pollutant emission or flame disturbance and/or flashback.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the {{coal-fired}} power industry began a more accelerated move toward using <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> (LNB) technologies to reduce NOx emissions. Most LNBs incorporate less oxygen with the coal initially, creating a cooler and somewhat substoichiometric initial combustion zone, with additional oxygen added further on in the combustion process to complete char combustion. Another method used to achieve lower NOx emissions is to fire the coal substoichiometrically and add additional air through overfire air ports. Both of these methods create certain impacts on fireside performance that are different from conventional high-excess-air firing arrangements. Some of the impacts that have been noticed by the utility industry are higher levels of unburned carbon in the fly ash and bottom ash, increased boiler tube corrosion, higher particulate loadings on control devices, and changes in slagging in the main furnace. Work on the fundamental mechanisms of entrained ash and ash deposit formation during low-NOx combustion has been sparse. This project by the Energy and Environmental Research Center (EERC) focuses on the issues of entrained ash formation and slagging for low-NOx combustion systems in general. Time-resolved combustion tests under conventional and low-NOx conditions have been conducted to note particle-size formation and slagging deposition. The results from this work are yielding an increased understanding of the mechanisms of ash formation during low-NOx combustion along with methods for enhancing heat transfer and fly ash collectability. Specific objectives of this research project include (1) determining whether initial char and ash generated under low-NOx conditions have greater tendencies for slagging than conventionally generated ash and (2) determining the differences, if any, between particle size and composition for entrained ash generated under low-NOx and conventional combustion conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Low-NOx</b> surface <b>burners</b> {{have been}} found to {{generate}} a great amount of noise and heat release fluctuations in certain working regimes. The wide range application of these <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> is difficult due to this thermo-acoustic instability. The mechanism behind this instability is still not fully understood. The origin is believed to lie a low-frequency instability which occurs in the near wake of high solidity plates. In order to enable the suppression of this thermo-acoustic instability, the low-frequency flow instability in the near wake of perforated plates is investigated using hot-wire anemometry (HWA) and high-end particle image velocimetry (PIV) techniques. From these measurements the spectral content of the flow is investigated and it is found that the low-frequency instability is a robust phenomenon which occurs in transition region from laminar to turbulent flow. The oscillation starts to occur beyond a critical Reynolds number. Within the transition regime, the oscillation frequency is found to increase linearly for increasing Reynolds number. This implies that the Strouhal number of the low-frequency instability remains constant. The instability is found to be absent near the boundaries of the perforated plate which also introduces the concept of a critical number of jets. A critical number of jets have to be present in order for the phenomenon to occur. Together with this limit there exists a trade-off between Reynolds number and number of jets, as we find that the decrease in number of jets increases the critical Reynolds number...|$|R

The DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner (see Figure 1. 1) is B&W's newest low-NO{sub x} burner capable of achieving very low NO{sub x}. The burner is designed to reduce NO{sub x} by diverting air away from {{the core of the}} flame, which reduces local stoichiometry during coal devolatilization and, thereby, reduces initial NO{sub x} formation. Figure 1. 2 shows the historical NO{sub x} emission levels from different B&W burners. Figure 1. 2 shows that based on three large-scale commercial installations of the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burners in combination with OFA ports, using Western subbituminous coal, the NO{sub x} emissions ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 18 lb/ 10 {sup 6 } Btu.

Although NO{sub x} emissions from the DRB- 4 Z{trademark} burner are nearing OTR emission level with subbituminous coals, the utility boiler owners that use bituminous coals can still benefit from the addition of an SNCR and/or SCR system in order to comply with the stringent NO{sub x} emission levels facing them...|$|E
40|$|Fossil fuel combustion, such as coal combustion, {{currently}} {{meets the}} majority of the global energy demand; however, the process also produces a significant proportion of the worldwide CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Further improvement in the efficiency and control of the combustion process is needed, as well as the implementation of novel technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Oxy-fuel combustion is a very promising CCS technology, where the air in the combustion process is replaced with a mixture of recycled flue gas and oxygen producing a high CO 2 outflow that can effectively be processed or stored. The adjustment of the combustion environment within the boiler resulting from the high CO 2 concentration will modify the flame characteristics. It is therefore important to evaluate properly the changes of the flame that occur with different flue gas recycle schemes. A coal flame is often characterised by its physical parameters, such as the flame size, shape, brightness and temperature, and it can be considered as a stable flame by the presence of ignition and the propagation of the flame. The oscillatory behaviour of a flame can be quantified by the flicker frequency obtained after the instantaneous variations of the flame parameters, and is used as a reference for flame stability. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used to model coal combustion. This work compares the estimated flicker frequency taken from CFD calculations against measurements undertaken at the experimental facilities of the UKCCSRC Pilot-scale Advanced Capture Technology (PACT) located in South Yorkshire, UK. The 250 kW combustion test facility consists of a down-fired, refractory lined cylindrical furnace, which is 4 m in height with a 0. 9 m internal diameter. The furnace is fitted with a scaled version of a commercially available Doosan Babcock <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner.</b> The flame physical parameters are approximated from performing a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) using the CFD code ANSYS FLUENT v 15. The flicker frequency obtained from the CFD approach is compared against the experimentally measured value from a 2 D flame imaging system. A series of oxy-fuel cases are then examined in the same fashion in order to assess their flame stability and the boiler operational limit. The flicker frequency trend obtained from the computations and measurements helps to determine the dynamic response of the flame for different combustion environments, and the results will be applicable in determining the optimal recycle ratio applied in future oxy-fuel systems...|$|E

This project addresses the critical need of process heater operators for reliable, economical emission reduction technologies to comply with stringent emission regulations, and for heater design alternatives that reduce process heater energy requirements without significant cost increase. The key project targets were NOx emissions of 10 ppm (@ 3 % O 2), and a heater thermal efficiency of 95 percent. The ultra low NOx burner was developed {{through a series of}} pilot-scale and field tests combined with computational fluid dynamic modeling to arrive at simultaneous low emissions and suitable flame shape and stability. Pilot scale tests were run at TIAX, at the 2 MMBtu/hr scale, and at Callidus at 8 MMBtu/hr. The full scale burner was installed on a 14 burner atmospheric pipestill furnace at an ExxonMobil refinery. A variety of burner configurations, gas tips and flame stabilizers were tested to determine the lowest emissions with acceptable flame shape and stability. The resulting NOx emissions were 22 ppm on average. Starting in 2001, Callidus commercialized the original ultra low NOx burner and made subsequent design improvements in a series of commercial burners evolving from the original concept and/or development. Emissions in the field with the ultra <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> over a broad spectrum of heater applications have varied from 5 ppm to 30 ppm depending on heater geometry, heater service, fuel and firing capacity. To date, 1550 of the original burners, and 2500 of subsequent generation burners have been sold by Callidus. The advanced heater design was developed by parametric evaluations of a variety of furnace and combustion air preheater configurations and technologies for enhancing convective and radiative heat transfer. The design evolution relied heavily on computational fluid dynamic predictions of design alternatives. The final design features modular separate radiant cells, each with one and two-side fired vertical tubes. The convection section configuration is vertical tube banks enclosed in the radiant channels. Commercial modular plate air preheaters are used. The predicted performance for the integrated advanced heater and Callidus burner is 95 percent efficiency with 9 ppm NOx emissions firing natural gas, and 12 ppm firing refinery gas.

40|$|The Stirling {{engine is}} a {{promising}} prime mover for micro-scale combined heat and power. For Stirling engines with heat supply by combustion, the external heating system {{is one of}} the most important parts. It has major infulence on the overall performance. The central component of the external heating system is the burner. This thesis describes the theoretical and experimental studies in the developement of a gas fired burner for the external heating system that have been carried out. The focus was on low emissions and high system efficency. As a first step, a system analysis of the external heating system is presented based on fundamental considerations about the thermodynamics and practical aspects of the Stirling engine. The results of the analysis show that the expected NOx emissions are strongly determined by the system design. Without making any restrictions to the burner desing, a span of the NOx emissions with a ratio of 1 : 800 was found. Modern design methodology is then introduced in order to analyze a large number of different <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> concepts that were found in literature. The concepts are evaluated and classified with help of the methodology in order to find possible new low-NOx concepts by favourable combinations of generic principles. Based on this, the concept of the porous inert media (PIM) burner is chosen for further development as a burner for the Stirling engine. The selection is confirmed by an experimental benchmark study in which the PIM burner showes low NOx emissions and the lowest pressure drop compared to three other low- NOx burner concepts. The optimization of the design of the PIM burner is described. A fovourable combination of materials was found, which enables stable operation with a turn-down ration of 1 : 15 and a span of the excess-air ratio from 1. 28 to 2. 0 when methane is used as the fuel. Temperature and CO measurements inside the combustion region were made which enable conclusion about the stabilization of the combustion process. Finally, the behaviour of the PIM burner with different fuel gases like methane, propane, methane-hydrogen mixtures and syngas is presented based on experimental results. Stability and emissions of CO and NOx under different operating conditions are discussed. The possible pathways of formation of NOx are analysed. Strong correlation of the NOx emissions with the temperature at the burner outlet is found. Based on this, a way of predicting the NOx emissions by simple empirical correlations that are valid for all fuels gases that have been used is presented. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|Since its inception, the low-swirl burner (LSB) {{has shown}} to be a useful {{laboratory}} apparatus for fundamental studies of premixed turbulent flames. The LSB operates under wide ranges of equivalence ratios, flow rates, and turbulence intensities. Its flame is lifted and detached from the burner and allows easy access for laser diagnostics. The flame brush is axisymmetric and propagates normal to the incident reactants. Therefore, the LSB is well suited for investigating detailed flame structures and empirical coefficients such as flame speed, turbulence transport, and flame generated turbulence. Due to its capability to stabilize ultra-lean premixed turbulent flames (phi approx. = 0. 55), the LSB has generated interest from the gas appliance industry for use as an economical <b>low-NO(x)</b> <b>burner.</b> Lean premixed combustion emits low levels of NO(x), due primarily to the low flame temperature. Therefore, it is a very effective NO(x) prevention method without involving selective catalytic reduction (SCR), fuel-air staging, or flue gas recirculation (FGR). En the gas turbine industry, substantial research efforts have already been undertaken and engines with lean premixed combustors are already in use. For commercial and residential applications, premixed pulsed combustors and premixed ceramic matrix burners are commercially available. These lean premixed combustion technologies, however, tend to be elaborate but have relatively limited operational flexibility, and higher capital, operating and maintenance costs. Consequently, these industries are continuing the development of lean premixed combustion technologies as well as exploring new concepts. This paper summarizes the research effects we have undertaken {{in the past few years}} to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the low-swirl flame stabilization method for a wide range of heating and power generation systems. The principle of flame stabilization by low-swirl is counter to the conventional high-swirl methods that rely on a recirculation zone to anchor the flame. In LSBS, flow recirculation is not promoted to allow the premixed turbulent flames to propagate freely. A LSB with an air-jet swirler is essentially an open tube with the swirler at its mid section. The small air-jets generate swirling motion only in the annular region and leaving the central core of the flow undisturbed, When this flow exits the burner tube, the angular momentum generates radial mean pressure gradient to diverge the non-swirling reactants stream. Consequently, the mean flow velocity decreases linearly. Propagating against this decelerating flow, the flame self-sustains at the position where the local flow velocity equals the flame speed, S(sub f). The LSB operates with a swirl number, S, between 0. 02 to 0. 1. This is much lower than the minimum S of 0. 6 required for the high-swirl burners. We found that the swirl number needed for flame stabilization varies only slightly with fuel type, flow velocity, turbulent conditions and burner dimensions (i. e. throat diameter and swirl injection angle) ...|$|E
40|$|Scope of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the oxide scale formation on metallic high-temperature alloys resulting during reaction with the atmosphere of the combustion of industrial gas oil (IGO). The Ni-Cr-based alloys 601 (2. 4851), 602 (2. 4633), 603, 693 and 617 (2. 4663) were tested at elevated temperatures between 900 °C and 1050 °C in a burner rig equipped with a low-NOx recirculation burner by application as material of the burner flame tube. Further on, the oxide scale on a woven wire cloth made of a Ni-Cr-based alloy was analysed. The wire cloth was used as the hot surface of a radiant burner at temperatures of approximately 685 °C for an operation time of 844 h. All alloys investigated in the <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burner</b> rig showed following oxide scale structure: a chromium oxide scale at the alloy surface and aluminium or silicon oxide (on alloy 603) beneath. Particles with a composition {{similar to that of the}} bulk alloy were found enclosed in the chromium oxide scale. Frequently these particles were located near the oxide-gas boundary indicating an impending local degradation of the chromium oxide scale. Aluminium oxide grew predominantly along grain boundaries in the depth of the bulk. During the test period of up to 3000 h no aluminium oxide scale was found. For longer investigation times accelerated internal oxidation of aluminium was observed. In contrast to aluminium, silicon formed an albeit noncontinuous scale of silicon oxide directly below the chromium oxide layer. The diffusion of chromium towards the surface was inhibited by the silicon scale, which resulted in a slower kinetic of the chromium oxide growth and consequently a thinner chromium oxide scale. However, as the silicon oxide scale was not protective. Mo-oxides formed in the bulk – Mo being an alloying element of alloy 603 – followed by breakaway oxidation. In case of the aluminium alloyed material the formation of nitrides in the bulk indicated the breakdown of the oxide scale. Failure of the alloys was related to massive inward nitrogen diffusion and the formation of aluminium nitrides in the bulk. Therefore it is assumed that in nitrogen rich atmospheres a high aluminium content is unfavourable due to the strong affinity of aluminium to nitrogen. In general it was observed, that at lower temperatures, as a result of a slower growth kinetic, the nitride formation began later. Short term tests of 50 hours of alloy 602, alloy 603 and alloy 693 showed, that a thicker and more uniform oxide layer formed when the burner was operated with standard quality IGO (1700 mg/kg S), compared with the oxide scale formed in the case of operation with fuel with reduced sulphur content (20 mg/kg S). Ventilation with air after burner shut down had no significant effect on chromium oxide scale thickness. The time dependence of the observed growth of the chromium oxide scale was fitted with a power law. A deviation from the parabolic law has been found indicating an oxide loss due to spallation. Reasonable estimation of life time was achieved by logarithmic plots of the time dependence of the chromium depletion measured by line scans on cross sections of the samples. The metallographic investigation of the hot surface of the radiant burner showed a thin continuous chromium oxide layer. No indication of damage of the scale, a small depth of internal oxidation and the absence of a significant chromium depletion zone were found. Hence, a long life time of the woven wire cloth can be expected...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the activities carried {{out for the}} development {{and the use of}} CRFD codes and related procedures for the design of industrial furnaces. The objective is to predict the emission of pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides, in combustion flue gases. This prediction may be correctly accomplished using a detailed kinetic mechanism, which cannot be directly implemented on CRFD codes due to actual computational limits (both in terms of memory and CPU time consumption). A new approach has been developed: analysing the 3 D CRFD flow fields, an "equivalent" chemical reactors network model is extracted with corresponding residence time distributions and overall reactor properties, and the detailed kinetic calculation is performed on this simpler scheme. The approach has been successfully applied to different scale of furnaces such as pilot plants and industrial boilers, <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> and glass furnaces. In the papers a description of the CRFD codes is given, and the methodology to extract a chemical ideal reactor network from CFRD fields is presented. Finally, an application of the procedure on the Monfalcone # 3 steam generator is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} role of coal as {{a source}} of energy in the 21 st century will demand environmental and cost-effective strategies for the use of coal combustion by-products (CCBPs), mainly fly ash containing unburned carbon. However, the carbonaceous residue in fly ash, unburned carbon (UC), is a potential precursor for the production of adsorbent carbons, since it has gone through a devolatilization process while in the combustor, and therefore, only requires to be activated. Accordingly, this research program focuses on the development of activated carbons from the unburned carbon present in fly ash. During the present reporting period (June 30, 1999 [...] June 29, 2000), Task 1 ''Procurement and characterization of CCBPs'' was initiated and samples from various combustion systems were collected. The suite assembled thus far includes samples from pulverized utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> and Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system, and also from an utility cyclone unit. The characterization studies showed that the sample from the cyclone unit contained the highest carbon content (LOI of {approx} 80 %), since this unit has been retrofitted with a technology to separate the unburned carbon from the fly ash. In contrast, the sample from the unit retrofitted with a Selective Non Catalytic Reduction system showed the lowest carbon content with LOI values around 2 - 4 %. The samples from the utility boilers with <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> were collected from the hot-side hoppers and present carbon contents {approx} 50 %. The BET (N{sub 2 } 77 K) surface areas of the samples investigated were between 30 - 40 m{sup 2 }/g and the pore volume is mainly due to mesopores. In addition, during this reporting period, also Task 2 ''Development of activated carbons'' and Task 3 ''Characterization of activated carbons'' were initiated. The investigations showed that after steam activation at 850 C, the unburned carbon samples generated activated carbons with microporous structure and surface areas up to 443 m{sup 2 }/g. The samples activated with steam present generally higher surface areas than those using CO{sub 2 } or KOH pretreatment, probably due to the faster reaction rate of steam. The activation process could tailor the inherent mesoporosity of these materials into the desired porosity for a specific application, since the mesophore volume accounted for {approx} 66 % of the total pore volume for the parent samples, while after steam activation the micropore volume accounted for over 60 % of the total...|$|R

The {{short-term}} goal of {{the research}} is to develop advanced in-furnace technologies for coal-fired power plants capable of controlling NOx emissions {{to a level of}} 0. 15 pounds per million Btu heat input (lb/MMBtu) by 2007 and 0. 10 lb/MMBtu by 2010, while achieving a levelized cost savings of at least 25 % compared to state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction (SCR) control technology. The program’s long-term goal is to further develop a combination of advanced in-furnace and SCR control technologies to achieve a NOx emission rate of 0. 01 lb/MMBtu by 2020. The advanced NOx research program takes a holistic approach to pollutant control by not only addressing NOx emissions control technologies, but also important balance-of-plant issues associated with those technologies such as unburned carbon, ammonia slip, and sulfuric acid emissions. This paper provides an update on the status of DOE/NETL’s advanced in-furnace NOx control R&D efforts. Commercially-available <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> (LNB) and SCR NOx control technologies are enabling industry compliance with today’s regulatory requirements. However, the NOx control technologies under development by DOE/NETL will provide more costeffective options for coal-fired power plants to comply with the ever more stringen...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the U. S. Department of Energy’s Low Emission Boiler System (LEBS) program is to dramatically improve the environmental performance of future electric power generating plants fired with pulverized coal. The Low Emission Boiler System developed by the DB Riley team under this project incorporates a low-NOx slag-tap boiler. This firing system converts the fly ash into a vitrified form which is useful as a byproduct, and which is more easily handled and disposed of if necessary. In addition, the down-fired, or U-fired, slag tap system is adaptable to {{a broad range of}} fuels, including those with low volatile or high ash content. The very high NOx emissions typical of slag tap firing are controlled with a combination of advanced <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners,</b> air staging, and fuel staging (reburning). Tests at DB Riley's 30 MWt U-fired facility have demonstrated NOx levels of less than 0. 2 lbs/MBtu leaving the firing system, minimizing the need for post combustion cleanup. Commercial demonstration is planned at an 80 MW Proof-of-Concept (POF) Facility. This paper presents an overview of the LEBS Project, test results from the firing system development work, and a design for a Proof-of-Concept demonstration...|$|R

40|$|A burner is very {{important}} device in process furnaces that significantly affect the production of emissions during the combustion process. One of the key things in development of the modern <b>low-NOX</b> <b>burners</b> is the evaluation of flow field downstream of an axial blade swirler inside the burner. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) {{is often used to}} predict the attributes of the flow. Predicted values should be validated with measurement. It is the reason why the velocity fields for several choosen swirlers were measured. The hot wire anemometry was choosen and the dual-sensor probe was used during the measurement. The data can be then used for CFD validation. This thesis describes procedure of measurement set-up. The experimental facility was designed according to the anemometry method. The new probe traversing system was designed, which provides desired accuracy. Five different swirlers were measured. Large data set, need for customized post-processing and control over calculation procedures lead to new software design. For each swirler the velocity profiles were gathered and the swirl numbers calculated. That final data were transferred in to graphical format. Uncertainty of measured data was calculated. Results show counter-rotating flow in some areas closed to the swirler. Some drawbacks of current measurement set-up are discussed. Based on the thesis reader can obtain the information and knowledge for consequent measurements of swirl burners velocity profiles...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of low-volatile coal are utilized in power plants throughout China. With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, {{it is important}} to develop and deploy low-NOx combustion technologies for pulverized coal boilers burning low-volatile coal. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate a novel decoupling combustion system for low-volatile coal via experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The combustion system includes horizontal fuel-rich/lean <b>low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> (LNB) and the associated air distribution system for a polygonal tangentially fired boiler (PTFB). The effects of coal particle diameter and coal feeding rate on the gas/particle flow characteristics of the burner, and the cold state aerodynamic field of the PTFB were analyzed in detail. The structural design of the LNB results in advantageous gas/particle flow characteristics and the PTFB improved the distribution of the flow field. The CFD models and simulation results were validated by comparing with those of cold experiments data. The simulation results demonstrated that this low-NOx combustion technology enhances staged combustion at different scales, which can reduce NOx generation significantly. In the industrial application on a 300 MW pulverized coal boiler, installation of the LNBs improved the stability of low-volatile coal combustion and reduced NOx emissions significantly. These research findings provide valuable guidance to the design of low-NOx combustion system for pulverized coal boilers using low volatile coal. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{document}} a recently completed four-year study to {{examine the impact of}} low-NOx firing technologies on ash formation and deposition while firing pulverized coal. <b>Low-NOx</b> <b>burners</b> and staged combustion inhibit NOx formation by restricting the amount of oxygen available to form a fuel-rich zone in which nitrogen compounds are reduced to molecular nitrogen (N{sub 2 }) rather than oxidized. Additional oxygen is provided downstream for complete combustion. Consequently, coal and mineral particles encounter different temperatures and oxygen concentrations when they are burned under low-NOx firing conditions than they do in conventionally-fired units. Two coals with distinctly different inorganic contents and ash characteristics were fired in a pilot-scale laboratory combustor under both conventional and staged combustion conditions. Ash and deposit samples were collected at various locations in the reactor and analyzed in order to assess the influence of staged combustion. This report is organized as follows. First, a background section provides the foundation needed {{in order to understand the}} motivation for and the results of the experimental program. The next section presents a description of the experimental apparatus and procedures, including the development the analytical methods critical to the study. Results of the analyses of coal, ash and deposit samples are then presented and discussed for each of the two coals. Finally, the report ends with a short summary and statement of conclusions...|$|R
