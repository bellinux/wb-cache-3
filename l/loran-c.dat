5|$|The {{airfield}} {{was built}} {{in connection with the}} <b>LORAN-C</b> transmitter at Olonkinbyen and was completed in 1960. Jan Mayensfield is served eight times per year by Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft of the 335 Squadron from Bodø Main Air Station, which provide supplies and change crew at the outpost. The nearby Beerenberg volcano can cause a Kármán wind, which creates difficult landing conditions.|$|E
25|$|The OMEGA {{navigation}} {{system and the}} <b>LORAN-C</b> transmitters outside the USA were run until 1994 also by the United States Coast Guard, and <b>LORAN-C</b> transmitters within the US were decommissioned on June 1, 2010, {{with the exception of}} 5 CONUS <b>LORAN-C</b> stations that continue to be manned due to international agreements.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the greatly {{increased}} accuracy and ease-of-use of <b>Loran-C,</b> Loran-A remained in widespread use. This was due largely to two important factors. One was that the electronics needed to read a <b>Loran-C</b> signal were complex, and {{in the era of}} tube-based electronics, physically very large, generally fragile, and expensive. Further, as military ships and aircraft moved from Loran-A to <b>Loran-C,</b> the older receivers were made surplus. These older units were snapped up by commercial fisherman and other users, keeping it in widespread service.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of transistorized radios, and then microcontroller-based systems that decoded the location directly, continued to improve Loran-A systems while prices dropped. By the early 1970s such units were relatively common, although they remained relatively expensive compared to devices like a radio direction finder. But {{the improvement of}} electronics through this period was so rapid {{that it was only}} a few years before <b>Loran-C</b> units of similar size and cost were available. This led to the decision to open <b>Loran-C</b> to civilian use in 1974.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the {{meteorological}} station was located at Atlantic City, but moved in 1949 {{to a new}} location. Radio Jan Mayen also served as an important radio station for ship traffic in the Arctic Ocean. In 1959, NATO decided to build the <b>LORAN-C</b> network in the Atlantic Ocean, {{and one of the}} transmitters had to be on Jan Mayen. By 1961, the new military installations, including a new airfield, were operational.|$|E
25|$|The only {{inhabitants}} on {{the island}} are personnel working for the Norwegian Armed Forces and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Eighteen people spend the winter {{on the island}}, but the population may double (35) during the summer, when heavy maintenance is performed. Personnel serve either six months or one year, and are exchanged twice a year in April and October. The support crew, including mechanics, cooks, and a nurse, are among the military personnel. The military personnel operated a <b>Loran-C</b> base, until it closed {{at the end of}} 2015. Both the LORAN transmitter and the meteorological station are located a few kilometres away from the settlement Olonkinbyen (Olonkin City), where all personnel live.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s the Coast Guard {{was in the}} midst of phasing out Loran-A in favour of {{additional}} <b>Loran-C</b> chains. The Aleutian and Hawaii chains shut down on 1 July 1979, the remaining Alaska and West Coast chains on 31 December 1979, followed by the Atlantic and Caribbean transmitters on 31 December 1980. Several foreign chains in both the Pacific and Atlantic followed suit, and by 1985 most of the original chains were no longer operational. Japanese systems remained on the air longer, until 1991, serving their fishing fleet. Chinese systems were active into the 1990s before their replacement with more modern systems, and their nine chains were still listed as active in Volume 6 (2000 edition) of the Admiralty List of Radio Signals.|$|E
25|$|Roland {{served as}} Commandant {{during the time}} that the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) {{requested}} greater U.S. Navy involvement in interdiction of North Vietnamese troops and equipment into South Vietnam under Operation Market Time. The Navy did not have the patrol craft that would serve MACV's purposes and they requested assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard. Roland agreed to supply Point-class cutters and their crews to the operation, fearing that if the U.S. Coast Guard were left out of the Vietnam War that its standing as an armed service would be jeopardized. Coast Guard Squadron One was commissioned on 27 May 1965 and 17 cutters with their crews were assigned to Navy control and sent to Vietnam to assist with the mission of interdicting Communist vessels at sea and preventing personnel and supplies from entering South Vietnam. An additional nine Point-class cutters were assigned to Squadron One on 29 October at the request of MACV. The increased operations in Vietnam during Roland's time as Commandant included buoy tenders to service Vietnamese aids to navigation. U.S. Coast Guard port security personnel were assigned at MACV's request after a visit to Vietnam by Roland in July 1965. There were additional manning requirements for new <b>Loran-C</b> radio stations for radio navigation of ships and aircraft. During the time of the Vietnam preparations he also managed the U.S. Coast Guard's response to the Camarioca boatlift operations in the Straits of Florida. In all, Roland oversaw the increase of over 3,500 additional personnel in 1966.|$|E

500|$|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Norwegian Armed Forces started {{construction}} of a military communications outpost at Olonkinbyen in 1958. At first a LORAN-A transmitter was built, followed by a <b>LORAN-C</b> transmitter in 1960. In August, {{it was announced that}} the island would receive an airfield to allow continual operation of the transmitter. Originally, the aerodrome consisted of a [...] section of the island's dirt road. This was chosen to reduce the bureaucracy of construction. The first aircraft to land was a Consolidated PBY Catalina of the Royal Norwegian Air Force on 17 September 1960.|$|E
500|$|Jan Mayen is a {{volcanic}} {{island in the}} Arctic Ocean located at {{the border of the}} Norwegian Sea and the Greenland Sea. The single island covers an area of [...] and is dominated by the [...] tall Beerenberg volcano. The island's only population is a combined military and meteorological outpost that operates a <b>LORAN-C</b> transmitter at Olonkinbyen. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute annexed the island for Norway in 1922. On 27 February 1930, the island was made de jure a part of the Kingdom of Norway. Since 1994, the island has been administrated by the County Governor of Nordland, with some authority delegated to the station commander.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{dramatically}} improved performance of <b>Loran-C,</b> LORAN, now known as Loran-A (or [...] "Standard LORAN"), would become much more popular during this period. This was due largely to {{the large numbers of}} surplus Loran-A units released from the Navy as ships and aircraft replaced their sets with <b>Loran-C.</b> The widespread introduction of inexpensive microelectronics during the 1980s caused <b>Loran-C</b> receivers to drop in price dramatically, and Loran-A use began to rapidly decline. Loran-A was dismantled starting in the 1970s; it remained active in North America until 1980 {{and the rest of the}} world until 1985. A Japanese chain remained on the air until 9 May 1997, and a Chinese chain was still listed as active as of 2000.|$|E
2500|$|LORAN, in its {{original}} form, was an expensive system to implement, requiring a cathode ray tube (CRT) display. This limited use to the military and large commercial users. Automated receivers became available in the 1950s, but the same improved electronics led to new systems with higher accuracy. The US Navy began development of Loran-B, which offered accuracy {{on the order of}} a few tens of feet, but ran into significant technical problems. The US Air Force worked on a different concept, Cyclan, which the [...] Navy took over as <b>Loran-C.</b> <b>Loran-C</b> offered longer range than LORAN and accuracy of hundreds of feet. The US Coast Guard took over operations of both systems in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|An FCC {{database}} {{provides information}} about the height and year built of broadcasting towers in the US. It does not contain {{information about the}} structural types of towers or about the height of towers used by Federal agencies, such as most NDBs, <b>LORAN-C</b> transmission towers or VLF transmission facilities of the US Navy, or about most towers not used for transmission like the BREN Tower. [...] These are instead tracked by the Federal Aviation Administration as obstructions to air navigation.|$|E
2500|$|The Navy {{had also}} been experimenting with a similar concept during this period, but using a {{different}} method to extract the timing. This system, later known as Loran-B, ran into significant problems (as did another Air Force system, Whyn). In 1953 the Navy took over the Cyclan system and began a wide series of studies ranging {{as far away as}} Brazil, demonstrating accuracy to about [...] The system was declared operational in 1957, and operations of LORAN and Cyclan were handed to the US Coast Guard in 1958. At that time, the original LORAN became Loran-A or standard LORAN, and the new system became <b>Loran-C.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Richmond was {{appointed}} as Commandant of the Coast Guard by President Dwight D. Eisenhower 13 May 1954 {{as a vice}} admiral and took office 1 June, succeeding Vice Admiral Merlin O'Neill. One of his first concerns upon taking office was a proposal by Eisenhower to merge the Coast Guard Academy with the Department of Commerce Merchant Marine Academy. Again, Richmond was able to convince proponents of the move {{that there were no}} gains in economy and several impractical features to proposal by citing the differences in the military and commercial aspects of the academies. In 1956 Richmond's staff helped {{in the formation of the}} National Search and Rescue Plan which defined the Coast Guard's role and justified further developments in search and rescue (SAR) techniques by used by cutters and aircraft. Other developments during his first term as Commandant included the coordinated use of non Coast Guard resources in oceanic SAR cases and the adoption of <b>Loran-C</b> used for navigation. Because of Richmond's rapport with members of Congress and a desire of the Eisenhower administration to continue improving SAR programs, he {{was appointed}} to a second term as Commandant and took office 1 June 1958. Richmond was particularly active with international maritime conferences, representing the United States at the first assembly of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) in January 1959 and four other occasions as head of the Maritime Safety Committee of IMCO. In 1960 he was head of the delegation to the Safety of Life at Sea Convention in London, for which services he was awarded the newly inaugurated Coast Guard Distinguished Service Medal. On 1 June 1960, he was promoted to admiral under the authority of Public Law 86-474, which required the Commandant to hold the rank of admiral. [...] In 1960 he was chosen to preside at the sixth International Lighthouse Conference and as president of the executive committee of the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities. In 1961, Richmond was again a delegate to the second assembly of IMCO as well as chairman of the National Committee for Prevention of Pollution of Seas by Oil.|$|E
