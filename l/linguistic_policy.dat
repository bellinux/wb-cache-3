2500|$|Because {{the use of}} Standard Yoruba did {{not result}} from some {{deliberate}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>policy,</b> much controversy exists as to what constitutes 'genuine Yoruba', with some writers holding the opinion that the Ọyọ dialect is the most [...] "pure" [...] form, and others stating {{that there is no}} such thing as genuine Yoruba at all. Standard Yoruba, the variety learnt at school and used in the media, has nonetheless been a powerful consolidating factor in the emergence of a common Yoruba identity.|$|E
2500|$|Early Icelandic {{vocabulary}} {{was largely}} Old Norse. The introduction of Christianity to Iceland in the 11th century {{brought with it}} a need to describe new religious concepts. The majority of new words were taken from other Scandinavian languages; [...] ("church"), for example. Numerous other languages have had their influence on Icelandic: French brought many words related to the court and knightship; words in the semantic field of trade and commerce have been borrowed from Low German because of trade connections. In the late 18th century, language purism began to gain noticeable ground in Iceland and since the early 19th century {{it has been the}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>policy</b> of the country (see linguistic purism in Icelandic).

2500|$|In Canada and abroad, the <b>linguistic</b> <b>policy</b> of Quebec is {{too often}} {{negatively}} perceived. The business community and the media in particular know it very little. For their part, the Americans remain opposed to a legislation that appears to them to reduce individual liberties and limit the use of English. For them, language and culture are two separate elements, {{they do not see}} how the protection of Quebec culture also includes the protection of the French language, even though 35 American States have adopted declarations proclaiming English the official language. Thus, must be developed the perception that Quebec culture {{is a part of the}} North-American heritage and that it is necessary to preserve it. It is also important to correct the erroneous perceptions regarding the Quebec language policy and its application.|$|E

The status of Portuguese, indigenous, foreign, sign and immigrant languages in these documents is discussed, {{as well as the}} legal attitudes related to bilingualism in communities of immigrants, indigenous, deaf and descendants of Negro slaves. An initial legal ambiguity may be noted when essentially monolingual <b>linguistic</b> <b>policies</b> are prioritized. A mild progress has occurred during the last few years, mainly, those related to the acknowledgement of indigenous communities as bi/multilingual.

2500|$|Kaza {{director}} and graphic artist Selim Zerdani, for example, integrated manga into {{his efforts to}} develop elementary literacy. He justifies his choice to publish a manga in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) with his personal imperative to guide readers toward better reading: [...] "Many people {{do not know how}} to speak this language [...] properly, thus it is only legitimate to direct readers toward a good reading". Zerdani's valuative judgment echoes biases against dialectal Arabic as an improper language which were cultivated by the last forty years of the Algerian government's <b>linguistic</b> <b>policy.</b> Implicitly, however, his judgment also promotes manga as a respectable form of literature, inviting educators and parents alike to consider it an informal educational tool. Zerdani's work effectively legitimized Algerian discourse about manga, helping to broaden its market and to provide a new voice for Zerdani's ideas about Arabic literacy.|$|E

The text, bilingual in Portuguese and Hunsrückisch, one of the varieties of German immigration languages spoken in Brazil, was presented by the authors (as native speakers and translators), in the Legislative Seminar on Creation of the Book of Language Registers, organized by the Institute of National Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), Institute of Investigation and Development in <b>Linguistic</b> <b>Policies</b> (IPOL) and Education and Culture Committee of the Chamber of Representatives, in Brasília, on March 2006. The idea of the Book of Languages contributes to the recognition of Brazilian linguistic diversity, represented by approximately 210 languages, from which 180 are autochthonous (indigenous) and around 30 are allochthonous (of immigration). Its recognition as an immaterial (virtual) cultural heritage is seem as an important act in favor of speakers’ linguistic rights and against linguistic prejudice that comes along {{with the use of}} minority languages in contact with the Portuguese language.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades (i. e. since the 1950 s and 1960 s), many {{minorities}} in the Middle East have been advocating or fighting for their linguistic rights. On the other hand, the majority of Arab countries have tried to impose a quasi monolingual policy in favor of Arabic language. If the languages of the former colonial powers are still playing an important role, those of the non-Arab communities have always been marginalized {{on the basis of}} nationalistic and religious arguments. Focusing mainly on Egypt and Sudan, this paper attempts to identify the historical roots of the current <b>linguistic</b> <b>policies</b> and to assess their impact and implications for identity formation and national cohesion. The present monolithic <b>linguistic</b> <b>policies</b> are inherited mainly from a narrow conception of nationalism with Arabism being the dominant ideological model. Although it is not always easy to establish a clear distinction between Arabism and Islamism when dealing with the issue of Arab nationalism it appears that Islam, as a religion, did not play a decisive role in the linguistic choices of the modern Arab and Middle Eastern States. In many cases, the <b>linguistic</b> and cultural <b>policies</b> in favor of Arabization have been implemented by secular States (the Nasserist regime in Egypt, the Baathiste regime in Syria and Irak, the FLN in Algeria) but religious references were also explicitly made to acquire more legacy. It is therefore a combination of secular nationalism and modern political islamism that fed most official discourses supporting Arabization. The Arabization policies failed to ensure national consensus and national unity in a number of Arab countries with sizeable non-Arab minorities...|$|R
