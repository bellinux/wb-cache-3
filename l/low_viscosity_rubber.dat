50|$|Liquid {{silicone}} rubbers are supplied in barrels. Because {{of their}} <b>low</b> <b>viscosity,</b> these <b>rubbers</b> can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the vulcanization equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a metering pump. One {{of the components}} contains the catalyst, typically platinum based. A coloring paste {{as well as other}} additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by transfer molding and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the so-called Green Tyre concept, in the early 90 ies, the use of silica as reinforcing fillers has spread and grown worldwide. The general advantages of silica as reinforcing filler over carbon black filler are better rolling resistance by achieving at least equal wet traction while tread wear should not be adversely affected. In general, high filler loading attributes poor dispersion and lack of adhesion to the rubber matrix which in turn affect the processability and physical properties of the rubber compounds. In this work, the objective {{of the study was to}} investigate the influence of viscosity on silica dispersion and in relation to mechanical and performance properties of Epoxidised Natural Rubber (ENR) compound. The viscosity of the compound was measured via viscometer. The filler flocculation and dispersion was monitored by following the changes in torque and storage modulus at low strain using rheometer MDR 2000 and DisperGrader. The filler network on the other hand was characterised by Rubber Processing Analyzer (RPA) and bound rubber measurements. The physical tests were also done according to the ASTM methods such as tensile strength and abrasion.

TEM images taken on transverse sections parallel to the injection direction reveal that, for high EP/PP viscosity ratios, large (> 1 mu m) undeformed EP nodules are observed up to the surface. The AFM and FMM observations performed on the surface reveal soft regions {{of the same size}} embedded in a more rigid matrix (undeformed EP nodules present at or just below the surface). For <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> ratios, EP <b>rubber</b> nodules, strongly elongated parallel to the surface, are observed by TEM.

40|$|Footprint {{morphology}} (e. g., outline shape, {{depth of}} impression) {{is one of}} the key diagnostic features used in the interpretation of ancient vertebrate tracks. Over 80 tridactyl tracks, confined to the same bedding surface in the Lower Jurassic Elliot Formation at Mafube (eastern Free State, South Africa), show large shape variability over the length of the study site. These morphological differences are considered here to be mainly due to variations in the substrate rheology as opposed to differences in the trackmaker’s foot anatomy, foot kinematics or recent weathering of the bedding surface. The sedimentary structures (e. g., desiccation cracks, ripple marks) preserved in association with and within some of the Mafube tracks suggest that the imprints were produced essentially contemporaneous and are true dinosaur tracks rather than undertracks or erosional remnants. They are therefore valuable not only for the interpretation of the ancient environment (i. e., seasonally dry river channels) but also for taxonomic assessments as some of them closely resemble the original anatomy of the trackmaker’s foot. The tracks are grouped, based on size, into two morphotypes that can be identified as Eubrontes-like and Grallator-like ichnogenera. The Mafube morphotypes are tentatively attributable to large and small tridactyl theropod trackmakers, possibly to Dracovenator and Coelophysis based on the following criteria: (a) lack of manus impressions indicative of obligate bipeds; (b) long, slender-digits that are asymmetrical and taper; (c) often end in a claw impression or point; and (d) the tracks that are longer than broad.

This was performed using different concentrations in media and by coating on polystyrene surfaces. In addition, the bactericidal effect was investigated using a modified direct contact test. The results showed that <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> chitosan in media had both a bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect on planktonic growth and biofilm formation of S. epidermidis in a concentration dependent manner.

With increasing energy and the reach of QGP the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> of the plasma became apparent and this brought a new revolution in the fluid dynamical studies.

40|$|<b>Low</b> <b>viscosity</b> {{base oils}} {{are one of}} the {{candidates}} for fuel saving lubricants for internal combustion engines. These lubricants reduce viscous friction under hydrodynamic conditions, so reduce total energy loss at tribological contact. However, these oils provide thinner oil films resulting in magnified wear. Therefore, wear protection of rubbing surfaces is very important to apply <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> oils in practice. Effects of phosphorus-containing additives on antiwear properties of <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> base oils were evaluated under boundary lubrication conditions using a four-ball type wear tester according to ASTM D 4172. For mineral based oils, dialkyl phosphonates considerably reduced wear whereas trialkyl and triaryl phosphonates did not. Compatibility of additive with mineral based oil depends on the refining process of the oil. Wear prevention by phosphorus-containing additive in solvent-extracted mineral oils was sometimes unpredictable. Additive response for hydrogen-refined mineral oils was better than that for solvent-extracted oils. The results showed good accordance with phosphorus contents on the worn surfaces obtained by surface analysis. At least 0. 062 mass% (620 ppm) of phosphorus is required to achieve sufficient antiwear properties in hydrogen-refined mineral oils. Synthetic esters have good lubricity in comparison with mineral oils. However, conventional antiwear additives for mineral oils are not always effective for synthetic esters, especially <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> esters. Hydroxyalkyl phosphates, with a polar functional group in the molecule, reduced wear effectively even at 0. 016 mass% (160 ppm) of phosphorus in <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> synthetic esters.

40|$|A simple {{model for}} mid-plate swells {{is that of}} {{convection}} in a fluid which has a <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> layer lying between a rigid bed and a constant viscosity region. Finite element calculations {{have been used to}} determine the effects of the viscosity contrast, the layer thickness and the Rayleigh number on the flow and on the perceived compensation mechanism for the resulting topographic swell. As the viscosity decreases in the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> zone, the effective local Rayleigh number for the top boundary layer of the convecting cell increases. Also, because the lower viscosity facilitates greater velocities in the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> zone, the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> layer produces proportionally greater horizontal flow near the conducting lid, causing the base of the conducting lid to appear like a free boundary. The change in the local Rayleigh number and in the effective boundary condition both cause the top boundary layer to thin. Through a Green's function analysis, we have found that the <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> zone damps the response of the surface topography to the temperature anomalies at depth, whereas it causes the gravity and geoid response functions to change sign at depth counteracting the positive contributions from the shallower temperature variations. By increasing the viscosity contrast, the conbined effects of the thinning of the boundary layer and the behaviour of the response functions allow the apparent depth of compensation to become arbitrarily small. Therefore, shallow depths of compensation cannot be used to argue against dynamic support of mid-plate swells. Furthermore, we compared the distribution of the effective compensating densities, which is used to obtain the geoid, to that of Pratt compensation, which is often used to calculate the depth of compensation from geoid and topography data for mid-plate swells. For all of our calculations including those with no <b>low</b> <b>viscosity</b> layer, the effective gravitational mass distribution is more complex than assumed in simple Pratt models, so that the Pratt models are not an appropriate gauge of the compensation mechanism. © 1987...|$|R
