500|$|Although {{no major}} {{problems}} were encountered {{during the initial}} testing phase, some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was {{partly due to the}} tandem main landing gear being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed. During one <b>landing</b> <b>incident,</b> the chain mechanism (used to shorten the gear) in the Mark 1 gear jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation. [...] In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a TCA Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton.|$|E

40|$|A long landing is {{one type}} of flight {{incident}} that will multiply {{the risk of a}} runway excursion. It occurs frequently but receives little attention in research due to difficulty in obtaining the real flight data. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discover key flight parameter features of long <b>landing</b> <b>incidents</b> by analyzing Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data and put forward prevention measures from the perspective of pilot operation at the same time. First, 73 flight performance parameter variables and 4 operation parameter variables were defined, covering major landing stages from 1500 ft to touchdown. Then 128 cases of selected QAR data were divided into two groups according to the threshold of identifying normal and long landing. Second, each flight parameter variable of these 128 flights was compared between groups and then the logistic and linear regression models were developed respectively to further examine the links between touchdown distance and these flight parameter variables. Third, potential flight operation causing performance difference of long <b>landing</b> <b>incidents</b> was also analyzed. Finally results indicate that the period of 200 ft to touchdown is the key stage of landing and flare is the most critical operation affecting touchdown distance. It is suggested that the pilot should inspect the ratio of descent rate and groundspeed carefully at the height of 50 ft and pilot&# 39;s faster and steady pulling up columns is probably helpful for an excellent flare and landing. The findings are expected to be applied into flight operation practice for further preventing long <b>landing</b> <b>incidents</b> and even the runway excursion accidents. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Examples of {{this process}} is a series of {{aircraft}} intended for the Uragan project developed by the Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau. The Mikoyan-Gurevich I-3U became the I-7U when the proposed engine was canceled. An armament change resuted in the I-7K, and after a <b>landing</b> <b>incident,</b> the I-7K became the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-75 after it was rebuilt. The I-3/7/75 design progressed as the Ye-6, later becoming the Ye-50P and ultimately the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21F. The Sukhoi design bureau also produced a series of experimental aircraft for the Uragan program. Among them are the Sukhoi P-1, T-3, T-405, Su-9, Su-9U, T-431 and finally Su-11. Similar designs were proposed by Yakovlev and Lavochkin.|$|E
50|$|In September 1937, the {{prototype}} {{was delivered to}} the Centre d'Essais de Matériels Aériens at Vélizy-Villacoublay for the type's official evaluation. On 6 December 1937, it {{was involved in a}} forced <b>landing</b> <b>incident</b> as a result of both engines having failed simultaneously in mid-flight; the pilot, Jea Doumerc, was able to land without sustaining any damage. The prototype was promptly returned to the manufacturer for adjustments prior to the resumption of evaluation flights. In July 1938, {{the prototype}}, fitted with the new Mercier-designed cowlings, attained 500 km/h (270 knots, 311 mph). The earlier instability issues were partially addressed via the adoption of redesigned twin fins and rudders on the tail unit.|$|E

50|$|China Express Airlines, {{also known}} as Huaxia Airlines, is China's first private {{regional}} airline. The airline was established in May 2006 and is owned by Cathay Fortune (40%), High Zero (25%), Tampines International (24%) and others (11%). On August 28, 2011, a China Express Airlines Bombardier CRJ 200 regional jet scraped the ground on landing at Guiyang Airport in southwest China. No one was injured during the incident. On 1 September 2010, China's Civil Aviation Administration ordered the airline to suspend operations after a <b>landing</b> <b>incident</b> at Guiyang Longdongbao International Airport in which an aircraft's right wing made contact with the runway during landing. The airline was ordered to review its safety regulations and perform {{an investigation into the}} incident. On 6 September, Chinese authorities allowed the airline to resume partial operations; according to a spokesperson, the company planned to resume full operations within two weeks.|$|E
5000|$|On July 26, 2015, a Piper PA-46 Malibu piloted by Taishi Kawamura and {{carrying}} four passengers on board, {{crashed into a}} residential area just after take-off. Three {{people died in the}} crash, including the pilot, one of the passengers, and a woman on the ground. The other three passengers survived with injuries, as did two people on the ground. Witnesses on the ground reported that the engine made an abnormal sound as it flew over them. Several videos were uploaded to YouTube showing the airplane flying lower than usual after take-off. Three investigators from the Japan Transport Safety Board were soon dispatched to the accident site. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department also launched an investigation, suspecting professional negligence resulting in injury and death. Initial investigative work revealed the airplane was involved in a <b>landing</b> <b>incident</b> at an airport in Hokkaido in October 2004. Several anomalies with the flight plan were also found.

50|$|SAHSA and TAN {{merged into}} TAN-SAHSA {{in the early}} 1990s. It was based at Toncontín International Airport in Tegucigalpa and flew from Honduras to various {{destinations}} throughout Central and North and South America. The TAN-SAHSA name was used between 1990 and 1991, when the name TAN disappeared. The airline continued to operate as SAHSA until its demise in 1994. The collapse was partly due to corruption and partly to the airline's poor safety record. The airline experienced several accidents during its operational life, including a major crash of a 727 in 1989 in Honduras, killing 131 of 146 passengers aboard, and a subsequent emergency <b>landing</b> <b>incident</b> on a Houston-bound 737 plane in 1993, after which the airline lost its FAA Air Operations Certificate and with it its operating privileges to the United States. No longer able to fly to the United States, financial pressures caused the airline to cease flight operations in late 1993 and it was disbanded in January 1994. Following the collapse of SAHSA, Honduras had no national airline until 2002, when Sol Air commenced operations.|$|E

5000|$|Malfunctions {{or human}} errors (or a {{combination}} of these) related to retractable landing gear have been the cause of numerous accidents and incidents throughout aviation history. Distraction and preoccupation during the landing sequence played {{a prominent role in}} the approximately 100 gear-up landing incidents that occurred each year in the United States between 1998 and 2003. [...] A gear-up <b>landing</b> <b>incident,</b> also known as a belly landing, is an accident that may result from the pilot simply forgetting, or failing, to lower the landing gear before landing or a mechanical malfunction that does not allow the landing gear to be lowered. Although rarely fatal, a gear-up landing is very expensive, as it causes massive airframe damage. If the landing results in a prop strike, a complete engine rebuild may also be required. Many aircraft between the wars - at the time when retractable gear was becoming commonplace - were deliberately designed to allow the bottom of the wheels to protrude below the fuselage even when retracted to reduce the damage caused if the pilot forgot to extend the landing gear or in case the plane was shot down and forced to crash-land. Examples include the Avro Anson, Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Douglas DC-3. The modern-day Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II carries on this legacy: it is similarly designed in an effort to avoid (further) damage during a gear-up landing, a possible consequence of battle damage.|$|E
