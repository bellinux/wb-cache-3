40|$|There {{are many}} {{regions in the}} {{developing}} world that suffer from poor infrastructure and lack of connection to the Internet and Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTN). Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a technology that has been advocated for providing store-and-forward network connectivity in these regions over the past few years. DTN often relies on human mobility {{in one form or another}} to support transportation of DTN data. This presents a socio-technical problem related to organizing how the data should be transported. In some situations the demand for DTN traffic can exceed that which is possible to support with human mobility, so alternative mechanisms are needed. In this paper we propose using <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> pigeons (columba livia) to transport DTN data. Carrier pigeons have been used for transporting packets of information for a long time, but have not yet been seriously considered for transporting DTN traffic. We provide arguements that this mode of DTN data transport provides promise, and should receive attention from research and development projects. We provide an overview of pigeon characteristics to analyze the feasibility of using them for data transport, and present simulations of a DTN network that utilizes pigeon transport in order to provide an initial investigation into expected performance characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Various probiotics and immunostimulants {{have been}} shown to enhance the immune {{response}} and alter the disease resistance of aquaculture organisms. The bacterial energy storage compound poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) for example improves resistance against pathogenic infections in shrimp (Laranja et al., 2014) and exhibits a controlling effect on the gut microbiota of juvenile sea bass which may result in the stimulation of immune functions (De Schryver et al., 2011). These properties might be of special importance for culturing early life stages since their immune system is not yet fully developed. Therefore, we assessed the potential immunostimulating effect of PHB in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae in our study.

40|$|C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice were vaccinated {{with either}} live or heat-killed Mycobacterium bovis {{bacillus}} Calmette-Guérin (BCG) organisms, and splenic T cells {{were used to}} screen the stimulatory potential of fractionated somatic and secreted mycobacterial proteins by production of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). Maximum responses were obtained with fractionated secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. There was no single dominant antigen, but five regions of mycobacterial proteins induced high concentrations of IFN-gamma. However, {{only two of the}} five regions stimulated T cells from both mouse strains: two were exclusively recognized by T cells from BALB/c mice, and one was exclusively recognized by T cells from C 57 BL/ 6 mice. T cells from mice vaccinated with heat-killed M. bovis BCG organisms failed to respond to fractionated secreted proteins but recognized several somatic antigen fractions. As late as 1 year after primary vaccination, memory T cells responded to similar protein regions, and IFN-gamma production was intensified by secondary infection. Our data confirm a central role for secreted proteins in immunity to mycobacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate that a major set of mycobacterium-reactive T cells is stimulated only by vaccination with live but not with heat-killed M. bovis BCG organisms. Because a major impact of genetic host factors on antigen recognition was observed, we favor the use of <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> organisms which secrete mycobacterial proteins over subunit vaccines as an improved antituberculosis vaccine...|$|E
40|$|The 70 -kilobase pYV plasmid of Yersinia enterocolitica encodes {{a set of}} {{proteins}} called Yops that are produced during infection. To use Y. enterocolitica as a <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> to present the cholera toxin B (CT-B) subunit to the immune system, we constructed an operon fusion between ctxB and the yop 51 gene. This operon fusion was either cloned on an RSF 1010 -derived plasmid or integrated into the pYV plasmid itself. In Y. enterocolitica, both constructions directed the synthesis of free CT-B only under conditions of Yops production, i. e., at 37 degrees C in a medium deprived of Ca 2 +. Bacteria containing both types of recombinant plasmids were given orally to mice. A serum antibody response against CT-B was detected in both cases. A secretory immunoglobulin A activity specific to CT-B was also observed in the intestinal secretions. According to immunoblot analysis, the serum antibody response was only directed against the polymeric form of the B subunit. The ctxB gene was also inserted in frame within yop 51, giving a chimeric Yop 51 -CT-B protein that was secreted into the surrounding medium. In this case, however, no antibody response was observed after oral inoculation of mice. This lack of response probably results from {{the inability of the}} hybrid protein to assemble into the polymeric form of the B subunit...|$|E
40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica has the {{capacity}} to invade the intestinal tissue and to resist the primary host resistance. The former is chromosome coded while the second largely depends on the presence of a 70 kb plasmid called pYV. This plasmid directs the conditional synthesis of high amounts of proteins (YOPs) that are secreted and inserted in the outer membrane. In order to evaluate Y. enterocolitica W 22703 as a potential <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> for immunization, three strains expressing beta-galactosidase (GZ), were tested for their ability to induce an antibody response to this antigen in mice. The first strain contained plasmid pGC 1256, a mutated pYV plasmid containing lacZ transcribed from a yop gene promoter. This strain produced high amounts of GZ instead of a YOP protein and was shown to be hypovirulent. The other strains tested were W 22703 pYV+ and pYV- containing a derepressed lac operon carried on an independent plasmid. Immunoblot analysis of sera of mice having received by oral inoculation, W 22703 (pGC 1256) or the pYV+ GZ producing strain revealed the presence of antibodies to GZ. The response to GZ after inoculation of W 22703 (pGC 1256) was shown by ELISA to be only slightly inferior to that obtained by subcutaneous injection of GZ. No response was obtained after oral inoculation of the pYV-GZ producing strain. This showed that the presence of pYV was necessary to obtain an antibody response in this system...|$|E

40|$|Attenuated Salmonella enterica strains {{have been}} widely used as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> for {{vaccines}} and therapeutic molecules. Appropriate attenuation has been introduced into such bacteria for safety reasons and the improvement of strain properties. Here, we compared two strains that were rendered auxotroph for diaminopimelic acid or thymidine monophosphate precursors by deletion of the genes asd or thyA, respectively. Upon removal of the complementing compound from bacterial cultures, both strains quickly lose their property to form colonies. However, while the Deltaasd bacteria lysed almost immediately under such conditions, DeltathyA bacteria remained physically intact during the observation period. As a consequence, the Deltaasd bacteria released their intracellular content such as proteins or plasmids into the supernatant. In contrast, no intracellular component, either proteins or plasmids, could be recovered from the supernatants of DeltathyA bacteria upon depletion of thymidine. Thus, the release of macromolecules from the bacterial carrier occurs as a consequence of appropriate lethal attenuation. This might substitute for sophisticated secretion systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi {{is a human}} {{pathogenic}} microorganism with a {{very complex}} infective cycle, involving the transit of bacteria across different microenvironments; to optimize the performance of attenuated Salmonella strains suitable as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> of heterologous antigens, fine tuning of wild type bacteria gene expression is essential. Several DNA fragments were obtained from a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (vi+, fim+) blood isolate and 18 clones were selected according to the dimension of the insert (range < 0. 2 - 1. 6 kb). These fragments showed a transcriptional activity in a promoterless vector cloned in Escherichia coli background, according to homogeneous parameters. The results obtained provide an insight about signals mediating gene activation in vivo, particularly in the microenvironments known to exist during the infectious process, even if the fragments are not promoters sequences. Finally, the functional characterization of several fragments showed that they possessed an efficient and homogeneous transcriptional activity, worth to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|BCG, the {{attenuated}} strain of Mycobacterium bovis, {{has been widely}} used as a vaccine against tuberculosis and is thus an important candidate as a <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> for multiple antigens. With the aim of developing a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT), we analyzed the potential of CRM 197, a mutated nontoxic derivative of diphtheria toxin, as the recombinant antigen for a BCG-based vaccine against diphtheria. Expression of CRM 197 in rBCG was achieved using Escherichia coli-mycobacterium shuttle vectors {{under the control of}} pBlaF*, an upregulated β-lactamase promoter from Mycobacterium fortuitum. Immunization of mice with rBCG-CRM 197 elicited an anti-diphtheria toxoid antibody response, but the sera of immunized mice were not able to neutralize diphtheria toxin (DTx) activity. On the other hand, a subimmunizing dose of the conventional diphtheria-tetanus vaccine, administered in order to mimic an infection, showed that rBCG-CRM 197 was able to prime the induction of a humoral response within shorter periods. Interestingly, the antibodies produced showed neutralizing activity only when the vaccines had been given as a mixture in combination with rBCG expressing tetanus toxin fragment C (FC), suggesting an adjuvant effect of rBCG-FC on the immune response induced by rBCG-CRM 197. Isotype analysis of the anti-diphtheria toxoid antibodies induced by the combined vaccines, but not rBCG-CRM 197 alone, showed an immunoglobulin G 1 -dominant profile, as did the conventional vaccine. Our results show that rBCG expressing CRM 197 can elicit a neutralizing humoral response and encourage further studies on the development of a DPT vaccine with rBCG...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} awareness that secondary metabolites produced by marine diatoms negatively impact the reproductive success of their principal predators, the copepods. Several oxylipins, products of the enzymatic oxidation of fatty acids, are produced when these unicellular algae are damaged, as occurs during grazing. In the past, the dinoflagellate Prorocentrum minimum, which does not produce the oxylipin 2 -trans, 4 -trans-decadienal (DD), {{has been used as a}} <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> to calculate daily ingestion rates of this molecule by copepod crustaceans. However, since the interaction between oxylipins and live carriers is unknown, the question as to how much and for how long ingestion of these molecules affects copepod reproduction remains a critical point to understanding the functional role of such compounds at sea. In the investigation presented here we used giant liposomes (approximately 7 mum) as a delivery system for the oxylipin DD, prepared in the same size range as copepod food and containing known amounts of DD. The aim of this work was to relate the ingestion of DD to the reproductive failure of the copepods Temora stylifera and Calanus helgolandicus. Liposomes were very stable over time and after 10 days of feeding, liposomes encapsulating DD reduced egg hatching success and female survival with a concomitant appearance of apoptosis in both copepod embryos and female tissues. Concentrations of DD inducing blockage were one order of magnitude lower that those used in classical feeding experiments demonstrating that liposomes are a useful tool to quantitatively analyze the impact of toxins on copepods...|$|E

TNFRp 55 −/−, IL- 12 p 40 −/−, and IL- 18 −/− mutant mice, in which the Yersinia wild-type strain causes severe systemic infections, were used to investigate whether these Yersinia mutant strains would be attenuated in immunodeficient hosts. A plasmid-cured Yersinia mutant strain was unable to colonize any of the mutant mice tested. A SycH-deficient mutant strain colonized intestinal tissues of these mice but was attenuated for systemic infection {{in all of the}} mutant mice. Both YadA- and Irp- 1 -deficient Yersinia mutants were still attenuated in IL- 12 −/− and IL- 18 −/− mice but were pathogenic in TNFRp 55 −/− mice. By contrast, a Yersinia sodA mutant was highly pathogenic for TNFRp 55 −/− and IL- 12 p 40 −/− mice while interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) was dispensable. This finding demonstrates that certain virulence factors enable yersiniae to compete with distinct cytokine-dependent host defense mechanisms. Moreover, while gamma interferon mRNA expression did not reflect protective host responses in cytokine-deficient mice, IL- 10 expression coincided with a heavy splenic bacterial load and was associated with progressive infection courses. We can thus segregate minor (SodA), intermediate (YadA and IRP- 1), and major (YopH) virulence factors of Y. enterocolitica. Finally, we demonstrate that, even in immunocompromised hosts, Yersinia sycH and, with some restrictions, irp- 1 mutants may be suitable for use as <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> vaccines...|$|E

40|$|After {{incubation}} at 37 degrees C in {{the absence}} of Ca 2 + ions, pathogenic strains of Yersinia spp. release large amounts of a set of plasmid-encoded proteins called Yops. The secretion of these proteins, involved in pathogenicity, occurs via a mechanism that involves neither the removal of a signal sequence nor the recognition of a C-terminal domain. Analysis of deletion mutants allowed the secretion recognition domain to be localized within the 48 N-terminal amino acids of protein YopH, within the 98 N-terminal residues of protein YopE, and within the 76 N-terminal residues of YopQ. Comparison of these regions failed to reveal any sequence similarity, suggesting that the secretion signal of Yop proteins is conformational rather than sequential. Hybrid proteins containing the amino-terminal part of YopH fused to either the alpha-peptide of beta-galactosidase or to alkaline phosphatase deprived of its signal sequence were efficiently secreted to the Yersinia culture medium.

Oral immunization with vaccines composed of killed pathogens or subunit proteins as antigens generally resulted in low immune responses, lack of protection and absence of an immune memory. <b>Live</b> <b>carriers</b> such as bacteria presenting homologous or heterologous antigens induce a mucosal immunity and thereby provide local protection.

40|$|Several new {{generation}} vaccines {{have been developed}} and commercialized. Live bacteria delivered by the oral route are interesting tools for mucosal immunization. Lactococcus lactis, a {{generally regarded as safe}} (GRAS) organism, is widely used in food industry and genetic engineering. The food grade lactic acid bacterium is particularly suitable as <b>live</b> <b>carrier</b> to deliver protective antigens to the mucosal immune system. L. lactis present an attractive approach for recombinant vaccines because of their ease of administration, low cost of manufacturing and effective stimulation of the mucosal immune response. In this study, enterovirus 71 capsid protein VP 1 or VP 1 epitopes (VP 1 e) was used as model antigen. Three expression systems for targeting the model antigen to cytoplasm, cell wall, and extracellular medium of L. lactis were developed. The PslpA- 1, SPslpA and anchor motif from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 were used as expression signal, secretion signal and carrier protein for the display of model antigen on the cell surface, respectively. In addition, an antigen display and delivery system based on non-genetically L. lactis or gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) was developed. The expression of VP 1 in the cytoplasm of L. lactis could not be detected evidently by using SDS-PAGE and western blot. We suggest that the intracellular protease degrade the cytoplasmic form of VP 1. The secretion system constructed in this study was successfully used for extracellular production of antifreeze protein and VP 1 e. Construction of plasmids used for surface display of GFP+ and VP 1 e was unfortunately failed due to base deletion in the insertional DNA fragment. We also used Escherichia coli T 7 expression system to express VP 1 e-anchor motif fusion protein. The purified fusion protein was anchored onto the outer surface of L. lactis and the GEM. The strategy has potential application in development of non-genetically L. lactis as vaccine carrier. We will further determine the effect of genetically and non-genetically L. lactis on the stimulation of the immune system. 隨著科技之進步，目前已有許多新型之疫苗被開發與商業化。而其中以細菌作為疫苗攜帶者(vaccine carrier) 更是一項新興的技術。乳酸菌為安全級食用菌株，近年來於遺傳工程研究上也有相當的進展，極適合開發成為疫苗攜帶者，以其作為疫苗攜帶者之優點包括有疫苗投與方便、有效降低生產成本以及可引發有效之黏膜免疫反應。 本論文之目的即在開發重組乳酸鏈球菌(Lactococcus lactis) 口服疫苗。實驗中以腸病毒 71 型外鞘蛋白VP 1 或VP 1 抗原決定部位 (VP 1 e) 作為抗原模式，分別建構胞內表現、胞外分泌以及細胞表層展示之乳酸菌表現系統，同時也利用非基因工程方式分別於乳酸菌細胞表面及分離自乳酸菌之細胞壁成分(gram-positive enhancer matrix, GEM) 進行 VP 1 e之表層展示，並比較不同系統用於口服疫苗之適用性。 乳酸菌表現載體之構築乃以帶有broad-host-range pSH 71 ori之載體pNZ 8008 為主幹，採用來自Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 表層蛋白(S-layer protein) 的啟動子(PslpA- 1) 作為表現元件，訊息胜肽(SPslpA) 作為分泌訊號以及錨定功能區塊(第 115 至第 412 胺基酸序列) 作為表層展示之攜帶者蛋白(carrier protein) 。論文中成功建構乳酸菌胞內表現及分泌表現載體。在VP 1 蛋白質於胞內表現之部分，無法利用蛋白質電泳及西方墨點法清楚觀察到重組蛋白質之表現，推測可能是胞內表現之蛋白質受到胞內蛋白酶降解所致。利用抗凍蛋白作為模式蛋白質，證實建立之分泌表現系統可運用於乳酸鏈球菌。進一步利用此分泌系統可大量分泌VP 1 e。乳酸菌表層展示載體之建構方面，不管是模式蛋白綠螢光蛋白或抗原蛋白質VP 1 e之基因均發生點刪除之突變現象，而無法建構完成。在非基因工程策略中，利用大腸桿菌T 7 表現系統大量表現VP 1 e-anchor motif，之後利用金屬親合性管柱層析純化重組融合蛋白質，將純化之重組融合蛋白質與乳酸鏈球菌及GEM進行共置培養，結果證實重組融合蛋白質能結合於細胞表面。未來可利用動物試驗評估不同系統作為口服疫苗之可行性。本論文中使用之重組乳酸菌皆以抗藥性基因作為篩選標誌，未來可朝向食品級表現系統之建立，以建立食品級口服乳酸菌疫苗。內容目錄		 頁數 中文摘要	 [...] .

40|$|Pathogenic {{microorganisms}} possess antioxidant defense {{mechanisms for}} protection from reactive oxygen metabolites which are generated during the respiratory burst of phagocytic cells. These defense mechanisms include enzymes such as catalase, which detoxifies reactive oxygen species, and DNA repair systems, which repair damage resulting from oxidative stress. To (i) determine {{the relative importance of}} the DNA repair system when oxidative stress is encountered by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex during infection of the host and to (ii) provide improved mycobacterial hosts as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> to express foreign antigens, the recA locus was inactivated by allelic exchange in Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The recA mutants are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and show increased susceptibility to metronidazole, the first lead compound active against the dormant M. tuberculosis complex. Surprisingly, the recA genotype does not affect the in vitro dormancy response, nor does the defect in the DNA repair system lead to attenuation as determined in a mouse infection model. The recA mutants will be a valuable tool for further development of BCG as an antigen delivery system to express foreign antigens and as a source of a genetically stable vaccine against tuberculosis...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mortality}} during fish {{early life}} stages {{is a major}} bottleneck in aquaculture. Therefore, the establishment of methods to prevent and control diseases, to ensure efficient growth and to reach maximal survival rates is mandatory to optimize the productivity. A promising solution can be the early activation {{of the immune system}} by administration of probiotics as nutritional supplements. In our study we assess the effect of the probiotic candidate Bacillus subtilis on the innate and adaptive immune response of juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Therefore, Artemia nauplii were used as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> to feed B. subtilis to 3 -month-old sea bass over a period of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the juveniles were fed another week without administering B. subtilis in order to estimate the bacterial mucus-binding ability. During the course of the experiment, we evaluated direct effects on the cellular immune response by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and on survival. As a next step we will determine profiles of immune gene expression. To estimate cellular stress, the expression level of metabolism- and stress-related genes will be measured. Furthermore, the RNA/DNA ratio as an indicator of growth will be analysed...|$|R
40|$|Salmonella strains {{have great}} {{potential}} as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> of heterologous antigens to induce immunity against {{a variety of}} infectious diseases. However, the amount of heterologous antigen required to induce an adequate immune response may be toxic for the bacterium and result in cell death, overattenuation or loss of expression of the heterologous antigen. To solve this problem an expression vector was developed with a strong promoter located on a DNA fragment which is inverted at random. Antigen is only expressed in one particular orientation of the promoter. Thus a bacterial population harbouring the plasmid will consist of a subpopulation which does not produce heterologous antigen, and is therefore not affected in growth, persistence and dissemination within the host. Further, this non-producing population will continuously segregate antigen-producing bacteria. To evaluate the system, CtxB {{was used as a}} model antigen. Analysis of the plasmid DNA isolated from Salmonella revealed a selection against the promoter orientation that directs transcription of the ctxB gene. In spite of this, the vector was stably maintained in vivo and induced CtxB-specific IgA and IgG in mice. These results indicate that this kind of expression vector may offer {{a solution to the problem}} of unstable expression of foreign antigens in live bacterial vaccine strains...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the scope}} of the DEPROHEALTH project, a range of {{wild-type}} strains of Lactobacillus were analysed for their ability to interact with the host immune system. While the studied isolates interacted in a strain-specific way with immune cells, they seemed to have little and non-discriminative effect on epithelial cells. However, they were shown to facilitate the cross-talk between intestinal and immune cells. Studies conducted in mouse colitis models confirmed that specific strains possess higher intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties. Two of these were further engineered to produce murine IL 10 and are presently being evaluated for their protective effect in a TNBS colitis model. Cell wall mutants of Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 8826 were analysed for their phenotypic traits, immune modulatory ability and capacity to act as <b>live</b> <b>carriers.</b> This led to the identification of mutants with increased anti-inflammatory or antigen delivery properties. Substantial work was invested in attempts to increase the immune response induced by recombinant lactobacilli producing Helicobacter or rotavirus antigens. In the course of these experiments, new methods to evaluate the load of Helicobacter in infected mice were developed. Novel targeting signals for cell surface presentation of therapeutic molecules were also identified. Finally, a safe biologically contained lactococcal strain secreting human IL 10 was constructed, thus opening the way to a first clinical trial in patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ...|$|R

40|$|Global {{aquaculture}} production is growing rapidly, however, {{the industry is}} facing great challenges such as high mortality rates during early life stages. The lack of a fully mature immune system makes larvae highly sensitive to infectious diseases. One {{of the most common}} pathogenic bacteria in larviculture is Vibrio anguillarum causing worldwide severe economic losses. Due to the development of antibiotic resistances, the establishment of alternative methods to prevent and control diseases, ensure efficient growth and reach maximal survival rates is mandatory to optimize aquaculture productivity. A promising solution might be the early activation of the immature immune system of fish larvae by administration of immunostimulants as nutritional supplements. In our study we assessed the potential immunomodulatory effect of poly-ß-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae. PHB is a bacterial energy storage compound which may have a potential application as an immunostimulant in fish culture. In our experiment we used rotifers as <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> to feed PHB-accumulating bacteria (Alcaligenes eutrophus) to first-feeding European sea bass larvae over a period of 14 days. To estimate the immediate impact of PHB, larval mortality rates were monitored daily {{during the course of the}} experiment. In order to assess the disease resistance of the larvae, survival rates after bath challenge with Vibrio anguillarum after 3 and 14 days of PHB treatment and 7 days post PHB treatment were monitored. Furthermore, we determined gene expression profiles for immune genes as well as metabolism- and stress-related genes. Results will be discussed in respect to the use of PHB in fish hatcheries and its effect on the immune system of first feeding sea bass...|$|R
40|$|Vectorial {{vaccines}} are {{predicted to}} yield novel therapeutic and protective approaches. They consist of recombinant <b>live</b> <b>carriers</b> that express antigen from an unrelated pathogen in the recipient. Promising viral carriers are host-restricted pox viruses that trigger a strong immune response without ability to replicate {{in the human}} organism. A block in replication is an important safety featurethatallowsapplicationeveninimmunocompromized recipients. However, {{with this type of}} attenuation there is not even limited amplification of the vector at the site of infection and therefore very high numbers of infectious units have to be given per dose for full efficacy. Hence, if such vectors are to be used in global vaccine programs highly efficient production processes will be required. Furthermore, to combat diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis C, tuberculosis, or malaria with these vectors, millions of the concentrated vaccine units will have to be provided annually. Any production process therefore should also be scalable and preferrably transferrable to newly industrialized countries. Latter requirement demands a robust process independent of the complex logistics and uncertainties associated with primary chicken cells, the current industrial substrate for these pox viruses and certain other vectors. We believe that we have solved most of the upstream challenges with a chemically defined suspension culture production process for three disparate members of the highly attenuated poxviruses [1]: modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), fowlpoxvirus (FPV) and canarypoxvirus ALVAC. The process is independent of primary material and based on the continuous duck suspension cell line AGE 1. CR specifically created as a vaccine substrate [2]. In contrast to production of influenza virus that readily replicates in the cell proliferation medium [3], development of a production process for poxviruses wa...|$|R

Nowadays, Escherichia coli-Mycobacteria shuttle plasmids are commonly used {{to take full advantage of}} the molecular biological tools developed in E. coli, before transferring the final constructions into the mycobacterial species. However, plasmid analysis of mycobacterial transformants still presents major difficulties. The slow growth rate of cell cultures impedes rapid analysis of recombinant bacteria (see Table 1). Moreover, yields of extracted plasmid DNA are usually poor, essentially due to the high resistance of Mycobacteria to standar...|$|R
