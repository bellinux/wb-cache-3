Game Informer cited the games [...] "exquisite" [...] backdrops but bemoaned its long load times each time players enter a new environment or engage an enemy. GameSpot said the game had a cinematic look, and had an [...] "astounding" [...] level of detail for real life locations in New York City. The lack of any voice acting or singing, however, hindered dramatic scenes such as the opera and subsequent mass combustion of the entire audience at the game's start.|$|E

He found On Stranger Tides to be [...] "precisely what you'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride: a whole lot of noise, plenty of stunts and complete silliness." [...] British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his 5 Live show, saying [...] "it's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part, because it is just nothing, it is just a big empty nothing, whereas part three I think was an active atrocity, it's just nothing at all".|$|E
500|$|Harmonia is {{a visual}} novel {{in which the}} player assumes the role of Rei. The {{gameplay}} is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue and follows a <b>linear</b> <b>plot</b> line; this is what Key refers to as a [...] "kinetic novel". The text in the game is accompanied by character sprites, which represent who Rei is talking to, over background art. Throughout the game, the player encounters CG artwork at certain points in the story, which {{take the place of}} the background art and character sprites. Once the game is completed, a gallery of the game's CGs and background music becomes available on the title screen. The story takes place in a town with a stable water source that supports a small population. Frequented locations include the church where Rei and Shiona live, the library where Tipi lives, and the town plaza. The town also has various establishments, including a general store, a photo studio, and a bar. Although most of the town does not have electricity, there is a solar-powered battery in the library. On the outskirts of town, there is a ruined Phiroid factory next to the town dump.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} in 1823 of Q1—whose existence {{had been quite}} unsuspected—caused considerable interest and excitement, raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation. Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1, which {{was instrumental in the}} development of the concept of a Shakespearean [...] "bad quarto". Yet Q1 has value: it contains stage directions (such as Ophelia entering with a lute and her hair down) that reveal actual stage practices in a way that Q2 and F1 do not; it contains an entire scene (usually labelled 4.6) that does not appear in either Q2 or F1; and it is useful for comparison with the later editions. The major deficiency of Q1 is in the language: particularly noticeable in the opening lines of the famous [...] "To be, or not to be" [...] soliloquy: [...] "To be, or not to be, aye there's the point. / To die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all: / No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes." [...] However, the scene order is more coherent, without the problems of Q2 and F1 of Hamlet seeming to resolve something in one scene and enter the next drowning in indecision. New Cambridge editor Kathleen Irace has noted that [...] "Q1's more <b>linear</b> <b>plot</b> design is certainly easier [...] to follow [...] but the simplicity of the Q1 plot arrangement eliminates the alternating plot elements that correspond to Hamlet's shifts in mood." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{frequency}} response diagram plots the microphone sensitivity in decibels over {{a range of}} frequencies (typically 20Hz to 20kHz), generally for perfectly on-axis sound (sound arriving at 0° to the capsule). Frequency response may be less informatively stated textually like so: [...] "30Hz–16kHz±3dB". This is interpreted as meaning a nearly flat, <b>linear,</b> <b>plot</b> between the stated frequencies, with variations in amplitude {{of no more than}} plus or minus 3dB. However, one cannot determine from this information how smooth the variations are, nor in what parts of the spectrum they occur. Note that commonly made statements such as [...] "20Hz–20kHz" [...] are meaningless without a decibel measure of tolerance. Directional microphones' {{frequency response}} varies greatly with distance from the sound source, and with the geometry of the sound source. IEC60268-4 specifies that frequency response should be measured in plane progressive wave conditions (very far away from the source) but this is seldom practical. Close talking microphones may be measured with different sound sources and distances, but there is no standard and therefore no way to compare data from different models unless the measurement technique is described.|$|E
