5|$|The Woodsmen's Show attracts {{thousands}} of visitors to Cherry Springs State Park on the first weekend in August. It has been held every year since 1952, and has been sponsored by the Galeton Rotary Club since 1987. In 2008events at the three-day show included tree-felling, cross-cutting, log rolling, axe-throwing, horse pulling, spring board chopping, the standing block chop, and chainsaw competitions and demonstrations. The 2008show also featured historic recreations {{of life in a}} <b>logging</b> <b>camp,</b> musical performances, and vendors selling food, crafts, and equipment related to the lumber industry.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a <b>logging</b> <b>camp</b> near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E
5|$|With few ties in Britain, {{he decided}} to emigrate to Canada, {{arriving}} in Nova Scotia in 1907, where he gained work {{on a farm in}} Saskatchewan. From 1909 to 1911 he worked at a confectioner's warehouse, and then for a further nine months at a <b>logging</b> <b>camp,</b> before gaining a job as an accounting clerk at the British Columbia Electric Railway in April 1912. He had come to loath Christianity and the Victorian moral systems that he associated with it; instead he began reading about Eastern religion, yoga, and Western esotericism. While at work, he met Charles Stansfeld Jones, a Thelemite who shared Smith's interest in these subjects and who lent him copies of Aleister Crowley's Book 4 and volume one, number one of The Equinox. Intrigued, Smith paid to join Crowley's Britain-based magical order, the A∴A∴, in doing so obtaining more of Crowley's writings. He began performing many of the practices encouraged by the group, including yoga and the keeping of a diary recording his magical endeavours.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Remnants of {{railroad}} <b>logging</b> <b>camps,</b> and their associated features, are {{perhaps some of}} the most common archaeological resources found on public lands in the Pacific Northwest. Many camps have already been located, their cultural materials inventoried, and networks of logging railroad grades mapped. Yet, despite these efforts, little can be said about the people who made those transportable communities their homes. This study focuses on the social and physical conditions {{of railroad}} <b>logging</b> <b>camps</b> of the Shevlin-Hixon Company of Bend, Oregon, from the company's inception in 1916 until it ceased operations in 1950. Historical literature combined with oral history interviews are used to describe camp movement and physical layout, living accommodations, community amenities, and the kind of social life Shevlin-Hixon <b>logging</b> <b>camps</b> offered its residents. The information presented here not only presents a historical picture of a community that no longer exists but should provide future researchers, particularly cultural resource specialists, with a rudimentary model by which to assess similar railroad <b>logging</b> <b>camps</b> and features throughout the Pacific Northwest...|$|R

25|$|The first {{regular service}} between the City of North Vancouver and Vancouver began in 1900 with the craft North Vancouver. Three years later, the North Vancouver Ferry and Power Company was created, {{took over the}} {{existing}} service, and built a new craft called St. George. These two ferries were later renamed North Vancouver Ferry No. 1 and North Vancouver Ferry No. 2. The City of North Vancouver took over the service in 1908 {{to provide a more}} reliable ferry connection with Downtown Vancouver. Soon after, another craft, North Vancouver Ferry No. 3, was built. In 1936, the No. 2 was retired and used as a <b>logging</b> <b>camp</b> on the west coast of Vancouver Island until it was destroyed by fire.|$|E

500|$|Frantic and guilt-stricken, Harry Glicken {{convinced}} {{three separate}} helicopter pilots {{to take him}} up on flights over the devastated area in a rescue attempt, but the eruption had so changed the landscape that {{they were unable to}} locate any sign of the ColdwaterII observation post, which had been swept away and buried in the blast. He and the helicopter crew did manage to find a car with people in it at a <b>logging</b> <b>camp,</b> but when they landed to attempt an evacuation, skin fell off the dead victims' hands. Shortly after the eruption, Don Swanson found Johnston's backpack and parka buried in the rubble, but he hid the discovery from all but a few people for fear that scavengers (who were already removing and selling souvenirs of victims of the volcano) would find and remove his friend's body or belongings. In 1993, while building a [...] extension of Washington State Route 504 (also called [...] "Spirit Lake Memorial Highway") to lead to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, construction workers discovered pieces of Johnston's trailer. His body, however, has never been recovered.|$|E

500|$|The Word for World is Forest begins {{from the}} point of view of Captain Davidson, who is the {{commander}} of a <b>logging</b> <b>camp</b> named Smith camp. Many native Athsheans are used as slave labor at the camp, and also as personal servants. The novel begins with Davidson travelling to [...] "Centralville", the headquarters of the colony, hoping to have a sexual encounter with one of a number of women who have just arrived on the predominantly male colony. When Davidson returns to Smith Camp, he finds the entire camp burned to the ground, and all of the humans dead. He lands to investigate, and while on the ground is overpowered by four Athsheans. He recognizes one of them as Selver, an Athshean who was a personal servant at the headquarters of the colony, and later an assistant to Raj Lyubov, the colony anthropologist. A few months prior to the attack, Davidson had raped Selver's wife Thele, who died in the process, prompting an enraged Selver to attack Davidson. Davidson nearly kills him, before he is rescued by Lyubov; however, he is left with prominent facial scars, which render him easily recognizable. The Athsheans allow Davidson to leave and carry a message about the destruction of the camp back to the colony headquarters.|$|E

[...] The village of Mowat on the west side of Canoe Lake was first established in 1893 as a <b>logging</b> <b>camp</b> for the Gilmour Lumber Company. [...] From there, logs were driven down the Oxtongue River towards Lake of Bays and eventually on to Trenton. [...] In the same year the park headquarters was established near the <b>logging</b> <b>camp.</b> [...] The arrival of the railway had provided easy access for the lumbermen as well.
