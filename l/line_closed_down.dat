25|$|In September 1999 Wasa Queen {{returned}} to sail {{from the city}} she was named after. During the same year tax free sales ended in traffic within the EU, meaning that most profits on the Vaasa—Umeå service disappeared. On December 31, 2000, Silja <b>Line</b> <b>closed</b> <b>down</b> traffic across kvarken completely, and Wasa Queen was laid up in Vaasa awaiting potential buyers. In July 2000 she was chartered as a hotel ship to the G8 meeting in Genoa. At {{the end of that}} charter, on July 28, the ship was sold to Star Cruises and set sails for Singapore. In September 2000 she sailed for two weeks from Singapore under the banner of Star Cruises' new daughter company Cruise Ferries, after which she started traffic between Hong Kong and Xiamen.|$|E

50|$|The coal {{extraction}} on the Slamannan's line {{declined in the}} twentieth century, and in 1930 the passenger service was discontinued, and the route was severed in the centre, becoming a branch from Manuel to Avonbridge at the east end, and from Airdrie to Slamannan at the west end.

After a freelance career, Hite came to Last Unicorn Games and joined the developers working on the [...] "Icon system" [...] for their line of licensed Star Trek role-playing games; to get Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game ready for GenCon 31, Hite was flown out to Los Angeles for two weeks.

5000|$|The Rudyard Lake Steam Railway is a ridable {{miniature}} railway and {{the third}} railway of any gauge to run {{along the side of}} Rudyard Lake in Staffordshire. The railway runs for 1+1/2 mi on the track bed of an old standard gauge North Staffordshire Railway line. After the NSR <b>line</b> <b>closed</b> <b>down,</b> a small narrow gauge train ran on the site for two years before moving via Suffolk to Trago Mills in Devon. The current line started in 1985 and is [...] gauge, and operates to a timetable. It was built by Peter Hanton of Congleton working on his own over a period of 10 years. He sold the railway to the Rudyard Lake Steam Railway Ltd in October 2000 who have developed it since that date. Trains are about half the size a normal narrow gauge railway and are steam hauled. The railway runs from Rudyard railway station to the Dam then {{along the side of the}} lake to terminate by the lakeside at Hunthouse Wood. This is about a mile South of the site of the old Cliffe Park railway station.The Railway was purchased by the Leek and Rudyard Railway on 18th December 2015. This company owns the assets of the former Mull Railway and has plans to combine the two railways at Rudyard.|$|E
50|$|Scalby has one {{railway station}} at Scalby Mills {{on the narrow}} gauge North Bay Railway. Services leave to Peasholm Park in Scarborough's North Bay. The village {{used to have a}} station on the now closed Scarborough to Whitby Railway. The station at Scalby closed in 1953, some 12 years before the other {{stations}} (and the <b>line</b> itself) <b>closed</b> <b>down</b> {{as a result of the}} Beeching Axe.|$|R
50|$|Bannister Green is {{a village}} near Felsted, in the Uttlesford district, {{in the county}} of Essex, England. It {{used to have a}} railway station (Bannister Green Halt railway station on the Bishop's Stortford-Braintree Branch <b>Line)</b> but it <b>closed</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, grain {{elevators}} dotted the prairies every 6 to 10 miles (10-15 km) apart, a distance {{that was a}} good day's journey for farmer and horse with a full load. Farmers could find services available to buy and grade grain at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevators. The Pool Farm Service Centers provided a place for farmers to pick up fertilizer and chemicals. Highways, trucks, tractors, and combines revolutionized the farming industry after the industrial revolution in and around the era of World War II. These changes gradually led to the rail system facing deregulation and consolidation changes: many branch <b>lines</b> <b>closed</b> <b>down,</b> and there were increased loading quotas available to railcars for grain, specialty crops and even oilseeds. These developments led to newer and more advanced state-of-the-art grain handling systems called SWP Terminals which serve larger surrounding farming areas.|$|R
5000|$|Development {{funds were}} allotted in 1946 {{for a more}} {{powerful}} {{version of the same}} design, the TG-190. This engine finally emerged as the famed General Electric J47, which saw great demand for several military aircraft; a second manufacturing facility near Cincinnati was opened. J47 production ran to 30,000 engines by the time the <b>lines</b> <b>closed</b> <b>down</b> in 1956. Further development of the J47 by Patrick Clarke in 1957 led to the J73, and from there into the much more powerful J79. The J79 was GE's second [...] "hit", leading to a production run of 17,000 in several different countries. The GE and Lockheed team that developed the J79 and the F-104 Mach 2 fighter aircraft received the 1958 Collier Trophy for outstanding technical achievement in aviation. Other successes followed, including the T58, and T64 turboshaft engines, J85 and F404 turbojets.|$|R
