5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the blips on the displays. If the blip was slightly <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He began {{building}} a full-scale replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> public display.|$|E
5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Lynch left in 1989, Butthole Surfers' stage show {{had become more}} predictable, with {{previously}} random shockers being done {{at the same point}} in each night's performance. Teresa Nervosa quit for good around the same time, and King Coffey became the band's sole percussionist. Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> display.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of Hybrid Theory, Linkin Park {{received}} invitations to perform at various rock concerts and tours, including Ozzfest, the Family Values Tour, KROQ-FM's Almost Acoustic Christmas, and the band's self-created tour, Projekt Revolution, which was headlined by Linkin Park and featured other bands such as Cypress Hill and Adema. During this time, Linkin Park reunited with their original bassist, Dave “Phoenix” Farrell. The band kept an online journal on their official website throughout their 2001 and 2002 touring regime, in which each band member made a respective notation. Although the notes are no <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> their website, they are available on fansites. Linkin Park played 324 shows in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the transponder responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the transponder relative to the aircraft, the blip would be <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the transponder using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E

5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

He was hampered by lack of news from Europe; unaware of the latest scientific developments, Priestley was no <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the forefront of discovery. Although the majority of his publications focused on defending phlogiston theory, he also did some original work on spontaneous generation and dreams. Despite Priestley's reduced scientific output, his presence stimulated American interest in chemistry.|$|E

5|$|The Karlsruhe {{class of}} light cruisers {{was a pair}} of two ships built for the German Imperial Navy before the start of World War I. The ships and were very similar to the {{previous}} s, mounting the same armament and similar armor protection, though they were larger and faster than the earlier ships. Both vessels were laid down in 1911, and launched one day apart, on 11 and 12 November 1912. Karlsruhe joined the fleet in January 1914, but fitting out work lasted slightly <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> her sister; Rostock was commissioned the following month.|$|E
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density undercoat. The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|The allies invaded Paraguay in April 1866, {{but after}} initial success, their advance {{was blocked by}} fortifications at Humaitá and along the Paraguay River. Porto Alegre had {{remained}} behind, leading the 2nd Corps and guarding Rio Grande do Sul. Mitre, no <b>longer</b> <b>on</b> Brazilian territory and acknowledged as the allied commander-in-chief, planned to use Porto Alegre's army to march through Paraguayan territory from the rear to surround Humaitá. As {{a result of a}} suggestion by Tamandaré—though Mitre had not issued orders for the move—Porto Alegre boarded his army onto Brazilian ships and instead brought them up to the positions occupied by the other allied troops.|$|E
