25|$|For 1968, the Cobra {{name was}} applied to both models, and they were now marketed as the Shelby Cobra GT 350 and the Shelby Cobra GT 500. The solid <b>lifter</b> K-code engine was {{discontinued}} by Ford so Shelby used the hydraulic <b>lifter</b> 230hp 302. It produced 250 HP with the high rise intake but was not equipped with Shelby headers {{in order to make}} room for power steering. The early 1968 GT500 used the Shelby installed 428 Police Interceptor with a single four barrel carburetor rated at 360 HP.|$|E
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the valve <b>lifter.</b> This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the valve <b>lifter</b> shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else {{although}} it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right <b>lifter</b> bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right <b>lifter</b> bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E

25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin {{walls in the}} <b>lifter</b> valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.|$|E
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a <b>lifter</b> plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the spun yarn. A felt or cloth washer is placed between the <b>lifter</b> plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E

By November 2011, the deck placement of the SAS span was complete, making 1½ miles of continuous roadway.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cap frame ca.1828 was a step forward in attaining higher production and finer yarn spinning. It is suitable for producing yarns made from botany and fine crossbred quality wools. Unlike the flyer frame where the spindle and flyer rotate, on the cap frame the spindle is stationary and carries a steel cap. Moving {{up and down the}} spindle is a <b>lifter</b> plate which carries the spinning tube on which the bobbin fits. The revolving tube and bobbin impart twist to the yarn until it becomes strong enough to wind onto the bobbin. The speed of the bobbin causes the thread to balloon, and the air resistance to this balloon, combined with friction on the cap edge, is sufficient to give enough tension for winding on at the line of the cap edge as the bobbin moves up and down inside the cap. This machine is hand doffed.|$|E
25|$|Bereket Gymnastic Club {{was founded}} under special {{permission}} on 4 March 1903. Their sporting activities gained more freedom with {{the declaration of}} the Constitutional Monarchy in 1908. After the political events of 31 March 1909, Fuat Balkan and Mazhar Kazancı, who were in Edirne, came to Istanbul with the Movement Army. After the political events settled down, Fuat Balkan, who was a good fencing coach, and Mazhar Kazancı, a good wrestler and weight <b>lifter,</b> found the youths involved in gymnastics in Serencebey and got them to agree to participate in sports together. Refik and Şerafettin Beys, friends of Fuat Bey, were also good fencers. Fuat Balkan made the space under his home in Ihlamur the Club’s headquarters, and the title of Bereket Gymnastics Club was changed to Beşiktaş Ottoman Gymnastics Club. Thus, a stronger sports club, where gymnastics, wrestling, boxing, fencing and athletics were emphasized, was formed. Founding member Mehmet Şamil Şhaplı was elected {{the first president of}} the club.|$|E

5000|$|The Wilks formula {{comes into}} play when {{comparing}} and determining overall champions across the different categories. The formula {{can also be used}} in team and handicap competitions where the team includes <b>lifters</b> of significantly varying bodyweights. The Wilks formula, like its predecessors (the O'Carroll and Schwartz [...] formulas), was set up to address the imbalances whereby lighter <b>lifters</b> tend to have a greater [...] Power-to-weight ratio, with lighter <b>lifters</b> tending to lift more weight in relation to their own body-weight. This occurs {{for a number of reasons}} relating to simple physics, the nature of the makeup and limitations of the human skeletal and muscular system as well as the shorter leverages of smaller people. Note the totals section and that lighter <b>lifters</b> below 100 kg body-weight achieve totals in excess of ten times bodyweight whereas heavier <b>lifters</b> do not. The Wilks system is primarily a handicapping process that provides an adjusted statistical method to compare all <b>lifters</b> of varying classes and groups on an equal standing and makes allowances for the disparities.|$|R

500|$|As a {{young child}} Phillips learned to play hockey, and by 1895 he had joined the Rat Portage Thistles junior club, a team of players mostly aged 12 to 16, and helped team win the 1895–96 {{intermediate}} level championship of the Manitoba and Northwest Hockey Association. By 1899–00 Phillips had joined the senior Thistles team, and would be named captain the following season, when they won the senior league championship. Phillips immediately earned praise for his endurance; {{in an era when}} players played the entire match and would often coast to conserve energy, Phillips could play at a fast pace the entire game: a posthumous newspaper report would state that he [...] "could play for an entire 60 at full speed and be as fresh at the end as he was at the start."

500|$|Los Angeles {{musician}} Mark Posgay {{auditioned for}} the band in 1995 and became the group's permanent drummer. In July of that year, Magnapop supported R.E.M. on their Monster World Tour and continued playing in the United States and Europe, including an appearance at X-Fest in 1996. They also played their first dates in Australia and Japan in 1996 and hosted 120 Minutes on July 7 of the same year. In late 1996, Mulvaney left the group, citing problems of distance—Hopper and Morris had relocated permanently to Los Angeles—as well as a desire to focus on his family. He continued playing bass guitar and stand-up bass with Atlanta groups The Hots, The Lugosis, and Anna Kramer & The Lost Cause. Boston native and former Queers bassist Greg Urbaitis replaced him after replying to an ad in The Recycler and the band continued to play live shows through 1997, including supporting Throwing Muses on their farewell tour. Posgay quit that summer and he was replaced by former <b>Lifter</b> drummer Johnny Rozas and this line-up recorded six demos at a recording studio in Orange County. This version of the band was short-lived as Magnapop was informed while on tour that their record label's rock division ceased to exist {{and they did not}} have any funding for future touring or recording. Compounding matters further, the band members were still under contract to their old record label and were legally disbarred from using the name [...] "Magnapop" [...] until their contract expired seven years later.|$|E

The stroke for all Gen-1 V8s is [...] Engine displacement was a factor of the bore: the [...] has a [...] bore, [...] , and the [...] a [...] bore. The bore size is cast {{on the top of the}} block near the back of the right bank cylinder head. The block features a deep skirt where the casting extends below the crankshaft centerline, forming a very rigid crankcase gallery. The oil system feeds a central gallery to the cam and crankshaft first from front to rear, and then dividing at the front to feed the two <b>lifter</b> galleries from front to rear. From the rear of the two <b>lifter</b> galleries oil is then supplied up to the two rocker arm shafts which serve as galleries to lubricate the valve train. The fore and aft direction changes are designed to eliminate stale oil areas which tend to form sludge deposits. Juxtaposed with the Rambler V8, the Chevrolet small-block engine feeds both <b>lifter</b> galleries and the central cam and crankshaft galleries simultaneously through a three way split from the rear, having oil proceed to the front of the engine, the <b>lifter</b> galleries feeding oil to the valve train through hollow pushrods.|$|E
