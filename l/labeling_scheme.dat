25|$|Low-dimensional {{comparability}} graphs: The comparability graph for {{a partially}} ordered set has a vertex for each set element and an edge between two set elements that are related by the partial order. The order dimension of a partial order is the minimum number of linear orders whose intersection is the given partial order. If a partial order has bounded order dimension, then an adjacency <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> for the vertices in its comparability graph may be defined by labeling each vertex with its position {{in each of the}} defining linear orders, and determining that two vertices are adjacent if each corresponding pair of numbers in their labels has the same order relation as each other pair. In particular, this allows for an adjacency <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> for the chordal comparability graphs, which come from partial orders of dimension at most four.|$|E
25|$|Intersection graphs: An {{interval}} graph is {{the intersection}} graph {{of a set}} of line segments in the real line. It may be given an adjacency <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> in which the points that are endpoints of line segments are numbered from 1 to 2n and each vertex of the graph is represented by the numbers of the two endpoints of its corresponding interval. With this representation, one may check whether two vertices are adjacent by comparing the numbers that represent them and verifying that these numbers define overlapping intervals. The same approach works for other geometric intersection graphs including the graphs of bounded boxicity and the circle graphs, and subfamilies of these families such as the distance-hereditary graphs and cographs. However, a geometric intersection graph representation does not always imply the existence of an adjacency <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme,</b> because it may require more than a logarithmic number of bits to specify each geometric object. For instance, representing a graph as a unit disk graph may require exponentially many bits for the coordinates of the disk centers.|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes,</b> however, most of proposed <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> are costly due to the need of re-calculating or re-labelling existing nodes whenever XML documents being updated.

In this paper, we develop a <b>labelling</b> <b>scheme,</b> the Compressed Dynamic <b>Labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> which meets the above requirements.

25|$|The Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg {{conjecture}} concerns implicit graphs {{given as}} a set of labeled vertices with a black-box rule for determining whether any two vertices are adjacent. This definition differs from an adjacency <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> in that the rule may be specific to a particular graph rather than being a generic rule that applies to all graphs in a family. Because of this difference, every graph has an implicit representation. For instance, the rule could be to look up the pair of vertices in a separate adjacency matrix. However, an algorithm that is given as input an implicit graph of this type must operate on it only through the implicit adjacency test, without reference to how the test is implemented.|$|E

Results of two experiments in Germany and The Netherlands show that a <b>labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> with reference point information at the nutrient level (e. g., the traffic light label) can achieve all three objectives. Although other types of <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> are also capable of communicating healthfulness, <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> lacking reference point information (e. g., nutrition tables) are less effective when no comparison product is available, and <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> based on overall product healthfulness within the category (e. g., logos) can diminish consumers’ ability to differentiate between categories, leading to a potential misinterpretation of product healthfulness.

40|$|Documents that {{comply with}} the XML {{standard}} are characterised by inherent ordering and their modelling usually {{takes the form of}} a tree. Nowadays, applications generate massive amounts of XML data, which requires accurate and efficient query-able XML database systems. XML querying depends on XML labelling in much the same way as relational databases rely on indexes. Document order and structural information are encoded by <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes,</b> thus facilitating their use by queries without having to access the original XML document. Dynamic XML data, data which changes, complicates the <b>labelling</b> <b>scheme.</b> As demonstrated by much research efforts, it is difficult to allocate unique labels to nodes in a dynamic XML tree so that all structural relationships between the nodes are encoded by the labels. Static XML documents are generally managed with <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> that use simple labels. By contrast, dynamic <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> have extra <b>labelling</b> costs and lower query performance to allow random updates irrespective of the document update frequency. Given that static and dynamic XML documents are often not clearly distinguished, a <b>labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> whose efficiency does not depend on updating frequency would be useful. The GroupBased <b>labelling</b> <b>scheme</b> proposed in this thesis is compatible with static as well as dynamic XML documents. In particular, this scheme has a high performance in processing dynamic XML data updates. What differentiates it from other dynamic <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> is its uniform behaviour irrespective of whether the document is static or dynamic, ability to determine all structural relationships between nodes, and the improved query performance in both types of document. The advantages of the GroupBased scheme in comparison to earlier schemes are highlighted by the experiment results...|$|R

This paper studies β-approximate {{distance}} <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes,</b> {{which are}} composed of a marker algorithm for labeling the vertices of a graph with short labels, coupled with a decoder algorithm allowing one to compute a β-approximation of the distance between any two vertices directly from their labels (without using any additional information). As most applications for informative <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> in general, and distance <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> in particular, concern large and dynamically changing networks, it is of interest to focus on distributed dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes.</b> The paper considers the problem on dynamic weighted trees and cycles where the vertices of the tree (or the cycle) are fixed but the (positive integral) weights of the edges may change. The two models considered are the fully dynamic model, where {{from time to time}} some edge changes its weight by a fixed quanta, and the increasing dynamic model in which edge weights can only grow. The paper presents distributed β-approximate distance <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for the two models, for β> 1, and establishes upper and lower bounds on the required label size and the communication complexity involved in updating the labels following a weight change. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{is one of}} the largest sources of carbon emissions. Manufacturing of raw materials, such as cement, steel and aluminium, is energy intensive and has considerable impact on carbon emissions level. Due to the rising recognition of global climate change, the industry is under pressure to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> are therefore developed as meaningful yardsticks to measure and compare carbon emissions. Carbon <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes</b> can help switch consumer-purchasing habits to low-carbon alternatives. However, such switch is dependent on a transparent scheme. The principle of transparency is highlighted in all international greenhouse gas (GHG) standards, including the newly published ISO 14067 : Carbon footprint of products – requirements and guidelines for quantification and communication. However, there are few studies which systematically investigate the transparency requirements in carbon <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes.</b> A comparison of five established carbon <b>labelling</b> <b>schemes,</b> namely the Singapore Green <b>Labelling</b> <b>Scheme,</b> the CarbonFree (the U.

The results suggest that the design of current carbon labels have transparency issues relating but not limited to the use of a single sign to represent the comprehensiveness of the carbon footprint. These transparency issues are partially caused by the flexibility given to select system boundary in the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology to measure GHG emissions. The primary contribution of this study to the {{construction industry}} is to reveal the transparency requirements from international GHG standards and carbon labels for construction products.

Due to increased and increasing economic integration, implementation of CFP <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> in one country will have significant impact on others. The impact is particularly significant for LDCs in the EAS region because: the EAS production networks are highly integrated, which provide necessary condition for the spill-over effects to be generated; LDCs generally lack the capacity to measure and label CFP of their products; and exports from LDCs often produced by relatively small producers. However, the effective inclusion of LDCs in <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> may offer more and cost-effective opportunities for carbon emission reductions. The presence of spillover effects means that countries that are implementing carbon <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> need to take stakeholders outside of their boundaries into consideration.
