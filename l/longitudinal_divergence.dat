40|$|Quantitative {{predictions}} of surface extratropical cyclone development are correlated {{to the degree}} of upper-level forcing from 500 mb vorticity advection and 300 mb divergence. Although it is difficult to obtain an accurate analysis of upper-level divergence, modern models and data assimilation procedures do produce consistent divergence fields. The divergence field partitioned into the longitudinal (alongstream) and transverse (cross-stream) components approximately estimates the effect of curvature and jet streaks on cyclone intensification. Verification of the Eta model indicated not significant difference in the mean central pressure to a confidence level of 95 %, and verification of the 300 mb divergence was very similar to the 500 mb vorticity advection. The presence of subgeostrophic flow in the trough and supergeostrophic flow in the ridge was noted with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>divergence.</b> Large variability in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>divergence</b> reflected some sensitivity to small-scale perturbations in the height field. Transverse divergence showed greater consistency and projected a similar wind pattern to the classic jet streak model, however, modifications were seen as ageostrophic winds may also be directed toward regions of height falls. The composition of the total divergence from the longitudinal and transverse divergence is about 50 : 50. However, with very large total divergence values, the dominant contributor is the transverse divergence. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
40|$|Light-front {{perturbation}} theory (LFPT) {{has been proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} covariant {{perturbation theory}}. LFPT is only acceptable if it produces invariant S-matrix elements. Doubts have been raised concerning the equivalence of LFPT and covariant perturbation theory. The main obstacles to a rigorous proof of equivalence are algebraic complexity in the case of arbitrarily high orders in perturbation theory and the occurrence of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>divergences</b> not present in covariant perturbation theory. We show {{in the case of the}} Yukawa model of fermions interacting with scalar bosons at the one-loop level how to deal with the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>divergences.</b> Invariant S-matrix elements are obtained using our method...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} flow {{equations}} {{is applied to}} QED on the light front. Requiring that the particle number conserving terms in the Hamiltonian {{are considered to be}} diagonal and the other terms off-diagonal an effective Hamiltonian is obtained which reduces the positronium problem to a two-particle problem, since the particle number violating contributions are eliminated. Using an effective electron-positron Hamiltonian, obtained in the second order in coupling, we analyze the positronium bound state problem analytically and numerically. The results obtained for Bohr spectrum and hyperfine splitting coincide to a high accuracy with experimental values. The rotational invariance, that is not manifest symmetry on the light-front, is recovered for positronium mass spectrum. Except for the <b>longitudinal</b> infrared <b>divergences,</b> that are special for the light-front gauge calculations, no infrared divergences appear. The ultraviolet renormalization in the second order in coupling constant is performed simultaneously. To preserve boost invariance we take into account the diagrams arising from the normal ordering of instantaneous interactions. Using flow equations and coupling coherence we obtain the counterterms for electron and photon masses, which are free from <b>longitudinal</b> infrared <b>divergences.</b> Comment: Ph. D.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) changes in both {{past and future}} climates has {{raised the issue of}} how the Southern Ocean would respond. Recent experiments with the GISS coupled atmosphere-ocean model have shown that a "bipolar see-saw" between NADW production and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) production in the Weddell Sea can occur in conjunction with freshening of the North Atlantic. However, this effect operates not through a slow ocean response but via a rapid atmospheric mechanism. As NADW reduces, colder temperatures in the North Atlantic, and Northern Hemisphere in general, are associated with higher surface pressure (increased atmospheric mass). Reduced mass in the Southern Hemisphere occurs in response, with lower pressure over the South Pole (an EOF # 1 effect, the "high phase" of the Antarctic Oscillation). The lower pressure is associated with stronger west winds that generate an intensified Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), which leads to <b>longitudinal</b> heat <b>divergence</b> in the South Atlantic (and heat convergence in the Southern Indian Ocean). Colder temperatures in the Weddell Sea region lead to sea ice growth, increased salinity and surface water density, and greater Weddell Sea Bottom Water production. Increased poleward transport of heat occurs in the South Atlantic in conjunction with increased bottom water production, but its convergence at high latitudes is not sufficient to offset the <b>longitudinal</b> heat <b>divergence</b> due to the intensified ACC. The colder temperatures at high latitudes in the South Atlantic increase the latitudinal temperature gradient, baroclinic instability, eddy energy and eddy poleward transport of momentum, helping to maintain the lower pressure over the pole in an interactive manner. The heat flux convergence in the Indian Ocean provides a warming tendency in that region, and overall global production of AABW remains unchanged. These results have implications for the interpretation of the ice core records of the last deglaciation, but may also be relevant for changes during the Holocene and perhaps even in response to increased CO 2 forcing...|$|R

50|$|Picking {{up where}} Lilienthal left off, Octave Chanute took up {{aircraft}} design after an early retirement, and funded {{the development of}} several gliders. In the summer of 1896, his team flew several of their designs many times at Miller Beach, Indiana, eventually deciding that the best was a biplane design. Like Lilienthal, he documented his work and also photographed it, and was busy corresponding with like-minded researchers around the world. Chanute was particularly interested in solving the problem of aerodynamic instability of the aircraft in flight, which birds compensate for by instant corrections, but which humans would have to address either with stabilizing and control surfaces or by moving {{the center of gravity}} of the aircraft, as Lilienthal did. The most disconcerting problem was <b>longitudinal</b> instability (<b>divergence),</b> because as the angle of attack of a wing increases, the center of pressure moves forward and makes the angle increase yet more. Without immediate correction, the craft will pitch up and stall. Much more difficult to understand was the relationship between lateral and directional control.|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{trials to}} improve day-to-day {{function}} in Huntington disease (HD) require accurate outcome measures. The DSM- 5 recommends the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2. 0 {{for use in}} neuropsychiatric disorders. The DSM- 5 also states proxy measures may be useful when cognitive function may be impaired. We tested WHODAS participant and companion ratings for differences in baseline and longitudinal function in three prodromal HD groups and a control group. Participants with prodromal HD were stratified by disease progression (low, medium, and high disease burden) based on their cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) -age product (CAP) score. Participant (N= 726) and companion (N= 630) WHODAS scores were examined for group differences, and for participant versus companion differences using linear mixed effects regression and Akaike 2 ̆ 7 s information criterion to test model fit. We also compared WHODAS with the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) scale. At baseline, functioning on the WHODAS was rated worse by participants in the high group and companions compared with controls. For longitudinal changes, companions reported functional decline over time in the medium and high groups. In simultaneous analysis, participant and companion <b>longitudinal</b> trajectories showed <b>divergence</b> in the high group, suggesting reduced validity of self-report. The WHODAS showed greater longitudinal difference than the TFC in the medium group relative to controls, whereas the TFC showed greater longitudinal difference than WHODAS in the high group. Results suggest the WHODAS can identify baseline and longitudinal differences in prodromal HD and {{may be useful in}} HD clinical trials. Companions may provide more accurate data as the disease progresses...|$|R
40|$|Short wavelength, high {{intensity}} Free Electron Lasers (FELs) require a high brightness electron beam, i. e. the beam should have small transverse and <b>longitudinal</b> sizes, small <b>divergence</b> and energy spread and high peak current. Therefore, the detailed {{characterization of the}} beam is required. The Photo Injector Test facility at DESY, Zeuthen site (PITZ), was established as a test stand of the electron source for Free electron Laser in Hamburg (FLASH) and the European X ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL). The PITZ beamline consists of various types of diagnostic devices for the detailed bunch characterization. Mainly, the transverse phase space characterization is performed at PITZ, but longitudinal phase space measurements are also of great importance for full characterization of high brightness electron bunches from the photo injector. One {{of the ways to}} measure the longitudinal phase space of electron bunch is an RF deflector. It deflects particles transversely with respect to the movement direction of the bunch in a linear dependence on their longitudinal coordinates within the bunch. As a result it gives the possibility to perform measurements of the bunch longitudinal properties in combination with a following transverse beam characterization. Using additionally a dispersive section the longitudinal phase space can be obtained as well. Another approach to measure the longitudinal phase space of the bunch is a tomographic method based on measurements of the momentum spectra while varying the electron bunch energy chirp. The energy chirp at PITZ can be applied and changed by varying the RF phase of the CDS booster – the accelerating structure installed downstream the gun. The resulting momentum distribution can be measured with a dipole spectrometer downstream. As a result, the longitudinal phase space at the entrance and exit of the CDS booster can be reconstructed over a wide range of bunch charges. In this thesis both methods for longitudinal phase space measurements are described in detail. Measurement techniques are introduced. Numerical simulations of the measurements are performed and studied. Results of the first longitudinal phase space measurements at PITZ using the tomographic technique are presented...|$|R
40|$|Atom {{lithography}} [1] {{has attracted}} {{a great interest in}} the scientific community as a technique for the fabrication of nanometer-scale ordered structures with a relatively simple apparatus. The atom lithography approach is similar to conventional optical litography, the light beam and the mechanical mask being replaced by an atomic beam and an immaterial light mask, respectively. Nanostructures are produced by space segregation of the atomic beam, due to its interaction with a quasi-resonant standing wave, that allows to realize ordered structures with interferometric precision and a space resolution well below 100 nm through either direct deposition or resist-assisted processes. The ultimate limits of the technique {{and the role of the}} interactions between the deposited atoms and the substrate are under recent debate. In order to better understand the relevant growth processes and the limits of atom lithography in terms of space definition, we have built an apparatus where a continuous beam produced out of a pyramidal-MOT funnel is used. The funnel is followed by a collimation stage, based on 2 D optical molasses along the transverse directions. The main advantage of this choice is the lower translational velocity of the atoms composing the beam with respect to conventional effusive sources (10 m/s vs hundreds of m/s typical for thermal beams). This leads to a larger interaction time during the collimating and immaterial mask (focusing) stages, which is expected to give rise to sharper deposited structures thanks to a significant reduction of aberration effects and of the amount of uncollimated/unfocused atoms arriving onto the substrate. 	The experimental set-up exploits a pyramidal funnel, made of two prisms and two mirrors arranged in the shape of an inverted pyramid with a small hole (1 mm x 2 mm) at its apex, mounted on a stainless-steel holder inside an ultra high vacuum system. The light for manipulating cesium atoms is produced by diode lasers operating around 850 nm, mounted in the external cavity configuration. The quadrupolar magnetic field for the pyramidal-MOT operation is produced by two coils in anti-Helmholtz configuration. We have characterized the atomic beam leaving the funnel [2], i. e., we have measured its density, <b>divergence,</b> <b>longitudinal</b> velocity and temperature. Induced fluorescence images, acquired using a CCD camera, and absorption measurements show a beam divergence of 25 mrad, a longitudinal velocity in the range 10 - 15 m/s (depending on the trapping parameters) and a flux up to 4 x 109 atoms/s. The atomic beam diameter (FWHM) is 1 cm measured 30 cm downward the funnel apex. The collimation stage is based on 2 D optical molasses. The collimating laser beam is elliptical in shape (13 mm x 6 mm), with the longer axis along the longitudinal direction, which leads to an interaction time of 1 ms. We have explored both the "lin perp lin" and the σ+σ - polarization configuration. With the "lin perp lin" configuration we found a minimum divergence of 8 mrad at a collimating laser detuning of - 9 Γ (Γ being the cesium natural linewith, 5. 13 MHz), limited by the presence in the collimation region of stray magnetic fields produced by the MOT coils. We were able to reach less than 2 mrad (corresponding to the measurement uncertainty) in beam divergence with the σ+σ - polarization configuration. The collimation stage allows us also to reduce the beam diameter to 4 mm at 30 cm from the funnel apex, with an increase of the atomic beam intensity relevant for our applicative purposes. The next step of the experiment will be deposition of cesium through a light mask (a one-dimensional laser standing wave) on several kinds of substrates. Currently we are working on the deposition of nanostructured cesium beam on Self Assembled Monolayer (a nonanethiol layer grown on a gold substrate). Our preliminary results demonstrate that the SAM is efficiently impressed by the arrival of the laser-cooled cesium atoms. By the time of the Conference we expect to obtain nanostructures (arrays of parallel planes, spaced by half the laser wavelength) through resist-assisted atom lithography. The work is supported by EC through RTD-IST "NANOCOLD", and by CNR through Progetto Applicativo "Nanotecnologie". [1]	J. J.
