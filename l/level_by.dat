40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{assessment}} of the antioxidant effects of polyphenolic extracts derived from the stems of three Greek grape varieties (Moshomayro, Mavrotragano and Mandilaria) in endothelial (EA. hy 926) and muscle (C 2 C 12) cells. We also investigated the effects of the polyphenolic composition on the antioxidant effects of the grape stem extracts. For this purpose, the endothelial and muscle cells were treated with low non-cytotoxic concentrations of the extracts for 24 h in order to assess the effects of the extracts on cellular redox status using oxidative stress biomarkers. The oxidative stress markers were thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein carbonyl (CARB) levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and glutathione (GSH) levels. The results revealed that treatment of the EA. hy 926 cells with Mandilaria extract significantly decreased the TBARS <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 14. 8 % and the CARB <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 25. 9 %, while it increased the GSH <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 15. 8 % compared to the controls. Moreover, treatment of the EA. hy 926 cells with Mavrotragano extract significantly increased the GSH <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 20. 2 %, while it significantly decreased the TBARS and CARB <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 12. 5 % and 16. 6 %, respectively. Treatment of the C 2 C 12 cells with Mandilaria extract significantly decreased the TBARS <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 47. 3 %, the CARB <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 39. 0 % and the ROS <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 21. 8 %, while it increased the GSH <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 22. 6 % compared to the controls. Moreover, treatment of the C 2 C 12 cells with Mavrotragano significantly decreased the TBARS, CARB and ROS <b>levels</b> <b>by</b> 36. 2 %, 35. 9 % and 16. 5 %, respectively. In conclu-sion, to the best of our knowledgel, our results demonstrate for the first time that treatment with grape stem extracts at low concentrations improves the redox status of endothelial and muscle cells. Thus, grape stem extracts may be used for devel-oping antioxidant food supplements or biofunctional foods. However, it was also found that the polyphenolic composition of grape stem extracts affects their antioxidant capacity. For example, the results suggested that trans-resveratrol, gallic acid, (+) -catechin, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin, coumaric acid and kaempferol may be essential for the antioxidant activity of grape stem extracts...|$|R
