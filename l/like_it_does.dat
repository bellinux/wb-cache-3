5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal chorion <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
500|$|Lohan {{performed}} [...] "Rumors" [...] on Good Morning America on December 2004. According to a MTV News staff report, [...] "Lohan {{missed the}} cue to mouth along, forcing cameras {{to cut away}} when her mouth remained closed as she was heard singing, thanks to a backing track." [...] A representative for Lohan, however, revealed that the singer actually sang it live, and noted that Lohan only used a background track [...] "to help make the song sound <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> on her album." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lacrymosa" [...] {{incorporates}} the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart's Requiem (1791). It additionally includes a 22-piece orchestra led by Dave Campbell and background vocals by The Millennium Choir. Inspired {{by the film}} Amadeus, the song contains electronic backing beats, symphonic string section, heavy guitar and a haunting choir. Its vocals make a contrasting representation of light and dark. Jim Farber of Daily News compared the song with the works of English progressive rock band Renaissance. [...] "Like You" [...] is written in memory of Lee's deceased sister, as was [...] "Hello" [...] on Fallen. Concerning this, the singer said, [...] "I can't help but be affected by that, and if it's my place to express myself {{and all the things}} that have been most deep and the most painful and have just touched me, I feel <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> honor her". One of the most personal songs on the album, [...] "Like You", contains lyrics which yearn for death so Lee can be with her sister. which are accompanied by heavy riffing guitars. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield found similarities between the track and American rock band My Chemical Romance's song [...] "Helena" [...] (2005); other critics compared the song with Evanescence's earlier material on Fallen. [...] "Lose Control" [...] was inspired by Balsamo's loud guitar and contains influences from Portishead. The protagonist shows her anger through the lines, [...] "You don't remember my name, I don't really care". According to Lee, the song is about wanting to be less apprehensive and looser.|$|E

2500|$|As in Standard German, Pennsylvania German uses three genders (masculine, {{feminine}} and neuter). Pronouns inflect for four cases, as in Standard German, but the nominative and accusative articles and adjective endings are the same, e.g., [...] "der" [...] in Pennsylvania German {{does not become}} [...] "den" [...] in the accusative, <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in High German. As in other South German and West German dialects, the genitive is often replaced by a special construction using the dative and the possessive pronoun: [...] "the man's dog" [...] becomes [...] "em Mann sei Hund" [...] (literally: [...] "to the man his dog"). In most regions, the dative has been gradually replaced by the accusative, so that [...] "em Mann sei Hund" [...] (the man's dog), for example, has frequently become [...] "der Mann sei Hund". Adjectival endings exist, but are somewhat simplified compared to Standard German. As in all other South German dialects, the past tense is generally expressed using the perfect: [...] "Ich bin ins Feld glaafe" [...] (I ran into the field) rather than the simple past ("Ich lief ins Feld"). The use of the subjunctive, while it exists, is more limited than in Standard German.|$|E

60|$|The {{feeling that}} fills the {{traveller}} may be faintly suggested thus; that here, in this legendary land between Asia and Europe, {{may well have}} happened whatever did happen; that through this Eastern gate, if any, entered whatever made and changed the world. Whatever else this narrow strip of land may seem <b>like,</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> really seem, to the spirit and almost to the senses, like the bridge that may have borne across archaic abysses the burden and the mystery of man. Here have been civilisations as old as any barbarism; to all appearance perhaps older than any barbarism. Here is the camel; the enormous unnatural friend of man; the prehistoric pet. He is never {{known to have been}} wild, and might make a man fancy that all wild animals had once been tame. As I said elsewhere, all might be a runaway menagerie; the whale a cow that went swimming and never came back, the tiger a large cat that took the prize (and the prize-giver) and escaped to the jungle. This is not (I venture to think) true; but it is true as Pithecanthropus and Primitive Man and all the other random guesses from dubious bits of bone and stone. And the truth is some third thing, too tremendous to be remembered by men. Whatever it was, perhaps the camel saw it; but from the expression on the face of that old family servant, I feel sure that he will never tell.|$|E
60|$|The man who hunts {{and does}} {{like it is}} an object of keen envy {{to the man who}} hunts and doesn't; but he, too, has his own miseries, and I am not {{prepared}} to say that they are always less aggravating than those endured by his less ambitious brother in the field. He, too, when he comes to make up his account, when he brings his hunting to book and inquires whether his whistle has been worth its price, is driven to declare that vanity and vexation of spirit have been the prevailing characteristics of his hunting life. On how many evenings has he returned contented with his sport? How many days has he declared to have been utterly wasted? How often have frost and snow, drought and rain, wind and sunshine, impeded his plans? for to a hunting man frost, snow, drought, rain, wind and sunshine, will all come amiss. Then, when the one run of the season comes, he is not there! He has been idle and has taken a liberty with the day; or he has followed other gods and gone with strange hounds. With sore ears and bitter heart he hears the exaggerated boastings of his comrades, and almost swears that he will have no more of it. At {{the end of the season}} he tells himself that the season's amusement has cost him five hundred pounds; that he has had one good day, three days that were not bad, and that all the rest have been vanity and vexation of spirit. After all, it may be a question whether the man who hunts and doesn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> not have the best of it.|$|E
