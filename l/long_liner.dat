The thousand foot <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> {{was to have}} been a motor ship propelled by the new diesel-electric propulsion system, but the ship was never completed due to financial issues. Oceanics keel was dismantled and the steel was used in two new smaller motor ships: Britannic (III) and Georgic.

Also there are several sports fishing vessels anchored on the shore of Shimoni at the Pemba Channel Club which pass into the Pemba Channel - a fishing ground famous for Kenya, winning All Africa and World IGFA fishing records. The presence of <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> fishing vessels offshore, rising water levels, destructive fishing methods using small seine nets and dynamite on reefs, have all had an detrimental impact on the fish reservoir.|$|E

40|$|The American style {{purse seiner}} {{developed}} in the United States was studied in comparision with the tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> developed in Japan, in terms of principal particulars, speed, hull form and conditions expressed in mean value of four vessels each. In comparison with the tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> of 500 GT class, the American style purse seiner {{of the same size}} is 20. 2 % broader in actual size and 16 % broader in L/B and has more stability. The speed which is required to be over 14 knots in cruising condition is 14. 7 knots for the purse seiner and 12. 8 knots for the tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner.</b> The purse seiner has the hull form of greater midship section coefficient and smaller block coefficient, i. e., the hull form of fat midship and rapidly slim bow and stern. The incident angle of water line at the bow is 9 ～ 14 degrees for the purse seiner while it is approximately 38 degrees for the tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner.</b> The trim of the purse seiner in light load condition is by the head since this vessel carries net and skiff boat in the stern area. This is a significant characteristic of the purse seiner. The metacentric height (GM) in full load condition, i. e., in working condition is 0. 93 m which is about twice as much as that of ordinary fishing vessels, giving consideration to the safty against unvavorable condition in navigation and fishing operation. However, the period of rolling is 7 ～ 9 seconds which is an ordinary period for the fishing vessel of 500 GT class. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と日本で開発された 500 総トン級鮪延縄船各 4 隻の要目,速力、船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は,甲板上の搭載物重量が重いため幅を鮪延縄船より 20. 2 %広げて復原力を増している。米国式旋網船の巡航速力である 3 / 4 負荷では, 14 ノット以上要求されているが,調査した限りでは平均で 14. 7 ノットであり,鮪延縄船では, 12, 8 ノットであった。米国式旋網船は,船体中央部では鮪延縄船より肥っているが船首および船尾で急激にやせている船型である。船首の水線入射角は,米国式旋網船は極端に小さく 9 度～ 14 度であり,鮪延縄船では 38 度位である。軽荷状態の米国式旋網船のTrimはTrim by the headである。船尾に重量物(漁網約 30 トン, 9 mスキフボート約 15 トン) を積む関係であるが,このTrimは顕著な特徴である。重量物の搭載後の満載状態では 1. 14 mTrim by the sternとなり,航海に適したTrimとなる。運航者が,船の安全度と初期復原力を知る目安としているMetacentric height (GM) は,稼働状態の満載状態では 0. 93 mで一般漁船の約 2 倍となっているが,漁撈時に於ける船体の傾斜,その他の航海,操業時における悪条件の中での安全性について考慮を払ったものと思われる。GMが大きければ横揺れ周期が短くなるが,周期は 7 ～ 9 秒で 500 トン級漁船としては通常の周期である...|$|E

40|$|The Amazon Estuary is a {{considered}} one of the most productive fishery regions of Brazil. Fisheries in this region are complex and multivariate techniques are useful for obtaining an integrated image of this activity. This study has the objective of characterizing fishing activities used in the state of Pará. Data on CPUE (kg/trip) were obtained (261 trips and 167 boats) from an enterprise based in Belém for the years 2001 and 2002. To characterize these fisheries, univariate (diversity) and multivariate techniques were applied. A total of 37 species of 24 families and eight orders were registered in the industrial and artisanal landings. Gill net catches were the most diverse, followed by trawler and <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> catches. The gear type was the main factor in discriminating groups, whilst the precipitation levels did not relevantly discriminate the groups.

40|$|The {{effect of}} trail rope was studied by the {{resistance}} and yawing experiments. A {{model of a}} tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> of gross tonnage about 260 tons was used. Figures 1 and 2 show the plans of the experiments. When a boat makes head at a higher speed than 3 knots relative to the surface water, {{the effect on the}} course stability of the trail rope as a Jury rudder is very marked, while less so at a higher speed than 5 knots. In the case where the speed was 4. 4 knots, the boat without trail rope showed a critical yawing angle 12 °. The angle increased to 15 ° with rope of straight line type and to 24 ° with rope of U-line type. The boat with trail rope, especially of U-type, shows a faster damping period of yawing (Fig. 4 a and 4 b). This type of a Jury rudder seems to be very useful in the case of strong gale. ...|$|E

40|$|Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri Cuvier, 1832) is {{a member}} of the Scombrid family, is a pelagic (open ocean) species found {{worldwide}} in tropical and warm-temperate seas. It is fished throughout its range by artisanal, recreational, and commercial. Wahoo is one of the by-product species of the tuna long line fleets operate in Indian Ocean. This paper describes status of wahoo resource caught by tuna long line in Indian Ocean based at Benoa-Bali. Data obtained from onboard observer program on the tuna <b>long</b> <b>liner</b> based at Benoa-Bali during 2005 - 2010. Total of 85 trips of onboard observation were carried out with the total long line sets (one set per day) were 2873 times. The data covered the horizontal and vertical position of tuna long line hooks caught the wahoo, hook rate and fish size distribution. Data of horizontal fishing positions (coordinates) gained from the global positioning system availabled in the tuna long liners. The depth of the long line gear in the waters and teperature of waters were measured by mini-loggers TDR type SP 2 T- 1200, brand: NKE Micrel. Hook rate of wahoo is calculated using the Klawe (1986) method. Result of research showed that the wahoos caught by tuna long lines based at Benoa spread horizontally between 1 o 31 ’- 33 o 40 ’S and 77 o 18 ’- 117 o 53 ’E and spread vertically between the depth of 75. 2 - 285. 7 m. From 85 tuna long line fishing trips, only about 50 % of 85 tuna long line fishing trips caught wahoo with hook rate ranged 0. 947 - 1. 399 per 1000 hooks/setting.

40|$|Research PaperThe {{theoretical}} {{economic performance}} of the year 2000 Norwegian fishing fleet in the Barents Sea cod fisheries are studied under different stock biomass levels and age compositions by applying the EconMult fleet model. Quarterly stock conditions during the period 1946 - 2004 have been investigated as this represent stock conditions which may naturally occur. Cost profiles and prices are from Norwegian official statistics of year 2000, while the harvest production equations are from the EconSimp 2000 model. The study confirms a close relationship between relative economic performance between fleet segments and the stock properties. No dominant factor is found, as both stock properties, stock-output elasticities and fleet cost compositions are all important factors influencing the final result. Stock size and age composition in stock are however important factors, particularly the latter. The study indicates that bottom trawl may be relatively more efficient {{the second half of}} each year when the cod availability is reduced, while gill netters and <b>long</b> <b>liners</b> dominate the first half; except in years of extreme biomasses, as these often are characterised by large biomasses of young cod which suits the trawler fleet better than the conventional fleet...|$|R
