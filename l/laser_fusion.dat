25|$|<b>Laser</b> <b>fusion</b> was {{suggested}} in 1962 by scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{shortly after the}} invention of the laser itself in 1960. At the time, Lasers were low power machines, but low-level research began as early as 1965. <b>Laser</b> <b>fusion,</b> formally known as inertial confinement fusion, involves imploding a target by using laser beams. There are two ways to do this: indirect drive and direct drive. In direct drive, the laser blasts a pellet of fuel. In indirect drive, the lasers blast a structure around the fuel. This makes x-rays that squeeze the fuel. Both methods compress the fuel so that fusion can take place.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012, Mike Dunne, {{director}} of NIF's <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> energy program, predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012. In the same month, the NIF fired {{a record high}} of 57 shots, more than in any month up to that point. On March 15, 2012, NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 trillion watts of peak power. On July 5, 2012, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Laser</b> tissue <b>fusion</b> {{has a large}} {{potential}} for minimal invasive tissue fusion in different surgical specialties. We have developed a combined endovascular minimal invasive surgical technique to fuse blood vessels for bypass surgery. However, the main difficulty was to achieve reproducible results as the main tensile strength {{is a result of}} protein denaturation. We therefore aimed to develop a quantitative, reproducible tissue fusion using polycapsulated silica core nanoparticles containing indocyanine green (Si@PCL/ICG). Methods: In a first step we developed mesoporous indocyanine green (ICG) containing nanoparticles and assessed their heating profile. Furthermore the stability to light exposure and ICG degradation was measured. In a second phase Si@PCL/ICG nanoparticles for embedding into a biodegradeable implant was developed and characterized using differential scanning calomeritry technique (DSC). Results: ICG containing mesoporous silica nanoparticles showed a sufficient increase in temperature up to 80 °C suitable for <b>laser</b> tissue <b>fusion.</b> However, long-term stability of ICG mesoporous nanoparticles is lost after 7 days of light exposure. In contrast Si@PCL/ICG nanoparticles demonstrated a strong heating capacity as well as a good DSC profile for <b>laser</b> tissue <b>fusion</b> and long-term stability of 3 weeks. Furthermore Si@PCL/ICG nanoparticles can be directly dispersed in spin-coated polycaprolactone polymer. Conclusion: Si@PCL/ICG nanoparticles have good long-term stability and polymer embedding properties suitable for <b>laser</b> tissue <b>fusion...</b>|$|R

25|$|These output {{energies}} {{are still}} {{less than the}} 422MJ of input energy required to charge the system's capacitors that power the laser amplifiers. The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least {{an order of magnitude}} more than this input. Commercial <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> systems would use the much more efficient diode-pumped solid state lasers, where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{assembled}} tube {{was made of}} beryllium tube and tungsten tube, and was produced by over fitting. The residual stresses in the {{assembled tube}} were very comprehensive after <b>lasers</b> braze <b>fusion</b> welding, not only including the welding residual stresses, but also the initial stresses from over fitting. Both of the dimension and strength were affected by the complex residual stress distribution in the assembled tube. MSC.

The stress fields during <b>lasers</b> braze <b>fusion</b> welding and the residual stresses after welding have been obtained, {{and the effect of}} over fitting on welding residual stress of the assembled tube have also been studied. The residual stresses at outer surface of the assembled tube have been measured by the X-ray diffraction method. A comparison of the residual stresses by finite element method (FEM) to that by experiment indicates an identical stress change trend and thus validates the FEM model...|$|R

Methods of exploration of laser thermonuclear targets by means of computational experiments were elaborated by Kurdyumov (together with academician RAS A.A. Samarskii).

In 1979, FEF representatives attended a Moscow conference on <b>laser</b> <b>fusion.</b> LaRouche began to promote the use of lasers and related technologies for both military and civilian purposes, calling for a [...] "revolution in machine tools." ...|$|E
2500|$|In <b>Laser</b> <b>fusion</b> progressed: in 1983, the NOVETTE laser was completed. The {{following}} December 1984, the ten beam NOVA laser was finished. Five years later, NOVA {{would produce}} a maximum of 120 kilojoules of infrared light, during a nanosecond pulse [...] Meanwhile, efforts focused on either fast delivery or beam smoothness. Both tried to deliver the energy uniformly to implode the target. One early {{problem was that the}} light in the infrared wavelength, lost lots of energy before hitting the fuel. Breakthroughs were made at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester. Rochester scientists used frequency-tripling crystals to transform the infrared laser beams into ultraviolet beams. In 1985, Donna Strickland and Gérard Mourou invented a method to amplify lasers pulses by [...] "chirping". This method changes a single wavelength into a full spectrum. The system then amplifies the laser at each wavelength and then reconstitutes the beam into one color. Chirp pulsed amplification became instrumental in building the National Ignition Facility and the Omega EP system. Most research into ICF was towards weapons research, because the implosion is relevant to nuclear weapons.|$|E

Hagelstein arrived in May 1975, but nearly left when he found the area to be [...] "disgusting" [...] and immediately surmised they were working on weapons research when he saw the barbed wire and armed guards. He stayed on only because he met interesting people.|$|R
5000|$|However, the AEC had {{considered}} <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> {{to be directly}} related to weapons development, and the news of KMS Fusion’s entry into the field raised many eyebrows. The commission directed KMS to stop its <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> research on these grounds. Siegel hired lawyers and even {{wrote a letter to}} President Nixon to refute these issues. In February 1971, two years after the proposed idea, KMS was granted a contract from the commission that would allow the company to work in <b>laser</b> <b>fusion.</b> KMS Fusion was under government control; however, the firm was without government funds and access to government information. This meant that they could not hire anyone who had worked in a weapons laboratory, and had to be completely privately funded. The delays that the commission were causing placed financial strains on the company before it even really began. KMS was required to hire guards and take other precautions to protect ideas that the government had decreed to be [...] "secret" [...] for reasons of national security. Siegel had to mortgage his other enterprises and enlist other private companies in order to secure funding. KMS’s confidence did stimulate public support for <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> research, but also put pressure on magnetic confinement technologies.|$|E

50|$|After {{review of}} these two {{contracts}} by the DoE, {{it was determined that}} the development of fusion power be left {{in the hands of the}} national labs. These labs had the resources, including computer systems and expensive laser systems, to have the best shot at producing <b>laser</b> <b>fusion.</b> The DoE suggested that KMS Fusion should still investigate target fabrication and laser-target interactions. The DoE saw KMS Fusion involved by “commercial mass production of <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> targets” and that is what they did for the national labs that could not make their own targets. KMS Fusion was involved in this role until they went under in 1993 after competition for a new DoE contract was opened.|$|E

A cylindrical plasma channel is created by two moderate intensity laser prepulses {{at the edge of a}} deuterium cluster jet along which an intense main laser pulse propagates several nanoseconds later. With the aid of this plasma channel, the main laser pulse will be allowed to deposit its energy into the central region of the deuterium gas jet where the cluster sizes are larger and the atomic density is higher. The plasma channel formation and its impact on the deuterium ion energy spectrum and the consequent fusion neutron yield have been investigated.

50|$|The 1976 {{contract}} {{had some}} lofty goals set for KMS Fusion. Their main goal was {{the generation of}} power from laser fusion; however, KMS Fusion also developed a new laser system, new targets and new ways of target fabrication. The targets used were large-diameter thin-walled targets made of glass, plastic or layers of both. They also developed targets that were completely solid, filled with a liquid, or filled with a gas to examine which would generate the most power. The only failure of the contract was that generation of power was not achieved by <b>laser</b> <b>fusion.</b> The failure was contributed to “specifying laser power based on calculations which could not adequately predict laser performance and from using dirty laser optical equipment”. This meant that the laser power received did not match with predicted power and therefore <b>laser</b> <b>fusion</b> could not be achieved at this lower power. KMS Fusion did not have sophisticated enough software to model their laser power output so a partnership with Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) was formed. Livermore software showed that KMS Fusion would receive 25% of the originally predicted laser power from their system. Other than the failure to generate power from <b>laser</b> <b>fusion,</b> the DoE stated that KMS Fusion’s work exceeded contract requirements.|$|E
50|$|In {{the drive}} to succeed with <b>laser</b> <b>fusion,</b> Siegel cannibalized the other KMS {{divisions}} and invested his own personal fortune.
