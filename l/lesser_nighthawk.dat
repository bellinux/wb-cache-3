2500|$|In warm climates, such as deserts {{and salt}} flats, heat rather than cold can kill the {{developing}} embryos. In such places, scrapes are shallower {{and tend to}} be lined with non-vegetative material (including shells, feathers, sticks and soil), which allows convective cooling to occur as air moves over the eggs. Some species, such as the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> and the red-tailed tropicbird, help reduce the nest's temperature by placing it in partial or full shade. [...] Others, including some shorebirds, cast shade with their bodies as they stand over their eggs. Some shorebirds also soak their breast feathers with water and then sit on the eggs, providing moisture to enable evaporative cooling. [...] Parent birds keep from overheating themselves by gular panting while they are incubating, frequently exchanging incubation duties, and standing in water {{when they are not}} incubating.|$|E
50|$|The common {{nighthawk}} resembles both the Antillean nighthawk and the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> and occurs at least seasonally {{in the entire}} North American range of both of these species. The <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> is a smaller bird and displays more buffy on the undertail coverts, where the {{common nighthawk}} shows white. Common nighthawks and Antillean nighthawks exhibit entirely dark on the basal portion of the primary feathers, whereas lesser nighthawks have bands of buffy spots. Common and Antillean nighthawks have a longer outermost primary conveying a pointier wing tip than the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk.</b> The common nighthawk forages higher above ground than the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> and has a different call. The only reliable way to distinguish Antillean nighthawk without disturbance is also by the differences in their calls. Visually, they may only be distinguished as different from the common nighthawk once in the hand. Subtle differences are reported {{to be a challenge}} in field identification.|$|E
50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> (Chordeiles acutipennis) is a {{nightjar}} {{found throughout}} {{a large part}} of the Americas.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} partial migrants. The <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> retreats from the United States and {{northern}} Mexico {{during the winter}} months. Occasionally single birds may be found overwintering. The nighthawk is also occasionally found as a vagrant to the US Gulf Coast states to Florida.|$|E
50|$|The common {{nighthawk}} winters in southern South America, but distribution in this range is poorly known due to difficulties in distinguishing the bird from the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> and in differentiating between migrants and overwintering birds. In some South and Central American countries, {{a lack of}} study has led to restricted and incomplete records of the bird. Records do support wintering in Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina.|$|E
50|$|On {{cold winter}} nights, these birds can reduce their body {{temperature}} {{by as much}} as 10 to 12 °C (from their normal temperature of about 42 °C) to conserve energy. Such a capacity for torpor is not very common in birds. Other bird species capable of torpor include the common swift Apus apus, the common poor-will Phalaenoptilus nuttallii, the <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> Chordeiles acutipennis, and various species of hummingbirds.|$|E
50|$|The Gulf of Panama {{supports}} {{the majority of}} waterbirds in Panama {{due in part to}} the mangrove swamps, as well as the opportunities for foraging in the shrimp ponds and agricultural areas.Bird species include Amazon kingfisher (Chloroceryle amazona),grey-necked wood rail (Aramides cajaneus), green kingfisher (Chloroceryle americana), <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> (Chordeiles acutipennis), mangrove black hawk (Buteogallus anthracinus subtilis), roseate spoonbill (Platalea ajaja), rufous-browed peppershrike (Cyclarhis gujanensis), rufous-necked wood rail (Aramides axillaris) and yellow-billed cotinga (Carpodectes antoniae).|$|E
50|$|The {{adults are}} dark with brown, grey and white {{patterning}} on the upperparts and breast; the long upperwings {{are black and}} show a white bar in flight. The tail is dark with white barring; the underparts are buffy with fine black horizontal streaking. The adult male has a white throat; the female has a light brown throat. This bird looks similar to the common nighthawk, but is slightly smaller, has a slightly less deeply forked tail, and is more buffy in coloration. The calls are also completely different. The <b>lesser</b> <b>nighthawk</b> has a rapid, low whistled melodious trill, lasting several seconds. It is usually heard only near breeding areas.|$|E

40|$|America, and {{occurs in}} Central America and Panama ' {{only as a}} transient. A {{breeding}} population is here recorded from Panama, almost a thousand miles southeast of Mexico, belonging to an undescribed subspecies. In a comparison of specimens, local color parallelism was noted with sym-patric populations of the <b>Lesser</b> <b>Nighthawk,</b> C. acutipennis. The taxonomic and distributional status of both species in southern Middle America is discussed. In my study of this group, Oberholser's (1914) monograph proved of basic usefulness, supplemented by Selander's (1954) paper on the western races of C. minor. The large collection of the American Museum of Natural History, plus additional examples lent by the Carnegie Museum, the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology, the Dickey Collection, and the United States National Museum, enabled me to reach certain conclusions regarding this con-troversial group...|$|E
