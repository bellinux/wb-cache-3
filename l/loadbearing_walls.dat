40|$|The recent {{earthquakes}} in Italy {{demonstrated the}} extreme vulnerability of {{historical and cultural}} structures. Masonry vaults, which represent artistically valuable elements of these constructions, have been recognised among the most vulnerable elements. Traditional vault retrofit methods, such as buttresses or ties, are still widely adopted. These retrofit methods prevent differential displacements between vault supports (e. g., abutments, masonry piers and <b>loadbearing</b> <b>walls).</b> However, the pier differential displacement {{is not the only}} vulnerability source for vaults, and in many cases, further retrofit interventions are needed. Innovative retrofit methods based on inorganic matrixes, such as IMG, are aimed to prevent hinge mechanism failures. Such methods are suitable to be applied on vaults already retrofitted using traditional methods. The knowledge of the seismic behaviour of a vault, once the differential displacement between the supports is prevented, can be crucial to the assessment of potential further vulnerabilities of vaults already retrofitted with traditional methods. However, a deep knowledge of vault seismic behaviour is still lacking from an experimental point of view. Indeed, to date, few dynamic experimental studies have been conducted. Therefore, to investigate the seismic behaviour of masonry barrel vaults, several shaking table tests were performed on a full-scale specimen before and after the retrofit interventions. The tests investigated the main seismic properties of the tested structure and clarified the cracking mechanisms and capacity improvement due to the retrofit interventions. A comprehensive overview of the main results of the experimental tests has been presented...|$|E

It is a 5 storey Hotel located on the main street facing the waterfront with multiple functions including a restaurant/bar on ground floor, a thermal bath and massage area on first floor and an outdoor pool on the third floor. The first floor (4. 8 x 4. 8 m) has smaller rooms with 4 bedrooms. The second floor (4. 8 x 5. 6 m) and third floor has 4 larger rooms (4. 8 x 6 m. The top floor has 2 presidential suites (8. 4 x 8 m) consisting a separate bedroom, a lounge room and a mini-bar.

40|$|Considerations of the Gold Coast's {{architectural}} heritage tend to privilege the signification of those building materials widely {{used during the}} city's post-war boom. This paper reflects on the breeze block as a material that opens debate on {{the relation of the}} city's image to its reality and its past. It offers a reflection on a moment of suburban expansion in which the tenets of high modernism were distilled into the architectural language of mid-century Australia. Despite its history as a low-cost material used primarily in the construction of <b>loadbearing</b> <b>walls,</b> the industrialised production of imitative rockface and decorative breeze blocks in the twentieth century marked an important shift in its role in American (and then an Austerican) domestic architecture. With the block's recalibration from structure to decoration, substance to skin, and with its widespread suburban uptake, the material engages with the longstanding role assigned the Gold Coast (from Robin Boyd onwards) as an accentuated moment among Australian cities and for Australian architecture. Common practices and manoeuvres therein find an extreme expression now informing disproportionate claims upon the specificity of their cultural significance. Offering {{a brief description of the}} breeze block's twentieth century turn to the pattern screen, this paper opens out on to instances where the image of the breezeblock within contemporary Australian art concerned with the Gold Coast (directly or otherwise) has served to emphasise this notion of breeze block as surface. In doing so, this paper positions research into the Gold Coast breeze block in light of 'official' efforts to align such other materials as fibro-cement with the city's collective memory (Fibro Coast, Arts Centre Gold Coast and Gold Coast Heritage, 2013 - 14) thereby fostering an institutionalised nostalgia - anchored to a fixed image of the city's architectural and urban history - that the breezeblock serves here to undermine.

40|$|Loadbearing masonry {{construction}} is a building system composed of masonry walls and concrete slabs, with the masonry walls supporting the slabs and {{acting as the}} main structural element resisting the lateral loads from wind and earthquake. In Australian practice, these buildings usually incorporate slip joints, which are placed between the unreinforced masonry walls and concrete slabs, to allow for long term differential movements between {{the walls and the}} slabs. In some areas they also serve as a membrane type damp-proof-course. Loadbearing masonry buildings are often composed of reinforced concrete slabs and supporting masonry walls arranged in a cellular pattern. In Australia, these buildings usually incorporate slip joints in the interfaces between walls and slabs, to allow for long term relative displacements caused by brick growth, concrete shrinkage, and thermal expansion and contraction. A common application of this technique is for ''walk up" apartment buildings up to five storeys [Page (2002) ]. In this system of building, wind and earthquake actions are resisted by the floor slab acting as horizontal diaphragm in conjunction with the <b>loadbearing</b> <b>walls.</b> The load path therefore includes the slip joints at the wall-floor interface. The distribution of those actions among the walls of that building initially depends on the elastic stiffness and arrangement of the walls. However, once either softening of masonry or slip in the joints occurs, a redistribution of shear loads will result. The redistribution of shear is a complex process and is influenced by many factors, such as the nonlinear behaviour of masonry and slip joints, the compressive stress level in the walls, and the walls arrangement [Sing-Sang et al. (2006) ]. In asymmetrical buildings, the centre of mass does not coincide with the centre of wall stiffness. Hence, the lateral loading action tends to twist the building, and causes an increase of shear in the walls located at one side of the centre of stiffness, and a reduction of shear in the other walls. The building twisting also induces shear loading in the walls perpendicular to the lateral load direction. This behaviour may accelerate or delay the masonry softening and the slip in the joints. When either softening of masonry or slip in the joints occurs, the centre of wall stiffness will also change its position. Thus, during the loading process the effects of building torsion may change the shear distribution making the prediction of wall forces a very complex process...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the seismic response of unreinforced masonry buildings is a popular topic all over the world. In recent years, also the Netherlands started to face seismic risk, since the induced seismicity {{in the north of}} the country considerably increased (the gas extraction started in 1963, and earthquakes have occurred since the early ‘ 90 s, with the highest magnitude equal to 3. 6 on the Richter scale experienced near Huizinge in 2012). This phenomenon has a wide impact on the built environment, which is mainly composed by unreinforced masonry. These buildings were not designed for seismic loading, and present specific characteristics such as very slender walls (a ratio height/thickness equal to 25), limited cooperation between walls and floors, and use of cavity walls, often connected by weak and corroded ties. To predict the behaviour of unreinforced masonry buildings, the use of numerical models and simple analytical design methods is required. These approaches necessitate the characterisation of the masonry at both material and structural level. An extensive large-scale testing program was performed at the Delft University of Technology to create benchmarks for the validation of the numerical and analytical models. The attention was mainly devoted to a terraced house typology, which was widely adopted for housing in the period 1960 - 1980. These houses were characterised by <b>loadbearing</b> <b>walls</b> of calcium silicate bricks and walls of clay bricks as outer leaves. In this framework, the paper presents an overview of the cyclic pushover tests performed on full-scale walls under either in-plane or out-of-plane loading. Seven full-scale unreinforced masonry (URM) walls were tested under in-plane loading. Two different series of solid brick masonry walls were considered: four specimens (COMP- 0 a, COMP- 1, COMP- 2, and COMP- 3) were characterized by a high aspect ratio (H/B = 2. 5), whereas three specimens (COMP- 4, COMP- 5, and COMP- 6) had low aspect ratios (H/B = 0. 6). Also two different configurations were considered, according to the provided boundary conditions at wall ends: cantilever walls, and double clamped walls. Five full-scale URM walls were tested in the out-of-plane direction by applying cyclic loading using a system of airbags. Two different geometries of brick masonry walls were considered: two specimens (COMP- 0 b and COMP- 7) were characterized by a high aspect ratio and tested in a one-way spanning configuration; other three specimens (COMP- 10, COMP- 11, and COMP- 12) had low aspect ratios and were tested in a two-way spanning configuration. All the walls were composed by solid calcium silicate masonry, except specimen COMP- 10 which was made of perforated clay brick masonry. Sample COMP- 12 contained a window opening, so that two asymmetric piers were determined at the sides of the window. For both the in-plane and the out-of-plane tests a description of the material properties, of the employed set-ups, and of the loading procedures is provided.

40|$|Preliminary {{tests on}} floor joist {{assemblies}} {{carried out at}} the University of Waterloo (Black et. al., 2002) revealed {{that there could be}} a significant reduction in the strength of the assembly with an offset load path such as that shown in Figure 1. Based on these findings, it was decided that a more extensive investigation of these assemblies was needed to determine the actual behaviour, and to define more appropriate alignment rules as needed. Test Configurations The test assemblies were constructed to model actual floor assemblies following the AISI Prescriptive Method (AISI 2001 b). Each specimen consisted of four floor joist pieces and was 4 -foot square. The drawings in Figure 2 show the test specimens for the 2 nd floor and bottom floor conditions. The 2 nd floor tests investigated the bearing of the joist on the lower <b>loadbearing</b> <b>wall</b> stud, so the test assembly as shown in Figure 2 is inverted from what would be the actual construction.

40|$|Sometimes in wood frame {{construction}} wall assemblies {{are required}} that have a higher axial loadbearing capacity than conventional <b>loadbearing</b> <b>wall</b> designs. To increase the axial load bearingcapacity to carry higher vertical loads, i. e. dead load or traffic load of upper building storeys, theframing has to be stronger, which {{can be achieved by}} either decreasing the spacing of the studs orby using stronger studs at a wider spacing. These significant structural measures increase the wallstiffness and thus can also affect the airborne sound insulation of the wall assemblies. The effectof wall stiffness on airborne sound insulation was investigated, by analysing bendingwavenumbers measured along the primary axis on the gypsum board leaf of a common staggeredstud wood frame wall and of assemblies with smaller than typical stud spacing (i. e. < 400 mm),with multi-stud columns at a wider spacing, and with shear membranes in various configurations. A correlation in the change of bending wavenumber results and the change of airborne soundinsulation was found in frequency ranges where the wall stiffness was influenced by the designchanges. The results are promising and a first step towards a method for the estimation ofairborne sound insulation changes from the mechanical properties of the wall.

40|$|The {{third and}} final {{excavation}} season at Stabiae of the Advanced Program of Ancient History and Art (APAHA) in 2014 in-tended to reach {{a better understanding of}} the architectural development of the Villa San Marco. To that end, two trenches were excavated. The first was located in a small, enclosed garden (viridarium) close to the atrium, suggested to be the Villa’s original core. This room is one of only a handful where two different architectural alignments meet (that of the Villa’s main part and that of its bathing complex) and where it is possible to excavate without removing mosaic flooring. In the adjacent architecture, signs of restructuring are visible, suggesting alterations to the arrangement of rooms. Those alterations notwithstanding, the results of the excavations showed that little rebuilding had occurred in this part of the Villa, except for a change to a system of drains related to a wall alteration. The second trench was located just north of the threshold of the Villa’s tablinum, where the threshold connects two sections of the Villa that have a different socioeconomic character: an undecorated working sector to the north and a decorated domestic sector to the south. Here as well the trench promised to be rewarding for investigations into architectural development. Together with the atrium, the tablinum is thought to have belonged to the Villa’s original construction. A surprise in this trench was that the tablinum foundation did not show signs of Republican-era construction. Another surprise was the discovery of a wide and deep wall, either the outside face of a large, out-of use cistern or the foundation for a demolished <b>loadbearing</b> <b>wall...</b>|$|R
40|$|In recent times, {{light gauge}} steel framed (LSF) structures, such as cold-formed steel wall systems, are {{increasingly}} used, but without {{a full understanding of}} their fire performance. Traditionally the fire resistance rating of these load-bearing LSF wall systems is based on approximate prescriptive methods developed based on limited fire tests. Very often they are limited to standard wall configurations used by the industry. Increased fire rating is provided simply by adding more plasterboards to these walls. This is not an acceptable situation as it not only inhibits innovation and structural and cost efficiencies but also casts doubt over the fire safety of these wall systems. Hence a detailed fire research study into the performance of LSF wall systems was undertaken using full scale fire tests and extensive numerical studies. A new composite wall panel developed at QUT was also considered in this study, where the insulation was used externally between the plasterboards {{on both sides of the}} steel wall frame instead of locating it in the cavity. Three full scale fire tests of LSF wall systems built using the new composite panel system were undertaken at a higher load ratio using a gas furnace designed to deliver heat in accordance with the standard time temperature curve in AS 1530. 4 (SA, 2005). Fire tests included the measurements of load-deformation characteristics of LSF walls until failure as well as associated time-temperature measurements across the thickness and along the length of all the specimens. Tests of LSF walls under axial compression load have shown the improvement to their fire performance and fire resistance rating when the new composite panel was used. Hence this research recommends the use of the new composite panel system for cold-formed LSF walls. The numerical study was undertaken using a finite element program ABAQUS. The finite element analyses were conducted under both steady state and transient state conditions using the measured hot and cold flange temperature distributions from the fire tests. The elevated temperature reduction factors for mechanical properties were based on the equations proposed by Dolamune Kankanamge and Mahendran (2011). These finite element models were first validated by comparing their results with experimental test results from this study and Kolarkar (2010). The developed finite element models were able to predict the failure times within 5 minutes. The validated model was then used in a detailed numerical study into the strength of cold-formed thin-walled steel channels used in both the conventional and the new composite panel systems to increase the understanding of their behaviour under nonuniform elevated temperature conditions and to develop fire design rules. The measured time-temperature distributions obtained from the fire tests were used. Since the fire tests showed that the plasterboards provided sufficient lateral restraint until the failure of LSF wall panels, this assumption was also used in the analyses and was further validated by comparison with experimental results. Hence in this study of LSF wall studs, only the flexural buckling about the major axis and local buckling were considered. A new fire design method was proposed using AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005), NAS (AISI, 2007) and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006). The importance of considering thermal bowing, magnified thermal bowing and neutral axis shift in the fire design was also investigated. A spread sheet based design tool was developed based on the above design codes to predict the failure load ratio versus time and temperature for varying LSF wall configurations including insulations. Idealised time-temperature profiles were developed based on the measured temperature values of the studs. This was used in a detailed numerical study to fully understand the structural behaviour of LSF wall panels. Appropriate equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for different composite panels, varying in steel thickness, steel grade and screw spacing for any load ratio. Hence useful and simple design rules were proposed based on the current cold-formed steel structures and fire design standards, and their accuracy and advantages were discussed. The results were also used to validate the fire design rules developed based on AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) and Eurocode Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006). This demonstrated the significant improvements to the design method when compared to the currently used prescriptive design methods for LSF wall systems under fire conditions. In summary, this research has developed comprehensive experimental and numerical thermal and structural performance data for both the conventional and the proposed new load bearing LSF wall systems under standard fire conditions. Finite element models were developed to predict the failure times of LSF walls accurately. Idealized hot flange temperature profiles were developed for non-insulated, cavity and externally insulated load bearing wall systems. Suitable fire design rules and spread sheet based design tools were developed based on the existing standards to predict the ultimate failure load, failure times and failure temperatures of LSF wall studs. Simplified equations were proposed to find the critical temperatures for varying wall panel configurations and load ratios. The results from this research are useful to both structural and fire engineers and researchers. Most importantly, this research has significantly improved the knowledge and understanding of cold-formed LSF <b>loadbearing</b> <b>walls</b> under standard fire conditions...|$|E
50|$|Jonathan Sergison and Stephen Bates met in London in {{the early}} 1990s and {{were part of a}} group of architects, theorists and artists who met {{regularly}} between 1994 and 1995. The group (informally called Papers on architecture) had a common interest in the urban character of London and the work of Alison and Peter Smithson. Among the earliest realised projects by Sergison Bates architects are the public house (pub) in Walsall and the semi-detached house in Stevenage, both of which use motifs of informal architecture. A number of other small scale projects, primarily in London, followed, which also displayed an interest in creating a robust architectural expression through the use of lightweight low-tech construction methods (i.e. thin brick-slip façade panels on the Studio house in Bethnal Green and cement boards as cladding for a timber panel structure in the self-build housing project in Tilbury). This preoccupation with breathing layered wall constructions culminated in the exhibition project and book “Brick-work: thinking and making”. The unrealised competition design for a museum on the Danish island Bornholm (included in “Brick-work”) indicated a shift towards a more heavy and monolithic construction form and spatial expression. Two examples of this change in direction are the Urban housing project in Finsbury Park built with a <b>loadbearing</b> <b>wall</b> of brickwork and precast concrete, and the Centre for the applied arts in Ruthin that adopted structure and pigmented façade elements made of concrete cast in situ.

Different braided fibrous structures were produced with different surface characteristics (different spacing between the surface ribs). The adhesion between these braided structures and cement mortar was characterized using pull-out tests and according to the experimental results, the braided structures produced by replacing two polyester braiding yarns with polyester braids and produced at higher take up speed showed excellent adhesion with the mortar, leading to complete breakage of these structures before being pulled out.
