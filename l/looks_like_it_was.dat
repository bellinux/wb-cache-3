500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and bring us into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the DVD in 2008, Record Collector stated that [...] "25 years on, [...] lost none of its power". Rocky Mountain News {{recalled}} that the video is [...] "still a thrilling performance, raw but polished, passionate and sincere". Andrew Gilstrap of PopMatters gave the remastered version of the film a rating of 8 out of 10, stating, [...] "It's rare that a band can totally transform a scene—especially one with a stage show that boasts charisma as its only special effect—but it's not hyperbole to say that U2 put on a dominating, flawless-despite-mistakes performance. This is the one that put U2 on the map." [...] In its review of the remastered version of Under a Blood Red Sky, online magazine Pitchfork Media said, [...] "when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything—earth, wind, fire—in place to maximise and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs." [...] James Wigney of The Sunday Telegraph and the Sunday Herald Sun gave the DVD a score of 5 out of 5, praising the film's concert, but stated that the [...] "footage is still on the fuzzy side". The Advertiser said the DVD's audio commentary was very informative, but criticised the picture quality, stating, [...] "even the remastered version <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> shot on a mobile phone".|$|E

Jason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote that one [...] "gets {{the feeling that}} 'Treasure', with its grand harmonies, classically kooky hooks and slyly sexual undertones, is the musical mode that makes Mars the happiest", while Spins Dan Hyman favorably compared [...] "Treasure" [...] {{to the work of}} American disco artist Donna Summer. Journalist Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a rating of 4 out of 5, and noted that it [...] "sounds like a modern day 'Rock with You', a feat that few could get away with pulling off so authentically". Katie Hasty, while reviewing the songs of the summer of 2013, said [...] "it <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> culled straight out of Soul Train". Ryan Reed of Paste Magazine gave the song a positive review, and described [...] "Treasure" [...] as a [...] "stripper-theme funk-pop with gooey synth pads and enormous slap-bass fills that punch through like air-humps". Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commented that [...] "Treasure" [...] is [...] "creamy Michael Jackson/Prince-schooled disco soul", while Matt Cibula from Pop Matters also compared the [...] "funky" [...] song to the work of those two musicians when he said that [...] "Treasure" [...] "knows that a flirt beats a bleat any day". Matthew Horton from BBC Music wrote that the track has a [...] "sugary early 80s funk", and that it [...] "is lathered in so much slap bass it starts to sting". Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club wrote that for this [...] "disco-spiked" [...] song, Mars [...] "capably sells himself as a one-man Maroon 5". Tim Sendra of AllMusic found that the song had a [...] "easy-going charm" [...] of the previous album, and described it as [...] "MJ-inspired disco jam". On a mixed review for The Scotsman, Fiona Shepherd wrote that [...] "Treasure" [...] is [...] "likeable pop funk".|$|E
2500|$|Alex Navarro of GameSpot {{rated the}} game 3 out of 10 {{and called it}} a [...] "collection of games that you can play better {{versions}} of for free or significantly cheaper elsewhere on the Internet. Not only are these games overly simplistic, they're just not that much fun." [...] Navarro wrote, [...] "Most offensive of all, however, is how cheaply The Apprentice handles its license. This game presents itself horribly. It <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> programmed hastily with Macromedia, with all the characters appearing as weirdly drawn cartoon versions of themselves." [...] Navarro also criticized the game's audio clips of Donald Trump, and its short length, noting that the entire game could be completed in 20 minutes.|$|E

On 17 April, around 600 {{collection}} agents {{claiming to}} be associated with Saradha Group assembled at the headquarters of TMC and demanded government intervention. Despondency quickly spread across Bengal. A Times of India interviewee said, [...] "'The entire Dakshin Barasat today <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hit by a cyclone. Every home has a bankrupt depositor or a fugitive agent. People who were once friends became enemies. Happy households became miserable. Students stopped going to school.

He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing {{because you have to}} be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said the first time he saw it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you."

He wears a vest and his hair <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> styled during a power cut. He runs along towpaths in skimpy orange swimming trunks and has a torso that's closer to a Party Seven than six pack. He has no concept of innocent until proved guilty and thinks it's acceptable to turn up to a swingers' evening with a prostitute he's just busted. He's racist, disablist and homophobic, and he calls his only female detective Flash Knickers. (And he means it as a compliment.) In fact when you see Hunt's qualities spelled out like that, it looks appalling. [...] the fact remains: Gene Hunt is my guilty secret, and I know scores of other women feel the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among critics, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times, {{gave the}} film two {{stars in a}} mostly {{negative}} review, saying the film lacked a science fiction theme and was more akin to a police murder revenge flick, musing [...] "they've just taken the standard cop-buddy-drug lord routine and changed some of the makeup. The Newcomers have no surprises." [...] Regarding the fictional alien culture, he expressed disappointment saying [...] "a feeble attempt is made to invest the Newcomers with interest, by having them get drunk on sour milk instead of booze, and depriving them of any sense of humor." [...] However, on a slightly complimentary note, Ebert mentioned [...] "the makeup took trouble, the photography looks good, the cast and technical credits are top-drawer." [...] But overall, he summed it up by declaring [...] "Alien Nation feels like a movie made {{by people who have}} seen a lot of movies, but don't think the audience has." [...] In agreement with Ebert over the originality of the buddy cop genre with the aliens inserted in as just a new rendition, Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said, [...] "Alien Nation wants to be [...] "In the Heat of the Night" [...] as science fiction, but it's neither morally instructive nor prophetic. It proves a lumbering marriage of action and sci-fi that alienates both audiences. It's too dull for one and too dumb for the other." [...] Kempley did find the first half hour to be suspenseful, though: [...] "... well paced, brawny and intense, <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made by another director. But the rest is the cinematic equivalent of overcooked asparagus." [...] However, the more enthusiastic staff of Variety found originality in the extraterrestrial–injected plot saying, [...] "Solid performances by leads James Caan and his humanoid buddy-cop partner Mandy Patinkin move this production beyond special effects, clever alien makeup and car chases." [...] while also adding the film was a [...] "compelling human-humanoid drama." ...|$|E
