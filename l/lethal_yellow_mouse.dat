40|$|Insights {{into the}} {{etiology}} of human obesity have arisen {{from the study of}} animal models. Animal models of obesity are also important for the development of future treatments of obesity. An agouti mouse mutation resulting in obese, yellow mice was described over a century ago and in 1992 agouti was cloned, making it the first obesity gene characterized at the molecular level. The <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mouse</b> mutation is one of five dominant agouti mutations and is an excellent model for human obesity. The molecular categorization of agouti was responsible for the elucidation of the melanocortin system's involvement in hypothalamic weight regulation. As genetic knowledge increases many transgenic mice have been created with genes either over-expressed or deleted, models which further enhance the understanding of obesity...|$|E
40|$|The {{mahogany}} (mg) locus {{originally was}} identified as a recessive suppressor of agouti, a locus encoding a skin peptide that modifies coat color by antagonizing the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor or MC 1 -R. Certain dominant alleles of agouti cause an obesity syndrome when ectopic expression of the peptide aberrantly antagonizes the MC 4 -R, a related melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor expressed in hypothalamic circuitry and involved in the regulation of feeding behavior and metabolism. Recent work has demonstrated that mg, when homozygous, blocks not only the ability of agouti to induce a yellow coat color when expressed in the skin of the <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mouse</b> (AY), but also the obesity resulting from ectopic expression of agouti in the brain. Detailed analysis of mg/mg AY/a animals, presented here, demonstrates that mg/mg blocks the obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and increased linear growth induced by ectopic expression of the agouti peptide. Remarkably, however, mg/mg did not reduce hyperphagia in the AY/a mouse. Furthermore, mg/mg induced hyperphagia and an increase in basal metabolic rate in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse in the absence of AY. Consequently, although mahogany is broadly required for agouti peptide action, it also appears {{to be involved in the}} control of metabolic rate and feeding behavior independent of its suppression of agouti...|$|E

To determine {{the relationship between}} altered leptin physiology and reproductive function in these mice, we compared body weight (BW), serum leptin concentration, ovulation rate, and in vitro blastocyst development among 120 - and 180 -d-old <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> and black non-mutant (a/a) <b>mice.</b> Estrous female <b>yellow</b> and black <b>mice</b> were mated with fertile black males.

BW, serum leptin levels, and the leptin:BW ratio differed among groups as follows: 180 -d yellow > 120 -d yellow > 180 -d black = 120 -d black. Ovulation rate was similar among 120 -d yellow and black, and 180 -d black mice. Among 180 -d <b>yellow</b> <b>mice,</b> five of twelve mice failed to ovulate, but the other seven mice ovulated a similar number of oocytes as their black counterparts (8. 4 ± 0. 9 versus 8. 0 ± 1. 3). Non-ovulators had higher (P < 0. 05) leptin levels (56. 6 ± 1. 8 ng*mL- 1) than ovulators (46. 2 ± 3. 5), but BW did not differ significantly. Fewer embryos from 180 -d <b>yellow</b> <b>mice</b> reached the blastocyst stage in culture than did the embryos from black mice (55 % versus 83 %, P < 0. 05). Moreover, blastocyst development in 180 -d old <b>yellow</b> <b>mice</b> negatively correlated with leptin levels (r = - 0. 797, P = 0. 032) and leptin:BW ratio (r = - 0. 847, P = 0. 016), but not with BW.

40|$|At {{the final}} step of {{melanocyte}} differentiation in mouse hair follicles, the cells produce melanin. The type of melanin they produce is, however, determined by the tissue environment of hair follicles. In wild-type mice, melanocytes located in hair bulbs synthesize eumelanin {{at the beginning of}} hair growth. They subsequently produce pheomelanin and finally produce eumelanin again. Therefore, the hair is characterized by a subterminal band of yellow, with the rest of it displaying black. This characteristic is called the agouti pattern and is known to be determined by the wild-type allele, A at the a (agouti) locus, which is considered to function in the follicular cells. Expression of the agouti pattern is altered by genetic substitutions at the a locus and the e (extension) locus. Animals heterozygous for the Ay (<b>lethal</b> <b>yellow)</b> allele exhibit yellow coat color; those homozygous for the e (recessive yellow) also produce yellow hair exclusively. By using an organ culture method, we demonstrated that α-MSH and cholera toxin, as well as forskolin, induced eumelanin synthesis in expiants from <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mice</b> (Ay/a). On the other hand, these reagents did not induce eumelanogenesis in the hair follicles of recessive <b>yellow</b> (e/e) <b>mice.</b> Therefore, we assume that the product of the a locus, which probably functions in follicle cells, interacts with α-MSH at the α-MSH receptor and that the e locus controls the functionality of adenylate cyclase in the membrane of mouse melanocytes.

In black mice (C 57 BL/ 6 J, a/a), N-acetyl- 4 -S-CAP showed dose-dependent depigmenting potency (0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 mmol/kg), which was in parallel to the tissue eumelanin content (98 %, 28 %, and 3 % of controls, respectively) and to the tissue glutathione content (94 %, 85 %, and 76 %, respectively). In <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mice</b> (C 57 BL/ 6 J, Ay/a), only a dose of 2. 0 mmol/kg showed the color change of hair to dark, not to white as seen in black mice. This was reflected by the decrease of pheomelanin content (56 %) and the increase of eumelanin content (28 % of black mice). The simultaneous administration of N-acetyl-cysteine, which up-regulated glutathione content, completely abolished the depigmenting potency of N-acetyl- 4 -S-CAP, whereas administration of buthionine sulfoximine, which depleted the tissue glutathione content, enhanced the depigmenting potency of N-acetyh 4 -S-CAP in black hair. In <b>yellow</b> <b>mice,</b> the darkening of hair follicles by 2. 0 mmol/kg of N-acetyl- 4 -S-CAP was completely abolished by the combined administration of N-acetyl-cysteine, with the resulting hair color {{the same as in}} controls, whereas combined administration with buthionine sulfoximine caused some whitening of yellow hair follicles, Our data indicate that the tissue content of glutathione regulates melanocytotoxicity and depigmenting potency of N-acetyl- 4 -S-CAP and that this alteration of glutathione content may switch the melanogenesis type from pheomelanin to eumelanin...|$|R

40|$|Ectopic {{overexpression}} of the agouti {{protein in}} the <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> (Ay/a) <b>mouse</b> causes a <b>yellow</b> coat {{as well as}} the <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> syndrome. Presence of thiols like glutathione (GSH) or cysteine (Cys) may regulate the conversion of dopaquinone to phacomelanin in hair follicle melanocytes. GSH also plays important roles in cellular health and maintenance. Cys and GSH were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography in hair follicles and serum of AwJ/AwJ (agouti), Ay/a (yellow), and a/a (black) mice over a 20 -d hair growth regeneration period. Agouti alleles modulate thiol concentrations. Ay/a hair follicles exhibited higher total thiol levels and an increased ratio of Cys to GSH. AwJ/AwJ mice showed intermediate levels, while a/a mice had lowest total thiol concentrations and a decreased ratio of Cys to GSH. Hair follicle cysteine concentrations showed yellow > agouti > black (p < 0. 01). In all genotypes, unplucked skin and day 0 hair follicles showed GSH as the major thiol, but a shift to predominantly Cys on peak melanogenic days was seen. Presence of high concentrations of free cysteine support the hypothesis of phaeontelanin synthesis via cysteinyldopas. The Ay/a mouse had the most dramatic follicular thiol changes as well as a depression in serum thiols. An altered thiol metabolism in these and other Ay/a tissues might impair normal cell functioning to contribute to the <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> syndrome...|$|R
40|$|ASIP is an {{important}} pigmentation gene responsible for dorsoventral and hair-cycle-specific melanin-based color patterning in mammals. We report {{some of the first}} evidence that the avian ASIP gene has a role in pigmentation. We have characterized the genetic basis of the homozygous <b>lethal</b> Japanese quail <b>yellow</b> mutation as a > 90 -kb deletion upstream of ASIP. This deletion encompasses almost the entire coding sequence of two upstream loci, RALY and EIF 2 B, and places ASIP expression under control of the RALY promoter, leading to the presence of a novel transcript. ASIP mRNA expression was upregulated in many tissues in yellow compared to wild type but was not universal, and consistent differences were not observed among skins of yellow and wild-type quail. In a microarray analysis on developing feather buds, the locus with the largest downregulation in yellow quail was SLC 24 A 5, implying that it is regulated by ASIP. Finally, we document the presence of ventral skin-specific isoforms of ASIP mRNA in both wild-type quails and chickens. Overall, there are remarkable similarities between yellow in quail and <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> in <b>mouse,</b> which involve a deletion in a similar genomic position. The presence of ventral-specific ASIP expression in birds shows that this feature is conserved across vertebrates...|$|R
40|$|Agouti <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> (Ay) <b>mice</b> express agouti ectopically {{because of}} a genetic {{rearrangement}} at the agouti locus. The agouti peptide is a potent antagonist of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC 4 R) expressed in neurons, and this leads to hyperphagia, hypoactivity, and increased fat mass. The MC 4 R signals through Gs and is thought to stimulate the production of cAMP and activation of downstream cAMP effector molecules such as PKA. Disruption of the RIIβ regulatory subunit gene of PKA results in release of the active catalytic subunit {{and an increase in}} basal PKA activity in cells where RIIβ is highly expressed. Because RIIβ is expressed in neurons including those in the hypothalamic nuclei where MC 4 R is prominent we tested the possibility that the RIIβ knockout might rescue the body weight phenotypes of the Ay mice. Disruption of the RIIβ PKA regulatory subunit gene in mice leads to a 50 % reduction in white adipose tissue and resistance to diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia. The RIIβ mutation rescued the elevated body weight, hyperphagia, and obesity of Ay mice. Partial rescue of the Ay phenotypes was even observed on an RIIβ heterozygote background. These results suggest that the RIIβ gene mutation alters adiposity and locomotor activity by modifying PKA signaling pathways downstream of the agouti antagonism of MC 4 R in the hypothalamus...|$|R

40|$|Agouti {{protein and}} Agouti-related protein (Agrp) are paracrine-signaling {{molecules}} that normally regulate pigmentation and body weight, respectively. These proteins antagonize {{the effects of}} α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) and other melanocortins, and several alternatives have been proposed to explain their biochemical mechanisms of action. We have used a sensitive bioassay based on Xenopus melanophores to characterize pharmacologic properties of recombinant Agouti protein, and have directly measured its cell-surface binding to mammalian cells by use of an epitope-tagged form (HA–Agouti) that retains biologic activity. In melanophores, Agouti protein has no effect {{in the absence of}} α-MSH, but its action cannot be explained solely by inhibition of α-MSH binding. In 293 T cells, expression of the Mc 1 r confers a specific, high-affinity binding site for HA-Agouti. Binding is inhibited by α-MSH, or by Agrp, which indicates that α-MSH and Agouti protein bind in a mutually exclusive way to the Mc 1 r, and that the similarity between Agouti protein and Agrp includes their binding sites. The effects of Agouti and the Mc 1 r in vivo have been examined in a sensitized background provided by the chinchilla (Tyrc-ch) mutation, which uncovers a phenotypic difference between overexpression of Agouti in <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> (Ay/a) <b>mice</b> and loss of Mc 1 r function in recessive yellow (Mc 1 re/Mc 1 re) mice. Double and triple mutant studies indicate that a functional Mc 1 r is required for the pigmentary effects of Agouti, and suggest that Agouti protein can act as an agonist of the Mc 1 r in a way that differs from α-MSH stimulation. These results resolve questions regarding the biochemical mechanism of Agouti protein action, and provide evidence of a novel signaling mechanism whereby α-MSH and Agouti protein or Agrp function as independent ligands that inhibit each other’s binding and transduce opposite signals through a single receptor...|$|R

Intracerebroventricular infusion of antisense oligonucleotide targeted to this transcript selectively suppressed its hypothalamic mRNA levels and resulted in loss of body weight in both P. obesus and Sprague Dawley rats. Reductions in body weight were mediated by profoundly reduced food intake without a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate.

40|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} clear that female obesity {{is associated with a}} myriad of adverse side effects including abnormal female reproduction due, in part, to amenorrhea and anovulatory infertility. The <b>lethal</b> <b>yellow</b> (LY) <b>mouse</b> possesses a deletion mutation which results in ectopic expression of agouti and adult-onset obesity. Furthermore, LY mice exhibit premature loss of fertility, which has been associated with progressive obesity making the LY mouse line an excellent model to study the effects of obesity-dependent factors on ovarian function. In the current study blood serum and granulosa cells were obtained from LY (Ay/a) and age-matched B 6 controls (C 57 BL/ 6 J) to identify changes in metabolic hormone profiles and gene expression, respectively. As expected, LY females exhibited higher circulating levels of insulin and leptin compared to age-matched B 6 controls. For the first time, we identified a significant increase in circulating insulin like-growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) levels in the LY compared to B 6 at 6 weeks of age. Despite these differences in circulating hormone levels, there was little evidence that gene expression is altered in age-matched granulosa cells from LY and B 6 females. However, age-dependent changes in the expression of several genes involved in follicular growth in both LY and B 6 females were detected. 	Given that IGF- 1 exhibited increased levels in LY compared to B 6 mice at 6 weeks of age, the objective of our in vitro {{study was to determine the}} role of IGF- 1 on granulosa cell gene expression. To this end, short-term granulosa cell cultures were treated with cAMP (the second messenger of both FSH and LH signaling), IGF- 1, or a combination of both. IGF- 1 had an additive effect on cAMP-dependent regulation of a subset of genes involved in follicular growth, bi-directional communication, steroidogenesis, and ovulation. Western blot analyses provided evidence that the additive effect of IGF- 1 on cAMP regulation of gene expression is mediated by stimulation of Akt phosphorylation. Thus, the cooperative effect of IGF- 1 on FSH- and LH-dependent signaling may enhance the expression of genes which are crucial for optimal follicular growth and ovulation. Furthermore, these collective data provide a plausible mechanism for age and obesity-dependent anovulatory infertility...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether genes {{that are less}} conserved than the 16 S rRNA gene can distinguish Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense strains that are identical based on their 16 S rRNA genes, {{with a view to}} providing insight into their origins and distribution, and any patterns of association with particular plant hosts. Sequence analysis of the tuf gene and rp operon showed that Ca. P. australiense strains could be differentiated into four subgroups, named 16 SrXII-B (tuf-Australia I; rp-A), 16 SrXII-B (tuf-New Zealand I; rp-B), 16 SrXII-B (tuf-New Zealand II) and 16 SrXII-B (rp-C). Strawberry <b>lethal</b> <b>yellows</b> 1, strawberry green petal, Australian grapevine yellows, pumpkin yellow leaf curl and cottonbush witches 2 ̆ 7 broom phytoplasmas were designated members of the 16 SrXII-B (tuf-Australia I; rp-A) subgroup. The strawberry <b>lethal</b> <b>yellows</b> 2 and cottonbush reduced yellow leaves phytoplasmas were assigned to the 16 SrXII (tuf-New Zealand II; rp-B) subgroup. No relationship was observed between these phytoplasma subgroups and collection date, location or host plant. However, the study revealed evolutionary divergence in the 16 SrXII group...|$|R
