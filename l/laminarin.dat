40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sulfated modification of <b>laminarin</b> and the changes in structure and antitumor activity. The chlorosulfonic acid‑pyridine method was applied for sulfated modification. The molecular weights of <b>laminarin</b> and <b>laminarin</b> sulfate (LAMS) were measured by high‑performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and IR and NMR spectra were also recorded. The surface conforma-tions of <b>laminarin</b> and LAMS were observed with a scanning electron microscope. The antitumor activities of the two poly-saccharides were also evaluated using an MTT assay. LAMS with a sulfate content of 45. 92 % and a molecular weight of 16, 000 was synthesized. The IR spectra of <b>laminarin</b> and LAMS showed the characteristic absorption peaks of a poly-saccharide, and LAMS also had the characteristic absorption peaks of sulfate moieties. The NMR spectra showed that lami-narin and LAMS had β‑(1 → 3) glycosidic bonds forming the main chain, and sulfate substitution was at the hydroxyl groups of C 2 and C 6. Under the scanning electron microscope, there were clear differences in surface conformation between lami-narin and LAMS; <b>laminarin</b> was cloud‑like and spongy, while LAMS was block‑like and flaky. The MTT results showed that <b>laminarin</b> and LAMS had inhibitory effects on LoVo cell growth, and the antitumor activity of LAMS was higher than that of <b>laminarin</b> at the same concentration.

We show that <b>laminarin,</b> a b- 1, 3 glucan with elicitor activity in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), becomes, after chemical sulfation, an inducer of the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway in tobacco and Arabidopsis thaliana. In tobacco cell suspensions, the oxidative burst induced by the <b>laminarin</b> sulfate PS 3 was Ca 2 þ dependent but partially kinase independent, whereas <b>laminarin</b> triggered a strickly kinase-dependent oxidative burst. Cells treated with PS 3 or <b>laminarin</b> remained fully responsive to a second application of <b>laminarin</b> or PS 3, respectively, suggesting two distinct perception systems. In tobacco leaves, PS 3, but not <b>laminarin,</b> caused electrolyte leakage and triggered scopoletin and SA accumulation. Expression of different families of Pathogenesis-Related (PR) proteins was analyzed in wild-type and mutant tobacco as well as in Arabidopsis. <b>Laminarin</b> induced expression of ethylene-dependent PR proteins, whereas PS 3 triggered expression of ethylene- and SA-dependent PR proteins. In Arabidopsis, PS 3 -induced PR 1 expression was also NPR 1 (for nonexpressor of PR genes 1) dependent. Structure-activity analysis revealed that (1) a minimum chain length is essential for biological activity of unsulfated as well as sulfated <b>laminarin,</b> (2) the sulfate residues are essential and cannot be replaced by other anionic groups, and (3) moderately sulfated b- 1, 3 glucans are active.

However, the functions and mechanisms of <b>laminarin</b> in pulmonary oxidative damage are poorly understood. This study aimed at investigating the protective effect of <b>laminarin</b> against pulmonary oxidative damage and underlying mechanisms. Human lung fibroblasts MRC- 5 cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide to induce oxidative damage. <b>Laminarin</b> treatment was performed before or after hydrogen peroxide treatment, and then major indexes of oxidative damage, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH) and catalase (CAT), were quantified by biochemical assays. The expression of oxidation-related factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF 2) was analyzed by qPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence assay. NRF 2 knockdown and overexpression were performed by cell transfection to reveal possible mechanisms. Results showed that <b>laminarin</b> treatment of 0. 020 mg/mL for 24 h, especially the pre-treatment, could significantly relieve changes in SOD, MDA, GSH and CAT that were altered by hydrogen peroxide, and promote NRF 2 mRNA (P <  0. 001).

LOVO cells were treated with different concentrations of <b>laminarin</b> at different times. Morphology observations were performed to determine the effects of <b>laminarin</b> on apoptosis of LOVO cells. Flow cytometry (FCM) was used to detect the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and pH.

A dose of 200 μg mL− 1 <b>laminarin</b> or oligogalacturonides induced within a few minutes a 1. 9 -pH-units alkalinization of the extracellular medium and a transient release of H 2 O 2. After a few hours, a strong stimulation of Phe ammonia-lyase, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, and lipoxygenase activities occurred, as well as accumulation of salicylic acid. Neither of the two oligosaccharides induced tissue damage or cell death nor did they induce accumulation of the typical tobacco phytoalexin capsidiol, in contrast with the effects of the proteinaceous elicitor β-megaspermin. Structure activity studies with <b>laminarin,</b> <b>laminarin</b> oligomers, high molecular weight β- 1, 3 – 1, 6 glucans from fungal cell walls, and the β- 1, 6 – 1, 3 heptaglucan showed that the elicitor effects observed in tobacco with β-glucans are specific to linear β- 1, 3 linkages, with laminaripentaose being the smallest elicitor-active structure. In accordance with its strong stimulating effect on defense responses in tobacco cells, infiltration of 200 μg mL− 1 <b>laminarin</b> in tobacco leaves triggered accumulation within 48 h of the four families of antimicrobial pathogenesis-related proteins investigated. Challenge of the laminarin-infiltrated leaves 5 d after treatment with the soft rot pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora resulted in a strong reduction of the infection when compared with water-treated leaves...|$|E
