5000|$|The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is a {{fundamental}} theorem of aerodynamics used for the calculation of the lift of an airfoil and any two-dimensional bodies including circular cylinders translating in a uniform fluid at a constant speed large enough so that the flow seen in the body-fixed frame is steady and unseparated. The theorem relates the lift generated by an airfoil to {{the speed of the}} airfoil through the fluid, the density of the fluid and the circulation around the airfoil. The circulation is defined as the line integral around a closed loop enclosing the airfoil of the component of the velocity of the fluid tangent to the loop. [...] It is named after the German Martin Wilhelm Kutta and the Russian Nikolai Zhukovsky (or Joukowski) who first developed its key ideas in the early 20th century. Kutta-Joukowski theorem is an inviscid theory, but it is a good approximation for real viscous flow in typical aerodynamic applications. [...] Kutta-Joukowski theorem relates lift to circulation much like the Magnus effect relates side force (called Magnus force) to rotation. However, the circulation here is not induced by rotation of the airfoil. The fluid flow {{in the presence of the}} airfoil can be considered to be the superposition of a translational flow and a rotating flow. This rotating flow is induced by the effects of camber, angle of attack and a sharp trailing edge of the airfoil. It should not be confused with a vortex like a tornado encircling the airfoil. At a large distance from the airfoil, the rotating flow may be regarded as induced by a <b>line</b> <b>vortex</b> (with the rotating line perpendicular to the two-dimensional plane). In the derivation of the Kutta-Joukowski theorem the airfoil is usually mapped onto a circular cylinder. The theorem is proved in many text books for a circular cylinder and the Joukowski airfoil, but it holds true for general airfoils.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{rotating}} neutron superfluid in {{the inner}} crust of a neutron star is threaded by quantized <b>vortex</b> <b>lines.</b> The pinning force from lattice nuclei and the Magnus force from neutron superfluid act onto a <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> that has a finite tension. The configuration of a <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> in equilibrium comprises a number of pinned straight lengths separated by unpinned kinks when the rotation axis is slightly inclined to the major axis of a crystal lattice and the Magnus force is not so strong. Energy of ∼ 4 MeV is required to form a kink at densities of ∼ 3. 4 × 10 13 g cm − 3. Magnus force makes the <b>vortex</b> <b>line</b> parabolic on global scale. There exist two modes, rotational and helical (Kelvin), for oscillations allowed on a <b>vortex</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>vortex</b> oscillations in the pinned straight segments are possible only above a minimum frequency.
