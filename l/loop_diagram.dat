40|$|Models for {{numerical}} simulations {{should be}} described in a coherent style. They {{are expected to have}} consistencies at the causal dependency level. However, System Dynamics causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> can have inconsistencies. This diagram style’s arrows, concerning flow and stock relationships, can have the opposite direction of stock flow diagrams which can numerically simulate models. These inconsistencies can cause inappropriate qualitative simulations so that it is sometimes recommended to use stock flow diagrams instead of causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> even for qualitative simulations. However, causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> have merits in their use. Causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> are intuitively easy to draw and read. If causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> are given information about each variable’s dynamic property, they can be changed to stock flow diagrams and simulation models can be generated.

40|$|Causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> are {{graphical}} aids for depicting {{hypotheses about}} causality and feedback mechanisms. Though widely used, causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagramming</b> has significant limitations. Causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> can contain numerous untested assumptions about causality. This paper demonstrates how causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagramming</b> practice {{can be made}} more robust. The proffered technique described in this paper suggests how we might improve the ways we contemplate cause and effect. Applying the technique, and using the tool, offers new opportunities for testing assumptions about multi-factorial causal influences. The paper suggests that our first attempts at building remedial strategies for complex systemic problems might be completed without building quantitative stock and flow models. The paper demonstrates how causal <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> can be kept free of errors in logic. It also raises {{a number of important}} issues regarding the ways we view combinations of potentially confounding causal influences, and identifies the need fo...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a new {{application}} of the positive Grassmanian to Wilson <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> (or MHV diagrams) for scattering amplitudes in N= 4 Super Yang-Mill theory ($N= 4 $ SYM). There has been much interest in studying this theory via the positive Grassmanians using BCFW recursion. This is the first attempt to study MHV diagrams for planar Wilson loop calculations (or planar amplitudes) in terms of positive Grassmannians. We codify Wilson <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> completely in terms of matroids. This allows us to apply the combinatorial tools in matroid theory used to identify positroids, (non-negative Grassmannians), to Wilson <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams.</b> In doing so, we find that certain non-planar Wilson <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> define positive Grassmannians. While non-planar diagrams do not have physical meaning, {{this finding suggests that}} they may have value as an algebraic tool, and deserve further investigation...|$|R

For tanβ≡ |v_ 2 |/|v_ 1 | close to one, contributions from two <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> involving the t quark and the W boson dominate; while for tanβ 10, contributions from two <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> involving the b quark and the τ lepton are dominant.

50|$|Starting {{from the}} coupled system of {{equations}} obtained in the continuum limit and expanding in powers of the coupling constant, one obtains integrals which correspond to Feynman diagrams on the tree level. Fermionic <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> arise due to the interaction with the sea states, whereas bosonic <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> appear when taking averages over the microscopic (in generally non-smooth) space-time structure of a causal fermion system (method of microscopic mixing). The detailed analysis and comparison with standard quantum field theory is work in progress.|$|R
5000|$|The reason <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{are called}} <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{is because the}} number of -integrals that are left {{undetermined}} by momentum conservation is equal to the number of independent closed <b>loops</b> in the <b>diagram,</b> where independent <b>loops</b> are counted as in homology theory. The homology is real-valued (actually [...] valued), the value associated with each line is the momentum. The boundary operator takes each line to the sum of the end-vertices with a positive sign at the head and a negative sign at the tail. The condition that the momentum is conserved is exactly the condition that the boundary of the -valued weighted graph is zero.|$|R

While pseudoscalar meson PVV transitions {{are known to}} be determined by (only) quark <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams,</b> the above SPT also constrains scalar meson SVV transitions to be governed (only) by meson <b>loop</b> <b>diagrams.</b> We apply this latter SVV theorem to a 0 → γγ and f 0 → γγ decays. ...|$|R
