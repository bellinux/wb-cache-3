50|$|Trifolium dubium, the <b>lesser</b> <b>trefoil,</b> {{suckling}} clover, little {{hop clover}} or lesser hop trefoil, is a flowering {{plant in the}} pea and clover family Fabaceae. This species is generally accepted as the primary plant to represent the traditional Irish shamrock.|$|E
5000|$|The larva {{feeds on}} plants {{from the family}} Leguminosae (bean family). Recorded food plants are Lathyrus species, Vicia species, Vicia cracca, Oxytropis campestris, bird's foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus), Oxytropis pyrenaica, Astragalus aristatus, Astragalus onobrychis, Astragalus pinetorum, black medick (Medicago lupulina), Medicago romanica, Medicago falcata, common {{restharrow}} (Ononis repens), wild thyme Thymus serpyllum, <b>lesser</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Trifolium dubium), Trifolium pratense and white clover (Trifolium repens).|$|E
50|$|Other species {{found at}} the site include wood crane’s-bill (Geranium sylvaticum), {{meadowsweet}} (Filipendula ulmaria), changing forget-me-not (Myosotis discolor), fairy flax (Linum catharticum), field wood-rush (Luzula campestris), betony (Stachys officinalis) and northern marsh-orchid (Dactylorhiza purpurella), as well as legumes, including meadow vetchling, bitter vetch (Lathyrus montanus), <b>lesser</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Trifolium dubium), red clover (T. pratense), white clover (T. repens), common and greater bird’s-foot trefoils (Lotus corniculatus) and (L. uliginosus).|$|E
50|$|Black medick may be {{confused}} with other plants that have three leaflets and small yellow flowers, such as hop trefoil, large hop <b>trefoil,</b> <b>lesser</b> hop <b>trefoil,</b> and yellow woodsorrel.|$|R
40|$|Trefoil {{peptides}} are {{a recently}} recognized group of small peptides abundantly produced at mucosal surfaces that offer {{the opportunity to}} define mechanisms of mucosal cell-specific differentiation and to illuminate new mechanisms {{for the preservation of}} mucosal integrity. We report the cDNA cloning of a 75 -amino acid human trefoil factor expressed in small and large intestinal mucosas that is highly homologous to the intestinal trefoil factor, with 70 % identity at the amino acid level of the predicted mature protein. This human intestinal trefoil factor is also homologous, although to a <b>lesser</b> extent, to <b>trefoil</b> peptides expressed at other sites in the gastrointestinal tract in man, exhibiting absolute conservation of the P domain motif (CX 9 CX 9 CX 4 CCX 9 WCF) that defines this family of peptides. These findings indicate a high degree of evolutionary conservation of organ/region-specific members of this peptide family...|$|R
50|$|Medicago lupulina, {{commonly}} known as black medick, nonesuch, or hop clover, is a familiar lawn plant belonging to the legume or clover family. Plants of the genus Medicago, or bur clovers, {{are closely related to}} the true clovers (Trifolium) and sweet clover (Melilotus). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of the <b>lesser</b> <b>trefoil.</b> Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 60 years {{there has been}} growing concern over the impact that {{changing}} agricultural practices have had on the extent and integrity of grasslands in Britain and Europe. Such is the concern that it has become a driver in a number of European environmental policies. Unimproved grasslands have suffered the greatest loss to extent and integrity with remaining remnants becoming heavily fractured. The altering of influencing factors such as soil conditions and drainage has had a detrimental impact on the diversity of many types of grassland. Many types of grassland are important as they contain a number of native species that are rare and have limited distribution. Today many remaining grasslands are managed and protected to prevent further losses. This survey looks into the species composition of a 3. 5 ha grassland which is to be used for recreation under a new project by the Budshead trust. The site is owned by Plymouth City Council and is currently listed as a potential County Wildlife Site. The results where then used to aid in the formation of a management scheme for two sites now {{under the control of the}} Budshead trust. The site is important as it serves as a buffer for the adjacent County Wildlife Site(CWS) It examined the species composition of both the grassland contained within the site and the surrounding hedgerows. On average 8 - 11 species were recorded per m 2 within the highest number of species per m 2 being 15. Several species were recorded that had not been recorded during a survey done in 2009. This included species such as Yellow Rattle (Rhinanthus minor), Broomrape (Orobanche minor). <b>Lesser</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Trifolium dubium) and Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). The presence of Yellow Rattle (Rhinanthus minor) is encouraging as this is a species know to promote diversity within grasslands. The hedgerow surveys demonstrated that the hedgerows at the site are currently in a favourable condition with a number of different species being recorded in each of the three hedgerows surveyed, some species such as Digitalis and Arum maculatum were only found in one of the three hedgerows. The results indicated a need for a re-classification of the site from a previous classification given in a 2009 survey. It also confirmed the previous studies observations on the condition of the site. During the survey period mowing was undertaken in the second week of July. The practices observed highlighted the need for correct management practices to be put into place to preserve the condition of the site. It is important that site retains its integrity not only because of its role as a buffer area for the CWS but also for the resources it provides with to the 3 surrounding wildlife as it has been previously noted that it is used as feeding sites for several bat and bird species. The survey determined that site is currently in good condition with a sward composition comparable with the adjacent CWS. The result of the survey where then used in the formulation of a management scheme for the Budshead trust aimed at the site and the adjacent abandoned playing field. The overall objectives of the scheme where; to protect and enhance current diversity levels, whilst extending the local biodiversity network further into the abandoned playing field site located to the north of the survey site.
