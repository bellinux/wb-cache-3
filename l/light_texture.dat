5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} {{of ice cream}} also resulted from the ice trade. Ice cream had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze ice cream relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the <b>light</b> <b>texture</b> associated with ice cream. By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that ice cream was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new ice cream maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, ice cream became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise ice cream with the general public.|$|E

25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in <b>light</b> <b>texture.</b> Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause freezing point depression. Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

2500|$|Sandwich bread (also {{referred}} to as sandwich loaf) is bread that is prepared specifically {{to be used for}} the preparation of sandwiches. Sandwich breads are produced in many varieties, such as white, whole wheat, sourdough, rye, multigrain and others. Sandwich bread may be formulated to slice easily, cleanly or uniformly, and may have a fine crumb (the soft, inner part of bread) and a <b>light</b> <b>texture.</b> Sandwich bread may be designed to have a balanced proportion of crumb and crust, whereby the bread holds and supports fillings in place and reduces drips and messiness. Some may be designed to not become crumbly, hardened, dried or have too squishy a texture. Sandwich bread can refer to cross-sectionally square, sliced white and wheat bread, which has been described as [...] "perfectly designed for holding square luncheon meat". The bread used for preparing finger sandwiches is sometimes {{referred to}} as sandwich bread. Pan de mie is a sandwich loaf. Some sandwich breads are designed for use in the creation of specific types of sandwiches, such as the submarine sandwich. For barbecuing, use of a high-quality white sandwich bread has been described as suitable for toasting over a fire. Gluten-free sandwich bread may be prepared using gluten-free flour, teff flour. and other ingredients.|$|E
