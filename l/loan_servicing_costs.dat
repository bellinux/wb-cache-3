At the time, it was the most expensive transaction in sporting history. The deal was financed largely through borrowed money, including $340 million borrowed from Société Générale and $155 million debt assumed on the stadium. Annual <b>loan</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs</b> are an estimated $50 million. In order to pay down the team's debt, in 2003 he sold 15% of the team to real estate developer Dwight Schar for $200 million, 15% to Florida financier Robert Rothman for a like amount; and 5% to Frederick W. Smith, the founder of Federal Express, leaving him with a 65% ownership interest.|$|E
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper presents a microsimulation model of household distress. We use logit analysis {{to estimate the}} extent to which a household’s risk of being financially distressed depends on net income after tax and <b>loan</b> <b>servicing</b> <b>costs.</b> The impact of assumed macroeconomic shocks on this net income concept is calculated at the household level. The microsimulation model is used to simulate both the number of distressed households and their aggregate debt in various macroeconomic scenarios. The simulations indicate that household credit risks to banks are relatively well contained. financial stability; indebtedness; micro simulations; households...|$|E

40|$|A stated {{preference}} (SP) experiment of car ownership {{was conducted}} in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) of Maharashtra in India. A full factorial experiment was designed to considering various attributes such as travel time, travel cost, projected household income, car <b>loan</b> payment and <b>servicing</b> <b>cost.</b> Data on 357 individuals were collected which resulted in 3213 observations for the calibration of the work trip and recreational trip car ownership models. The car ownership alternatives considered 0, 1 and 2 cars. A multinomial logit framework was used to develop the car ownership model taking the household as a decision unit. The specification and results of the SP car ownership model are discussed. The observed and predicted values matched reasonably when {{the validity of the}} SP car ownership model was tested against revealed preference (RP) data. The car ownership models developed in this study exhibit a satisfactory goodness of fit. It is concluded that the SP modelling approach can be successfully used for modelling car ownership decisions of households in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Total Direct Loan administrative costs grew from $ 314 million to $ 864 million from fiscal years 2007 to 2012, but federal costs per borrower have generally remained steady or fallen. The increase in total administrative costs largely results from an increase of over 300 percent {{in the number of}} Direct Loans during that same time period. One key factor contributing to this loan volume increase was a law that ended student loan originations under a federally guaranteed loan program resulting in new originations being made under the Direct <b>Loan</b> program. <b>Loan</b> <b>servicing</b> [...] which includes activities like counseling borrowers on selecting repayment plans, processing payments, and collecting on loans in delinquent status [...] is the largest category of administrative costs, comprising 63 percent of total Direct Loan administrative costs in fiscal year 2012. While total administrative costs have increased, costs per borrower and other unit costs have remained steady or declined. For example, the <b>servicing</b> <b>cost</b> per borrower has remained roughly $ 25 over the six-year period we examined. However, a number of factors, including a new payment structure for <b>loan</b> <b>servicing</b> contracts to reward servicers for keeping more borrowers in repayment status, have created some uncertainty about the <b>servicing</b> <b>cost</b> per borrower in coming years. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There are {{now more}} than 400 {{community}} type public drinking water systems in Utah. Considerable state and federal assistance is available for construction or renovation of such systems, but once the system is constructed and the consulting engineer leaves, the managers of the smaller systems find themselves quite isolated from sources of professional assistance. The larger systems have a revenue base which can provide ongoing services of a consultant or salaried engineer and well trained operators. The smaller systems, particularly low density rural systems where the length of pipeline per user is very high, usually find themselves barely able to pay <b>loan</b> <b>service</b> and operating <b>costs</b> despite user fees which are extremely high relative to urban systems. Typically, after construction of a new rural system, a part time operator with little or no training is hired at a very low wage and is supervised by community leaders who receive almost no pay and whose experience in managing domestic water systems often matches their salary. Such systems officers are usually very dedicated community minded people who spend countless hours at their assignment and do surprising well at keeping system costs to a minimum, but who often get replaced at frequent elections, just as they are gaining experience in their positions. Perhaps even more importantly, operators have a high turnover rate due to the low pay and high level of responsibility...|$|R

40|$|One {{method of}} {{measuring}} {{the prices of}} deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> is to view the differentials between actual loan and deposit interest rates and appropriate “reference rates ” as the “indirectly measured prices of deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services.</b> ” In fact, the ONS in the UK and the BLS in the US are considering the adoption {{of this type of}} estimation method for their measurements of deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> prices. This paper reviews the prior research at the ONS and BLS, identifies the problem points, and examines the feasibility of using published interest rate data “of a constant quality ” to indirectly measure deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>services</b> prices in Japan. The conclusions show: (1) published interest rate data that is indicative and “of a constant quality ” is not available for certain lending rates; and (2) there are logical inconsistencies between the published-interest-rate-data-based method for measuring deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>service</b> prices which is examined in this paper and the input-output tables, which are presently utilized to determine the weights of individual service prices in the Corporate Service Price Index (CSPI). Consequently, the paper concludes that {{it would be difficult to}} incorporate indirectly measured deposit and <b>loan</b> <b>service</b> prices in the CSPI. * The author would like to thank Professor Takanobu Nakajima of Keio University for his useful comments during th...|$|R
