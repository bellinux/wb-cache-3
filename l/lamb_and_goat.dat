Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine uses nearly every edible meat, including offal, chicken feet, duck's tongue, snakes, and snails. However, <b>lamb</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> are rare. There is also a heavy use of seafood, due to proximity to the sea. This style of cuisine uses many cooking methods, with steaming and stir-frying being the most popular, largely due to relative convenience.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional Slovak cuisine {{is based}} mainly on pork meat, poultry (chicken {{is the most}} widely eaten, {{followed}} by duck, goose, and turkey), flour, potatoes, cabbage, and milk products. It is relatively closely related to Hungarian, Czech and Austrian cuisine. On the east it is also influenced by Ukrainian and Polish cuisine. In comparison with other European countries, [...] "game meat" [...] is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular.

40|$|Faecal {{samples from}} 146 diarrhoeic <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids, <b>and</b> from 511 healthy sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were {{screened}} {{for the presence}} of Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC). In healthy sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> VTEC were isolated in 24. 4 and 16. 2 % of the animals, respectively. Moreover, VTEC were detected in 3. 1 and 5. 9 % of the diarrhoeic <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids, respectively. These data suggest that VTEC seems not to be associated with diarrhoea in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids. Only four VTEC strains were eae-positive. The absence of the eae gene in most of these VTEC strains could indicate that these strains are less virulent for humans that the classical eae-positive enterohaemorrhagic E. coli types. However, almost half (42. 9 %) and 12. 2 % of VTEC strains isolated from healthy sheep <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> respectively, belonged to serotypes associated with severe diseases in humans...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Cryptosporidium is a {{protozoan}} parasite {{that causes}} diarrhea, which is typically a short-lasting benign infection. The aimof {{the present study}} was to determinate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids in Kurdistandistrict, Iran. Materials and Methods: Atotal of 1200 fecal samples were obtained from diarrheic <b>and</b> non-diarrheic <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kidsaged 1 to 6 months from 48 villages in the Kurdistan province, west of Iran. The samples were tested for the presence ofCryptosporidium spp. oocysts using modified Ziehl–Neelsen staining method. Results: Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts were present in 10. 24 % of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> in 18. 86 % of goat kids. Both diarrhea andCryptosporidium spp. oocysts were observed in 64. 37 % (56 / 87) of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> in 30. 51 % (18 / 59) of goat kids. Cryptosporidium spp. infection rates were significantly higher in diarrheic than in non-diarrheic groups. The highest rate ofinfection was found in an animal aged one month. Furthermore, the prevalence of the infection according to age groups andconsistency of feces was found to be statistically significant. Conclusion: The presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids in Kurdistan indicates that this protozoan parasiteshould also be considered in the etiology of <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids exhibiting diarrhea...|$|R

The animals were grouped according to age, i. e., up to 30 days and from 31 to 90 days. The infection was diagnosed using three coprological procedures. Sheather’s sugar flotation {{was employed to}} determine the concentration of oocysts. Modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique and modified Kinyoun technique were used as staining procedures. Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in 42. 1 % examined <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 31. 8 % goat kids. These findings clearly demonstrate the presence of Cryptospodium infection in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goat</b> kids in Serbia and indicate the potential role of these animals as reservoirs of cryptosporidia...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} dietary zinc (Zn) supplementation on plasma Zn and serum thyroid hormones was {{evaluated}} in healthy male Merino <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> Angora <b>goats.</b> A total of 12 <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 12 <b>goats</b> {{were divided into}} two equal groups as control and Zn groups in separate experiments. The <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> of the control groups were fed basal rations alone. The Zn contents of these rations prepared for <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were 40 mg/kg and 35 mg/kg in dry matter (DM), respectively. Both species of animals in the Zn groups were fed a basal ration supplemented with zinc sulphate adjusted to 250 mg Zn/kg diet in DM. The feeding trial lasted for 12 weeks in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> 8 weeks in goats. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein at 4 -week intervals. Both animal species in the Zn groups had higher plasma Zn values than the controls throughout the experimental period, except in the 4 th week in goats. However, the levels of serum total thyroxine (T 4) and triiodothyronine (T 3) were lower in the <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> of the Zn groups, except in the 4 th week, as compared to those in the controls. Moreover, serum total thyroid hormone levels of the goats were higher at the 4 th week than at the 8 th week. Although there was a decrease in the levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine of both small ruminant species in the Zn groups when compared to the controls, these alterations were not statistically significant. These results may show that zinc supplementation to the diet at this dose reduces total thyroid hormone levels in small ruminants but does not yet impair the euthyroid status of the organism. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of abamectin in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> naturally infected with gastrointestinal nematodes. The study was conducted on 300 lambs, from both sexes, at age ranged between 6 - 9 months, <b>and</b> 150 native <b>goats</b> from both sexes, at age ranged between 1 - 2 years. The total infestation rate with gastrointestinal nematodes were 54 % and 53. 3 % in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats,</b> respectively. Results of fecal culture for obtained larvae 3 revealed the presence of seven genus of nematodes in that included Marshallagia spp. (66. 6 %), Ostertagia spp. (53. 1 %), Haemonchus spp. (24. 7 %), Nematodirus spp. (16. 67 %), Strongyloides spp. (9. 8 %), Cooperia spp. (4. 4 %), and Oesophagostomum spp. (3. 08 %), where as in goats the following genus was obtained included Marshellagia spp. (46. 3 %), Nematodirus spp. (37. 5 %), Strongyloides spp. (37. 5 %), Ostertagia spp. (33. 7 %), Haemonchus spp. (15 %), Cooperia spp. (15 %), Chabertia spp. (6. 25 %), and Trichuris spp. (2. 5 %). The most important clinical signs that were detected in <b>lambs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goats</b> were emaciation, pale mucous membrane, easily detached hair and wool and diarrhea. Abamectin at dose 0. 2 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously (single dose) had an efficacy of (97 %) in the first week and increased to (100 %) to the end of the study, whereas in goats it was (100 %) started from 1 st week after the treatment to the end of the study period. Treated animals showed gradual improvement in presenting the clinical abnormalities. Total red blood cells count, hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volume were increased significantly.
