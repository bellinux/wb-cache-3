40|$|Cavitation {{erosion of}} Francis {{turbines}} continues to impose costly repairs {{and loss of}} revenues. This erosion is primarily caused by leading edge cavitation. A revue of the literature reveals the non-existence of an absolutely validated detection technique of this cavitation in operating Francis turbines. Considering the impulsive character of the implosion of a cavitation structure, the assimilation of cavitation erosion to a process of mechanical fatigue of materials and the vibratory response at high frequencies of a linear structure to multiple random excitations whose responses add on a power basis, we have proposed that the vibratory response of a Francis turbine at high frequencies is tightly related to its cavitation erosion rate. The absolute measurement of cavitation aggressiveness on the blades {{can be made by}} the normalization of <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> bearing vibration measurements by an average Transmissibility function measured by reciprocity with the runner underwater. The proposed method has been validated and it is now possible to state that the MSV of inferred forces at the cavitation impact rate of hydrodynamic origin is proportional to the erosion rate. The approach has been validated in excellent manner in laboratory set-ups with little or no flows by comparison to absolute cavitation aggressiveness assessment methods such as the DECER electrochemical technique and the pit counting technique on polished material samples. The validation was then pursued with laboratory homologous flows on a NACA 009 profile in the LMH high-speed cavitation tunnel with blade mounted DECER sensors as reference. Once again, impact frequencies of hydrodynamic origin, following here a Strouhal law, were observed and the MSV of the profile acceleration at high frequencies was proportional to the average erosion rate on the profile. Notwithstanding the difficulty of the measurements, the results were excellent and fared well with the erosive power of the flow in V 3 L 2 (V= flow velocity, L= length of the attached vapour cavity). Preliminary measurements on a Francis model with blade mounted DECER sensors agreed well with the MSV of <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> bearing acceleration at high frequencies. Later measurements on the Rapide Blanc model confirmed the damage model observed on the NACA profile. Hydrodynamic impact frequencies were however not governed by the tunnel Strouhal law but were found to be determined by the blade passage frequency. Stationary measurements at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> bearing were equivalent to runner on board measurements. Reciprocity, typical to linear structures, was verfied. As on the profile, maximum aggressiveness on the runner blade occurs in the leading edge cavity closure area. This was confirmed by the application of "Prescale" pressure sensitive film on the blades for operating conditions generating maximum vibratory response at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies. High-speed video recordings shot at 2000 frames/s allowed detailed observation of the dynamics of the cavitation structures at the blade passage frequency. Visual observations of cavitation developments along with implosion frequencies allowed observing that the MSV of vibratory response at high frequencies at the cavitation impact occurrence rate was coherent with the calculated value of the flow erosive power inasmuch as the implosions occurred on the blades and not beyond the blade trailing edges. These results on the Francis model therefore supported the proposed vibratory detection approach. The application of the developed techniques, including the measurements of Transmissibility with the runners underwater, allowed assessing the difference in absolute cavitation aggressiveness on an existing and proposed replacement model runner for the Beauharnois power plant. The applicability of the proposed measurement and calibration methods was confirmed on prototype N° 6 of the Rapide Blanc power plant. Measurements on fixed and rotating elements of the machine are equivalent and reciprocity also applies. The recurrence frequency of the cavitation impacts was however {{different from that of the}} model. The difference appears to be due to the semi-spiral case utilized on the model. It was not fully homologous to the full spiral case of the prototype. It would thus appear that on the model, the wake of the semi-spiral case tongue plays a determinant role in the generation and implosion process of cavitating structures while on the prototype the wakes of the wicket gates fill that function. The ultimate validation of the vibratory approach to the detection of erosive cavitation on Francis prototypes occurred in 1995 on unit 44 of the Manic 5 PA power plant. This was done using on board sensors (pressure, DECER and accelerometer) on severely eroded blade 4 and polished 316 L stainless steel disks mounted in this same blade after removal of the pressure sensor housings. Paint removal and pit counting tests had previously correlated well in 1993 with the MSV of global modulation of high frequency acceleration at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> bearing at the cavitation hydrodynamic impact occurrence rate which was for this prototype the wicket gate passing frequency for a rotating observer. The 1995 correlation of the MSV of the blade 4 high frequency acceleration modulation at the wicket gate passage hydrodynamic frequency with the volume pitting rate of the 316 L stainless steel disks and the DECER erosion current was excellent. The existence in the flow of the 60 Hz (rotation speed, 180 r. p. m., 20 wicket gates) hydrodynamic frequency was confirmed by dynamic pressure measurements on blade 4 and in the draft tube just below the runner. The per blade inferred forces were calculated for each set of test conditions with the average Transmissibility measured by reciprocity on five blades with the runner underwater. The MSV of high frequency inferred forces agrees better with the real aggressiveness than does the wideband acceleration but not as well as the MSV of the acceleration modulation at the hydrodynamic frequencies of the cavitation impacts. Improvements on this subject have been incorporated in the cavitation erosion monitoring system now in operation at Hydro-Québec. Tu summarize, the MSV of the vibratory response at the <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> bearing modulated at the cavitation hydrodynamic frequencies describes well its relative aggressiveness with varying operating conditions and the use of an averaged Transmissibility measured with the runner underwater allows to estimate it on an absolute basis...|$|E

40|$|For the {{transportation}} of dangerous substances, several modes of transportation are possible. If {{there are multiple}} possibilities, it is relevant to compare the safety of {{the transportation}} alternatives. TNO has developed a consistent method to compare the different transportation modes, using standard risk criteria like cumulated Individual Risk (Locational Risk) and Societal Risk. An evaluation of the method was done for two typical cases: transport of 100, 000 t/y ammonia and 100, 000 t/y propane. By using a standard QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment) tool, the individual risk contours, the societal risk (FN) curve, and additional societal risk maps were generated and compared for 4 modes of transportation: railway, road, ship and pipeline When using the Individual Risk contour as a criteria, the “distance to 10 - 6 /y risk value” is often used to compare risks of transport. Because of the important contribution of loading and unloading activities at the beginning and endpoints of the route, one should evaluate the cumulated contours for interference with vulnerable objects. For Societal Risk, the Dutch prescribed approach would be to consider the FN-curve for the kilometre segment of the route with the highest risk. The paper demonstrates that this approach may give misleading results when comparing different route tracks. Furthermore, because stationary equipment is subjected to stricter allowance rules (a <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> value of societal risk curve), comparison of the combined effect of the transport and stationary loading & unloading activities is ambiguous.

40|$|In this work, {{we compare}} gyrokinetic (GK) and fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) {{simulations}} of magnetic reconnection in {{the limit of}} strong guide field. In particular, we analyze the limits of applicability of the GK plasma model compared to a fully kinetic description of force free current sheets for finite guide fields (b_g). Here we report the first part of an extended comparison, focusing on the macroscopic effects of the electron flows. For a low beta plasma (β_i= 0. 01), it is shown that both plasma models develop magnetic reconnection with similar features in the secondary magnetic islands if a sufficiently high guide field (b_g≳ 30) is imposed in the kinetic PIC simulations. Outside of these regions, in the separatrices close to the X points, the convergence between both plasma descriptions is less restrictive (b_g≳ 5). Kinetic PIC simulations using guide fields b_g ≲ 30 reveal secondary magnetic islands with a core magnetic field and less energetic flows inside of them in comparison to the GK or kinetic PIC runs with stronger guide fields. We find that these processes are mostly due to an initial shear flow absent in the GK initialization and negligible in the kinetic PIC high guide field regime, in addition to fast outflows on the order of the ion thermal speed that violate the GK ordering. Since secondary magnetic islands appear after the reconnection peak time, a kinetic PIC/GK comparison is more accurate in the linear phase of magnetic reconnection. For a high beta plasma (β_i= 1. 0) where reconnection rates and fluctuations levels are reduced, similar processes happen in the secondary magnetic islands in the fully kinetic description, but requiring much <b>lower</b> <b>guide</b> fields (b_g≲ 3).

Deformation arises in the wire, during the machining of taper cutting using Wire EDM. Due to that deformation in the wire, effected to the ruled inclination of machined parts.

To predict the deformation of wire by considering contact mechanics, properties of wire, properties of the guide, boundary conditions, typically used in taper cutting operations, has been taking into the account. FEM is needed to reduce the experimental cost and lack of time consumption and to give a more common approach to the problem.

40|$|For the {{transportation}} of dangerous substances, several transport modalities are possible. The {{choice for a}} specific transportation mode is often based on practical assumptions, like "we have a railroad available" or "we have a shipping contract". But suppose {{you have a choice}} for different types of transport, which one would be the safest for your substance? TNO has developed a method to compare the different transport modalities by using standard risk criteria like cumulated Individual Risk (a. k. a. Locational Risk) and Societal Risk. The evaluation was done for two typical substances: ammonia and propane, which are both transported often in the Netherlands. By using a standard QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment) tool, the individual risk contours, the societal risk (FN) curve, and societal risk maps were generated and compared. A number of important assumptions were made in the study: 1. Since loading / unloading are essential steps in the distribution process, the risk of these activities were included for all batch based transportation methods (so not for pipeline transport) 2. The currently prevailing legislative failure rates and accident distances have been applied (calculated for the number of required ships/cars/wagons and typical dimensions). Although there is no consensus on "correct" failure rates or consequence distances, the statutory rules and values were applied. For the Individual Risk contour, one tends to use the "distance to 10 - 6 risk value" in comparing risks of transport. Due to the important contribution of loading and unloading activities at the beginning and endpoints of the route, one really should evaluate the cumulated contours for interference with vulnerable objects. For Societal Risk, the Dutch prescribed approach would be to compare the FN-curve for the highest kilometer section of the route. The study pointed out that this approach may give misleading results in comparing situations for different route tracks.

40|$|The Palaeozoic {{echinoderms}} of the British Isles {{are most}} diverse in the Silurian and <b>Lower</b> Carbonifer-ous. This <b>guide</b> discusses and illustrates members of all major groups of echinoderms, {{apart from the}} crinoids, from the Silurian of these islands. Groups considered include the echinoids (fi ve taxa), ophiuroids (ten taxa) and asteroids (thirteen taxa), and the extinct ophiocistioids (three species) and rhombiferan cystoids (nine species) ...|$|R
30|$|The ShUREX 2015 {{campaign}} {{is the first}} time a UAV has been used extensively to probe turbulent structures in the <b>lower</b> atmosphere, <b>guided</b> in real or near real time by measurements from a VHF radar operated concurrently in high vertical resolution range imaging mode. The goal of the campaign was to measure turbulence parameters in the lower atmosphere, along with concurrent radar-derived values. While Scipion et al. (2016) made simultaneous observations of structure function parameter of refractive index using DataHawk and the Jicamarca radar, reliable and accurate measurements of a suite of turbulence parameters, including the TKE dissipation rate, were possible only during the ShUREX campaign, because of the extensive effort needed to improve the turbulence sensors and processing of turbulence data.|$|R
