40|$|Landscape {{pattern and}} eco-hydrological process had changed greatly after seven times {{emergency}} water transportation {{in the lower}} reaches of Tarim River, Xinjiang, China. After analyzing the changes of eco-hydrological process, ground water level, soil moisture and vegetation growth etc. of emergency water transportation, remote sensing images in 2000 and 2005 year which present the situation {{before and after the}} emergency water transportation were processed and dynamic change characteristics of landscape pattern were analyzed. The changes of landscape pattern were described as follows: The forest land, waters, farmland and construction landscape area increase, and forest land increases the biggest, which increased by 23. 03 % during last 5 years. Waters landscape change is only inferior to forest land, which increased by 16. 04 %. The <b>lawn,</b> <b>sand</b> and Gobi saline-alkali land landscape area reduced; lawn and farmland had made the biggest contribution to the increase of forest land by 6. 46 % and 4. 79 % in the year 2005. Landscape diversity index, evenness index, fractal dimension and general fragmentation increased, but dominance index reduced. The results indicate that RS plays the vital role in the macroscopic dynamic change analysis of landscape pattern and seven times emergency water transportation has greatly influenced eco-hydrology process and landscape pattern changes in the lower reaches of Tarim River.

50|$|Alum Rock Park, {{founded in}} 1872, {{was the first}} {{municipal}} park in the U.S. state of California. Located in a valley in the Diablo Range foothills {{on the east side}} of San Jose, the 720 acre (2.9 km2) park offers 13 miles (21 km) of trails, varying from fairly level along Penitencia Creek to sharp switchbacks climbing to the ridges to the South Rim Trail and the North Rim Trail. The narrow floor of the valley includes a visitor center, a small museum/animal rehab facility, picnic areas, playgrounds, <b>lawns,</b> <b>sand</b> volleyball pits, mineral springs, lush plant life, woodlands, creek play opportunities, and occasional group camping.|$|R

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, public schools and many private schools closed, Although no {{mandatory}} evacuations were ordered, multiple shelters were opened in schools and churches and government offices shut down in anticipation of Harvey's onslaught. Several counties issued a state of emergency. Residents prepared individually by, for example, securing boats and <b>lawn</b> furniture. Free <b>sand</b> and sandbags were {{made available to the}} general public and inmates filled bags for those physically unable to do so themselves. Officials at Lake Manatee began lowering the water level to help avoid flooding. In Hillsborough County the threat of the storm forced the cancellation of local football programs.|$|R
40|$|Foot interfaces, such as {{pressure-sensitive}} insoles, still yield unused potential such as for implicit interaction. In this paper, we introduce CapSoles, enabling smart insoles to implicitly identify who {{is walking}} {{on what kind}} of floor. Our insole prototype relies on capacitive sensing and is able to sense plantar pressure distribution underneath the foot, plus a capacitive ground coupling effect. By using machine-learning algorithms, we evaluated the identification of 13 users, while walking, with a confidence of ~ 95 % after a recognition delay of ~ 1 s. Once the user's gait is known, again we can discover irregularities in gait plus a varying ground coupling. While both effects in combination are usually unique for several ground surfaces, we demonstrate to distinguish six kinds of floors, which are <b>sand,</b> <b>lawn,</b> paving stone, carpet, linoleum, and tartan with an average accuracy of ~ 82 %. Moreover, we demonstrate the unique effects of wet and electrostatically charged surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of orchid species in semi-natural calcareous grassland {{is thought to}} depend on floral variability. However, differences in primary life-history strategy, or the overall suite of functional traits, could also affect coexistence. Both primary strategy (affecting day-to-day survival) and reproductive traits (representing periodic events) have been hypothesized {{to contribute to a}} general mechanism regulating the local persistence and relative abundance of species. We recorded species identity at 8, 000 points at the centimetre scale along sixteen 5 -m long transects at the Olive <b>Lawn,</b> a xeric <b>sand</b> calcareous grassland near Lecco, Italy. Transects allowed the relative abundance and spatial aggregation of Grime's competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) strategies to be quantified. Orchid flowering and fruiting phenology was recorded alongside the phenology of graminoid growth. Seven orchid species were present and exhibited a spectrum of strategies spanning two extremes, (1) small early-flowering ruderals (R/CR-selected), and (2) larger-leaved competitors (C/CR) flowering later as dominant graminoids attained maximum height. These orchids, and other subordinate species in the community, exhibited random spatial distributions amongst dominant graminoids that exhibited a high degree of spatial aggregation and similar, but non-identical, stress-tolerator (S) strategies. The reproductive phenology of meadow orchids is an intimate component of their CSR strategies, and appears to promote coexistence by allowing segregation between temporal niches and the exploitation of opportunities between clumps of dominant species. Only for closely related species with identical CSR strategies, such as Ophrys benacensis and Ophrys sphegodes, could specific floral differences alone explain coexistence...|$|R
