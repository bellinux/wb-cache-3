Polysilicon emitter-base self-aligned structures and trench isolation techniques are becoming key elements for high performance bipolar ECL device structures, by which parasitic capacitances and resistances {{have been reduced}} drastically. In order to get further improved performance, smaller parasitic capacitances associated with the pull-up resistor as well as high cutoff frequency are required. Wafer-direct-bonded SOI structures are the promising candidate, while the base resistance and the cutoff frequency should be optimized moderately.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a design {{strategy}} for MUX, XOR and D-latch Source-Coupled Logic (SCL) gates is proposed. To this end, an analytical {{model of the}} delay and the noise margin {{as a function of}} the transistors’ aspect ratio and bias current is first introduced. Successively, analytical equations of the transistors’ aspect ratio to meet a given noise margin specification are derived {{as a function of the}} bias current, and are then used along with the delay model to express the delay as an explicit function of the bias current and noise margin. The simplified delay expression explicitly relates speed performance to power dissipation and the noise margin, thereby providing the designer with the required understanding of the trade-offs involved in the design. Therefore, the criteria proposed allow the designer to consciously manage the power-delay trade-off. The delay dependence on the <b>logic</b> <b>swing</b> is also investigated with results showing that this delay is not necessarily reduced by reducing the <b>logic</b> <b>swing,</b> in contrast with the usual assumption.

40|$|Abstract—We have {{experimentally}} {{studied the}} scaling behavior of sub- 100 -nm InAs high-electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) on InP substrate from the logic operation point of view. These devices {{have been designed}} for scalability and combine a thin InAlAs barrier and a thin channel containing a pure InAs subchannel. InAs HEMTs with gate length down to 40 nm exhibit excellent logic figures of merit, such as ION/IOFF = 9 × 10 4, drain-induced-barrier lowering = 80 mV/V, S = 70 mV/dec, and an estimated logic gate delay of 0. 6 ps at VDS = 0. 5 V. In addition, we have obtained excellent high-frequency operation with Lg = 40 nm, such as fT = 491 GHz and fmax = 402 GHz at VDS = 0. 5 V. In spite of the narrow bandgap of InAs subchannel, under the studied conditions, our devices are shown not to suffer from excessive band-to-band tunneling. When benchmarked against state-of-the-art Si devices, 40 -nm InAs HEMTs exhibit ION = 0. 6 A/μm atILeak = 200 nA/μm. This is about two times higher ION than state-of-the-art high-performance 65 -nm nMOSFET with comparable physical gate length and ILeak.

This thesis studies several related control {{problems associated with}} an under-actuated robot, Pendubot, from the point view of fuzzy <b>logic</b> control. To <b>swing</b> up the Pendubot from a rest position to the upright configuration, a fuzzy algorithm is proposed from non-complete sets of linguistic rules that link some mechanism states to {{the sign of a}} single control action. Therein, a simplified Tsukamoto's reasoning method and quasi-linear-mean aggregating operators are used to derive and analyze the controller input-out mappings. In order to balance the Pendubot at the unstable upright top configuration after swinging up, another simple fuzzy controller is derived according to its joint states: This combining fuzzy algorithm for swinging-up and balancing is successfully applied to the Pendubot. This thesis also investigates the case that the Pendubot tracks a desired signal and a corresponding fuzzy scheme is proposed, which combines the linear regulator theory with the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy methodology. The stability and stability conditions for this fuzzy scheme are analyzed. Numerical simulations for all the above controllers are carried out to validate the theoretical analysis by using SIMULINK.

40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} device simulator {{was used}} to examine the various profile design strategies for silicon bipolar transistors operating at liquid-nitrogen temperatures. Special emphasis was placed on the scaling tradeoffs of these design approaches. It is concluded that a relaxed scaling technique based on the maintenance of constant base Gummel number with a slight decrease in emitter doping level probably offers the best overall low-temperature design strategy for scaled double-polysilicon devices. To verify these calculations, devices with 0. 8 -μm lithography were fabricated using this design scheme. Transistors were found to be reasonably ideal at low temperatures and had adequate current gain for most digital applications. Unloaded ECL ring oscillators operated at sub- 100 -ps speeds at liquid-nitrogen temperatures.

40|$|In a study {{performed}} {{over the}} temperature range of 400 to 77 K, Si bipolar transistors {{were found to}} have near-ideal characteristics at low temperatures with β as high as 80 at 77 K. Detailed calculations indicate that the conventional theory of the temperature dependence of β does not match the data. The discrepancy can be removed if it is assumed that a phenomenological thermal barrier to hole injection is present. Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) ring oscillators are functional at 85 K with no degradation in speed until about 165 K when compared to 358 K (85 °C). Calculations using a delay figure of merit indicate that fT, Rb, and Cc are the delay components most affected by low-temperature operation. The feasibility of reduced <b>logic</b> <b>swing</b> operation of bipolar circuits at low temperatures is examined.

40|$|In this paper, the DC {{behavior}} of subthreshold CMOS logic is analyzed {{in a closed}} form {{for the first time}} in the literature. To this aim, simplified large-signal and small-signal models of MOS transistors in subthreshold region are first developed. After replacing transistors with these equivalent models, analysis of the main DC parameters of CMOS logic gates is performed. In particular, the change in the DC characteristics shape due to operation at ultra-low voltages is analyzed in detail, evaluating analytically the degradation in the <b>logic</b> <b>swing,</b> the symmetry and the steepness of the transition region, as well as the change in the unity-gain points position. The resulting expressions permit to gain an insight into the basic dependencies of DC behavior on design and device parameters. The noise margin is explicitly evaluated and modeled with a very simple expression. Interestingly, analysis shows that the noise margin deviates from the ideal half-swing value by an amount that linearly depends on the logarithm of the pn-ratio. Analysis permits to evaluate the minimum supply voltage that ensures correct operation of CMOS logic (i. e., positive noise margin). Previously proposed rule of thumbs to evaluate minimum voltage are also theoretically justified. Moreover, the impact of PMOS/NMOS unbalancing on DC characteristics is analyzed from a design perspective. Considerations on the impact of process/voltage/temperature variations are also introduced.

Leakage power is increasing {{more and more}} with the continuous scaling, and design of clock distribution systems needs to be reconsidered as it becomes {{difficult to deal with}} performance and power consumption specifications while keeping a correct synchronisation in modern multi-GHz systems. The ongoing technology trend will become difficult to maintain unless dedicated library cells, new logic styles and circuit methods are emerging to prevent the drawbacks of future nanoscale circuits. In this thesis we investigate a new class of dynamic differential logic family that features a self-timed operation and low output <b>logic</b> <b>swing.</b> The latter contributes to reduce dynamic power, while the self-timing scheme alleviates the drawbacks of synchronous circuits and systems. Furthermore, the dynamic and differential nature of LSCML class brings advantages in terms of reduction of the power consumption variation and thus gives LSCML an additional potential for implementation of secure encryption devices against attacks based on power analysis.

40|$|In this paper, Positive Feedback Source-Coupled Logic (PFSCL) gates are {{analyzed}} from a design point of view. The design space is explored through analytical relationships which relate the gate delay, power consumption and noise margin, which are modeled through a simplified circuit analysis. To be more specific, {{a simple and}} accurate model of the noise margin is used to derive a systematic design strategy to size the transistors’ aspect ratios ensuring an assigned noise margin for a given bias current. From {{the knowledge of the}} transistor sizes, the gate delay is then expressed {{as a function of the}} bias current and the supply voltage, both of which define the static power consumption of PFSCL gates, as well as of the <b>logic</b> <b>swing,</b> which determines the noise margin. Therefore, this delay model simply relates the speed performance, the power consumption and the noise margin of PFSCL gates, and accounts for the dependence on the fan-in and fan-out. Extensive SPICE simulations with a 0. 18 um CMOS process confirm the adequate accuracy of the analytical models and the validity of the approximations introduced to simplify the analysis, and a practical design example of an equality comparator is also presented.
