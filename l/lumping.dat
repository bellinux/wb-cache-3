5|$|Based on {{the work}} on {{albatross}} genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross, per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's albatross, Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross. For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the <b>lumping</b> of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross), although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges of the marsh rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies of the marsh rice rat. Other workers continued this <b>lumping</b> and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

The holotype {{is thought to be}} MNHN1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist Justin Goudot. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be Antongil Bay. In 1850, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire moved the fork-marked lemurs to the genus Cheirogaleus (dwarf lemurs), but they were also commonly listed in the genus Microcebus (mouse lemurs). In 1870, John Edward Gray assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own genus, Phaner, after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the genus Lepilemur (sportive lemurs). Although French naturalist Alfred Grandidier accepted Gray's new genus (while also <b>lumping</b> the other cheirogaleids in Cheirogaleus and illustrating the cranial similarities between cheirogaleids and Lepilemur) in 1897, the genus Phaner was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between Cheirogaleus and Microcebus.|$|E

40|$|Background:. Breast {{augmentation}} with autologous fat {{has been}} performed in Japan for over 30 years. However, complications include breast <b>lumps</b> and oil cysts. Such breast <b>lumps</b> greatly reduce patient satisfaction, and are currently difficult to diagnose and treat for many cosmetic surgery clinics. This study aimed to elucidate {{the effectiveness of}} ultrasound {{diagnosis and treatment of}} patients with breast <b>lumps</b> after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting. Methods:. We used diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound to examine 256 patients with breast <b>lumps</b> between April 2012 and April 2017. We determined the nature, size, and location of the maximal <b>lump.</b> Breast <b>lumps</b> were classified into five types: cystic, complex, solid, calcification, and unclassifiable. The method of treatment (including fine-needle aspiration, VASER liposuction, lumpectomy, and extended lumpectomy) was selected according to the <b>lump</b> type, and the efficacy of treatment was determined by postoperative palpation and ultrasound. Results:. A total of 198 patients (198 / 256, 77 %) requested treatment. Cystic <b>lumps</b> (79 / 256, 31 %) were treated by fine-needle aspiration. VASER liposuction was used to treat complex (64 / 256, 25 %) and solid <b>lumps</b> (50 / 256, 19 %). Calcification (58 / 256, 23 %) and unclassifiable <b>lumps</b> (5 / 256, 2 %) were removed via periareolar incision. There were no serious complications. In all cases, the <b>lumps</b> were no longer palpable after treatment, and ultrasound showed that they had either contracted or disappeared. Conclusions:. The appropriate treatment for breast <b>lumps</b> after breast augmentation with autologous fat grafting must be selected according {{to the nature of the}} <b>lumps.</b> Ultrasound is essential for diagnosing the breast <b>lump</b> type and determining the best treatment...|$|R

Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; back plates that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's <b>lumping</b> of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus.

The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E
