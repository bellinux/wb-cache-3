5000|$|Originally, purifiers {{were simple}} tanks of lime-water, {{also known as}} cream or milk of lime, where the raw gas from the retort bench was bubbled through to remove the sulfuret of hydrogen. This {{original}} process of purification {{was known as the}} [...] "wet lime" [...] process. The <b>lime</b> <b>residue</b> left over from the [...] "wet lime" [...] process {{was one of the first}} true [...] "toxic wastes", a material called [...] "blue billy". Originally, the waste of the purifier house was flushed into a nearby body of water, such as a river or a canal. However, after fish kills, the nauseating way it made the rivers stink, and the truly horrendous stench caused by exposure of residuals if the river was running low, the public clamoured for better means of disposal. Thus it was piled into heaps for disposal. Some enterprising gas entrepreneurs tried to sell it as a weed-killer, but most people wanted nothing to do with it, and generally, it was regarded as waste which was both smelly and poisonous, and gas-works could do little with, except bury. But this was not the end of the [...] "blue billy", for after burying it, rain would often fall upon its burial site, and leach the poison and stench from the buried waste, which could drain into fields or streams. Following countless fiascoes with [...] "blue billy" [...] contaminating the environment, a furious public, aided by courts, juries, judges, and masters in chancery, were often very willing to demand that the gas-works seek other methods of purification - and even pay for the damages caused by their old methods of purification.|$|E

40|$|Acidic upland {{intended}} for soybean development areas must be limed {{to improve its}} soil fertility. The targeted soil is the root zones around 30 cm depth for soybean to decrease the level of acidity. The study {{was carried out in}} Sukadana, East Lampung Province, to determine the effect of lime application technique to the growth and yield of soybean in acidic upland. The experiment was conducted for two years (2009 and 2010). The experiment in 2009 used randomized complete block design to study four rates of lime, based on the calculation to decrease the exchangeable Al to 20 %. Two weeks after lime was incorporated into the soil, soybean (Wilis variety) was planted, and bassal fertilizer of 300 kg NPK/ha was applied. In the 2010 experiment, each previous treatment plot was divided into two plots of the same size: one was treated with no lime to study the effect of the <b>lime</b> <b>residue,</b> and the second plot was limed as maintenance at rate of 25 % of lime applied in the 2009 experiment. Soybean (Anjasmoro Variety) was planted, with bassal fertilizer of 2, 5 t chicken manure + 300 kg SP 18 + 300 kg NPK + 50 kg urea + 50 kg KCl/ha. Soil tillage to a depth of 30 cm on the no limed plots had decreased the growth and grain yield of soybean compared to those of soil tillage to a depth of 15 cm. Liming at 15 and 30 cm to the uppermost soil layer in 2009 increased the growth and yield of soybean, however the yield was not yet optimum. In the 2010 experiment, soybean grew optimally, yielded 2. 67 t and 2. 71 t/ha for lime treatments of 15 and 30 cm soil depth, respectively. To obtain high yield of soybean in the acidic uplands, it is suggested to lime on to the uppermost 15 cm soil layer using rate of lime to decrease the exchangable Al to 20 % in the first year, and applying an additional lime in the following year at 25 % of the first year rate...|$|E

Adsorption isotherms fitted the "H" type described in the Giles classification. Saturation adsorption was reached at equilibrium lead concentrations > 3000 mg/L for peat, compared with ~ 250 mg/L for soil. Calculation of the isotherm parameters showed the maximum lead adsorption to be 150 mg lead/g of peat. This compared with only 12. 64 mg/g of lead for soil alone. Several tests were carried out to evaluate the lead binding capacity of peat in a spiked soil sample. Results from leaching tests (Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure, TCLP, at pH 2. 9) on soil-peat mixtures confirmed the excellent metal binding capacity of peat in the samples tested. The amount of lead leached from a soil sample, spiked with 1840 mg/kg of water-soluble lead, decreased with increasing amounts of peat loading. Total fixation was achieved at a peat loading of 20 %. In addition to peat, several other agents were tested for their suitability as fixing agents in heavy-metal contaminated soils.

Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emanating from application {{of synthetic}} fertiliser, <b>lime</b> and crop <b>residues</b> retained in the field after harvest during field crop production in South Africa were calculated in this study. The objective was to establish GHG profiles of the field crops in South Africa that can inform national mitigation plans that are currently lacking details regarding the agriculture sector. The calculations used Agriculture and Land Use National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software {{which is based on}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National GHG Inventory. GHG emissions were calculated and compared among different crop production and management practices. It is estimated that production of field crops resulted in a total of 5. 2 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) emissions in South Africa in 2012. Application of synthetic fertiliser contributes the highest emissions with 57 % of national total crop CO 2 -eq emissions, followed by addition of lime (30 %) and crop residues retained in the field (13 %). Production of cereal crops accounts for 68 % of national total field crops’ GHG emissions followed by other field crops (14 %), legumes and oilseeds (11 %) and vegetables (7 %). Cultivations of maize, wheat and sugarcane result in highest commodity emissions. Highest GHGs per area planted were from the production of tomatoes with 1. 65 t of CO 2 -eqha− 1.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} an acid soil in a semi-subsistence farming area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa to investigate {{the possibility of using}} organic amendments as liming materials within a minimum tillage (strip cultivation) system to produce maize. Amendments (cattle manure, grass <b>residues</b> and dolomitic <b>lime)</b> were incorporated to a depth of 20 cm in bands 15 cm wide down plant rows at rates of 10 and 20 t ha (in the amended area) for organic materials and 2. 5 and 5. 0 t ha for lime. The remainder of the field remained untilled. Additions of cattle manure rapidly increased soil pH, and concentrations of exchangeable K, Ca and Mg and extractable P were also greatly elevated. Grass residue additions increased pH progressively and increased exchangeable K and Mg and those of dolomitic lime increased pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg. Addition of each of the amendments decreased concentrations of exchangeable Al; the effect was greatest for animal manure after 6 weeks and for <b>lime</b> and grass <b>residues</b> at harvest. At harvest, addition of all three amendments had significantly reduced concentrations of both phytotoxic monomeric and total Al in soil solution. The system not only resulted in an increase in pH and extractable nutrients in row soil compared to that in the inter-row but also an increase in the size and activity of the soil microbial community. Maize yields were increased by additions of amendments under both unfertilised and fertilised conditions and yields were generally greatest at the higher rate of addition. Under unfertilised conditions, cattle manure treatments gave the greatest yields. Fertiliser additions increased yields greatly particularly in the control, grass <b>residue</b> and <b>lime</b> treatments. It was concluded that the strip tillage system used is a practicable way of applying high rates of organic materials to soils, that cattle manure has a rapid liming effect as well as being a nutrient source and that grass residues from rangeland decompose slowly and, therefore, have a slow liming effect...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{work with}} {{solution}} cultures inoculated with soil showed that 20. 83 mgm. of nitrate nitrogen disappeared in eight days, while the total nitrogen increased. The results obtained with soil cultures {{were very similar}} to those obtained with the solution cultures. Treating the soil with straw in the greenhouse brought about a complete utilization of the nitrates, while there was a small accumulation of nitrate in the soil treated with farm manure. The nitrate-assimilating power of the soil was influenced by a number of factors, and, altho much information was secured by the methods employed, more work on the various factors affecting nitrate assimilation in soils is desirable. It was found that dextrose increased the nitrate-assimilating power of the soil. This material furnished a source of energy for those organisms which utilized both nitrate and ammonia, thus preventing an accumulation of nitrate. Since the nitrate content of the soil at any given time is the resultant of many different forces, some treatment which would eliminate all but nitrate assimilation would facilitate the accurate measurement of this process. The addition of a readily available energy source, especially one poor in nitrogen, tends to bring about this condition. Straw, partially decomposed straw and farm manure brought about an assimilation of nitrate immediately upon being added to the soil. The straw brought about a larger assimilation of nitrate than the straw manure or the farm manure. Manure, lime and rock phosphate applied {{over a period of years}} on Marshall silt loam and Grundy silt loam tended, in general, to lower: the nitrate-assimilating power of the soil. The nitrate-assimilating power of Carrington loam treated in the field with different manures varied thruout the season, showing only slight differences between the different treatments. Very similar results were secured with manure, <b>lime</b> and crop <b>residues</b> on both continuous corn and corn in the three-year rotation.

40|$|Acidic mining {{drainage}} (AMD) {{production is}} known {{to be one of the}} most serious problems facing the mining industry. The work presented here deals with the use of alkaline residue of pulp and paper industry, consisting mainly of calcite (mud lime) to control AMD. First, an exhaustive characterisation of the tailing of Ascot mine site (Eastern Townships, Québec) and mud lime (sludge) from the pulp and paper factory of Cascade East Angus (Eastern Townships) was conducted. Four columns were used to test the effect of using mud lime in reducing AMD, in addition to a reference column. Mud <b>lime</b> in mine <b>residues</b> leads to an immediate increase in pH and precipitation of metals. The mud lime superimposed on mine residues produces an alkaline front which, migrating along the columns, leads to an increasing pH and an improvement of the leachate quality. In order to verify in situ the laboratory results, a field application of this method was undertaken on five demonstration cells (12 m x 12 m) among which one is a reference cell. The four adopted variants allowed us to test the effect of incorporating the mud lime and/or covering mine residues with the mud lime. The principal parameters monorited are: (1) Oxygen concentration through cross-section of the soil; (2) Temperature variations; (3) Electrical conductivity of mine residues using probes entirely conceived and manufactured by our laboratory; (4) Chemistry of leachate recovered by the drainage system. The effect of the mud lime on the bacterial catalytic activity was also studied. The main conclusions of the field study can be summarized as follows: (1) Infiltration of precipitation water is significantly reduced by application of the sludge coat at the top; (2) Reduction of atmospheric oxygen diffusion, is achieved especially with a high water content of the mud lime cover; (3) Migration of the alkaline front generated by the mud lime cover improves interstitial water quality; (4) Increasing the pH, due to calcite dissolution, leads to an almost complete inhibition of the bacterial catalytic activity whose role in producing AMD is a well known fact; (5) Geochemical calculations using a computer software (FREEQC) allowed us to carry out speciation of different elements. Determination of secondary minerals susceptible to precipitate has been possible by calculating the saturation indexes; (6) Compilation of experimental results and economical data allows the development of a design, suitable for a reclamation plan of the site. This plan can also be used for other sites having similar problems. " [...] Résumé abrégé par UM...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally goats {{have been}} herded or allowed to roam free range. Their high {{reproductive}} performance {{and ability to}} survive and even thrive on poor quality feeds not generally eaten by other species has made them attractive to resource-poor farmers in marginal areas. Their critics accuse them of eating everything and causing degradation and even desertification. But goats can also be managed intensively to provide a useful income {{as well as more}} grazing control and less environmental damage. Come 95 % of all goats are found in developing countries, one third of them in the ACP States. Nigeria has 26 million goats, Somalia and Ethiopia 18 million each and Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Sudan and Tanzania all have large numbers. In the Caribbean and Central America, Mexico has 10 million goats and Haiti one million. There are also large populations in relation to country size in the Dominican Republic, Barbados, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and other Caribbean islands. In Oceania there are smaller but still considerable numbers in Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Vanuatu. It is in low income countries, which often have limited supplies of animal feed, that the goat comes into its own. Goats are owned' often in small flocks, by more households than any other ruminant species. Partly due to their lowly social status, they are owned by women and children. However, landless owners often allow their animals to scavenge and such opportunistic feeders can cause damage to crops and trees and ill-will among neighbours. Where goats are kept penned and fed on a cut-and-carry system there can be many advantages. It has been shown in numerous studies that indigenous goats will have more young than sheep, will rear twins more successfully and will produce surplus milk for their owners. In some developed countries, particularly in the Mediterranean basin, the goat has long been managed {{in such a way that}} it produces a considerable proportion of the region's milk and milk products. Kept in raised pens on slatted floors, goats can be kept free of internal parasites, which they avoid under traditional free-ranging conditions but suffer from if kept on restricted pasture. Pens can be made to allow easy access. Animals are more easily monitored, poor performers can be culled and breeding is more easily managed. Intensification initiatives In the ACP countries there are several intensification initiatives, mostly related to milk production. Almost all aim to improve productivity, not by selection within indigenous breeds, but by outcrossing or absorption by exotic breeds. These initiatives have had varied success. In the relatively dry areas of eastern Rwanda, for example, crossing Alpine and Anglo-nubian with indigenous Small East African goats led to neither increased milk nor meat production. This was mainly due to high mortality in the exotics but also because of inadequate feed supplies. In Ethiopia the use of Saanens on small Afar goats has been studied for several years: in the very dry Rift Valley the first cross goats were unable to survive but backcrosses to give 1 / 4 Saanen x 3 / 4 Afar genotypes survived well. Encouraging results from crossbreeding have also been obtained using the Mozambique Landim goat. Here 3 / 4 Landim x 1 / 4 Alpine produced 60 % more milk than Landim, and halfbreds more than three times as much. Success by small producers Success by small producers has been achieved in Burundi where, in the densely populated highlands, there are 20, 000 goats of mixed Alpine and Small East African (Burundi) blood. Goats with 75. 0 and even 87. 5 % Alpine blood are managed by local farmers but it is probable that in the long term not more than 62. 5 % Alpine blood will be best for the prevailing management, feed and health environments. Introductions of exotic blood in Burundi resulted in increased lactation length and persistence as well as higher yields. Much of the excess milk is converted to cheese thus generating cash in addition to providing better nutrition. Improved human nutrition and increased income are also the aims in western Kenya, where a dual-purpose goat is being developed from a blend of two local (Small East African and Galla) and two exotic (Toggenberg and Anglo-nubian) types. There are many other cases of intensification, for meat (in Dominica for example), for milk (Norwegian goats in Tanzania) and for dual or multi-purposes (Anglonubians in the south-eastern highlands of Ethiopia). In Dominica mixed groups of local goats and sheep are crossed to exotic breeds and kept in locally designed raised pens with slatted wooden floors. They are but one of several enterprises on small (2 ha) plots where farmers have been settled on old lime estates. The goats and sheep are fed grass cut from under lime trees and on dried <b>lime</b> peel, a <b>residue</b> of <b>lime</b> processing. In northern Tanzania some workers on sisal estates keep goats in similar raised slatted-floor pens close to their houses and cut forage from roadsides and field boundaries. What is clear is that the interest and enthusiasm for goat keeping are there and that further research on nutrition and health will result in the development of more productive intensive systems with benefit to small farmers - and the local environment. Traditionally goats have been herded or allowed to roam free range. Their high reproductive performance and ability to survive and even thrive on poor quality feeds not generally eaten by other species has made them attractive to resource-poor [...] ...|$|R
