5|$|The term {{coronation}} {{is sometimes}} {{used in a}} semi-ironic sense to refer to uncontested party leadership elections, with all potential party leaders choosing to back a single candidate or to stay silent, rather than stand in an election {{they are likely to}} <b>lose.</b> <b>This</b> typically happens where there has been a protracted behind-the-scenes attempt to remove the outgoing leader, leading to a significant amount of time to determine who has the most party support before the election proper.|$|E
5|$|Triple H {{returned}} on the January 30, 2012 {{episode of}} Raw to evaluate Laurinaitis' performance as general manager. Before he could announce the decision, he {{was interrupted by}} the returning Undertaker. After initially refusing the rematch as {{he did not want}} to tarnish The Undertaker's legacy, Triple H accepted the challenge after being called a coward who lives in Shawn Michaels' shadow, on the condition their rematch be contested inside Hell in a Cell. Triple H went on to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> match at WrestleMania XXVIII.|$|E
5|$|Teaching {{commitments}} left MacLaren {{unavailable for}} the start of the 1896 season, and his first appearance came in July. Although he had only batted once in the season, he was chosen to play in the second Test match of the summer between England and Australia, a selection made controversial by his lack of cricket. As the Test was played at Old Trafford, the England team was chosen by the Lancashire committee, who recognised that MacLaren would attract spectators as a local player. He was dismissed by the first ball he faced in the first innings, and scored 15 runs in the second as England were defeated. Shortly after the Test, he scored 226 against Kent to take Lancashire to a draw in a match they seemed likely to <b>lose.</b> <b>This</b> was enough for him to retain his place in the team for the final Test match, where he scored 20 and 6. He batted effectively for the rest of the season, finishing with 713 runs for Lancashire at 54.85. Critics praised his batting, but his absences may have prevented the team from winning the Championship; they finished second. In all first-class matches, he scored 922 runs at 36.88.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien {{says of the}} Valar (including the Maiar) {{that they}} can change their shape at will, and move unclad in the raiment of the world, meaning {{invisible}} and without form.

25|$|There were {{setbacks}} in {{the growth}} of the university. In 1967, the Rutgers Physics Department had a Centers of Excellence Grant from the NSF which allowed the Physics Department to hire several faculty each year and become a more prominent institution. These faculty were to be paid by the grant for three years, but after that time any faculty hired with the Associate or Full Professor designation would become tenured. The Governor and the Chancellor forced Rutgers to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> grant by rejecting these faculty as tenured.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos {{contrived}} to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> one, having {{first had}} Leicestershire Foxes {{on the rack}} after limiting them {{to a total of}} 150 for 9. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made that possible, but he was later to be the main culprit as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets and refused to give him runs. He eventually finished on 18 from 17 balls, making the task of Gareth Breese and Gordon Muchall impossible - and Durham finished an agonising three runs short.|$|E
25|$|The sibling {{relationship}} {{is a unique}} one, as they share a special bond and a common history from birth, have a certain role {{and place in the}} family, often complement each other, and share genetic traits. Siblings who enjoy a close relationship participate in each other's daily lives and special events, confide in each other, share joys, spend leisure time together (whether they are children or adults), and have a relationship that not only exists in the present but often looks toward a future together (even into retirement). Surviving siblings <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> “companionship and a future” with their deceased siblings.|$|E

25|$|The same {{mountains}} that provide Chattanooga's scenic backdrop also served to trap industrial pollutants which {{caused them to}} settle over the community, so much that in 1969, the federal government declared that Chattanooga had the dirtiest air in the nation. But environmental crises {{were not the only}} problems plaguing the city. Like other early industrial cities, Chattanooga entered the 1980s with serious socioeconomic challenges, including job layoffs due to de-industrialization, deteriorating city infrastructure, racial tensions, and social division. Chattanooga's population declined by more than 10% in the 1980s. However, Chattanooga was the only major U.S. city to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> proportion of its population in the 1980s and then regain the same proportion in the next two decades.|$|E
25|$|Housing is {{guaranteed}} to all new first-year students, with many of them housed in Christensen Hall and Williamson Hall, the two largest first-year-only halls. Alexander Hall is also an all first-year student hall, specifically for students in the College of Liberal Arts who have not declared a major yet. These halls offer a living environment of commonality, where all are new to the university. The university guarantees students who live on-campus the ability to live on campus all four years. However, students who move off campus (with the exception of students studying abroad) <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> guarantee, and must complete a housing wait-list application each semester {{in order to be}} considered for on-campus housing the following semester.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Reformation in Zürich and its rapid {{territorial}} expansion definitely made this religious renewal a political issue and {{a major source of}} conflict between the thirteen cantons. The alpine cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Lucerne, and Zug remained staunchly Catholic. Their opposition was not uniquely a question of faith; economic reasons also played a role. Besides on agriculture, their economy depended to a large degree on the mercenary services and the financial recompensations for the same. They could not afford to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> source of income, which was a major target of reformatory criticism. In contrast, the cities' economies were more diversified, including strong crafts and guilds as well as a budding industrial sector. Fribourg and Solothurn also remained Catholic.|$|E

I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet.

25|$|Floor spikes - The First Wars to The Third Wars and Series 8 onwards - These were {{pneumatic}} spikes {{located in}} several {{positions on the}} arena floor that came up whenever a robot drove over them. They trapped robots and on occasion flipped them. They were removed for Series 4 after causing many upsets during The Third Wars, where robots currently winning battles would be overturned and then <b>lose.</b> <b>This</b> most notably happened during Heat B when Behemoth was flipped, couldn't self-right and its opponent Pitbull won by default. For Series 8, a group of five large spikes forms {{one of the four}} main hazards of the arena. They are powerful and large enough to lift and trap robots for a brief moment (as happened to Bonk in the opening episode), but are not as fast as their predecessors. In theory, this will avoid the sort of upsets seen in Series 3. One spike 'hole' is capable of emitting sparks.|$|E
25|$|His career best {{score was}} 143, made against Leicestershire at Chesterfield in 1924, the highest {{score of the}} season for Derbyshire, who failed to win a match all season and {{contrived}} to <b>lose</b> <b>this</b> one after being ahead by 52 on first innings by being bowled out for 69 in the second innings. This remained his only hundred until 1927, when he scored two more, 110 against Glamorgan at Chesterfield and 102 against Gloucestershire at Gloucester, and enjoyed his best season in terms of averages, with 871 runs at 27.21. There was a fourth century in 1928, 111 against Warwickshire at Derby, and a final one the following season, 138 against Somerset at Burton-on-Trent, when he put on 153 for the seventh wicket with Archibald Slater and 113 for the eighth wicket with Arthur Richardson. In 1930, he played pretty regularly, but by this time batted mostly at No 7 or 8 and in the season he scored less than 500 runs. The following year, he played just nine matches and was not re-engaged {{at the end of}} the season.|$|E
