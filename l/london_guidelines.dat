2500|$|Three {{other efforts}} to improve {{regulation}} of international pesticide trade are the United Nations <b>London</b> <b>Guidelines</b> for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission. [...] The former seeks to implement procedures for ensuring that prior informed consent exists between countries buying and selling pesticides, while the latter seeks to create uniform standards for maximum levels of pesticide residues among participating countries. Both initiatives operate on a voluntary basis.|$|E

In 2007 it participated in a consensus conference on the management of early CKD.|$|R

5000|$|In 2008, {{in spite}} of the action by the General Synod, St Bartholomew's Church in London offered a rite of blessing for two priests {{entering}} into a same-sex civil partnership. Nevertheless, other dioceses and parishes supported the inclusion of gay and lesbian priests. In 2008, the Diocese of <b>London</b> provided <b>guidelines</b> saying [...] "clergy ... may use a form of service they consider suitable in respect of a civil partnership." [...] In London, some churches [...] "offer dedication services to civil partners" [...] as allowed within those guidelines. In 2011, the General Synod voted to extend pensions and employee benefits to gay and lesbian priests living with their partners in civil unions. In 2013, the House of Bishops ruled that priests in same-sex civil partnerships could be consecrated as bishops.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} mainly {{focused on the}} {{eligibility}} of trans-boundary Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project activity and it aims to explore {{a broad range of}} CCS transboundary issues whereby the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and national governments could take into consideration. Much work is still to be done by the CCS community (including the Institute) to ensure that the implementation of CCS under the CDM is both environmentally effective and commercially attractive. The recommendations focus on technical issues, with the aim of helping Parties evaluate a robust strategy for CCS as part of international negotiations and establish CCS best practice criteria for governments and the international process, thereby enhancing transparency and ensuring that CCS deployment is safe and effective. When considering CDM projects activities with a transboundary component, it is recommend that the rules of the main international treaties related to CCS be considered by the UNFCCC, especially the <b>London</b> Protocol <b>guidelines</b> for risk assessment and management and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Additionally, national governments should apply the rules and guidelines as delineated under the relevant existing international treaties and CCS national regulations...|$|R
40|$|Australia {{has made}} a {{substantial}} contribution to the recognition and treatment of the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS). Much of this occurred over a generation ago, and vigilance in identifying this condition needs to be sustained. More recently, treatment protocols have been developed by the Royal College of Physicians (<b>London).</b> These provide <b>guidelines</b> on {{when and how to}} treat both patients at risk and those with acute Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s encephalopathy (WE). It is not known how widespread these recommendations have been applied in Australia. We highlight these current treatment guidelines and illustrate management issues with two case reports. A decline in treatment practices in the United Kingdom prompted the development of these guidelines. Current treatment practices in Australia have not been reported. All alcohol and drug workers need to be reminded regularly of this condition and the need for prompt recognition and treatment...|$|R
5000|$|Using the GEH Statistic avoids some pitfalls {{that occur}} when using simple {{percentages}} to compare {{two sets of}} volumes. This is because the traffic volumes in real-world transportation systems vary over a wide range. For example, the mainline of a freeway/motorway might carry 5000 vehicles per hour, while one of the on-ramps leading to the freeway might carry only 50 vehicles per hour (in that situation {{it would not be}} possible to select a single percentage of variation that is acceptable for both volumes). The GEH statistic reduces this problem; because the GEH statistic is non-linear, a single acceptance threshold based on GEH can be used over a fairly wide range of traffic volumes. The use of GEH as an acceptance criterion for travel demand forecasting models is recognised in the UK Highways Agency's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges [...] the Wisconsin microsimulation modeling guidelines, the Transport for <b>London</b> Traffic Modelling <b>Guidelines</b> [...] and other references.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUrodynamic stress {{incontinence}} {{is a common}} complaint. There have been over two hundred procedures described for treatment. In 2003, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in <b>London</b> published a <b>guideline</b> highlighting the evidence for different surgical approaches. These guidelines are intended to guide practice in the United Kingdom, including the two countries that were surveyed. It was our impression however that more sub-urethral tape type procedures were taking place than was recommended. We therefore undertook a postal survey of the consultant gynaecologists in Scotland and Wales, to compare current practice with the evidence base, and also to assess practice from a clinical and manpower perspective. Two hundred and forty consultants were identified in Scotland (161) and Wales (79). About two-thirds of those who saw patients with {{stress incontinence}} would always arrange pre-operative physiotherapy, {{and the majority of}} consultants would always organise urodynamics preoperatively. There were several different choices of primary procedure, with Tension Free Vaginal Tape (TVT™ Gynecare- Johnson & Johnson) the most common option. More than half of the respondents in both countries would refer a patient with recurrent stress incontinence to a specialist. TVT™ was also the most common choice of procedure for recurrent stress incontinence. The procedures that have a grade A recommendation in the RCOG guideline are Burch colposuspension and TVT™, and 72 % in Scotland and 63 % in Wales would perform one of these procedures as first choice. Clinical practice moves on and there are several new sub-urethral tape procedures available on the market. It is important to balance the available evidence base with new developments in order to optimise the management of this common condition...|$|R
