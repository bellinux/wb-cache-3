40|$|A {{pregnant}} 3. 5 year-old high-productive Holstein cow in {{the third}} month of lactation showed colic signs, marked anorexia, and stopped milk production. Clinical examination revealed tachypnea, pyrexia and the mucous membranes were all congested. Signs of abdominal discomfort were observed, the abdomen was tense and painful; digestive activity was poor. Blood investigations revealed inflammation, cholestasis, and <b>leucocytosis</b> <b>with</b> marked <b>neutrophilia.</b> Trans-abdominal ultrasonography revealed decreased digestive transit and enlarged gall-bladder. Hepatic or biliary involvement was suspected. A right-flank exploratory laparotomy revealed a gallbladder filled with firm and mobile 0. 5 to 1 cm diameter fluctuant masses. Digital palpation allowed cholelith extraction through the cystic duct into the duodenum. After the surgery, the cow progressively regained a normal appetite and pain signs decreased. Blood samples analysed 10 days after the surgery still showed inflammation but to a lesser extent. Hepatic enzymes were markedly increased, indicating hepatic injury. Three months after the surgery, the cow was healthy and was inseminated. This case report suggests that cholelithiasis may be diagnosed and successfully treated in early stage of the disease in cattle, though this condition is rare in this species.

40|$|Canine leishmaniosis is {{a severe}} {{systemic}} disease caused by Leishmania species parasites, which are transmitted by {{the bite of}} haematophagous phlebotomine sandflies. Dogs are a major reservoirs host for human visceral leishmaniosis. An 11 -year-old male pinscher was referred during February 2004 with a one-month history of gastrointestinal disorders. Haematological analysis revealed a normochromic-normocytic hyporigenerative anaemia and <b>leucocytosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>neutrophilia.</b> May-Grunwald-Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears revealed inside neutrophils numerous L. infantum amastigotes. Many free parasites were also observed. The immunofluorescent antibody test for Leishmania-specific antibodies yielded a positive titre of 1 / 320. The finding of Leishmania species amastigotes in peripheral blood is rare. The role of played by PMN in controlling leishmanial infection is still unclear. Experimental studies suggest a possible dual role for PNMs in the early response to the infection.

40|$|Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is {{predominantly}} an opportunistic {{infection in the}} immunocompromised patients. Though, there are few cases of CMV colitis being reported in the immunocompetent individuals, CMV enteritis is exceedingly rare and enteritis leading into small bowel ischemia has never been reported yet. Presentation of case: A- 78 -year-old male patient presented with distal small obstruction for 4 days duration. Clinical examination revealed a distended abdomen and localised peritonism in right iliac fossa. An initial computed tomography (CT) scan revealed distended small bowel loops up to the thickened inflammed terminal illeum with no free fluid or gas and a normal appendix. No immunosuppressive risk factors such as human immunodeficiency virus, transplant procedures, or steroid therapy were present. Hematologic investigations showed <b>leucocytosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>neutrophilia.</b> Diagnostic laparoscopy confirmed a thickened terminal ileum causing small bowel obstruction. Laparoscopy converted to laparotomy and right hemicolectomy was performed. Histology showed isolated small bowel ischemia with ulcerative changes and cytomegalovirus inclusions. The patient was started on ganciclovir therapy and subsequently had an uneventful recovery and discharged after 16 days. Discussion: Cytomegalovirus enteritis was initially not suspected in our patient. In this case CMV caused ischemia of the small bowel without evidence of colonic involvement. Even in elderly patients, the small bowel remains resilient to the ischemic changes because of the copious blood supply. Conclusion: We report possibly the first case of isolated small bowel ischaemia caused by cytomegalovirus in immunocompetent individuals, needed surgical resection...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} verify the {{possible}} hematologic alterations related to intestinal parasitism in horses, 84 mixed breed animals (42 males, 42 females) were selected, with age varying from 2 to 15 years, used in the daily routine work of urban traction, with history of weight loss and less resistance to physical effort, and with a diagnoses of intense natural infection with strongyles. The fecal egg count per grams of feces (EPG) showed a variation from 350 to 6. 500 EPG (Md 1. 425 EPG) characterizing a considerable degree of infection with adult strongyles. The hematologic parameters were erithrocytes 6. 43 ± 0, 90 x 106 /µL; hemoglobin 10, 62 ± 1, 63 g/dL; PCV 30, 98 ± 4, 08 %; MCV 48, 38 ± 3, 14 fL; MCHC 34, 51 ± 4, 00 %; leucocytes 12. 495 ± 2. 776, 26 /µL; band neutrophils 28, 98 ± 114, 43 /µL; mature neutrophils 7. 970, 77 ± 2. 534, 33 /µL; lymphocytes 3. 921 ± 1. 585, 29 /µL; monocytes 128, 60 ± 187, 10 /µL and eosinophils 434, 33 ± 398, 07 /µL. These values showed a <b>leucocytosis</b> <b>with</b> <b>neutrophilia,</b> {{as well as a}} tendency of erythrocytic values in staying close to the normal inferior limits of the reference range for the specie. No alterations regarding eosinophylic values were observed, thus partly contradicting the concept that eosinophilia should occur with intestinal parasitism in horses. Com objetivo de verificar as possíveis alterações hematológicas relacionadas ao parasitismo intestinal em eqüinos selecionaram-se 84 animais (42 machos, 42 fêmeas), mestiços, com idade entre 2 e 15 anos, utilizados em trabalho diário de tração urbana, com histórico de emagrecimento e menor resistência ao esforço físico, diagnosticando-se apenas elevada infecção natural por estrongilídeos. A contagem de ovos por gramas de fezes (OPG) mostrou uma variação de 350 a 6. 500 OPG (Md = 1. 425 OPG) caracterizando um grau considerável de infecção por formas adultas de estrongilídeos, sendo o quadro hematológico representado pelos valores médios a seguir; Eritrócitos: 6, 43 ± 0, 90 x 106 /µL; Hb: 10, 62 ± 1, 63 g/dL; Ht: 30, 98 ± 4, 08 %; VCM: 48, 38 ± 3, 14 fL; CHCM: 34, 51 ± 4, 00 %; Leucócitos: 12. 495, 83 ± 2. 776, 26 /µL; Bastonetes: 28, 98 ± 114, 43 /µL; Neutrófilos: 7. 970, 77 ± 2. 534, 33 /µL; Linfócitos: 3. 921, 62 ± 1. 585, 29 /µL; Monócitos: 128, 60 ± 187, 10 /µL e Eosinófilos: 434, 33 ± 398, 07 /µL. Tais achados apontam a existência de leve leucocitose por neutrofilia, assim como uma tendência do quadro eritrocitário em se manter próximo aos limites inferiores de normalidade considerados para a espécie.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{pyometra}} syndrome with endotoxemia and/or sepsis in bitches may impair different organ systems and functions including haemostasis, which may considerably influence the outcome if overlooked or underestimated. The present clinical study was carried out on thirty-seven clinical patients admitted to the Clinic for Small Animal Medicine and Surgery at the Veterinary Faculty in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Preoperative diagnosis was based on clinical signs, haematology results and ultrasonographic examination. Ovariohysterectomy was performed as final treatment.

Acute phase reaction <b>with</b> <b>leucocytosis,</b> <b>neutrophilia,</b> lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia and hyperfibrinogenemia was identified preoperatively and up to 24 hours postoperatively. Changes in the haemostatic profile - prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, shortened thrombin time, increased concentration of D-dimeres and thrombocytopenia - which were confirmed in the study, suggest the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), most likely due to influence of E. coli endotoxin. The changes of haemostatic profile and concurrent acute phase reaction suggest the connection between inflammation and coagulopathy.

It presents in three clinical settings: classical Sweet's syndrome, usually after a respiratory tract infection; malignancy-associated, frequently related to acute myelogeneous leukemia; and drug-induced. We present, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, the first case of a rotavirus -infection-related Sweet's syndrome. Case presentation An 18 -month-old boy of Hellenic origin was referred to us <b>with</b> diarrhea, fever, <b>neutrophilia,</b> typical skin lesions, asymmetrical hip arthritis and oropharyngeal involvement. A skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Thorough screening did not reveal any underlying systemic illness, except for the confirmation of an overt rotavirus infection. The syndrome responded promptly upon corticosteroid administration; no recurrence was observed. Conclusion Besides describing the connection of Sweet's syndrome to a rotavirus infection, this case report is also a reminder that in a child presenting with a febrile papulo-nodular rash <b>with</b> <b>neutrophilia</b> Sweet's syndrome should be included in the differential. </p...|$|R

On admission she was haemodynamically stable but prostrated, with stiff neck and right otorrhea. Laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis <b>with</b> <b>neutrophilia,</b> thrombocytosis and high C-reactive protein. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination suggested bacterial meningitis and treatment with ceftriaxone was started. After Streptococcus pyogenes grew in the CSF, clindamycin was added. She completed 15 days of antibiotics and was discharged clinically recovered. No neurological or hearing sequelae were observed. Although the incidence of group A streptococcal meningitis seems to be low, invasive infection by this agent is raising. Despite the excellent evolution of this case, a fatal outcome or neurological sequelae can arise, even in healthy children.
