40|$|Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) {{has been}} {{considered}} as {{the best choice for}} numerous applications. To make PMSM a high performance drive, effective control system is required. Vector control is accepted widely due to its decoupling effect {{but it is not the}} only performance requirement. Additional control methods such as constant torque angle control (CTAC), optimum torque per ampere control (OTPAC), unity power factor control (UPFC), constant mutual flux <b>linkages</b> <b>control</b> (CMFLC), and angle control of air gap flux and current phasor (ACAGF) can also be implemented.

The performance characteristics for each strategy under steady state are modelled and simulated in MATLAB environment. Based on the simulation results, a conclusion is drawn that OTPAC is superior in normalized torque per unit normalized stator current (Ten/isn) ratio whereas UPFC yields very low Ten/isn ratio. In addition, performances of these control strategies are compared, which is a key to select optimum strategy depending on requirements. Based on the comparative study, it can be concluded that CMFLC is superior to CTAC, ACAGF, OTPAC, and UPFC. Hence, it can be a good control strategy to consider...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, an Electronic Helical Guide Controller (EHGC) is proposed, for {{helical gear}} shaping processes. In most {{traditional}} gear shaper machines, the cutter's reciprocating movement {{is driven by}} a crank-connecting rod mechanism. Therefore, this study adopts this kind of gear shaper as the machine platform to establish an accurate mathematical model. The control algorithm {{is embedded in the}} interpolation module of the CNC system using electronic gearbox techniques to realize special multi-axis <b>linkage</b> <b>control</b> requirements. The crankshaft's angular position is measured and the rotational speed is calculated in each control cycle. The actual position and velocity of the cutter along the Z-axis can be calculated using the geometric relations of the crank-connecting mechanism, and motion in the other axes can be controlled by the electronic gearbox. A special G code with parameters (G 83) is also designed and the EHGC control through NC programming is realized in an improvised gear shaping CNC machine. The proposed EHGC is low cost and easy to implement in practice since it does not need a linear grating ruler and a probe on the Z-axis. Furthermore, EHGC allows the flexibility to change a part's helix angle to compensate for distortions caused by heat treatment. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed EHGC...|$|E

It is necessary to realize remote regulating and automatic control on production systems of CBM wells as soon as possible, so that production cost can be reduced effectively and fine production of CBM wells can be improved. In this paper, remote production control technologies were designed based on production behaviors of CBM wells. And then, in light of the features of automatic monitoring instruments, automatic production of CBM wells was divided into four stages (i. e. before casing pressure occurring, casing pressure building, initial gas production and gas production). Finally, an automatic control program was developed and embedded into on-site control terminals after study was carried out on automatic control logics and methods of each production stage of CBM wells. It is {{for the first time that}} gas and water production of CBM wells are automatically regulated precisely and automatic CBM production modes are adopted with the <b>linkage</b> <b>control</b> of gas and water production. Based on this production network and remote control platform system, terminal operation is controlled and feedback according to the production orders which are set and delivered remotely. In this way, CBM well production is automatically controlled over long distance.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the position-sensor less direct {{torque and}} {{indirect}} flux control of brushless dc (BLDC) motor with non sinusoidal {{back electromotive force}} (EMF) has been extensively investigated. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for BLDC motor drives to obtain optimum current and torque control with minimum torque pulsations. Most methods are complicated and do not consider the stator flux <b>linkage</b> <b>control,</b> therefore, possible high-speed operations are not feasible. In this study, a novel and simple approach to achieve a low-frequency torque ripple-free direct torque control (DTC) with maximum efficiency based on dq reference frame is presented. The proposed sensor less method closely resembles the conventional DTC scheme used for sinusoidal ac motors such that it controls the torque directly and stator flux amplitude indirectly using d-axis current. This method does not require pulse width modulation and proportional plus integral regulators and also permits the regulation of varying signals. Furthermore, to eliminate the low-frequency torque oscillations, two actual and easily available line-to-line back EMF constants (kba and kca) according to electrical rotor position are obtained offline and converted to the dq frame equivalents using the new line-to-line park transformation. Then, they are {{set up in the}} look-up table for torque estimation. The validity and practical applications of the proposed sensor less three-phase conduction DTC of BLDC motor drive scheme are verified through simulations and experimental results.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the current}} era of {{globalization}} every prosperous nation {{in this world}} wishes to develop a fast moving aircraft with a high lift coefficient and low drag coefficient, which helps them to enhance their military force and strengthens its civilization’s foundation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine the viscous, incompressible and steady-state flow over the F- 16 aircraft using computer modelling techniques and to compare the modelled results with the experimental results done with the help of wind tunnel. This paper outlines the development of a computational model of the F- 16 model in modelling software and then the creation of a finite computational domain, segmentation of this domain into discrete intervals, application of the boundary condition such as Mach number or velocity and then obtaining the plots and results for coefficient of pressure, lift coefficient, drag coefficient, etc. The aircraft being a military aircraft travels at speed of Mach 2, which is around 1, 500 mph at an altitude of 50, 000 ft.

40|$|Synchronous {{machines}} with an AC converter are used mainly in large drives, {{for example in}} ship propulsion drives {{as well as in}} rolling mill drives in steel industry. These motors are used because of their high efficiency, high overload capacity and good performance in the field weakening area. Present day drives for electrically excited synchronous motors are equipped with position sensors. Most drives for electrically excited synchronous motors will be equipped with position sensors also in future. This kind of drives with good dynamics are mainly used in metal industry. Drives without a position sensor can be used e. g. in ship propulsion and in large pump and blower drives. Nowadays, these drives are equipped with a position sensor, too. The tendency is to avoid a position sensor if possible, since a sensor reduces the reliability of the drive and increases costs (latter is not very significant for large drives). A new control technique for a synchronous motor drive is a combination of the Direct Flux <b>Linkage</b> <b>Control</b> (DFLC) based on a voltage model and a supervising method (e. g. current model). This combination is called Direct Torque Control method (DTC). In the case of the position sensorless drive, the DTC can be implemented by using other supervising methods that keep the stator flux linkage origin centered. In this thesis, a method for the observation of the drift of the real stator flux linkage in the DTC drive is introduced. It is also shown how this method {{can be used as a}} supervising method that keeps the stator flux linkage origin centered in the case of the DTC. In the position sensorless case, a synchronous motor can be started up with the DTC control, when a method for the determination of the initial rotor position presented in this thesis is used. The load characteristics of such a drive are not very good at low rotational speeds. Furthermore, continuous operation at a zero speed and at a low rotational speed is not possible, which is partly due to the problems related to the flux linkage estimate. For operation in a low speed area, a stator current control method based on the DFLC modulator (DMCQ is presented. With the DMCC, it is possible to start up and operate a synchronous motor at a zero speed and at low rotational speeds in general. The DMCC is necessary in situations where high torque (e. g. nominal torque) is required at the starting moment, or if the motor runs several seconds at a zero speed or at a low speed range (up to 2 Hz). The behaviour of the described methods is shown with test results. The test results are presented for the direct flux linkage and torque controlled test drive system with a 14. 5 kVA, four pole salient pole synchronous motor with a damper winding and electric excitation. The static accuracy of the drive is verified by measuring the torque in a static load operation, and the dynamics of the drive is proven in load transient tests. The performance of the drive concept presented in this work is sufficient e. g. for ship propulsion and for large pump drives. Furthermore, the developed methods are almost independent of the machine parameters...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{radiocarbon}} (14 C) plateau-tuning method a new age model for Timor Sea Core MD 01 - 2378 was established. It revealed a precise centennial-scale phasing of climate events in the ocean, cryo-, and atmosphere during the last deglacial and provides important new insights into causal <b>linkages</b> <b>controlling</b> events of global climate change. At Site MD 01 - 2378 reservoir ages of surface waters dropped from 1600 yr prior to 20 cal ka to 250 - 500 yr after 18. 8 cal ka. This evidence was crucial for generating a high-resolution age model for deglacial events in the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool. Sea-surface temperatures (SST) started to change near 18. 8 cal ka, that is ~ 500 yr after the start of, presumably northern hemispheric, deglacial melt and sea level rise as shown by the benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope ratio (d 18 O). However, the SST rise occurred 500 - 1000 yr prior to the onset of deglacial Antarctic warming and the first major rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide at about 18 ka. The increase in SST may partly reflect reduced seasonal upwelling of cold subsurface waters along the eastern margin of the Indian Ocean, which is reflected by a doubling of the thermal gradient between the sea surface and the thermocline, a halving of chlorin productivity from 19 to 18. 5 cal ka, and in particular, by the strong decrease in surface water reservoir ages. Two significant increases in deglacial Timor Sea surface salinities from 19 - 18. 5 and 15. 5 - 14. 5 cal ka, may partly reflect the deglacial increase in the distance of local river mouths, partly an inter-hemispheric millennial-scale see-saw in tropical monsoon intensity, possibly linked to a deglacial increase in the dominance of Pacific El Niño regimes over Heinrich stadial 1...|$|R
