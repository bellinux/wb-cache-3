25|$|The {{potential}} for computer networking to facilitate newly improved forms of computer-mediated social interaction was suggested early on. Efforts to support social networks via computer-mediated communication {{were made in}} many early online services, including Usenet, ARPANET, <b>LISTSERV,</b> and bulletin board services (BBS). Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as America Online, Prodigy, CompuServe, ChatNet, and The WELL.|$|E
25|$|The {{charges against}} Chetty and Van den Berg arose out of {{comments}} {{by the two}} men, published {{in the press and}} on the university’s “Change” <b>listserv</b> in March and April. The comments were critical of UKZN vice chancellor Malegapuru Makgoba’s alleged repeated attempts to block from the senate agenda a faculty of Science and Agriculture submission on academic freedom, which refers to a “prevailing culture of incivility and racial stereotyping that further impedes the free exchange of ideas” at the university.|$|E

Kirschenbaum considers Mindvox, an interface between the dark web and the global Internet, to have been [...] "an ideal initial host". The text spread rapidly from that point on, first on FTP servers and anonymous mailers and later via USENET and <b>listserv</b> email. Since Gibson did not use email at the time, fans sent copies of the pirated text to his fax machine.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} the late 19th century, the {{baseball}} community had recognized that parks with shorter distances to the foul poles and back fence allowed for home runs that were thought of as undeserved or unearned, since fly balls of the same distance hit closer to or in center field could easily result in outs when fielders caught them. In 1896 Jim Nolan of the Daily News of Galveston, Texas, reporting on {{the expansion of the}} local ballpark, wrote: [...] "The enlarged size of the grounds will enable the outfielders to cover more ground and take in fly balls that went for cheap home runs before. Batsmen will have to earn their triples and home runs hereafter". In 2010 Jonathan Lighter, a member of the American Dialect Society's <b>listserv,</b> found the earliest use of the term [...] "Chinese home run" [...] for that type of hit in a Charleroi, Pennsylvania, newspaper's account of a Philadelphia Phillies game against the Pittsburgh Pirates: [...] "The Phillies went into a deadlock on Cy's Chinese homer only to see the Buccos hammer over four runs a little later." ...|$|E
