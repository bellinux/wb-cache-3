40|$|We {{argue that}} an {{understanding}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> as normative practice clarifies how sustainability is to be understood in <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is first approached by investigating its identity. We argue that the economic aspect qualifies and the formative aspect founds the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice. Observing the normativity related to these aspects {{will be the first}} task for the livestock farmer. In addition, we can distinguish conditioning norms applicable to the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice which should be observed for competent performance of the practice. Failing to do justice to this normativity might affect the practice's sustainability only in the long term - this is especially the case with conditioning norms. Motives to observe normativity have, therefore, the character of an ultimate conviction regarding the flourishing of the practice. Finally, the sustainability of the <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> practice crucially depends on the broader food system of which it is part...|$|R
25|$|Montana's {{personal}} income tax contains 7 brackets, with rates ranging from 1 percent to 6.9 percent. Montana has no sales tax. In Montana, household goods are exempt from property taxes. However, property taxes are assessed on <b>livestock,</b> <b>farm</b> machinery, heavy equipment, automobiles, trucks, and business equipment. The amount of property tax owed is not determined solely by the property's value. The property's value is multiplied by a tax rate, set by the Montana Legislature, to determine its taxable value. The taxable value is then multiplied by the mill levy established by various taxing jurisdictions—city and county government, school districts and others.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{the scale and}} {{intensity}} of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> have increased significantly. At the same time, Western societies have become more urbanised and fewer people have close relatives involved in farming. As a result, most citizens have little knowledge or direct experience of what farming entails. In addition, more people are expressing concerns over issues such as farm animal welfare. This has led to increasing public demand for more sustainable ways of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> To date, {{little research has been}} carried out on the social pillar of sustainable <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} provide insights into the sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. This study reviews the key findings of earlier published interdisciplinary research about the social perceptions of dairy farming in the Netherlands and Norway (Boogaard et al., 2006, 2008, 2010 a and 2010 b) and synthesises the implications for sociocultural sustainability of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> This study argues that the (sociocultural) sustainable development of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is not an objective concept, but that it is socially and culturally constructed by people in specific contexts. It explains the social pillar of the economics/ecological/social model sustainability in terms of the fields of tensions that exist between modernity, traditions and naturality – ‘the MTN knot’ – each of which has positive and negative faces. All three angles of vision can be seen in people's attitudes to dairy farming, but the weight given to each differs between individuals and cultures. Hence, sociocultural sustainability is context dependent and needs to be evaluated according to its local meaning. Moreover, sociocultural sustainability is about people's perceptions of <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> Lay people might perceive <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> differently and ascribe different meanings to it than experts do, but their ‘reality’ is just as real. Finally, this study calls for an ongoing collaboration between social and animal scientists in order to develop <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems that are more socioculturally sustainable...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} monitoring Trenthorst, situated near Lübeck in a temperate {{maritime climate}} on loamy soils, {{was established in}} 2003 and compares two cash crop and three <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> systems. We studied the soil mineral nitrogen contents of one cash crop and two <b>livestock</b> <b>farms,</b> specialised in dairy cows and goats/oilseeds resp., with {{the hypothesis that the}} <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> show a more even course of Nmin in the rotation and a higher rotation mean.

As a precise nitrogen supply via manure as in the <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> is impossible in a self-sustaining cash crop farm, the excess of nitrogen at the beginning and the lack of it towards the end of the rotation could not be balanced. A way to improve this might be the use of green manure crops for biogas production and the application of the residues as manure.

In order to minimize the problem, there must be some sort of regulation, existing regulation/by-law mainly focusing on disease control.
