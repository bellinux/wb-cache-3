5|$|The hoard was {{concentrated}} {{in a single}} location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as <b>ladles</b> and bowls were stacked inside each other, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, {{and the existence of}} the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated in situ by professional archaeologists.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and <b>ladles.</b> The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E

The channeled whelk (Busycotypus canaliculatus) and the quahog (Mercenaria mercenaria) were used to make white and purple traditional patterns. The shells were cut, rolled, polished and drilled before being strung together and woven into belts. These were used for personal, social and ceremonial purposes and also, at a later date, for currency. The Winnebago Tribe from Wisconsin had numerous uses for freshwater mussels including using them as spoons, cups, <b>ladles</b> and utensils. They notched them to provide knives, graters and saws. They carved them into fish hooks and lures. They incorporated powdered shell into clay to temper their pottery vessels. They used them as scrapers for removing flesh from hides and for separating the scalps of their victims. They used shells as scoops for gouging out fired logs when building canoes and they drilled holes in them and fitted wooden handles for tilling the ground.|$|E

25|$|Since around 2000 BC, stone {{hand tools}} and weapons {{improved}} extraordinarily in both quantity and variety. Pottery reached {{a higher level}} of technique and decoration style. The Vietnamese people were mainly agriculturists, growing the wet rice Oryza, which became the main staple of their diet. During the later stage {{of the first half of}} the 2nd millennium BC, the first appearance of bronze tools took place despite these tools still being rare. By about 1000 BC, bronze replaced stone for about 40 percent of edged tools and weapons, rising to about 60 percent. Here, there were not only bronze weapons, axes, and personal ornaments, but also sickles and other agriculture tools. Toward the closure of the Bronze Age, bronze accounts for more than 90 percent of tools and weapons, and there are exceptionally extravagant graves – the burial places of powerful chieftains – containing some hundreds of ritual and personal bronze artifacts such as musical instruments, bucket-shaped <b>ladles,</b> and ornament daggers. After 1000 BC, the ancient Vietnamese people became skilled agriculturalists as they grew rice and kept buffaloes and pigs. They were also skilled fishermen and bold sailors, whose long dug-out canoes traversed the eastern sea.|$|E

There are 23 cigni, which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small <b>ladles</b> and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the alpha and omega in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As {{is often the case}} with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola.

According to the requirements of actual operator and working condition, a lining structure of a new type of <b>ladle</b> with nanometer adiabatic material is put forward. Based on heat transfer theory and finite element technology, the three-dimensional finite element model of a new type of <b>ladle</b> is established. Temperature field and stress field of the new type of <b>ladle</b> with the nanometer adiabatic material in lining structure after baking are analyzed. The results indicate that the distributions of temperature and thermal stress level of working layer, permanent layer, and nanometer heat insulating layer are similar, and they are in the permissible stress and temperature range of each material for the new type of <b>ladle.</b> Especially heat preservation effect of nanometer adiabatic material is excellent. Furthermore, the maximum temperature of shell for the new type of <b>ladle</b> drops to 114 °C than the traditional <b>ladle,</b> and the maximum stress of shell for the new type of <b>ladle</b> is lower than the traditional <b>ladle,</b> that is, 114 [*]MPa.

500|$|Many basic {{variations}} of cooking utensils available today, such as frying pans, pots, kettles, and waffle irons, already existed, {{although they were}} often too expensive for poorer households. Other tools more specific to cooking over an open fire were spits of various sizes, and material for skewering anything from delicate quails to whole oxen. There were also cranes with adjustable hooks so that pots and cauldrons could easily be swung away from the fire {{to keep them from}} burning or boiling over. Utensils were often held directly over the fire or placed into embers on tripods. To assist the cook there were also assorted knives, stirring spoons, <b>ladles</b> and graters. In wealthy households {{one of the most common}} tools was the mortar and sieve cloth, since many medieval recipes called for food to be finely chopped, mashed, strained and seasoned either before or after cooking. This was based on a belief among physicians that the finer the consistency of food, the more effectively the body would absorb the nourishment. It also gave skilled cooks the opportunity to elaborately shape the results. Fine-textured food was also associated with wealth; for example, finely milled flour was expensive, while the bread of commoners was typically brown and coarse. A typical procedure was farcing (from the Latin farcio, [...] "to cram"), to skin and dress an animal, grind up the meat and mix it with spices and other ingredients and then return it into its own skin, or mold it into the shape of a completely different animal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Flow {{patterns}} and mixing behaviors in a gas stirred steelmaking <b>ladle</b> with a slag layer were discussed using a water model experiment {{as well as}} a numerical simulation. While the water model experiment was performed to investigate the effect of slag on the mixing behavior in <b>ladle,</b> the numerical simulation was carried out to figure out the flow pattern in <b>ladle</b> with a slag layer. Slag viscosity and its thickness in <b>ladle</b> were considered as major variables. It was found that a slag layer made a great change in the flow pattern in <b>ladle,</b> which, in turn, affected on the mixing behavior in <b>ladle.</b> A flow pattern without a slag layer showed that rising bubbles eventually made a recirculation loop at the central area of the <b>ladle</b> and this flow pattern was regarded as a favorable flow pattern for the better mixing behavior. However, a flow pattern with a slag layer showed distorted and localized recirculating loop near side wall below slag layer. This eventually gave a longer mixing time in <b>ladle</b> with a slag layer. Moreover, as the gas flow rate increases, slag existing on top of the <b>ladle</b> was found to be entrained into the melt. Slag viscosity and its thickness were found to be major variables affecting the behavior of slag entrainment. Lower the slag viscosity and thicker the slag layer, much more slag on top of the melt was entrained into the melt...|$|R
