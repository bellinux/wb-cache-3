40|$|AbstractWe {{report a}} perceptual {{phenomenon}} that originates from a nonlinear operation during the visual process, {{and we use}} these observations to study the functional organization of the responsible nonlinearity: the regulation of visual sensitivity to light. When the contrast of a high frequency grating was modulated while its spatial and temporal average luminance was kept constant, observers saw brightness changes or desaturation in the field. If the contrast was modulated periodically between zero and a peak value, observers saw vivid flicker (contrast-modulation flicker), and this flicker could be seen even when the grating was too fine to be visually resolved as a pattern. This uniform-field flicker can be nulled by a modulation of space-average luminance at the contrast-modulation frequency, with appropriate phase and modulation depth. Contrast-modulation flicker is still measurable with gratings at 100 cycles/deg. The dynamics of contrast-modulation flicker suggest that it results from an early sensitivity-controlling mechanism, acting very rapidly (within about 20 msec). Its dependence on stimulus spatial frequency implies a strictly local <b>luminance</b> <b>nonlinearity,</b> one that either resides within individual photoreceptors or operates on signals from individual receptors...|$|E
40|$|Triangular {{patterns}} {{phase shifting}} profilometry {{is a method}} of structured light whose three-dimensional reconstructions are susceptible to error from gamma distortion. In practice, the <b>luminance</b> <b>nonlinearity</b> caused by the gamma distortion effect of a digital projector and a digital camera yields undesired fringe intensity changes, which substantially reduce the measurement accuracy, and while {{the effects of the}} gamma distortion diminish with an increasing number of employed phase-shifted patterns. A gamma correction method based on the pre-coding of projected grating is proposed to reduce the measurement error caused by the gamma distortion. By applying an appropriate pre-coding value to the projected patterns, the gamma distortion effect is attenuated and the accuracy is enhanced. The linear least square is compensated the absolute coordinate residuals still existing after gamma correction. To verify the presented method in this paper, a 3 D shape measurement experimental system is constructed using digital video projector and CCD camera. The experiment results shown that, the gamma pre-coding correction reduce the maximum residuals error of absolute coordinate by 72. 2 %. After the linear least square compensation, the maximum absolute coordinate residual is only 6. 1 % of without any correction or compensation. The reconstruction surface of a complex curve surface is hardly any waviness, which is clearly noted in the reconstruction of the same tested object without any correction or compensation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} rules by which visual {{responses}} to luminous targets are combined {{across the two}} eyes. Previous work has found very different forms of binocular combination for targets defined by increments and by decrements of luminance, with decrement data implying a severe nonlinearity before binocular combination. We ask whether this difference {{is due to the}} luminance of the target, the luminance of the background, or the sign of the luminance excursion. We estimated the pre-binocular nonlinearity (power exponent) by fitting a computational model to ocular equibrightness matches. The severity of the nonlinearity had a monotonic dependence on the signed difference between target and background luminance. For dual targets, in which there was both a luminance increment and a luminance decrement (e. g. contrast), perception was governed largely by the decrement. The asymmetry in the nonlinearities derived from the subjective matching data made a clear prediction for visual performance: there should be more binocular summation for detecting luminance increments than for detecting luminance decrements. This prediction was confirmed by the results of a subsequent experiment. We discuss the relation between these results and <b>luminance</b> <b>nonlinearities</b> such as a logarithmic transform, as well as the involvement of contemporary model architectures of binocular vision...|$|R
40|$|The now {{ubiquitous}} {{nature of}} touch-screen displays in {{cell phones and}} tablet computers makes them an attractive option for vision testing outside of the laboratory or clinic. Accurate measurement of parameters such as contrast sensitivity, however, requires precise control of absolute and relative screen <b>luminances.</b> The <b>nonlinearity</b> of the display response (gamma) can be measured or checked using a minimum motion technique similar to that developed by Anstis and Cavanagh (1983) for the determination of isoluminance. While the relative luminances of the color primaries vary between subjects (due to factors such as individual differences in pre-retinal pigment densities), the gamma nonlinearity can be checked in the lab using a photometer. Here we compare results obtained using the psychophysical method with physical measurements {{for a number of}} different devices. In addition, we present a novel physical method using the device's built-in front-facing camera in conjunction with a mirror to jointly calibrate the camera and display. A high degree of consistency between devices is found, but some departures from ideal performance are observed. In spite of this, the effects of calibration errors and display artifacts on estimates of contrast sensitivity are found to be small...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the human visual system (HVS) has a {{nonlinear}} response to <b>luminance.</b> This <b>nonlinearity</b> can be quantified using the concept of just noticeable difference (JND), which represents the minimum amplitude of a specified test pattern an average observer can discern from a uniform background. The JND depends on the background luminance following a threshold versus intensity (TVI) function. It is possible to define a curve which maps physical luminances into a perceptually linearized domain. This mapping can be used to optimize a digital encoding, by minimizing the visibility of quantization noise. It is also commonly used in medical applications to display images adapting to the characteristics of the display device. High dynamic range (HDR) displays, which are beginning to appear on the market, can display luminance levels outside the range in which most standard mapping curves are defined. In particular, dual-layer LCD displays are able to extend the gamut of luminance offered by conventional liquid crystals towards the black region; in such areas suitable and HVS-compliant luminance transformations need to be determined. In this paper we propose a method, which is primarily targeted to the extension of the DICOM curve used in medical imaging, but also has a more general application. The method can be modified in order to compensate for the ambient light, which can be significantly greater than the black level of an HDR display and consequently reduce the visibility of the details in dark areas...|$|R
