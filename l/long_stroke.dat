40|$|This paper {{presents}} two {{fast and}} robust algorithms for word skew and slant corrections based on Radon transform. For the skew correction, we maximize a global measure which {{is defined by}} Radon transform of image and its gradient to estimate the slope. For the slant correction, Radon trans-form is used to estimate the <b>long</b> <b>strokes</b> and a word slant {{is measured by the}} average angle of these <b>long</b> <b>strokes.</b> Com-pared with the previous methods, these two algorithms do not require the setting of parameters heuristically. More-over, the algorithms perform well on words of short length, where the traditional methods usually fail. 1...|$|R

25|$|In the 1930s Scott {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of stationary engines {{with the aim of}} raising funds following the decline in motorcycle sales. Some of these engines were derived from motorcycle units, for instance the DSE was a watercooled version of the Lightweight Squirrel engine and the SE had the same bore and stroke dimensions as the <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> Flyers. It has come to light that the SE does not have the same bore size as the <b>Long</b> <b>Stroke</b> Flyer (73mm) but has a bore size of 78mm, this has been confirmed on two Scott SE engines. The PA stationary engine however was different. Designed to meet a Ministry requirement for a portable electrical generator for the Bofors anti-aircraft gun and its Kerrison Predictor, it was produced during the Second World War by both Scott and its former partners Jowett.|$|E
25|$|In July 1976, Ford {{introduced}} the XC Falcon, {{which was the}} first model to comply with the new pollution regulations specified under Australian Design Rule 27A. This led to locally produced Cleveland V8s and the introduction of the cross-flow (also called the X-flow) six-cylinder. Versions of this engine were produced in North America and, in various guises, used in Australian Falcons through to the XF. Its <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> and large capacity made for very good 'towing' torque, while its thick castings and relatively loose tolerances gave it a reputation for reliability in spite of abuse.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1949-50 the first {{prototype}} had both wings and fuselage strengthened after structural tests on a third, non-flying airframe. At {{about the same time}} the second prototype was fitted with a variable incidence tailplane. In 1950 this aircraft was rebuilt with a single jet outlet and swept empennage as the Hawker P.1081. [...] Its now redundant rear fuselage was then strengthened, fitted with an arrestor hook and transferred after some delay to the first prototype. [...] Now the only P.1052, it was fitted with a bullet fairing at the tailplane-fin intersection which improved its high speed behaviour. [...] In May 1952, with a <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> Sea Hawk undercarriage it undertook much delayed take-off and landing trials on board HMS Eagle. [...] In June it received its last modification, a variable incidence swept tailplane, and it flew on high speed trials with the RAE until a forced landing in September 1953 took it out of service.|$|E

6000|$|... § 6. Under these circumstances, it {{is quite}} evident that neither the pine nor {{plantain}} could have been rightly represented by a single dot or stroke of color. Still less could they be represented by a definite drawing, on a small scale, of a pine with all its branches clear, or of a plantain with all its seeds clear. The round dot or <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> would represent nothing, and the clear delineation too much. They were not mere dots of color which I saw on the hill, but something full of essence of pine; out of which I could gather which were young and which were old, and discern the distorted and crabbed pines from the symmetrical and healthy pines; and feel how the evening sun was sending its searching threads among their dark leaves;--assuredly they were more than dots of color. And yet not one of their boughs or outlines could be distinctly made out, or distinctly drawn. Therefore, if I had drawn either a definite pine, or a dot, I should have been equally wrong, the right lying in an inexplicable, almost inimitable, confusion between the two.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the efficiency and smoothness of voluntary movement in Huntington 2 ̆ 7 s disease (HD) {{by the use of}} a graphics tablet that permits analysis of movement profiles. In particular, we aimed to ascertain whether a concurrent task (digit span) would affect the kinematics of goal-directed movements. Twelve patients with HD and their matched controls performed 12 vertical zig-zag movements, with both left and right hands (with and without the concurrent task), to large or small circular targets over long or short extents. The concurrent task was associated with shorter movement times and reduced right-hand superiority. Patients with HD were overall slower, especially with <b>long</b> <b>strokes,</b> and had similar peak velocities for both small and large targets, so that controls could better accommodate differences in target size. Patients with HD spent more time decelerating, especially with small targets, whereas controls allocated more nearly equal proportions of time to the acceleration and deceleration phases of movement, especially with large targets. Short strokes were generally less force inefficient than were <b>long</b> <b>strokes,</b> especially so for either hand in either group {{in the absence of the}} concurrent task, and for the right hand in its presence. With the concurrent task, however, the left hand 2 ̆ 7 s behavior changed differentially for the two groups; for patients with HD, it became more force efficient with short strokes and even less efficient with <b>long</b> <b>strokes,</b> whereas for controls, it became more efficient with <b>long</b> <b>strokes.</b> Controls may be able to divert attention away from the inferior left hand, increasing its automaticity, whereas patients with HD, because of disease, may be forced to engage even further online visual control under the demands of a concurrent task. Patients with HD may perhaps become increasingly reliant on terminal visual guidance, which indicates an impairment in constructing and refining an internal representation of the movement necessary for its. effective execution. Basal ganglia dysfunction may impair the ability to use internally generated cues to guide movement...|$|R

6000|$|The punkah-coolies who {{pull the}} punkahs {{day and night}} came to know Garin intimately. He noticed that when the swaying fan stopped I would call out to the coolie and bid him pull with a <b>long</b> <b>stroke.</b> If the man still slept I would wake him up. He discovered, too, {{that it was a}} good thing to lie in the wave of air under the punkah. Maybe Stanley had taught him all about this in barracks. At any rate, when the punkah stopped, Garin would first growl and cock his eye at the rope, and if that did not wake the man it nearly always did--he would tiptoe forth and talk in the sleeper's ear. Vixen was a clever little dog, but she could never connect the punkah and the coolie; so Garin gave me {{grateful}} hours of cool sleep. But--he was utterly wretched--as miserable as a human being; and in his misery he clung so closely to me that other men noticed it, and were envious. If I moved from one room to another Garin followed; if my pen stopped scratching, Garm's head was thrust into my hand; if I turned, half awake, on the pillow, Garm was up and at my side, for he knew that I was his only link with his master, and day and night, and night and day, his eyes asked one question--"When is this going to end?" ...|$|E

That's the very most juvenile logic possible--and the juvenility of it (which yet in a manner touches me) is why I call you retrogressive--by way of a <b>long</b> <b>stroke</b> of endearment. There was exactly an admirable matter for you to write me about--a matter as to which you are strongly and abundantly feeling; and in a relation which lives on communication as ours surely should, and would (save for starving,) such occasions fertilise. However, of course the terms are easy on which you extract communication from me, and always have been, and always will be--so that there's doubtless {{a point of view}} from which your reservations (another fine word) are quite right. I'm glad at any rate that you've been reading Balzac (whose [...] "romantic" [...] side is rot!) and a great contemporary of your own even in his unconsidered trifles. I've just been reading Compton Mackenzie's Sinister Street and finding in it an unexpected amount of talent and life. Really a very interesting and remarkable performance, I think, in spite of a considerable, or large, element of waste and irresponsibility--selection isn't in him--and at one and the same time so extremely young (he too) and so confoundingly mature. It has the feature of improving so as it goes on, and disposes me much to read, if I can, its immediate predecessor. You must tell me again what you know of him (I've forgotten what you did tell me, more or less,) but in your own good time. I think--I mean I blindly feel--I should be with you about Auld Reekie--which somehow hasn't a right to be so handsome. But I long for illustrations--at your own good time. We have emerged from a very clear and quiet Xmas--quiet for me, save for rather a large assault of correspondence. It weighs on me still, so this is what I call--and you will too--very brief....
