50|$|James Curry, (born October 26, 1957) was a {{defensive}} tackle who played seven <b>seasons</b> <b>in</b> the Canadian Football League. He won Grey Cups in 1983 with the Toronto Argonauts and 1989 with the Saskatchewan Roughriders--his first and <b>last</b> <b>seasons</b> <b>in</b> the league.|$|R

5|$|In his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> {{the major}} leagues, {{he played for}} the Spiders, widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the worst teams in MLB history. After his baseball career, he returned to his hometown of Ashland. He worked for the area coal mines as a brewery wagon driver and carpenter, and died there at 62 years of age.|$|E
5|$|As Napoli {{qualified}} for the UEFA Champions League by their league position, Fiorentina as runners-up {{qualified for}} the Group Stage of the 201415 UEFA Europa League.

5|$|Despite the scare {{over his}} back complaint, Miller {{returned}} from New Zealand {{to play in}} the 1946 season, {{which turned out to be}} his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the few players to play at the highest levels of both cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E

5|$|During {{their five}} years in the top division, Maribor played a total of 166matches and {{achieved}} 40wins, 57draws and 69defeats, with a goal difference of 166–270. Maribor's highest league position was in the 1969–70 season when the club finished in 10th place in an 18-club league. The average league placement of the club in Yugoslav top flight was 13.8. The 1971–72 season was their <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> top division as the team finished last with 20points. Mladen Kranjc, one of the best players in history of the club, was the best goalscorer for the team in each of its five seasons spent in the Yugoslav top division, having scored a total of 54league goals, which eventually led to his transfer to one of the top Yugoslav clubs, Dinamo Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Giovinco was {{promoted}} to the first team during the 2006–07 season and also played his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> the Primavera squad. His professional debut came on 12 May 2007, in the Serie B match against Bologna; he came on as a substitute in place of Raffaele Palladino, and marked his first appearance with an assist for David Trezeguet's tap-in. Since then, he had been tipped to be Alessandro Del Piero's heir in the creative number 10 role behind the main striker, known as the trequartista, rifinitore, or fantasista, in Italian. Juventus won the Serie B title that season, earning promotion to Serie A the following season.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's first stadium was Malmö IP, {{which was}} shared with arch-rivals IFK Malmö. The team played {{here from the}} {{founding}} of the club in 1910, until 1958. The stadium still exists today, albeit with lower capacity, and is now used by women's team FC Rosengård, who were previously the women's section of Malmö FF. Capacity in 2012 is 7,600, but attendances were usually much higher when Malmö FF played there. For the <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> 1957, the average attendance was 15,500. The club's record attendance at Malmö IP is 22,436 against Helsingborgs IF on 1 June 1956. The stadium is still considered {{a key part of the}} club's history, as it was here that the club were founded, played their first 47 seasons, and won five Swedish championships.|$|E

5|$|The Nashville Baseball Club {{was formed}} as a charter member of the newly {{organized}} Class B Southern Association in 1901. The team did not receive their official moniker, the Nashville Volunteers, until 1908. However, the team was, and is, {{commonly referred to as}} the Vols. Their <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Association was 1961. After sitting out the 1962 season, the Vols returned for a final season {{as a part of the}} South Atlantic League in 1963. Over their 62-year existence, the Vols competed at four class levels: Class B (1901), Class A (1902–1935), Class A1 (1936–1945), and Double-A (1946–1961, 1963). They served as a farm club for eight major league teams.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies chose Capel in the 24th {{round of}} the 1980 MLB draft, but Capel did not sign with the team: instead, he opted to attend the University of Texas. Capel played on the 1982 USA College All-Star Team, which competed in the Amateur World Series in Seoul and placed third. The next year, Capel and the Texas Longhorns won the College World Series. After he was drafted by the Cubs, Capel left Texas and signed to play {{professional}} baseball; he played in six seasons of minor league baseball before he made his MLB debut in 1988. Capel spent the entire 1989 season in Triple-A, one level below the majors, but the Cubs released him {{at the end of}} the year. He agreed to terms with the Brewers and played in MLB after an injury opened a spot on Milwaukee's roster, but was again released {{at the end of the}} season. A free agent, the Astros signed Capel, and over the course of the season he pitched in 25 games for the team. He spent the final part of his career in the Astros farm system, and after he made the 1992 Triple-A All-Star team, Capel played his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> 1993. After retirement, Capel worked as the general manager of a car dealership in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season saw Milan {{dominate the}} league. Milan {{played host to}} Genoa on 25 September 2010, with Pirlo providing a lifted ball {{over the top of}} the defence to set striker Zlatan Ibrahimović free to score the solitary goal of the game. On 2 October, Pirlo scored a 40-yard goal against Parma to give Milan their first away win of the 2010–11 season. On 14 May 2011, Pirlo appeared in his last match for Milan, coming on as a half-time substitute for Massimo Ambrosini as the club celebrated their Serie A title with a 4–1 victory over Cagliari. Four days later, Pirlo confirmed that he would be leaving Milan at the end of the 2010–11 season, after a mutual decision not to renew his contract. In his <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> Milan, Pirlo appeared in the league just 17 times under manager Massimiliano Allegri, notching just one goal and three assists, winning his second Serie A title with Milan that season, also reaching the round of 16 in the Champions League, and in the Coppa Italia semi-final.|$|E
5|$|York City {{went without}} an {{official}} manager from their formation in May 1922 until {{the appointment of}} Jock Collier in July 1928. Collier initially joined as player-manager, but was forced to retire from playing due to a broken ankle after two matches. He was in charge for York's <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> the Midland League before their election to the Football League in June 1929. Collier oversaw the club's successful transition from non-League football to Third Division North, but left the club in May 1930 to become a publican. George Sherrington combined his duties as club secretary with that of manager {{for the next three}} years, before Collier was reappointed manager in May 1933. With results at a low ebb, he helped York establish themselves in the Football League, and led them to the fourth round of the 1936–37 FA Cup. In March 1937, Collier retired from football to go into business with his brother. Former player Tom Mitchell was appointed, and in his first full season led York to the quarter-final of the 1937–38 FA Cup.|$|E
5|$|For 1924–25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve {{teams from}} the competition. York {{finished}} sixth in the Principal Competition that concluded in February 1925 and were runners-up to Denaby United in the North Subsidiary Competition. The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity of the directors. John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds {{for the first time}} this season, being beaten 2–1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928–29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's <b>last</b> <b>season</b> <b>in</b> the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North.|$|E
