5|$|The barn {{was briefly}} in royal {{ownership}} but {{passed into the}} hands of three families who continued to use it for agricultural purposes until as late as the 1970s. It was subsequently owned by a property development company which redeveloped the farm complex. After the company went bankrupt in 2006, the barn was bought by property speculators betting on its compensation value if the nearby Heathrow Airport was expanded. The barn fell into disrepair and was closed to the public for all but one day a year. English Heritage stepped in, using a rare <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> to carry out repairs without the owner's consent, and eventually purchased the barn in January 2012. It is now open to the public from April to October on the second and fourth Sunday of each month under the management of the Friends of the Great Barn group.|$|E

25|$|By {{the twelfth}} and early thirteenth centuries, {{there was a}} shift away from the accusatorial model toward the <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> used in the Roman Empire.

Under inquisitorial procedures, guilt or innocence was proved by the inquiry (inquisitio) of the judge {{into the details of}} a case.|$|E
25|$|Although al-Husseini {{had been}} removed from the Supreme Muslim Council and other {{administrative}} roles by the British government in 1937, they did not remove him from the post of mufti of Jerusalem.

Traditionally, in the Anglophone West only women do so, but in rare instances men may change their last names upon marriage as well.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2008 coup, the {{military}} government of Mauritania faced severe international sanctions and internal unrest. Amnesty International accused it of practicing coordinated torture against criminal and political detainees. Amnesty has accused the Mauritanian legal system, {{both before and after}} the 2008 coup, of functioning with complete disregard for <b>legal</b> <b>procedure,</b> fair trial, or humane imprisonment. The organization has said that the Mauritanian government has practiced institutionalized and continuous use of torture throughout its post-independence history, under all its leaders.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the first}} freedom suits, court cases in the British Isles to {{challenge}} the legality of slavery, took place in Scotland in 1755 and 1769. The cases were Montgomery v. Sheddan (1755) and Spens v. Dalrymple (1769). Each of the slaves had been baptized in Scotland and challenged the legality of slavery. They set the precedent of <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> in British courts that would later lead to successful outcomes for the plaintiffs. In these cases, deaths of the plaintiff and defendant, respectively, brought an end before court decisions.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{transformation}} of disputes {{is not a}} simple process. The theory of filtering deems that during each stage of formation and {{transformation of}} disputes, the existence of various social mechanisms helps filter through a large number of cases until the dispute ends (Galanter 1983). In other words, not all disputes that are brought to the court through legal means will become formal cases. Through case filings, many disputes are disqualified and only a few will successfully be identified as cases (Ran 2005). Meanwhile, the original characteristics of disputes are diluted or filtered down following multiple <b>legal</b> <b>procedures.</b> Some studies describe this procedure as a “drying mechanism”: <b>legal</b> <b>procedures</b> function as a fast rotating dryer that dehydrates extra “water” (items irrelevant to <b>legal</b> <b>procedures,</b> e.g., morals, habits, or experience) and dress up a dispute with a legal coat (Guo 2013; Liu 2014).|$|R

In the papers of the original application (dated from July 1966) for reactor 1 the tubes were separated from each other. But in the blueprints submitted in October 1967, the two tubes were connected with each other outside the reactor vessel. TEPCO apparently changed the design without notifying NISA, in violation of <b>legal</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the origins}} of the law that one can see in the Cities of Refuge, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that early forms of <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> were {{grounded}} in vengeance. Roman law and German law started from the blood feud, which led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off. Holmes reported that in Anglo-Saxon practice, the feud was pretty well broken up by the time of William the Conqueror. The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson, and then the legal actions now familiar to lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Since 1996, it {{has been}} {{possible}} {{for someone who has}} gone through sex reassignment surgery to legally change their sex in their official documents. However, the law governing the ability of transgender persons to change their identity is vague and incomplete, resulting in inconsistency in judicial practice concerning legal recognition of gender identity. In some cases authorities denied recognition of a change in identity unless a sex-reassignment intervention had occurred. Because of the difficult <b>legal</b> <b>procedure</b> for gender recognition, it is often impossible for transgender persons to get documents reflecting their gender identity, which leads to difficulties in all services requiring identity documents (health care, transportation passes, banking services).|$|E

25|$|After {{evaluating}} {{the law and}} Snowden's situation, the French interior ministry rejected his request for asylum. Poland refused to process his application {{because it did not}} conform to <b>legal</b> <b>procedure.</b> Brazil's Foreign Ministry said the government planned no response to Snowden's asylum request. Germany, Finland and India rejected Snowden's application outright, while Austria, Ecuador, Norway, Italy, Netherlands and Spain said he must be on their territory to apply. In November 2014, Germany announced that Snowden had not renewed his previously denied request and was not being considered for asylum. Glenn Greenwald later reported that Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor of Germany, told him the U.S. government had threatened to stop sharing intelligence if Germany offered Snowden asylum or arranged for his travel there.|$|E
25|$|Judges {{must be able}} to {{research}} and process extensive lengths of documents and other case material, understand complex cases and possess a thorough understanding of the law and <b>legal</b> <b>procedure,</b> which requires excellent skills in logical reasoning, analysis and decision-making. Excellent writing skills are also a necessity, given the finality and authority of the documents written. Judges work with people all the time; {{by the nature of the}} job, good dispute resolution and interpersonal skills are a necessity. Judges are required to have good moral character, i.e. there must be no history of crime.
