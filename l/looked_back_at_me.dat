2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

60|$|Limping Lucy steadied {{herself on}} her crutch and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> over her shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Up he came, whom Charlotte welcomed very demurely, and so left us, {{saying that}} she must go about her {{household}} business; but as she departed she cast a <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> making a [...] "moue," [...] as the French say, with her red lips.|$|R
60|$|The {{carriage}} drove away, and Demetria's eyes, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> {{were filled}} with tears, but in Señor Villaverde's eyes, also glancing back, there was an expression that boded ill for my future. His feeling was natural, perhaps, for he {{was the father of}} two very pretty girls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Cheeko's brother kept {{creeping}} nearer and {{nearer to}} the edge of the thorns, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> every once in a while, as if believing I'd be scared out of my wits because he was so venturesome; but I never opened my mouth and finally he said with a flirt of his tail: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{strained}} my eyes; I {{looked and}} looked. And the blank white paper <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> quite distressed. Tears rose at once {{into her}} eyes with true Celtic suddenness.|$|E
60|$|On {{a sudden}} I set the portmanteaus {{to the ground}} and halted. He turned and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sometimes I {{stand for}} hours and peer at my face and wonder at it. At times I turn it upside down and gaze intently at it. I try to think what it means. It seems to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with its great brown eyes as if it knew me and wanted to speak to me.|$|R
60|$|At this signal, {{the little}} elephant, with a dexterity that {{was next to}} marvellous in so small an animal, whisked the chair round with Mr. Omer in it, and rattled it off, pell-mell, into the parlour, without {{touching}} the door-post: Mr. Omer indescribably enjoying the performance, and <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> on the road {{as if it were}} the triumphant issue of his life's exertions.|$|R
60|$|Nagaski sprang {{upon his}} mistress' lap, and {{his was the}} only {{farewell}} I received as the carriage drove away. His upper lip was drawn back over his red gums; there was something fiendish and uncanny in his snarl, and the hatred which shone from his tiny black eyes. I watched the carriage until it disappeared. He had not moved. He was still <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{the edge}} of the sea the {{creature}} paused and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> Then she slid sinuously into the surf.|$|E
60|$|The refined {{features}} of Lesage {{made me look}} towards him as to a possible protector, but his large dark eyes were as cold and hard as jet as he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{led the way}} to the sitting-room. I had a new interest, now, {{in going}} back. Still, Lucilla's {{behavior}} hung on my mind. Suppose she treated me with renewed coldness and keener contempt? I remained standing at the table in the hall. Nugent <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> over his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "My little Pansy! I put my own sorrow {{into your}} baby soul, {{and now it}} <b>looks</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with this strange wistfulness, and these great drops are the unsubmissive tears I locked up in my heart because I would not be {{grateful}} for the good gift God gave me, even while he took that other one away. O Baby, forgive your mother; and don't let her find that she has given you clouds instead of sunshine." ...|$|R
5000|$|Robinson {{expressed}} regret {{at the way}} he had squandered {{the money}} he made from football stating [...] "I <b>look</b> <b>back</b> and wish I'd bought a house and ended up with something to show for my career" [...] but accepted that it was his own decisions that led to his failure to fulfill his footballing potential saying [...] "I haven't quite hit the heights I should have. But the only person to blame is the idiot <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in the mirror." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Flood's debut album, The Ballad of K.B. {{appeared}} in 1999. Tim Badrick of Lost Treasures {{felt that it}} was [...] "jammed packed full of The Flood's unique amalgam of country, rock, blues and even a dash of boogie piano, be that unintentional or not." [...] The tracks were mostly written by Bennett with some co-written by Bennett, Gillard, Bligh and Collins. The lead track was released as the title track on an extended play, Don't <b>Look</b> <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>Me</b> (1999).|$|R
6000|$|He {{remained}} perplexed for a moment, as {{if trying}} to understand; and then his weighty: [...] "Certainly, certainly, Captain," [...] seemed to be the outcome of some sudden thought. His big chest heaved. Was it a sigh? As he went out to hurry off those potatoes he never <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|It {{is entirely}} beyond {{my power to}} {{describe}} the tone in which he made that reply. I can only declare that it struck me dumb for the moment. I drew a step nearer to him. With vague misgivings in me, I looked him searchingly in the face. He <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> without shrinking.|$|E
60|$|Something of the {{bitterness}} that I felt may have communicated itself to my voice. At {{the first words}} of my reply, her eyes, which had been turned away the moment before, <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> unwillingly. She answered in a low tone, with a sullen submission of manner which was quite new in my experience of her.|$|E
6000|$|Presently {{he ran to}} my canoe, sprang {{upon the}} gunwale, jumped back again, and ran along the log as before to {{where he had been}} digging. He did it again, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and saying plainly: [...] "Come here; come and look." [...] I stepped out of the canoe to the old log, whereupon Meeko went off into a fit of terrible excitement.--I was bigger than he expected; I had only two legs; kut-e-k'chuck, kut-e-k'chuck! whit, whit, whit, kut-e-k'chuck! ...|$|R
60|$|The man obeyed my directions, but so clumsily as {{to excite}} their suspicions. We {{had been driving}} after them about three minutes (returning along the road by which we had advanced) when I looked {{out of the window}} to see how far they might be ahead of us. As I did this, I saw two hats popped out of the windows of their cab, and two faces <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I sank into my place in a cold sweat; the {{expression}} is coarse, but no other form of words can describe my condition at that trying moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "And me!" [...] Kea cried, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> appealingly, for {{she headed}} our little hasty procession. [...] "What's to become of me? Of me, who have brought {{it all by}} my sin upon you! Of me, for whose sake Pélé is so angry! Of me, who roused her wrath by {{stealing}} away her victim! Leave me here to die! Kalaua is dead! My people are swallowed! I meant myself to die in their place, but you wouldn't let me! Leave me here to perish! If you don't leave me, Pélé in her anger will pursue you {{on your way to}} the sea itself, {{to the foot of the}} mountain!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{found her}} {{at the head of}} the sofa, when I returned. She was just {{touching}} his forehead with her lips. I shook my head as soberly as I could, and pointed to her chair. She <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a bright smile, and a charming colour in her face. [...] "You would have done it," [...] she whispered, [...] "in my place!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I bade them good-bye. He did me the honour {{of coming}} {{with me to the}} door. We could neither of us find a word to say, though we were both moved. When at last I held his hand and was looking at him as I said [...] "Good-bye", he <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> for the first time during our meeting. His eyes were heavy and as he lifted them to me, seemed to recoil in an agony of shame.|$|E
60|$|I looked up. The child <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with its}} radiant smile, and pointed eastward {{down the river}} toward the distant sea. While my eyes were still fixed on the softly glowing figure, I saw it fade away upward and upward into the higher light, as the lark vanishes upward and upward in the morning sky. I was alone again with my earthly fellow-beings--left with no clew to guide me but the remembrance of the child's hand {{pointing}} eastward to the distant sea.|$|E
60|$|Cleopatra {{placed her}} hands {{behind her head}} and, leaning <b>back,</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with half-shut eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I?" [...] Aunt Emma answered, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> appealingly. [...] "The {{circumstances}} were too suspicious. As it was, everybody was running after {{the young man}} in knickerbockers. Nobody took any notice of a little old lady in a long grey dust-cloak. But if once I'd confessed and shown my wounded hand, who would ever have believed I'd {{nothing to do with the}} murder?--except you, perhaps, Una. Oh no: I came back here to my own home as fast as ever I could; for I was really ill. I took to my bed at once. And as nobody called me to give evidence at the inquest, I said nothing to anybody." ...|$|R
40|$|Our House" {{interprets the}} world as I see it; not just a world of places or events, but one filled with people. When I {{interact}} with the people I photograph, our eyes connect and we exchange stories. The {{men and women in}} the photographs <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> and, as a result, at the viewer; and their stories exist as ambient sounds within the exhibition. The presentation is loosely structured and incorporates as much variation as possible while maintaining a broader cohesive style. This reflects my need for freedom in a world that is largely conditioned by implicit conventions. A sense of freedom, and a sense of real people form the theme that is my experience of the world we live in...|$|R
60|$|I {{was lying}} {{in the shade of}} the {{enclosure}} wall, staring out to sea, when I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel, and starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking into my face. He had long since lost speech and active movement, and the lank hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws more askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my attention, went a little way towards the bushes and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} him into the street watching his thick square form, of which even the back seemed to express sullen anger and determination. At a distance of a few yards stood the brother of the dead man, Mr. Selby, talking to Dr. Jeffries, one of whom made some remark that caught Sir John's ear. He stopped as though to answer, then, changing his mind, turned his head and <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> My sight is good and I could see his face clearly; on it was a look of malignity that was not pleasant to behold.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{acknowledged}} to you, Mr. Sherwin, that I have found means {{to speak to}} your daughter--to speak to her twice. I made my advances honourably. She received them with a modesty and a reluctance worthy of herself, worthy of any lady, the highest lady in the land." [...] (Mr. Sherwin looked round reverentially to his print of the Queen; then <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> and bowed solemnly.) [...] "Now, although {{in so many words}} she directly discouraged me--it is her due that I should say this--still, I think I may without vanity venture to hope that she did so as a matter of duty, more than as a matter of inclination." ...|$|E
6000|$|That night I hardly {{closed my}} eyes in sleep. My leg, which for several days had {{scarcely}} pained me, became troublesome once more {{with a sort of}} violent twitching neuralgic rheumatism. Never before had I felt anything so curiously spasmodic. I had tossed about during the evening indeed a great deal more than usual, and Kalaua, who noted my discomfort with his keen and observant Hawaiian glance, asked me more than once how I felt, with apparent kindliness. I told him my symptoms in perfect frankness. [...] "Aha," [...] he cried grimly, <b>looking</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a smile. [...] "That settles the matter. We shall have an eruption then. The old-time folk in heathen days always noticed that all neuralgic and rheumatic pains became far more severe when an eruption was brewing." ...|$|R
60|$|For a long moment, {{while his}} keen eye seemed {{to look through}} and through me, he never moved a muscle. One could easily have passed over him, {{thinking}} him {{only one of the}} gray, wave-washed roots on the shore. Then he humped himself together, in that indescribably awkward way that all herons have {{at the beginning of their}} flight, slanted heavily up to the highest tree on the shore, and stopped for a longer period on a dead branch to <b>look</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> I had not moved so much as an eyelid; nevertheless he saw me too plainly to trust me. Again he humped himself, rose high over the tree-tops and bore away in strong, even, graceful flight for a lonelier lake, where there was no man to watch or bother him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, not farewell," [...] {{she whispered}} <b>back,</b> <b>looking</b> up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with {{eyes that were}} full of tears, though what she meant I did not know.|$|R
