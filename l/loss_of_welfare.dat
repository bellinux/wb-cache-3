The usual definition corresponds to no economically interesting magnitude in general equilibrium. The effective rate of protection for a sector is redefined here as the uniform tariff which {{is equivalent to the}} actual differentiated tariff structure in its effect on rents to residual claimants in the sector. The new ERP permits a political economic ranking of across sectors, since higher uniform tariff equivalents imply higher <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> sacrificed to interest groups. The new ERP converges to the old ERP under a very special set of assumption, and elsewhere generalizes the ERP concept to any economic structure in which residual claims are defined.

They can choose neighborhoods with high levels of public goods or a high proportion of blacks, but very few neighborhoods combine both, a fact we document clearly. In the face of this constraint, we conjecture that racial sorting may dramatically lower the consumption of local public goods by high-SES blacks. To shed light on this, we estimate a model of residential sorting using unusually detailed restricted Census microdata, then use the estimated preferences to simulate a counterfactual world in which racial factors play no role in household residential location decisions. Results from this exercise provide the first evidence that sorting {{on the basis of race}} gives rise to significant reductions in the consumption of local public goods by black and high-SES black {{households in}} particular. These consumption effects lead to significant <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> and are likely to have important intergenerational implications. ...|$|R

The author compares the living conditions of working people, the forms and conditions of labor markets {{and the state of}} enterprises {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century as essential causes of the trade unions rise with the present situation and {{deals with the}} question, whether the differences are so essential that society could and should renounce the functions of trade unions without causing <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>welfare.</b> He argues that the improvement of the economic and social circumstances during the 20 th century would not justify restrictions of trade union activities. Without trade unions monopsonistic and oligopsonistic forms of labor markets would revive, the wage level would fall. The capitalistic state of factories and enterprises has not changed essentially. Therefore the countervailing power of trade unions seems useful in relation to distributions policy as well as to protecting the workers rights. Trade unions are organizations, which have improved the position of workers in the labor markets and within the factories.
