In 1856, working with the publisher Uoya Eikichi, he created a series of luxury edition prints, made with the finest printing techniques including true gradation of color, the addition of mica to lend a unique iridescent effect, embossing, fabric printing, blind printing, {{and the use of}} glue printing (wherein ink is mixed with glue for a glittery effect). Hiroshige pioneered the use of the vertical format in <b>landscape</b> <b>printing</b> in his series Famous Views of the Sixty-odd Provinces. One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (issued serially between 1856 and 1859) was immensely popular. The set was published posthumously and some prints had not been completed [...] he had created over 100 on his own, but two were added by Hiroshige II after his death.|$|E

It is variably known as Statement, Stationery, Memo, Half Letter, Half A (from ANSI sizes) or simply Half Size. Like the similar-sized ISO A5, it is used for everything from personal letter writing to official aeronautical maps. Organizers, notepads, and diaries also often use this size of paper; thus 3-ring binders are also available in this size. Booklets of this size are created using word processing tools with <b>landscape</b> <b>printing</b> in two columns on letter paper which are then cut or folded into the final size.|$|E

40|$|Throughout its history, the {{resilience}} of Japanese culture has allowed it to selectively absorb and transform outside influences, so that its own traditions are maintained and enriched. Of these influences, China and the West {{have been the most}} significant. This characteristic of Japanese culture is apparent in the traditional genre of landscape painting, of which late Edo period ukiyo-e <b>landscape</b> <b>prints</b> are a part. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the <b>landscape</b> <b>prints</b> of the ukiyo-e artists Katsushika Hokusai (1760  1849) and Utagawa Hiroshige (1797  1858) represent the synthesis of traditional landscape painting and Western realism into a reinvigorated Japanese expression, as these artists created what were in effect 3 -D versions of traditional landscape scenes...|$|R

50|$|The series' use of colour {{differs from}} other <b>landscape</b> <b>prints</b> {{of the time}} with richly overprinted shades and an unusual palette of yellow, green and varying red pigments.

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} half of the nineteenth century, landscapes had “eclipsed” bijinga, shunga and kabuki-e as the major strain of ukiyo-e.

5000|$|Even {{though the}} Hōeidō edition {{is by far}} the best known, The Fifty-Three Stations of the Tōkaidō was such a popular subject that it led Hiroshige to create some 30 {{different}} series of woodcut prints on it, all very different one from the other by their size (ōban or chuban), their designs or even their number (some series include just a few prints). [...] The Hōeidō edition of the Tōkaidō is Hiroshige's best known work, and the best sold ever ukiyo-e Japanese prints. Coming just after Hokusai's Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji series, it established this new major theme of ukiyo-e, the <b>landscape</b> <b>print,</b> or fūkei-ga, with a special focus on [...] "famous views" [...] (meisho). These <b>landscape</b> <b>prints</b> took full advantage of the new possibilities offered by the Western representation of perspective, that Japanese artists had by now fully assimilated. Hiroshige's series met with full success, not only in Japan, but later in Western countries.|$|R

50|$|In 1616, he drew several {{scenes of}} Haarlem {{as a series}} of 26 <b>landscape</b> <b>prints.</b> The success of this venture led him to expand it thirty years later to 60 prints, most of which are in the {{possession}} of the North Holland Archives.

Artists such as Kawase Hasui (1883-1957) produced dreamlike qualities in their prints, yearning for rural roots and the warm wooden architecture that was disappearing in urban Tokyo.|$|R
