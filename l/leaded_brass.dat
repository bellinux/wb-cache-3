Federal legislation known as Federal Public Law 111-380 or the [...] "Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act" [...] a.k.a.

National requirements allow for standard <b>leaded</b> <b>brass</b> to be installed up until January 4, 2014. However, these products will be non-compliant and obsolete as of January 4, 2014 and may not be grandfathered for continued use. The law requires pipes, pipe fittings, and plumbing fittings or fixtures, intended to convey or dispense water for human consumption through drinking or cooking, to meet the new “lead-free” definition. Additionally, any other end-use devices intended to convey or dispense water for human consumption through drinking or cooking must meet the new lead-free requirement.

40|$|In this {{research}} investigation, the lubricated wear behavior of <b>leaded</b> αβ <b>brass</b> sliding against stainless steel counterface was studied {{with the aid}} of a pin-on-disk apparatus. The main objective of this work was to study the effect of aqueous based environments on the interface and tribological characteristics of this tribosystem, as in several cases the formation of a thin corrosion product layer can act as a lubricating film, decreasing the coefficient of friction of the tribosystem. Thus distilled water and 3. 5 % NaCl solutions were used as possible lubricants and were then compared with a commercial SAE 80 W lubricant, which is extensively used in many light and heavy-duty, automotive, commercial or industrial applications. From the experimental results obtained, Stribeck curves for each lubricative environment were exacted and analyzed. In addition, by evaluating changes in the coefficient of friction of the tribosystem in accordance with the observed wear mechanisms, the characteristic lubrication regimes (elastodynamic, mixed and boundary) were identified in these curves. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

Finding the underlying mechanism of failure and developing a cost effective solution to the problem became paramount in terms of both product quality and rapidly increasing production cost.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the modes of {{production}} and the sources of metal supply for Migration period bow brooches, concentrating on a single form, the Anglian cruciform brooch. The thesis is in two volumes; text and bibliography (volume 1), catalogues, tables, illustrations (volume 2). The text is in six chapters. Attitudes to artefact studies are briefly discussed in Chapter 1 and the techniques employed {{in this study are}} outlined. Chapter 2 places the cruciform brooch forms into a simple hierarchical typology by formal similarity. A relative chronology is gained by contextual evidence, with absolute dates given by associations with other artefact types. Similarities between early English and continental forms are shown to be adequate to suggest importation, {{during the first half of}} the fifth century. Frisian and north German brooches have a special place in this system. Parallel stylistic development persisted during the second half of the fifth century but sixth-century English brooches are well distinguished from their continental contemporaries. Simple brooch types are thought to have had a long period of production and use. By examining methods of casting and assembling cruciform brooches, Chapter 3 establishes the types and ranges of technical variation observable. Some of these technical attributes provide links between England, Frisia, northern Germany and Denmark. English brooch manufacture is diverse throughout the period under study. Norwegian metalworkers developped a very different style and the technical evidence suggests a movement towards standardisation and mass production. In Chapter 4 we discover the types of alloy used and discuss the likely sources. Initially the alloys used were <b>leaded</b> <b>brasses</b> or bronzes. By the sixth century, copper alloys were commonly very impure. It is suggested that recycling provided a major part of the raw materials for cast copper alloys. Imports of copper alloys from France or the Celtic regions of Britain are relegated to a position of minor importance. The chemical compositions of Norwegian, Frisian, north German and Dutch cruciform brooches demonstrates access to high-tin, high-purity bronzes prevailed throughout the period. Brasses and mixed alloys were also available, probably originating from scrap. With the exception of Frisia, which appears to be more similar to Kent, alloy supplies were similar throughout the Scandinavian and continental cruciform brooch production. Chapter 5 provides a synthesis for these findings. Plans are given for a project extension into other regions (Chapter 6). </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of {{lead to the}} copper alloys increases its machinability and reducesthe overall production cost, despite copper being expensive, which makes achallenging task to replace lead. But the alarming effects of lead on human healthand the recycling problems {{has led to the}} increase in concern forreducing/eliminating the use of lead in brass and other copper alloys. Manymaterials are considered to replace lead in brass; silicon is one such alternative. The turned brass sample are investigated using the state of the artequipments at Halmstad University. The results obtained are controlled readingsof surface parameters and is categorized using surface imaging and mappingsoftware, Mountains Map. This thesis characterizes the lead and the lead free brass's surfaceintegrity for a certain cutting data. The study deals with the evaluation ofselection of appropriate surface integrity parameters and summarizes theappropriate combination of cutting data to maintain the surface of the ecobrass/unleaded brass on par with the <b>leaded</b> <b>brass</b> surface. The 2 D and 3 Dsurface parameters illustrates the surface functionality and its effect on thematerial in contact.

40|$|Brass has an {{attractive}} combination of properties, namely, good corrosion resistance, good wear properties, and high thermal and electrical conductivity.

40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{behavior of}} copper alloys cast in permanent molds was investigated. This {{is one of the}} least studied subjects in copper alloy castings. Grain refinement is not widely practiced for leaded copper alloys cast in sand molds. Aluminum bronzes and high strength yellow brasses, cast in sand and permanent molds, were usually fine grained due to the presence of more than 2 % iron. Grain refinement of the most common permanent mold casting alloys, <b>leaded</b> yellow <b>brass</b> and its lead-free replacement EnviroBrass III, is not universally accepted due to the perceived problem of hard spots in finished castings and for the same reason these alloys contain very low amounts of iron. The yellow brasses and Cu-Si alloys are gaining popularity in North America due to their low lead content and amenability for permanent mold casting. These alloys are prone to hot tearing in permanent mold casting. Grain refinement is one of the solutions for reducing this problem. However, to use this technique it is necessary to understand the mechanism of grain refinement and other issues involved in the process. The following issues were studied during this three year project funded by the US Department of Energy and the copper casting industry: (1) Effect of alloying additions on the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys and their interaction with grain refiners; (2) Effect of two grain refining elements, boron and zirconium, on the grain size of four copper alloys, yellow brass, EnviroBrass II, silicon brass and silicon bronze and the duration of their effect (fading); (3) Prediction of grain refinement using cooling curve analysis and use of this method as an on-line quality control tool; (4) Hard spot formation in yellow brass and EnviroBrass due to grain refinement; (5) Corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys; (6) Transfer the technology to permanent mold casting foundries; It was found that alloying elements such as tin and zinc do not change the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys. Aluminum promoted b phase formation and modified the grain structure from dendritic to equiaxed. Lead or bismuth reduces the size of grains, but not change the morphology of the structure in Cu-Zn alloys. The grain size of the Cu-Zn-alloy can be reduced from 3000 mm to 300 mm after the addition of aluminum and lead. Similar effects were observed in EnviroBrass III after the addition of aluminum and bismuth. Boron refined the structure of yellow brasses in the presence of iron. At least 50 ppm of iron and 3 ppm of boron are necessary to cause grain refinement in these alloys. Precipitation of iron from the melt is identified as the cause of grain refinement. Boron initiates the precipitation of iron which could not be explained at this time. On the other hand zirconium causes some reduction in grain size in all four alloys investigated. The critical limit for the zirconium was found to be around 100 ppm below which not much refinement could be observed. The mechanism of grain refinement in the presence of zirconium could not be explained. Grain refinement by boron and iron can remain {{over a long period of}} time, at least for 72 hours of holding or after remelting few times. It is necessary to have the iron and boron contents above the critical limits mentioned earlier. On the other hand, refinement by zirconium is lost quite rapidly, some times within one hour of holding, mostly due to the loss of zirconium, most probably by oxidation, from the melt. In all the cases it is possible to revive the refinement by adding more of the appropriate refining element. Cooling curve analysis (thermal analysis) can be used successfully to predict the grain refinement in yellow brasses. The precipitation of iron in the liquid metal causes the metal to solidify without undercooling. Absence of this reaction, as indicated by the time-temperature (t-T) and its first derivative (dt/dT) curves, proved to be an indicator of refinement. The viability of the technique as an on-line quality control tool was proved in two foundries. The method can also correctly predict the onset of fading. The corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys was measured in two solutions having different hydrogen activities, pH 6 and pH 8, and compared with the base alloys. Potentiodynamic polarization and long term weight loss experiments were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance. Cu-Zn alloys were evaluated for dezincification. In general, the grain refined alloys performed marginally better than the base alloys...|$|R
40|$|In this project, {{graphite}} {{is used as}} {{a substitute}} for lead {{in order to maintain the}} machinability of plumbing components at the level of <b>leaded</b> <b>brass.</b> Graphite dispersed in Cu alloy was observed to impart good machinability and reduce the sizes of chips during machining of plumbing components in a manner similar to lead. Copper alloys containing dispersed graphite particles could be successfully cast in several plumbing fixtures which exhibited acceptable corrosion rate, solderability, platability, and pressure tightness. The power consumption for machining of composites was also lower than that of the matrix alloy. In addition, centrifugally cast copper alloy cylinders containing graphite particles were successfully made. These cylinders can therefore be used for bearing applications, as substitutes for lead-containing copper alloys.

30|$|Compositional {{differences}} are expected for artefacts {{depending on their}} functional characteristics. However, observed wide variations in elemental concentrations are most likely attributable to common and time extended recycling practices of scrap metal. Similar compositional ranges have been previously reported on Roman British objects from the 3 rd and 4 th centuries CE [21]. This contrasted with previous centuries where lower amounts of leaded bronze or <b>leaded</b> <b>brass</b> were observed and unleaded brasses and bronzes were more prevalent. Increased alloying with lead during the later stages of the Roman Empire has also been reported for objects having a unique function (e.g. statuary) [22]. Given {{that the majority of}} retrieved objects are most likely reflecting the later phases of site occupation it can be hypothesized that rather than the specific physical properties of leaded alloys determining the choice of their use, the large compositional variation resulted from difficulties in accessing alternative metals during the 3 rd century CE. This hypothesis is framed within the unstable political and economic situation of the Roman Empire during the 3 rd century CE.|$|E

The object, recovered from burial in the Tiber riverbed in Italy, has been characterised from a morphological, chemical and microstructural point of view. The artefact probably originates from a Roman brass coin or medal and the alloy substrate was identified as a <b>leaded</b> <b>brass</b> (85 % copper, 12. 8 % zinc and 2. 2 % lead). A combination of XRF, SEM coupled with EDS spot analyses and elemental mapping, Raman spectroscopy and OM observations were employed in order to describe the corrosion processes that created the heterogeneous, multi-layer corrosion product stratification. The identification of copper sulphide layers and the precipitation of some, rarely reported, basic copper and zinc phosphates are among the most important findings of this work. Two phases of anaerobic and aerobic corrosion emerged from the analyses. The object has undergone dezincification at early stages and decuprification later on. However, the most crucial action was the environmental elements activity, which determined the corrosion rate {{and the nature of the}} corrosion product layers.

In this study, the intra- and inter-laboratory variability in bioaccessibility data generated by bioelution tests were evaluated in synthetic fluids relevant to oral, inhalation, and dermal exposure. Using one defined protocol, five laboratories measured metal release from cobalt oxide, cobalt powder, copper concentrate, Inconel alloy, <b>leaded</b> <b>brass</b> alloy, and nickel sulfate hexahydrate. Standard deviations of repeatability (s[subscript r]) and reproducibility (s[subscript R]) were used to evaluate the intra- and inter-laboratory variability, respectively. Examination of the s[subscript R]:s[subscript r] ratios demonstrated that, while gastric and lysosomal fluids had reasonably good reproducibility, other fluids did not show as good concordance between laboratories. Relative standard deviation (RSD) analysis showed more favorable reproducibility outcomes for some data sets; overall results varied more between- than within-laboratories. RSD analysis of s[subscript r] showed good within-laboratory variability for all conditions except some metals in interstitial fluid. In general, these findings indicate that absolute bioaccessibility results in some biological fluids may vary between different laboratories. However, for most applications, measures of relative bioaccessibility are needed, diminishing the requirement for high inter-laboratory reproducibility in absolute metal releases. The inter-laboratory exercise suggests that the degrees of freedom within the protocol need to be addressed...|$|E

It was found that bismuth were uniformly dispersed as the island of about 5 um in the brass powder matrix, and appeared at the brass powder surface after heat treatment over the melting point of bismuth. When 2. 2 mass % or more bismuth was added, the quantity of bismuth appearing at the brass powder surface increased because of saturated quantity of bismuth elements in the brass powder. There were bismuth islands of tens of microns in the extruded brass with 2. 2 mass % or more bismuth addition. These bismuth islands were depressed the elongation of extruded materials. The graphite particles with mean particle size of 5 mmwere also used as raw powder. 00 : 5 mass % graphite particles were mixed with the as-atomized brass powder by dry process. The elongation of the extruded brass alloy with both bismuth and graphite particles additions increased comparing with that of extruded brass with bismuth addition.
