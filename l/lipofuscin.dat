All thyroid samples examined contained nonbirefringent, Schmorl-positive pigment. However, the pigments in black thyroids from minocycline-treated patients resembled <b>lipofuscins</b> of untreated humans since both fluoresced and were Ziehl-Neelsen- and Sudan IV-positive. Minocycline induced pigment in rats was nonfluorescent and Ziehl-Neelsen- and Sudan IV-negative. Ultrastructurally, pigments in black thyroid glands of minocycline-treated humans resembled <b>lipofuscins</b> in untreated humans, and initial elemental analyses yielded similar spectra. Repeated analyses of the most electron-dense pigment deposits yielded spectra that resembled those of minocycline-induced pigment in laboratory animals-ie, both contained calcium. Black thyroid glands associated with minocycline administration contained predominantly <b>lipofuscins</b> {{with a small amount}} of another, possibly minocycline-related pigment. The absence of functional changes in patients and animals given minocycline suggests that discoloration of the thyroid gland associated with minocycline administration is innocuous. This is further supported by the lack of documented changes in thyroid physiology in patients that have received tetracyclines for a variety of indications in the last 30 -odd years since their introduction to therapy...|$|R
40|$|In a {{group of}} 105 {{patients}} suffering from various pulmonary diseases we have previously observed quantitative and qualitative differences between alveolar macrophages from smokers and non-smokers. In this study, we compared the cell population of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids in non-smoking, and smoking patients suffering from pulmonary sarcoidosis. Cell yield was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers: (P less than 0. 02), lavage fluids of smokers contained 83 % of macrophages and 14 % of lymphocytes, as compared with 60 % and 34 % respectively in non-smokers (P less than 0. 002). However, {{the total number of}} lymphocytes was not significantly different between the two groups. Alveolar macrophages from smokers were bigger and contained large pigmented lipoproteinic inclusions. Complementary cytochemical studies showed that <b>lipofuscins</b> were the principal constituent of these intracytoplasmic inclusions. In conclusion, cigarette smoke increases the number and alters the structure of the alveolar macrophages of patients with sarcoidosis, as well as in other chronic respiratory disease as previously shown. The mechanism responsible for the increased <b>lipofuscins</b> concentration in the alveolar macrophages of smokers remains to be determined...|$|R

25|$|The {{cell body}} of a neuron is {{supported}} by a complex mesh of structural proteins called neurofilaments, which are assembled into larger neurofibrils. Some neurons also contain pigment granules, such as neuromelanin (a brownish-black pigment that is byproduct of synthesis of catecholamines), and <b>lipofuscin</b> (a yellowish-brown pigment), both of which accumulate with age. Other structural proteins that are important for neuronal function are actin and the tubulin of microtubules. Actin is predominately found at the tips of axons and dendrites during neuronal development.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{flattened}} shape, satellite glial cells contain all common organelles {{necessary to}} make cellular products and to maintain the homeostatic environment of the cell. The plasma membrane of SGCs is thin and not very dense, and it is associated with adhesion molecules, receptors for neurotransmitters and other molecules, and ion channels, specifically potassium ion channels. Within individual SGCs, there is both rough endoplasmic reticulum and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but the latter is much less abundant. Most often the Golgi apparatus and the centrioles in an SGC are found in a region {{very close to the}} cell’s nucleus. On the other hand, mitochondria are found throughout the cytoplasm along with the organelles involved in autophagy and other forms of catabolic degradation, such as lysosomes, <b>lipofuscin</b> granules, and peroxisomes. Both microtubules and intermediate filaments can be seen throughout the cytoplasm, and most often they lie parallel to the SGC sheath. These filaments are found in greater concentrations at the axon hillock and at the beginning portion of an axon in an SGC of the sympathetic ganglia. In some SGCs of the sensory ganglia researchers have seen a single cilium that extends outward from the cell surface near the nucleus and into the extracellular space of a deep indentation in the plasma membrane. The cilium, however, only has the nine pairs of peripheral microtubules while it lacks the axial pair of microtubules, making its structure very similar to the cilia of neurons, Schwann cells, and astrocytes of the CNS.|$|E

Two phases have been distinguished, {{similar to those}} observed in dorsal root ganglion neurons. Up to 24 months, the mesencephalic trigeminal neurons progressively accumulate <b>lipofuscins,</b> while filamentous inclusions start to appear around 24 months of age. Hirano bodies and paired helical filament-like structures {{have been identified in}} animals aged 24 months or more. This time-course parallels the one observed previously in dorsal root ganglion neurons, indicating that the blood-brain barrier does not seem to influence the ageing of mesencephalic trigeminal neurons. The relationship between the paired helical filament-like inclusions and Hirano bodies, as well as similar structures already described by other authors, is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Our {{attention}} {{was captured by}} the interesting debate on the identification of <b>lipofuscins,</b> lipofuscin-like lipopigments, or flavins as the responsible for intracellular autofluorescence (AF) detected in epithelial cancer stem cells when exciting at 480 - 490 nm. Evidence was provided leading to ascribe AF emission to flavins accumulating in cytoplasmic structures, bounded to membranes and bearing ATP-dependent ABCG 2 transporters. Flavins were then proposed as an intrinsic AF biomarker of cancer stem cells, with advantageous implications on cell invasiveness and chemoresistance investigations. It is however worth recalling the huge amount of literature on flavins and NAD(P) H as AF biomarkers of cell energetic metabolism and redox state, an aspect {{that should not be}} overlooked in the renewed course to extend the potential of flavins as AF biomarkers, entailing also a recent proposal of Flavin-based fluorescent proteins as substitutes of Green fluorescent proteins...|$|R

The brain-blood barrier (BBB) in mutant brains exhibited increased permeability for Evans blue and fluorescent-dextran, suggesting a breakdown of the BBB in the mutant brains. Impaired BBB integrity facilitated autoreactive T cells infiltrating into all regions of the mutant brains. Brain autoimmune disorder caused accumulation of the ubiquitin-reactive aggregates in the mutant hippocampus, and early formation of autofluorescent <b>lipofuscins</b> in the neurons throughout the entire brains. Chronic neuroinflammation caused damage of the hippocampal mossy fibers and neuronal apoptotic death. This study shows that chronic systemic inflammation and autoimmune disorders in the TKO mice cause neuronal damage and death...|$|R

40|$|An intralobular duct {{of a human}} {{parotid gland}} has two parts, an {{intercalated}} part and a striated part. Intercalated ducts are lined with low cuboidal cells endowed with scanty cytoplasmic organelles. Striated ducts are lined with columnar cells rich in mitochondria and glycogen particles, and are characterized by extensive infoldings of the basal plasma membrane. The apical cytoplasm of {{the cells of the}} striated ducts shows a number of membrane-bound granules having a diameter of about 0 - 15 mum. These granules contain material of varying electron density which does not react with silver or with the histochemical reagents employed in the present study. Thus, {{on the basis of their}} small size and histochemical characteristics, they are distinct from the large and dense secretory granules observed in the so-called granular striated ducts of some animals. In addition, cells of striated ducts contain lysosomes, peroxisomes, and large lipoid bodies which give histochemical reactions typical of <b>lipofuscins.</b> Bodies of myoepithelial cells have been observed only in intercalated ducts. Their processes, however, extend into the proximal parts of striated ducts...|$|R

Two types of birefringent inclusions were found in CHRS only: the first is transparent in bright field, the second appears as brown granules or rods, similar to <b>lipofuscins.</b> As in IRD large PAS-positive macrophage-like cells contain the transparent type. Electron microscopical investigation of these cells shows trilaminar structures within membrane-bound organelles. The two types were also seen in kidney and brown adipose tissue, the first type in pancreas, the second type in adrenal gland; no such was observed in myocardium or in thyroid gland (CHRS).

40|$|Botryllus schlosseri is {{a colonial}} ascidian {{representing}} a suitable subject {{for studies on}} cyclical involution and resorption of tissues. At 19 °, adult zooids remain active for one week, then they are gradually resorbed, being replaced by {{a new generation of}} adult zooids, represented by buds which reach functional maturity. This stage, known as regression or takeover, is characterised by diffuse programmed cell death by apoptosis in zooid tissues, as shown by annexin V labelling for detection of exposed phosphatidylserine and the TUNEL reaction for chromatin fragmentation. Immunocytochemical assays to detect proapoptotic and antiapoptotic factors reveal the opposite expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax proteins, which extends in tissues of adult zooids with an antero-posterior progression starting from the pharynx. Bax is expressed in all tissues of the digestive tract in the stage preceding take-over: together with signs of DNA fragmentation in the pharynx and pyloric gland, it suggests that this is the crucial stage for triggering programmed cell death in old zooids. Residual zooids remain segregated for a long time as small dark vesicles rich in melanins and <b>lipofuscins.</b> Results support the idea that fundamental mechanisms for the induction of apoptosis are well conserved throughout chordate evolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{pigmented}} neurones of the {{substantia nigra}} are typically lost in Parkinson's disease; however, the possible relation between neuronal vulnerability {{and the presence}} of neuromelanin has not been elucidated. Early histological studies revealed the presence of increasing amounts of neuromelanin in the substantia nigra with aging in higher mammals, showed that the neuromelanin granules are surrounded by a membrane, and comparatively evaluated the pigmentation of the substantia nigra in different animal species. Histochemical studies showed the association of neuromelanin with <b>lipofuscins.</b> However, systematic investigations of the structure, synthesis, and molecular interactions of neuromelanin have been undertaken only during the past decade. In these later studies, neuromelanin was identified as a genuine melanin with a strong chelating ability for iron and an affinity for compounds such as lipids, pesticides, and MPP+. The affinity of neuromelanin for a variety of inorganic and organic toxins is consistent with a postulated protective function for neuromelanin. Moreover, the neuronal accumulation of neuromelanin during aging and the link between its synthesis and a high cytosolic concentration of catechols suggest a protective role. However, its putative neuroprotective effects could be quenched in conditions of toxin overload...|$|R
40|$|Aluminium (Al) is {{the third}} most {{widespread}} metal in the environment. It is toxic for the brain, bone and haematological system but unfortunately very little data exist for other organs. Stress proteins are induced or enhanced against metal toxicity with {{an essential role in}} the recovery of organules and other cellular proteins. This immunohistochemical study was performed to analyze the distribution of three stress proteins (HSP 25, HSP 72, GRP 75) in rat kidney and liver orally exposed to Al sulphate daily for 3 and 6 months. Al-induced alterations were further studied by histopathology (H&E, PAS, Perl’s, Masson) and ultrastructural morphometry. In the kidney: HSP 25 was enhanced in proximal tubules after 6 months Al-exposure when abnormal brush borders were observed; HSP 72 was induced in proximal tubules only after long Al-treatment; GRP 75 was raised in midcortical area sometimes within nuclei. Furthermore, lysosomal and <b>lipofuscins</b> densities increased in the juxtamedullary tubules after 3 months Al exposure with respect to controls. In the liver: Perl’spositive deposits and fibrosis became evident after Al treatment. HSP 25 was very weak; HSP 72 focal in pericentral hepatocytes at 3 months and induced also in Kupffer cells at 6 months; GRP 75 diffuse in periportal hepatocytes and non parenchymal cells at 6 months. Prolonged Al exposure stimulated stress proteins strictly organ-dependently in the rat. Their distribution in kidney and liver seems related to cumulative sublethal effects induced by metal and could be a sensitive index of Al susceptibility of these organs...|$|R
40|$|An {{histological}} {{study of}} the peripheral nervous fibres has been performed at various anatomical levels during aging: the spinal ganglion, the dorsal and the ventral nerve roots, the spinal and the sciatic nerves. During aging the various alterations occurring in a peripheral nerve can be summarized as following. In the myelinated fibres, the axoplasm was progressively invaded by several inclusions: glycogen granules, granulo-filamentous bodies and <b>lipofuscins.</b> The crystalloid networks arising from the cytoskeleton were mainly localised in the intraganglionic fibres. Among the axoplasmic organelles, the mitochondria were the most affected. The myelinic sheath split, became dystrophic and then was totally disrupted. The inner schwann cell compartment was invaded by several inclusions like Hirano bodies and dense residual deposits. Further, macrophages phagocytosed the axon and the myelin sheath. In the non-myelinated fibres, the alterations were less important and less precocious. When these results are analysed from a chronological point of view it is established that the alterations appear {{at the same time}} in each observed level but their amount differ from each other. In the 24 -month-old-rats, the ventral root and the sciatic nerve present many dystrophies whereas in the spinal ganglion and in the dorsal root they are less numerous. From these results, it can be suspected that the motor fibres are more vulnerable during aging. Moreover, the myelinated fibres of large diameter are the first affected. Furthermore, only the ventral root and the sciatic nerve show typical regeneration pictures at 32 months...|$|R
5000|$|Differently {{from the}} {{melanotic}} nevi and the verrucous nevi on the skin, age spots change with time {{in color and}} in shape. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory [...] proposes a hypothesis {{on the development of}} age spots. Firstly, the development of a flat spot is a result of accumulation of aged basal cells. When the skin is aged, some aged cells that contain <b>lipofuscin</b> bodies cannot be removed. An aged cell will affect the functionality of the local tissue and promote the aging of its neighbor cells. By a feedback loop, more and more neighbor cells become aged and lipofuscin-containing. They aggregate and form a spot with an irregular shape. Secondly, protruding of a flat spot {{is a result of the}} death of aged cells in the spot and release of <b>lipofuscin</b> bodies. Isolation of the un-digestible <b>lipofuscin</b> bodies in a fibrotic capsule is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the tissue. Successive encapsulation of dead cells and <b>lipofuscin</b> bodies results in the growth of a spot in three dimensions. The dense <b>lipofuscin</b> bodies in the capsule make a protruding spot soft and dark in color.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} levels and effects of trace metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, Zn), PAHs and PCBs in mussels and fish native to the Lagoon of Venice. To this end, bioaccumulation and various biomarkers of generic stress and exposure (malondialdehyde, MDA and metallothioneins, MT; ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity, EROD; fluorescent bile metabolites and somatic indices in fish; lysosomal membrane stability, LMS; <b>lipofuscins,</b> LF; neutral lipids, NL and survival-in-air, SOS in mussels) were measured in organisms seasonally collected from two differently influenced areas. In mussels, metal bioaccumulation levels at the two sites were low and fluctuated similarly, exhibiting decreasing levels in summer, like MDA and MT. Micro-organic pollutants and the probably related biological response of LMS did not show either significant site differences or seasonal trends. LF and NL revealed inconclusive patterns. The results of the survival-in-air test were quite erratic, showing that they were associated with the high variability of both natural and physiological parameters temperature, food, reproduction, and body reserve cycle. In fish, both inorganic and organic micro-pollutant levels were low, and differences were detected between sites only for PCBs. The pattern exhibited by micro-organic contaminants was clearly related to the reproductive cycle at both sites; a relationship with PCBs, EROD and MDA was established at the site where their levels were generally higher.

40|$|Tissue {{degeneration}} {{which occurs}} during development of organisms is often of morphogenetic importance {{as well as}} proliferation and differentiation. Cyclic apoptosis of organs was progressively lost in Chordates. Botryllus schlosseri is a colonial ascidian continuously forming new zooids by blastogenesis, through the recurrent formation of palleal buds, which grow and mature until an adult is formed. Three blastogenic generations are commonly co-present: adult, filtering zooids, their buds and budlets on buds. At a temperature of 19 °C, adult zooids remain active for about one week (mid-cycle stages); then they contract, close their siphons and are gradually resorbed, being replaced by {{a new generation of}} adult zooids, represented by buds which reach functional maturity, open their siphons and begin their filtering activity (regression or take-over stage). This stage is characterised by the occurrence of diffuse programmed cell death by apoptosis in zooid tissues, as evidenced by TUNEL reaction for chromatin fragmentation and annexin V labelling for detection of exposed phosphatidylserine, whereas infiltration of circulating phagocytes, which appear engulfed with apoptotic cells, is observed. With these characteristics, colonial tunicates are suitable subjects for studies on cyclical involution and resorption of tissues. In residual zooids remaining {{for a long time in}} the centre of each colony, melanin and <b>lipofuscins</b> accumulate as detected with Masson-Fontana, Ziehl-Nielsen and H 2 O 2 bleaching methods. Immunocytochemical assays to detect pro- and antiapoptotic factors reveal an opposite expression which progressively extends in tissues of adult zooids with an organ gradient starting from the branchial basket.

40|$|The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is {{a highly}} conserved {{heterodimer}} important for metazoan development, but its molecular function is not well understood. Recent evidence suggests the NAC is {{a component of the}} cytosolic chaperone network that interacts with ribosomal complexes and their emerging nascent peptides, such that the loss of the NAC in chaperone-depleted cells results in an increase in misfolded protein stress. We tested whether the NAC functions similarly in Caeonorhabditis (C.) elegans and found that its homologous NAC subunits, i. e. ICD- 1 and - 2, have chaperone-like characteristics. Loss of the NAC appears to induce misfolded protein stress in the ER triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). Depletion of the NAC altered the response to heat stress, and led to an up-regulation of hsp- 4, a homologue of the human chaperone and ER stress sensor GRP 78 /BiP. Worms lacking both ICD- 1 and the UPR transcription factor XBP- 1 generated a higher proportion of defective embryos, showed increased embryonic apoptosis and had a diminished survival rate relative to ICD- 1 -depleted animals with an intact UPR. Up-regulation of hsp- 4 in NAC-depleted animals was specific to certain regions of the embryo; in embryos lacking ICD- 1, the posterior region of the embryo showed strong up-regulation of hsp- 4, while the anterior region did not. Furthermore, loss of ICD- 1 produced prominent lysosomes in the gut region of adults and embryos putatively containing <b>lipofuscins,</b> lipid/protein aggregates associated with cellular aging. These results are the first set of evidence consistent with a role for C. elegans NAC in protein folding and localization during translation. Further, these findings confirm C. elegans as a valuable model for studying organismal and cell-type specific responses to misfolded protein stress...|$|R
