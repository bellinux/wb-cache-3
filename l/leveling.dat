40|$|Morphological <b>levelings</b> {{represent}} {{a useful tool}} for the decomposition of an image into cartoon and texture components. Moreover, they can be used to construct a morphological scale space. However, the classic construction of <b>levelings</b> is limited to the use of grey scale images, since an ordering of pixel values is required. In this paper we propose an extension of morphological <b>levelings</b> to colour images. To this end, we consider the formulation of colour images as matrix fields and explore techniques based on the Loewner order for formulating morphological <b>levelings</b> in this setting. Using the matrix-valued colours we study realisations of <b>levelings</b> relying on both the completely discrete construction and the formulation using a partial differential equation. Experimental results confirm the potential of our matrix-based approaches for analysing texture in colour images and for extending the range of applications of <b>levelings</b> in a convenient way to colour image processing...|$|R

In fact, while the morphological opening (closing) modifies the remaining structures, the opening (closing) by reconstruction sometimes reconstructs undesirable regions...|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{aforementioned}} balance issues, {{the game was}} initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat {{that he used to}} adjust the games setting for character <b>leveling</b> and the strength of enemies players would encounter.

Further more, enemies <b>leveling</b> and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if player get the boat to some land might be quickly killed. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we develop partial {{differential}} equations (PDEs) that model {{the generation of}} a large class of morphological filters, the <b>levelings</b> and the openings/closings by reconstruction. These types of filters are very useful in numerous image analysis and vision tasks ranging from enhancement, to geometric feature detection, to segmentation. The developed PDEs are nonlinear functions of the first spatial derivatives and model these nonlinear filters as the limit of a controlled growth starting from an initial seed signal. This growth is of the multiscale dilation or erosion type and the controlling mechanism is a switch that reverses the growth when {{the difference between the}} current evolution and a reference signal switches signs. We discuss theoretical aspects of these PDEs, propose discrete algorithms for their numerical solution and corresponding filter implementation, and provide insights via several experiments. Finally, we outline the use of these PDEs for improving the Gaussian scale-space by using the latter as initial seed to generate multiscale <b>levelings</b> that have a superior preservation of image edges and boundaries. ...|$|R

In this paper we investigate {{a class of}} filters able to simplify an image without blurring or displacing its contours: the simplified image has less details, hence less contours.

The corresponding filters are called <b>levelings.</b> Their properties and construction are described in the present paper. 1...|$|R
