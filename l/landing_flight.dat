25|$|On 25 November 2012, Chinese media {{announced}} that two J-15s had made successful arrested landings on {{the aircraft carrier}} Liaoning. The first pilot {{to land on the}} Liaoning was named as Dai Mingmeng (戴明盟). Luo Yang, the aircraft's head of production and designer, died the same day. PLA Daily newspaper indicated the first five naval pilots including Dai conducted J-15 fighter landing and taking off. Test and training program officials confirmed the carrier-borne aircraft and special equipment for the <b>landing</b> <b>flight</b> had gone through strict tests, and fighter jets can be deployed on the carrier.|$|E

2500|$|Disappointed by {{the reduced}} chances of {{commanding}} a Moon <b>landing</b> <b>flight,</b> Cooper retired from NASA and the Air Force on July 31, 1970, as a Colonel, having flown 222 hours in space. [...] In his book [...] "Leap of Faith" [...] (pp.176–183), Cooper charged that Shepard and Slayton had taken unfair {{advantage of their}} control of Apollo flight crew assignments by giving him the [...] "third-in-a-row" [...] backup crew assignment, {{in order to promote}} their own chances of flying.|$|E

50|$|The flags {{deployed}} on {{the last}} three <b>landing</b> <b>flights</b> were carried in the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA, an equipment drawer which opened {{from the side of}} the Lunar Module) rather than on the ladder. This eliminated the need for the thermal protection shroud.|$|R
5000|$|The {{period from}} the 18th century to modern day {{was marked by}} {{economic}} decline and <b>land</b> <b>flight.</b> Only in the 1980s were the Baronnies [...] "discovered".

2500|$|At 7:50, {{a special}} weather {{observation}} reported thin obscurement, with an overcast cloud ceiling estimated at [...] above the airport. Horizontal visibility was , obscured by fog. Two aircraft left the holding pattern, making attempts to land, but both made missed approaches. A third landed at 8:16 following an instrument approach to runway 19. After the latest airplane's successful <b>landing,</b> <b>Flight</b> 723 was cleared {{to execute the}} same instrument approach to runway 19. At 8:19, the flight advised the tower that because the aircraft's flaps could not be lowered, they would be abandoning their approach and returning to the holding pattern.|$|E
2500|$|A {{conventional}} take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>flight</b> profile {{was shown}} to cover a [...] "noise footprint" [...] of 20square miles (50km2) in line with an airport's runway when using a limit of 90decibels, by using an approach path of six degrees (double the normal angle) and a climb out path of 15degrees the footprint could be reduced to 3square miles (8km2). This form of STOL operation {{was expected to be}} in place at British city airports by the late 1970s. To reduce the noise footprint further to a circle with a diameter of just 3,000ft VTOL operations were expected to commence in the early 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|The rapid {{expansion}} in aircraft {{size and weight}} {{as well as the}} need for enhanced airfield safety led the U.S. Department of Commerce to threaten to close Washington-Hoover again. In June 1937, the department promulgated new rules requiring runways to be lengthened by as much as [...] and for all obstructions for take-off and <b>landing</b> <b>flight</b> paths to be removed. The department also instituted an airport classification system designed to rate fields on safety and other factors. Aircraft would be permitted to use only at those fields which had a rating indicating it was safe for them, and air traffic volumes would be limited at fields with lower ratings. The rules threatened to close Washington-Hoover, or permit its use for local traffic only.|$|E
50|$|Today {{most of the}} Baronnies {{is part of the}} département Drôme (a part of the région Rhône-Alpes). Smaller {{areas in}} the East and South belong to the départements of Vaucluse, Hautes-Alpes and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (part of the région Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur). The area of roughly 2,000 km2 is sparsely populated; the 1999 census counted only 22,000 inhabitants. Since the 17th century les Baronnies, {{especially}} its eastern parts, suffered from <b>land</b> <b>flight</b> due to harsh economic conditions. Starting in the 1980s <b>land</b> <b>flight</b> has stopped and the population is now increasing especially in and around the towns of Nyons, Buis-les-Baronnies, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies, Faucon and Puymeras. There are plans to create the Parc Naturel Régional des Baronnies. The area is paradise for hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, cycling, mountain biking, horse-riding, hang gliding and paragliding.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of the helicam is the flexibility and small size.

50|$|By this time, {{the plane}} was about 50 miles (80 km) from Nassau.

2500|$|The pitch rapidly {{changed from}} 2° nose up {{to a maximum}} 12° nose down for over 8 seconds. The plane {{remained}} in maximum nose down even when the plane was at close proximity with the ground. The [...] "Pull up" [...] ceased momentarily until it was activated again {{until the end of}} the recording.

Captain Noor wants to get out from the [...] "Pull up" [...] warning, but exceeding the critical angle of attack. This caused both stick shakers to activate again. First Officer Javid shouted in extreme anxiety [...] "Stall warning let's get out!". The Captain did not make any evasive action as he was so focused to get out from the condition, aggravated by the First Officer's action to not take control of the aircraft.

2500|$|The Shuttle crew awoke Friday at 05:28 UTC. With weather {{looking good}} at the Kennedy Space Center, and nothing {{standing}} in the way of <b>landing,</b> <b>Flight</b> Director Bryan Lunney gave the [...] "go" [...] signal to close the payload bay doors at 10:52 UTC. Mission Control also instructed the astronauts to begin [...] "fluid loading" [...] – a protocol that aids the astronauts' readjustment to gravity. The crew strapped into their seats at 12:37 UTC in preparation for a landing. NASA operators gave the [...] "go" [...] for the deorbit burn and at 13:37 UTC, flying upside down and backwards above the southern Indian Ocean just west of Indonesia, Atlantis fired its orbital maneuvering system (OMS) engines for 2 minutes and 47 seconds. The deorbit burn decelerated the orbiter by about 211 miles per hour, enough to lower its orbital perigee into the upper atmosphere. Atlantis encountered the first traces of Earth's atmosphere, known as [...] "entry interface", at 14:12 UTC at an altitude of 399,000 feet flying over the Pacific Ocean. At 14:26 UTC, eighteen minutes before touchdown, the orbiter was travelling at Mach 22; nine minutes later the orbiter was [...] "gliding" [...] at Mach 6. The shuttle’s ground track took it along the east coast of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula, across the Gulf of Mexico and cross the Florida coast south of Fort Myers.|$|E

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July 2010, the airport was shut down for an hour when an {{unidentified}} flying object was detected.

Just prior to take off, and from gear down to <b>landing,</b> <b>flight</b> attendants will be in their jumpseats in a semi-brace position performing their silent review.
