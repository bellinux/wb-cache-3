5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile <b>launcher</b> and a surface-to-air missile <b>launcher.</b>|$|E

However, Croatia might opt for Javelin <b>launchers</b> {{as the new}} Kongsberg 30 mm Turret for Patria is fitted with Javelin <b>launchers</b> and not Spike. Croatia has indicated a requirement for 48 <b>launchers</b> {{as part of the}} Patria program with the first 16 being delivered by 2015 and remaining <b>launchers</b> after that.|$|R

5|$|Officers found {{a firing}} range inside a disused wine cellar {{being used as}} an {{underground}} bunker, and seized weapons including an assault rifle, a submachine gun, a semi-automatic pistol and an RPG-18 rocket <b>launcher.</b> An earlier version of the rocket <b>launcher,</b> the RPG-7, {{had been in the}} possession of the Provisional IRA from as early as 1972, {{but this was the first}} time the RPG-18 had been found in the possession of a paramilitary organisation in Ireland. Among those convicted were Alan Ryan, who was on bail for possession of a loaded revolver at his home in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|Returning from Melee are trophies, statuettes {{of video}} game {{characters}} and objects that give brief histories or descriptions of their subjects, such as Mario and Link, or other characters and items {{that appear in}} their respective series. A minigame, the Coin <b>Launcher,</b> replaces the lottery machine from Melee as the primary method of obtaining trophies. The Coin <b>Launcher</b> is a machine that uses coins as projectiles to shoot trophies and counter incoming dangers such as missiles. Coins {{can also be used}} to bet on the victor of online battles via Spectator mode. Trophies unavailable in Coin <b>Launcher</b> mode are obtained by using an item called the Trophy Stand on weakened enemy characters and bosses within The Subspace Emissary. Trophies obtained in this manner may contain information on the backstory of the Subspace Emissary.|$|E
25|$|At least some, if not all, of the Indonesian ships have {{replaced}} their Seacat <b>launchers</b> with two twin Simbad <b>launchers.</b> Recently, the two quadruple Harpoon <b>launchers</b> were also replaced by Yakhont missile (SS-N-26) <b>launchers</b> purchased from Russia, because the early version Harpoon missiles previously installed were nearing their obsolescence period. There {{are also some}} conflicting reports that the Harpoon missiles were replaced with Chinese-sourced C-802 rather than Russian Yakhont. There are some pictures circulating on the internet showing several vessels of the class carrying box <b>launchers</b> that look much {{too small to be}} Yakhont's <b>launchers,</b> but they are the right size for C-802.|$|R

5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile <b>launcher</b> inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW <b>launcher</b> which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable depth charge <b>launcher</b> which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge <b>launcher,</b> and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E

5|$|Based on the M-13, the M-30 rocket was {{developed}} in 1942. Its bulbous warhead required it to be fired from a grounded frame, called the M-30 (single frame, four round; later double frame, 8 round), instead of a launch rail mounted on a truck. In 1944 it {{became the basis for}} the BM-31-12 truck-mounted <b>launcher.</b>|$|E
5|$|Israel {{captured}} BM-24 MRLs {{during the}} Six-Day War (1967), used them in two battalions during the Yom Kippur War (1973) and the 1982 Lebanon War, and later developed the MAR-240 <b>launcher</b> {{for the same}} rockets, based on a Sherman tank chassis.|$|E
5|$|Since GNOME 3.2 Web allows {{creating}} application launchers for web applications. The subsequent {{invocation of}} a <b>launcher</b> {{brings up a}} plain single instance of Web limited to one domain, with off-site links opening in a normal browser. The <b>launcher</b> created this way is accessible from the desktop and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of the desktop and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features {{can be found in the}} Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|E

Eight SRAMs were carried internally on a special rotary <b>launcher</b> and 12 SRAMs were mounted on two wing pylons. With SRAM, the B-52s could strike heavily defended targets without entering the terminal defenses.|$|E
5|$|The Super-Heavy Lift <b>Launcher</b> (SHLL) would {{consist of}} a new {{cryogenic}} main stage, five liquid fly-back boosters, and a re-ignitable injection stage.

5|$|Additionally {{a family}} of {{derivative}} launch vehicles was proposed {{in order to take}} an advantage of economies of scale, further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like Vega and Arianespace Soyuz, the Super-Heavy Lift <b>Launcher</b> capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit, and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{nitrogen}} is non-toxic, when {{released into}} an enclosed space it can displace oxygen, and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard. This may happen with few warning symptoms, since the human carotid {{body is a}} relatively poor and slow low-oxygen (hypoxia) sensing system. An example occurred shortly before {{the launch of the}} first Space Shuttle mission in 1981, when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Shuttle's Mobile <b>Launcher</b> Platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conversion}} {{project in}} early 1956 {{called for the}} installation of two Polaris nuclear ballistic missile launchers with a capacity for sixteen weapons. Also proposed were four RIM-8 Talos SAM launchers with eighty missiles per <b>launcher</b> and twelve RIM-24 Tartar SAM launchers with 504 missiles. A July 1956 estimate projected completing the ship by July 1961, {{but the cost of}} the conversion ultimately forced the Navy to abandon the project.|$|E
