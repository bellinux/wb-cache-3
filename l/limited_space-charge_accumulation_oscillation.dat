40|$|Space-charge effects play a {{dominant}} role {{in many areas}} of physics. In high-power microwave devices using high-current, relativistic electron beams, it places a limit on the amount of radiation a device can produce. Because the beam's space-charge can actually reflect a portion of the beam, the ability to accurately predict the amount of current a device can carry is needed. This current value is known as the <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited</b> current. Because of the mathematical difficulties, this limit is typically estimated from a one-dimensional theory. This work presents a two-dimensional theory for calculating an upper-bound for the <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited</b> current of relativistic electron beams propagating in grounded coaxial drift tubes. Applicable to annular beams of arbitrary radius and thickness, the theory includes the effect introduced by a finite-length drift tube of circular cross-section. Using Green's second identity, the need to solve Poisson's equation is transferred to solving a Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem, which is easily solved by elementary methods. In general, the resulting eigenvalue, which is required to estimate the limiting current, must be numerically determined. However, analytic expressions can be found for frequently encountered <b>limiting</b> cases. <b>Space-charge</b> effects also produce the fundamental collective behavior found in plasmas, especially in plasma sheaths. A plasma sheath is the transition region between a bulk plasma and an adjacent plasma-facing surface. The sheath controls the loss of particles from the plasma in order to maintain neutrality. Using a fully kinetic theory, the problem of a planar sheath with a single-minimum electric potential profile is investigated. Appropriate for single charge-state ions of arbitrary temperature, the theory includes the emission of warm electrons from the surface as well as a net current through the sheath and is compared to particle-in-cell simulations. Approximate expressions are developed for estimating the sheath potential as well as the transition to space-charge saturation.

It increases more than three orders of magnitude, to reach a value up to Ã¢â€°Ë† 2 Ãƒâ€” 10 - 8 m 2 /(VÃ‚Â·s) after the annealing process, {{as a result of}} an improved crystallinity of the film. Slow drying leads to an addnl. 33 -fold enhancement of the hole mobility even up to 5. 0 Ãƒâ€” 10 - 7 m 2 /(VÃ‚Â·s), thereby balancing the transport of electrons and holes in the blend.

Examples include the Bipolar Mode Static Induction Transistor (BSIT), ultrasmall Punch-through MOSFETs, and BARITT diodes for microwave applications. The development of punch-through space-charge type of devices is a technology motivated by the demanding high density among the IC chips. This dissertation discusses a device which operates in a punch-through condition with space-charge control of currents. It is a two terminal device, which could be fabricated with no deviation from today's technology. The device structure is simple, with two n⁺ or p⁺ regions formed in p⁻ or n⁻ substrate, respectively. Punch-through <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited</b> structures both n⁺p⁻n⁺ and p⁺n⁻p⁺, were simulated using a general one-dimensional semiconductor device performance simulation program GESIM 1 for dynamic and static analysis. The results of simulation show that the potential barrier height decreases with increasing applied potential and with a reduction of the spacing L between the n⁺ diffusion in an n⁺p⁻n⁺ structure. The resistance increases as the spacing L is increased. A two-dimensional analytical model of carrier transport in the device was developed.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of an organic photovoltaic (OPV) device {{is determined by}} the shape of its current-voltage (J-V) curve. Previous studies showed that the J-V curve for the best-studied OPV system, P 3 HT:PCBM, is determined mainly by non-geminate recombination where free electrons and holes recombine before being collected, thereby reducing output current. In this thesis we study non-geminate recombination experimentally, as well as charge collection efficiency and rates of geminate recombination, in several polymer:fullerene material systems. The aim is to determine limits to the performance of OPV devices and to quantify the recombination losses. The first two experimental chapters investigate P 3 HT:PCBM devices. The first presents an analysis of non-geminate recombination, and the application of temperature dependent measurements and new transient techniques to probe the energetic distribution of trap states within the semiconductor. The second reconciles two apparently contradictory experimental results, namely, the highly non-linear dependence of non-geminate recombination rate upon charge density and the linear dependence of corrected photocurrent on light intensity. In the third experimental chapter of this thesis both geminate and non-geminate recombination processes are studied and quantified in several material systems. Specifically we study {{the extent to which the}} two recombination mechanisms can impact upon the generation, collection and recombination of charges in the devices and we relate this directly to the fill-factor of the devices.

In recent years these cathodes {{have been used in}} electron linear accelerators (LINACs), particularly in induction LINACs, such as the Experimental Test Accelerator at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Relativistic Test Accelerator at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. For induction LINACs, the thermionic dispenser cathode provides greater reproducibility, longer pulse lengths, and lower emittance beams than does a field emission cathode. Los Alamos National Laboratory is fabricating a dual-axis X-ray radiography machine called dual-axis radiograph hydrodynamic test (DARHT). The second axis of DARHT consists of a 2 -kA, 20 -MeV induction LINAC that uses a 3. 2 -MeV electron gun with a tungsten thermionic-dispenser cathode. Typically the DARHT cathode current density is 10 A/cm{sup 2 } at 1050 C. Under these conditions current density is <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited,</b> which is desirable since current density is independent of temperature. At lower temperature (the temperature-limited regime) there are variations in the local current density due to a nonuniform temperature profile. To obtain the desired uniform current density associated with <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited</b> operation, the coolest area on the cathode must be at a sufficiently high temperature so that the emission is <b>space-charge</b> <b>limited.</b> Consequently, the rest of the cathode is emitting at the same space-charge-limited current density but is at a higher temperature than necessary. Because cathode lifetime is such a strong function of cathode temperature, there is a severe penalty for nonuniformity in the cathode temperature.
