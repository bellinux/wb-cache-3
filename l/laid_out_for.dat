5|$|The Tower Athletic Grounds was a {{multi-purpose}} {{stadium and}} ground {{that could be}} <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> athletics field events. The field was encircled by an athletics track surrounded by a banked cycle track, which hosted the World Cycling championships in July 1922. It was the biggest sporting and motorcycling track in the North of England. In 1933, the athletics track was replaced for use every Saturday by motorcycle speedway racing.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E

5|$|In the 1989 {{specifications}} {{issued to}} the Ecuadorian Military, the {{coat of arms}} has only eight colors that are used on the flag. The eight colors are yellow, blue, red (all from the national flag), sky blue, green, grey, silver and gold. There is also a nine piece instruction on how to draw the coat of arms, followed by a full color drawing and {{a black and white}} drawing of the arms. No size specifications have been <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the coat of arms except for when it is used on the national flag.|$|E

The island is open year round, with a ferry running during the summer. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available.

5|$|Buildings {{from most}} of the {{architectural}} periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, due to hunting, the Alpine ibex survived in the Gran Paradiso and Vanoise area. Approximately 60 {{individual}} ibex survived, here. Ibex were intensively hunted, partly for sport, {{but also because}} their body parts were thought to have therapeutic properties: talismans were made from a small cross-shaped bone near the ibex's heart {{in order to protect}} against violent death. Due to the alarming decrease in the ibex population, Victor Emmanuel, soon to be King of Italy, declared the Royal Hunting Reserve of the Gran Paradiso in 1856. A protective guard was created for the ibex. Paths <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the ibex are still used today as part of 724 kilometres (450mi) of marked trails and mule tracks.|$|E

5|$|The Edict on Maximum Prices (Edictum De Pretiis Rerum Venalium) {{was issued}} {{two to three}} months after the coinage edict, somewhere between 20 November and 10 December 301. The best-preserved Latin {{inscription}} surviving from the Greek East, the edict survives in many versions, on materials as varied as wood, papyrus, and stone. In the edict, Diocletian declared that the current pricing crisis resulted from the unchecked greed of merchants, and had resulted in turmoil for the mass of common citizens. The language of the edict calls on the people's memory of their benevolent leaders, and exhorts them to enforce the provisions of the edict, and thereby restore perfection to the world. The edict goes on to list in detail over one thousand goods and accompanying retail prices not to be exceeded. Penalties are <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> various pricing transgressions.|$|E
5|$|The land {{on which}} Denmark Street stands was {{formerly}} part of the grounds of St Giles Hospital, founded as a house for lepers in the early 12th century by Henry I's wife Matilda (Maud). In 1612, it was recorded as being owned by Tristram Gibbs. The grounds were <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> development {{during the reign of}} James II and developed by Samuel Fortrey and Jacques Wiseman in the late 1680s. Historical evidence suggests the street was formed between 1682 and 1687, as it was not shown on Morden and Lea's Map of 1682. It was named after Prince George of Denmark, who had married Princess Anne in 1683. By 1691, 20 houses had been completed, of which eight remain standing.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being <b>laid</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
