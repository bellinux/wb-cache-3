50|$|Accessories for {{the pistol}} include the Remote <b>Line</b> <b>Adapter</b> kit, which {{allows users to}} use an {{external}} continuous air source like HPA or CO2. Tippmann's Hammerhead barrels will also fit, and they sell leg holsters and spare magazines compatible with the pistol.|$|E
50|$|To use {{a remote}} air source a remote <b>line</b> <b>adapter</b> must be installed. This feature {{requires}} that an empty 12 gram CO2 cartridge {{be in place}} before a remote hose {{can be used with}} the TPX paintball pistol. Attachment of the remote air source depends on the remote line being used and is compatible with standard lines.|$|E
50|$|Because early Slingboxes did {{not support}} Wi-Fi, {{connecting}} them to a network was difficult if a customer {{did not have an}} ethernet jack near their set top box. To address these needs, Sling released the SlingLink line of power <b>line</b> <b>adapters.</b> With the release of a Wi-Fi-enabled Slingbox 500, the product was discontinued and is no longer supported.|$|R
50|$|An AC adapter, AC/DC adapter, or AC/DC {{converter}} {{is a type}} {{of external}} power supply, often enclosed in a case similar to an AC plug. Other common names include plug pack, plug-in adapter, adapter block, domestic mains <b>adapter,</b> <b>line</b> power <b>adapter,</b> wall wart, power brick, and power adapter. Adapters for battery-powered equipment may be described as chargers or rechargers (see also battery charger). AC adapters are used with electrical devices that require power but do not contain internal components to derive the required voltage and power from mains power. The internal circuitry of an external power supply is very similar to the design that would be used for a built-in or internal supply.|$|R
40|$|Other than {{integrating}} the PFC and the DCDC converter, this approach {{resort to the}} conventional two stage design with constant operating frequency and ZVS for all switches. A small switch is added between the PFC and asymmetric half bridge DC/DC converter to produce a four switch AC/DC converter with PFC. A 91 % efficiency 12 V 10 A universal off <b>line</b> ACDC <b>adapter</b> is built to demonstrate its merits. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|While {{the marker}} is {{designed}} to use 12 gram CO2 cartridges as its propellant, a remote <b>line</b> <b>adapter</b> can be installed in order to hook the TPX up to an external air source. Use of a remote line with the TPX increases the amount of air supply the marker has at one time by allowing larger sources of air {{to be used with}} the marker. Installation of this modification requires internal parts to be replaced in order to allow the air flow from the 12 gram CO2 cartridge to change and be redirected. This modification also requires a small piece {{in the back of the}} marker to be taken out. In order for this upgrade to function properly a used or empty 12 gram CO2 cartridge must be in place in the chamber underneath the barrel. Most remote lines are compatible with the TPX remote <b>line</b> <b>adapter</b> modification, and connection of the line depends on the model of remote hose being used.|$|E
5000|$|Communication {{was done}} serially, half-duplex, at 75 or 150 bits per second. A modem, such as IBM <b>Line</b> <b>Adapter,</b> {{was needed for}} {{connection}} to a communication line. The IBM 1050 featured multipoint asynchronous communication (Start Stop protocol), and improved error checking (LRC and VRC), with speed up to 14.8 characters per second (134 bauds), compared to the teleprinter's 10 cps. One IBM 1051 and another device were required per subsystem.|$|E
5000|$|The A and B wires of an {{analogue}} {{phone line}} {{appear in a}} structured cabling system usually on the centre pins of the 8P8C connector (pins 4 and 5; the blue/white TIA/EIA-568 pair 1 in Cat5 cables). In most other countries, those two wires are {{all that is needed}} to connect an analogue telephone. In the UK, however, many telephones expect the 25 Hz ring signal on a third wire. But such a 3-wire interface is not the symmetric interface needed for balanced twisted-pair transmission lines, and therefore prone to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with nearby other wiring. Therefore, the capacitor that separates the bell signal from the A/B wires should be located close to the telephone. Any bell wire provided by the master socket is therefore not connected to the structured cabling, and the telephone is plugged at the other end into the structured cabling via a <b>line</b> <b>adapter</b> unit (LAU) / Mod-Tap / Molex that contains the capacitor needed to create the separate bell signal. Different types of LAUs are on the market: ...|$|E
5000|$|RadioShack sold a <b>line</b> of <b>adapter</b> plugs for {{universal}} AC adapters. Each [...] "Adaptaplug" [...] had a single-letter code, {{but did not}} provide any other official designation, nor did RadioShack publish the complete specifications and tolerances on barrel and pin dimensions. RadioShack's web site listed the diameters to the nearest 0.1 mm, and sometimes differs slightly from the official EIAJ RC-5320A standard dimensions. This list may include some parts RadioShack has discontinued but are retained here for completeness.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]68 Carbine was {{developed}} as a lighter and more customizable version of the Pro-Lite, featuring a [...]45 grip frame, a simplified feed neck that {{was not part of}} the forearm grip, and now-standard bottom <b>line</b> ASA <b>adapter.</b> Like the Pro-Lite, it was durable, accurate, and required minimal maintenance. The feed neck turned out to be the only weak spot, which led to the development of a new model, a combination of the Pro-Lite forearm breech and the Carbine receiver. This new model was named the Pro-Carbine. Pro-Carbine Barrels will fit Pro-Lite, [...]68 Carbine, and A-5 Models. They will NOT fit the Model 98.|$|R
50|$|The G364 framebuffer was a <b>line</b> of {{graphics}} <b>adapters</b> {{using the}} SGS Thomson INMOS G364 chipset, produced by INMOS (known for their transputer and eventually acquired by SGS Thomson and incorporated into STMicroelectronics) {{in the early}} 1990s. The G364 included a RAMDAC and a 64-bit interface to VRAM graphical memory to implement a framebuffer, but did not include any hardware-based graphical acceleration other than a hardware cursor function.|$|R

40|$|An up to 5 Watts {{wide range}} power supply LED driver {{demonstrator}} with a Piezoelectric Transformer (PT) {{has been built}} to show the static and dynamic behavior as an off-line power supply [1],[2],[5],[6],[7]. The target of the power converter controller using a PT, with 2. 3 mm thickness and 17 mm diameter at frequency of 155 - 175 kHz, designed in a resonant circuit of Class-E topology, is to maintain a constant output current of 290 mA/DC with variable output voltage drop at wide input voltage range of 85 - 250 V/AC. Also, the ZVS (Zero-Voltage-Switching) condition is achieved over the full operation range. The used 1200 V Fieldstop IGBT (1 A-Type) shows losses around 200 mW over the full operating range for constant output current. The paper shows the regulation method for off-line power supplies using PT in Class-E topology in constant current mode regulation (CCMR). The regulation algorithm has been programmed in C language operated by a 32 -bit DSP (TMS 320 F 2812). Besides, in the Class-E application, the duty cycle of the switching frequency needs to be controlled {{in order to achieve}} the ZVS during the operation at different load and input condition [1]. This goal is achievable only by Phase Locked Loop (PLL) feedback in a satisfying way [3]. To solve this problem, the idea of PT with an auxiliary tap has been applied, and it is shown in Fig. 3. The application is suited for low size LED <b>line</b> <b>adapters,</b> to be integrated in bulb sockets. The results are applicable for any controller design of resonant PT stepdown topologies. The several suited optimum control concept is investigated in this paper, considering the circuit expense being minimized...|$|R

Users would tune to the PlayCable channel, which showed a menu of titles that could be played and used a keypad to select the desired game. The adapter would wait for the code of the selected title to show up in the data stream, then download the game to the adapter's internal memory for play.|$|R

Engine companies have a daily minimum staffing of four; one Pump Operator or Acting Pump Operator, one officer (Captain, Lieutenant, or Acting Lieutenant), and two firefighters. Occasionally, when extra staffing exists, certain engine companies may be assigned a third firefighter.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Integrin-{{extracellular matrix}} {{interactions}} activate signaling cascades such as mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK). Integrin binding to extracellular matrix increases tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Inhibition of FAK activity by expression of its carboxyl terminus decreases cell motility, and cells from FAK deficient mice also show reduced migration. Paxillin is a focal adhesion protein {{which is also}} phosphorylated on tyrosine. FAK recruitment of paxillin to the cell membrane correlates with Shc phosphorylation and activation of MAPK. Decreased FAK expression inhibits papilloma formation in a mouse skin carcinogenesis model. We previously demonstrated that MAPK activation was required for growth factor induced in vitro migration and invasion by human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) <b>lines.</b> Methods <b>Adapter</b> protein recruitment to integrin subunits was examined by co-immunoprecipitation in SCC cells attached to type IV collagen or plastic. Stable clones overexpressing FAK or paxillin were created using the lipofection technique. Modified Boyden chambers were used for invasion assays. Results In the present study, we showed that FAK and paxillin but not Shc are recruited to the β 1 integrin cytoplasmic domain following attachment of SCC cells to type IV collagen. Overexpression of either FAK or paxillin stimulated cancer cell migration on type IV collagen and invasion through reconstituted basement membrane which was dependent on MAPK activity. Conclusions We concluded that recruitment of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin to β 1 integrin promoted cancer cell migration via the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway. </p...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of beef carcass {{conformation}} {{carried out}} at a high-performance abattoir line and based on an impedance method Odhad zmasilosti jatečně upraveného těla skotu impedanční metodou na vysoce výkonné porážkové lince Z. BOHUSLÁVEK Czech University of Agriculture in Prague, Technical faculty, Czech Republic ABSTRACT: Using a device (based on a 4 -electrode method) for measuring the values of biological tissue impedance at 2 and 120 kHz, the impedance of 293 beef carcasses was identified during the current operation of a high-performance, modern abattoir <b>line.</b> An <b>adapter</b> with variable distance of needle electrodes and a computer-controlled measuring process enabled a fast impedance scanning process. The values recorded by measurements (impedance – imp 2, 120 (kHz); warm carcass weight – CW; distance of measuring electrodes – D) and the values subsequently derived were estimated as inde-pendent variables, and subsequently their correlation to the estimated commercial classification values (conformation, fatness) was ascertained. The measurements revealed a relationship (r = 0. 8) between conformation and impedance at the frequency of 120 kHz; and a high correlation between “electric volume ” (D 2 /imp 120) at the frequency of 120 kHz and the warm carcass weight (CW), expressed by the correlation coefficient r = 0. 827. Using a stepwise regression analysis, regression formulas for conformation estimation were sought for, and the best model with the coefficient of correlation/ determination (r = 0. 867 /r 2 = 0. 752) was found for the following independent variables: imp 2, D 2 /imp 120, CW and D. The calculated correlation coefficients (r) are lower than those obtained by former measurements using individually inserted electrodes...|$|R
