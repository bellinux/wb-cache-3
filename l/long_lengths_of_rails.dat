30|$|These motions are {{of little}} {{consequence}} for road traffic traveling on pneumatic tires, because the rotations {{of the transition}} span are small (less than 3 °). However, they pose problems for a fixed rail system, which cannot undergo, without yielding, a concentrated rotation at the pivot points. Even if a pin could be introduced, the resulting concentrated rotation would cause impacts that would prove unacceptable to the riders in terms of comfort and safety [2, 3], and would risk causing damage to the mechanism. It was therefore necessary to develop a system that would spread the rotations over a sufficiently <b>long</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> that the resulting curvature induced stresses would be acceptably small, but that would {{at the same time}} provide vertical support for the track at every tie.|$|R

Beuys originally {{created this}} installation for the German pavilion at the 37th Venice Biennale in 1976. Today two copies of the work exist, one in the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, and another in the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin. The work is based upon Beuys' childhood memories of a tram stop in Kleve on Nassauer Allee. The installation consists <b>of</b> a <b>long,</b> rusty <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail,</b> four sections <b>of</b> broad, rusty pipe, and a cannon of the early modern type. The cannon is topped by a cast iron head with a sorrowful expression. These elements are laid parallel to one another on the ground.|$|R

Therefore, it is meaningful that gets the optimum speed of projectile. In this paper, main resistances (plasma viscous drag, inertial drag and air drag) was full considered in the motion process of plasma armature, and the optimization model includes the speed of the armature,driving current and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> were build,then it was optimization calculated with internal penalty function method. The optimization result shows that the launched speed of projectile is maximum when the driving current and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> are fixed value. The purpose lies in adjusting the width and the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> and the distance between two rails so as to adjust the launched speed of projectile.

50|$|If {{the rail}} is held {{so that it}} cannot expand at all, {{then there is no}} limit on the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> that can be handled. The {{expansive}} force in a one-foot <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> at a certain temperature is the same as in a 100 mi <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> Early continuous welded rail was installed in limited <b>lengths</b> only because <b>of</b> technological limitations. However {{at the end of the}} CWR section where it abutted older, ordinary jointed track, that track would be unable to resist the expansive force and the jointed track might be forced to buckle. To prevent that, special expansion switches, sometimes called breathers, were installed. The expansion switches could accommodate a considerable expansive movement—typically four inches (100mm) or so—in the end section of the CWR without passing the movement on to the jointed track.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{investigated}} the effects <b>of</b> short vs. <b>long</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> rectus femoris during eccentric exercise of similar {{range of motion}} on selected muscle damage indicators. METHODS: Using an isokinetic dynamometer at 1. 05 rad/s, 12 healthy male [mean (standard deviation), 21 (2) years] volunteers randomly underwent two exercise sessions, one on each leg, 14 days apart. During each session, subjects had to accomplish 12 sets of 10 maximal voluntary efforts in seated and prone positions to achieve short and <b>long</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> rectus femoris, respectively. Muscle damage indicators [serum creatine kinase activity, delayed onset muscle soreness, range of motion, eccentric peak torque, concentric peak torque and isometric peak torque] were assessed pre-exercise and 24, 48, 72 as well as 96 h post-exercise. FINDINGS: Compared to baseline data, creatine kinase, delayed onset muscle soreness, and range of motion disclosed significant changes at all time points after both exercise sessions (P< 0. 05). However, these muscle damage indicators demonstrated greater changes following exercise at short compared to <b>long</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> rectus femoris (P< 0. 05). Torque assessments also revealed that nine out of 12 and only two out of 12 measurements decreased significantly following short and <b>long</b> <b>length</b> eccentric exercise <b>of</b> rectus femoris, respectively (P< 0. 05).
