Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{was first}} practiced in simple {{form in the}} mid 18th century by jäger- or rifle units. Their tasks {{required}} them to be inconspicuous, and they were issued green and later other drab colour uniforms. With the advent of longer range and more accurate weapons, especially the repeating rifle, camouflage was adopted for the uniforms of all armies, spreading to most forms of military equipment including ships and aircraft. Many modern camouflage textiles address visibility not only to visible <b>light</b> <b>but</b> also near infrared, for concealment from night vision devices. Camouflage is not only visual; heat, sound, magnetism and even smell {{can be used to}} target weapons, and may be intentionally concealed. Some forms of camouflage have elements of scale invariance, designed to disrupt outlines at different distances, typically digital camouflage patterns made of pixels.|$|E

5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a daymark.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} of the shooting, Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> was released with a reminder when it was determined that he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|In 1889 {{there was}} no {{generally}} accepted theory regarding the nature of <b>light</b> <b>but</b> by 1960 the wavelength of specific light spectra could give a more accurate and reproducible value than a prototype metre. In that year the prototype metre {{was replaced by a}} formal definition that defines the metre in terms of the wavelength of specified light spectra. By 1983 it was accepted that the speed of light in vacuum was constant and that this constant provided a more reproducible procedure for measuring length. Therefore, the metre was redefined in terms of the speed of light. These definitions give a much better reproducibility and also allow anyone, anywhere with a suitably equipped laboratory, to make a standard metre.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 1986U2R/ζ and λ rings, there are other extremely faint dust bands in the Uranian ring system. They are invisible during occultations because they have negligible optical depth, though they are bright in forward-scattered light. Voyager 2s images of forward-scattered light revealed the existence of bright dust bands between the λ and δ rings, between the η and β rings, and between the α ring and ring 4. Many of these bands were detected again in 2003–2004 by the Keck Telescope and during the 2007 ring-plane crossing event in backscattered <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> their precise locations and relative brightnesses were different from during the Voyager observations. The normal optical depth of the dust bands is about 10−5 or less. The dust particle size distribution is thought to obey a power law with the index p=2.5±0.5.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{originally}} intended to finish the series in a single volume titled A Memory of <b>Light,</b> <b>but</b> when Sanderson began writing the book it became clear a split was required as it was believed a single volume would be too large to print. The expected final book was then split into three volumes: The Gathering Storm, Towers of Midnight, and A Memory of Light. The books would be published a year apart with the first volume, The Gathering Storm, published on October 27, 2009; a week earlier than originally announced. Upon its release, it immediately rose to the No. 1 position on The New York Times hardcover fiction Best Seller list, making it the fifth consecutive Wheel of Time book to achieve this feat.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E

5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely <b>light</b> <b>but</b> very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stony corals}} extend their tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles which are then pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E
5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in <b>light</b> <b>but</b> not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E

5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed <b>Light,</b> <b>but</b> took on a life all their own. Shed Light’s most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect <b>light</b> <b>but</b> not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds.

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{a ring of}} four ganglia, {{positioned}} around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of ventral nerve cords connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. Most nemerteans have various chemoreceptors, and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup ocelli. These ocelli can detect <b>light</b> <b>but</b> can not form an image. Nemerteans respire through the skin. They have at least two lateral vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, flame cells are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.|$|E
5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim <b>light</b> <b>but</b> not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Caligari {{was filmed}} in the Lixie-Atelier film studio (formerly owned by Continental-Kunstfilm) at 9 Franz Joseph-Strasse (now Max Liebermannstraße), Weißensee, a {{north-eastern}} suburb of Berlin. Decla {{had been making}} films at the Lixie studio since October 1919, having previously released three titles, Die Pest in Florenz (1919) and the two parts of Fritz Lang's The Spiders (Die Spinnen). The relatively small size of the studio (built some five years earlier in 1914) meant most of the sets used in the film do not exceed six meters in width and depth. Certain elements from the original script had to be cut from the film due to the limited space, including a procession of gypsies, a handcart pushed by Dr. Caligari, Jane's carriage, and a chase scene involving horse-cabs. Likewise, the script called for a fairground scene with roundabouts, barrel organs, sideshow barkers, performers and menageries, none {{of which could be}} achieved in the restrictive space. Instead, the scenes use a painting of the Holstenwall town as a background; throngs of people walk around two spinning merry-go-round props, which creates the impression of a carnival. The script also made references to modern elements like telephones, telegrams and electric <b>light,</b> <b>but</b> they were eliminated during the filming, leaving the final film's setting with no indication of a specific time period.|$|E
