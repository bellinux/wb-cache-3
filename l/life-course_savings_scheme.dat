40|$|In the Netherlands, {{a unique}} though {{controversial}} <b>life-course</b> <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> (‘levensloopregeling’) {{will be introduced}} in January 2006. This paper discusses the origins of this scheme {{as an example of}} policy adjustment, which aims {{to strike a balance between}} new individual and collective labour relations. It appears that the standardised sequence of education, working and retirement has evolved into an erratic and less-predictable labour market pattern. Accordingly, a change in the nature of external and susceptible risks has occurred. The paper discusses the introduction of the <b>life-course</b> <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> which gained political momentum when the need for cost containment of both the early retirement provisions and wage control were combined, culminating in a broad social pact between the government and social partners. We conclude that the management of social risks should be evaluated not only in terms of the ‘combination scenario’ as a particular form of a transitional labour market model, but also as an indicator for the current reform of the corporatist welfare state...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{adds to the}} {{literature}} in three key areas. First of all, it adapts two energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes,</b> namely the DL signalling based scheme and the UL signalling based scheme to the PCC HetNet architecture, where a master-slave relationship exists between the macro cell and small cells. It also introduces a novel database-aided energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> which combines the advantages of both the UL and DL signalling-based schemes while mitigating their drawbacks. Secondly, it defines a typical small cell BS in the PCC architecture and derives a power model to characterize small cell BS energy consumption for the different energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally, it characterizes the connection latencies introduced by the different energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes</b> and quantifies {{the impact of these}} connection delays on the realizable energy savings and user throughput. The next section introduces the system model considered.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} three energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes</b> based {{on the concept of}} macro-assisted UE small cell connection establishment, made possible by the PCC architecture, allowing small cells to be put to a sleep state when not needed. Two of these schemes, namely the DL signalling based energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> and the UL signalling based energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> are an adaptation of state-of-the-art schemes to the PCC architecture, while the third scheme, the database-aided scheme, is natively enabled by the PCC architecture. The implementation of these schemes at low overhead for the network is made possible by a novel heuristic algorithm which connects a UE to a suitable small cell offering the highest SINR when a data connection is needed. Additionally, we have derived a power consumption model for a representative PCC small cell which allows to quantify the percentage of energy consumed by a small cell in the sleep state with respect to a small cell in the on state for the various energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes.</b> Furthermore, we have determined the time required to perform a macro-assisted UE-small cell connection for each energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme,</b> representing the delay before a UE can receive user data from a small cell.|$|R
30|$|We adapt two energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes</b> {{based on}} sleep mode techniques, namely a {{downlink}} (DL) signalling-based scheme and an uplink (UL) signalling-based scheme [6], originally proposed for traditional heterogeneous networks (HetNets), to the PCC architecture, {{to demonstrate how}} macro-assisted UE-small cell connection establishment procedures {{can be used to}} realize energy savings without impacting user QoS. A third energy <b>savings</b> <b>scheme</b> natively enabled by the PCC architecture, the database-aided scheme, is also presented. This scheme has been proposed by the authors in [4, 5] and aims at combining the advantages of the two schemes above to realize more energy savings. We apply the heuristic algorithm introduced in this paper to quantify the achieved energy savings and user QoS realizable with these three energy <b>savings</b> <b>schemes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Within {{two years}} of its {{transformation}} from a pilot project to an on-going savings programme for smallholders, the Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme's</b> balances increased from Sh 2 million to almost Sh 37 million, {{and the number of}} depositors exceeded 110, 000. By the close of 1974 these balances will no doubt exceed Sh 60 million, belonging to 150, 000 co-operators. Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> balances have a considerable impact on cooperative finance and at the close of 1973 exceeded by Sh 22 million the amount of loans outstanding on the books of participating societies under the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme, a companion programme. The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> operates in rural areas only and most depositors are members of primary coffee marketing societies. The Cooperative <b>Savings</b> <b>Scheme</b> exhibits several operational and management problems and cannot yet be considered mature. However, its performance during a period of generally favourable conditions in the smallholder coffee sector suggests that considerable rural savings capacity exists among small cash crop farmers and that this capacity is not tapped by financial institutions other than cooperatives. Savings is defined simply as deferred consumption, and the financier's view of savings as a funds flow phenomenon is more relevant to rural development than are considerations of savings as an institutional phenomenon motivated by long run considerations...|$|R
