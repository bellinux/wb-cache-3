25|$|In {{more recent}} times Auslan {{has seen a}} {{significant}} amount of lexical borrowing from American Sign Language (ASL), especially in signs for technical terms. Some of these arose from the signed English educational philosophies of the 1970s and 80s, when a committee <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> with direct equivalence to English words found them in ASL and/or in invented English-based signed systems used in North America and introduced them in the classroom. ASL contains many signs initialised from an alphabet which was also derived from LSF, and Auslan users, already familiar with the related ISL alphabet, accepted many of the new signs easily.|$|E
25|$|Coastal Command Spitfires and Lockheed Hudsons of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit {{flew from}} Norway to the Spanish border to {{photograph}} German-occupied ports, <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> of invasion preparations. Nothing was revealed {{until the second}} week of August, when accumulations of barges were found and interpreted as an invasion preparation. In the meantime, Bomber Command sent its bombers nightly against the German ports, aircraft industry and airfields when unable to bomb the primary target. The Blenheims of 2 Group made daylight attacks on airfields occupied by the Luftwaffe. In July ports and shipping were made the priority target but until the ports filled with invasion craft in August, Bomber Command continued to attack industry and Luftwaffe ground facilities. The Germans had 400 airfields available and dispersed aircraft around them, making bombing ineffectual. These targets were defended by large concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery, making ground strafing too risky. The Blenheims were vulnerable to fighter attack and the crews had orders to abandon raids unless there was 7/10ths cloud {{and by the end of}} June, 90 percent of sorties were cancelled. The Blenheims—with some Fairey Battles returned from France—began to fly on moonlit nights. In July 1940, Bomber Command lost 72 aircraft carrying out these operations.|$|E

Derby finished fourth in 1969–70, and then strengthened again from a player Taylor had scouted, signing midfielder Archie Gemmill from Preston North End for £64,000. Most signings involved scouting from Taylor, with the only two transfers he had played no part in being Clough's former Sunderland teammates Colin Todd and John O'Hare. Following a ninth-place finish in 1970–71, Derby {{went on to win}} the League Championship in 1971–72 – the first in the club's history. Clough and Taylor continued to strengthen the club in the transfer market however, with Taylor noting that [...] "a manager should always be <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>signs</b> of disintegration in a winning side and then sell the players responsible before their deterioration is noticed by possible buyers".|$|E

Orin Kerr noted the many questions asked about how the pagers and other technologies work, and how that lack of familiarity reinforced, in his view, the need for caution, quoting from one of his own papers: [...] "Judges who attempt to use the Fourth Amendment to craft broad regulatory rules covering new technologies run an unusually high risk of crafting rules based on incorrect assumptions of context and technological practice".|$|E

2500|$|On 3 May, British {{aircraft}} were detailed {{for special}} counter-attack reconnaissance, after {{the experience of}} the new German tactics of lightly holding the front line and counter-attacking with reserves and Eingreif divisions.

Bombardments from both sides and infantry attacks and counter-attacks, made the battlefield so chaotic that observers were not able to see clearly, except for those of 43 Squadron, who saw German troops massing opposite the XIII Corps front. Five Sopwith 1½ Strutters were sent from the squadron to attack the German infantry and machine-gunned them from low-altitude attacks on other bodies of troops were carried out in the afternoon. Tactical bombing took place, with attacks on the stations at Don, Busigny Junction, Brebières and the aerodrome at Eswars. After dark bombing continued on trains and three were hit by low-level attacks of the night-bombing specialists of 100 Squadron, along with railway junctions and Tourmignies airfield.|$|E

[...] Puyi always had a strong cruel streak, and he imposed harsh [...] "house rules" [...] on his staff; servants were flogged in the basement for such offenses as [...] "irresponsible conversations".

He counted all except himself, and then cried out that somebody was missing!
