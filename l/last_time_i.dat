25|$|In April and May 2012, McTell {{undertook}} a short tour of Australia. McTell's 2012 UK tour, branded “An English Heartbeat”, commenced in October, {{and saw the}} release of a CD of guitar instrumentals called Sofa Noodling. In an interview published ahead of his 2013 “One More for the Road” tour, McTell said, “It could be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> do a big tour... {{this is the beginning of}} slowing things down”.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> beg you in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

500|$|On September 30, 2006, Shirley {{issued a}} further {{statement}} claiming {{he had not}} been paid for his work, and had received threats and insults from people associated with the band: [...] "I've just mixed a really wonderful band with one of the worst sounding recordings ever. It's kinda disgraceful that they won't spend anything on a decent recording! I won't say who, because <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> commented on a sloppy recording (on this page), they refused to pay me and I got all manner of threats and insults from people associated with the band, so I'd best be quiet!" ...|$|E
500|$|A Game Boy Color {{version of}} Jet Force Gemini was in {{development}} in 2000, but was ultimately cancelled. The {{owner of the}} prototype cartridge has attested that the game appears to be nearly complete, though it was never officially announced by either Rare or Nintendo. In an October 2012 interview, former Rare designer and producer Martin Wakeley commented: [...] "Jet Force Gemini on the Gameboy was the only occasion I can remember Rare outsourcing anything. It was being done by Bits Studios and was nearly done <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw it, I’m not sure what happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|In Stage one (obedience and {{punishment}} driven), individuals {{focus on the}} direct {{consequences of their actions}} on themselves. For example, an action is perceived as morally wrong because the perpetrator is punished. [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> did that I got spanked, so I will not do it again." [...] The worse the punishment for the act is, the more [...] "bad" [...] the act is perceived to be. This can give rise to an inference that even innocent victims are guilty in proportion to their suffering. It is [...] "egocentric", lacking recognition that others' points of view are different from one's own. There is [...] "deference to superior power or prestige".|$|E

500|$|Killebrew {{was known}} for his quick hands and {{exceptional}} upper-body strength, demonstrated by several [...] "tape measure" [...] home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes. Abandoning vaulting poles in the stadium, with no intention of ever competing again, Jenner stated that: [...] "In 1972, I {{made the decision that}} I would go four years and totally dedicate myself to what I was doing, and then I would move on after it was over with. I went into that competition knowing that would be the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> would ever do this." [...] Jenner explained, [...] "It hurts every day when you practice hard. Plus, when this decathlon is over, I got {{the rest of my life}} to recuperate. Who cares how bad it hurts?" ...|$|E
500|$|Shirley {{replaced}} {{thousands of}} cymbal and drum hits with those used on previous recordings; the process took {{several days to}} complete. After recording the DVD, the band used a sprinkler system with diluted water rather than a bucket with blood that was like tar when recording the DVD. King later remarked, [...] "My guitar didn’t like it, that was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> played it," [...] and he donated it to the Hard Rock Cafe after the show. Vocalist Tom Araya felt the same and admitted; [...] "It was messy. I couldn't play because the initial dump {{at the beginning of}} the song got all over me. I couldn't hold my pick. I was slapping my bass trying to get sound out of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Brown had a {{difficult}} childhood; after her divorce, his working mother received welfare benefits. Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that was the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> ever stole." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I'll {{be back in}} {{baseball}} after the war", he had said on his last leave before going overseas. [...] Gedeon's cousin recalled: [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> saw him, he told me, 'I had my accident. It's {{going to be good}} flying from now on.' He said he had used up his bad luck." [...] In February 1943, the Associated Press ran a feature story about Gedeon's war service under the headline: [...] "Gedeon Will Return to Baseball If War Doesn’t Last Too Long." [...] Gedeon was quoted in the article as saying [...] "he hopes to pick up after the war where he left off." [...] He added that [...] "it's a matter of time." [...] "If the war ends before I’m past the playing age I’ll return to the game. [...] If I’m too old, I’ll do something else." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{distinctive}} part of Raonic's game is his powerful and accurate serve, from which his [...] "Missile" [...] nickname is derived. He is frequently cited as {{having one of}} the best serves among his contemporaries, along with Karlović and Isner. Some consider Raonic's serve to be among the best of all time. Sampras, Raonic's childhood idol, describes the Canadian's serve as [...] "bigger than big." [...] After a match against Raonic, Djokovic commented [...] "I can't recall the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was feeling so helpless returning. Even his second serve." [...] Women's tennis player Serena Williams has said that [...] "If she could take one thing from another player, it would be Milos Raonic's serve." [...] Statistically, Raonic is among the strongest servers in the Open Era, winning 91% of service games to rank third all-time. Raonic has one of the fastest recorded serves of all time.|$|E

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became {{well known}} for {{creating}} Broadway hits with other partners. [...] Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms (1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940). [...] Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: [...] On Your Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the [...] "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" [...] scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. [...] Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie (1924), The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat (1927). [...] Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, [...] "The <b>Last</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Saw Paris", which {{was included in the}} 1941 film Lady Be Good.|$|E
500|$|Since 2011, Genesis have {{expressed}} mixed opinions about a reunion. Collins {{retired from the}} music industry as an active musician that year in favour of family commitments and has stated {{he can no longer}} play the drums due to medical issues. Hackett has said [...] "I would say it's possible, but highly improbable. I've always been open to it. I'm not the guy who says no." [...] Gabriel addressed the possibility of a reunion: [...] "I never say never. It really didn't happen <b>last</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> think there's a small chance, but I don't think it's very high." [...] In 2014, Collins reiterated, [...] "Have people thought it through? It’s not as if you’re going to get Peter as the singer, me as the drummer. I can’t play any more, so it’s never going to happen," [...] adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs Collins originally sang lead on.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Studio City, California on Stage 17 at CBS Studio Center. It was filmed on April 10, 11, and 13, 2006. The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When we got to the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> stood in Will's kitchen. That was the most colorful position for me, standing there and stirring something. It was my pulpit, the place where I delivered my best jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|Next was Psychosis facing SmackDown! superstar and ECW Original Rey Mysterio, Jr. Mysterio won {{the match}} at the seven-minute mark after {{delivering}} a 619, {{followed by the}} West Coast Pop. The two later revealed that they were disappointed with the way their match panned out. After the contest, the SmackDown! crusaders entered the Hammerstein Ballroom. They consisted of Kurt Angle, JBL and his Cabinet, Carlito and Matt Morgan. The crowd chanted, [...] "You Suck Dick" [...] and [...] "Fuck You SmackDown!" [...] {{as they entered the}} arena. Joel Gertner attempted to interview the invaders, but Angle took the microphone out of his hand and JBL pushed him to the ground. JBL and Angle cut a promo, with the crowd continuing to chant, [...] "You Suck Dick", to which Angle replied [...] with [...] "Your MOTHER taught me how". Angle stated, [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was at an ECW event I walked out halfway through because it sucked" [...] (referring to the time Sandman was crucified). The crowd continued to chant, [...] "Shut the Fuck Up", while JBL spoke.|$|E
500|$|... "See You Again" [...] is a pop rock {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and ten seconds. The songs {{contains}} numerous influences from electronic, new wave, and techno music. The song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time and has a fast tempo of 138 beats per minute. It is written in the key of A minor and Cyrus' vocals span one octave, from G3 to A4. Throughout the song, Cyrus' edgy and sultry vocal performance maintains in the contralto range. The lyrics of [...] "See You Again" [...] are about a teenage romance. In verses, Cyrus discusses her sentiments and perceptions about her love interest, such as believing the couple had previously encountered in a previous incarnation. [...] "See You Again"'s refrains detail previous scenes of an encounter between the couple: [...] "The <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> freaked out / I just kept looking down / I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I’m thinking ‘bout." [...] Towards the conclusion of the refrains, Cyrus vows to redeem herself.|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} scene with Daenerys Targaryen {{emerging}} from the great fire of the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the filming took place in two different locations, with the close ups of Emilia Clarke taking place on a closed set in Belfast, and the large-scale set shots taking place in Spain. In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the <b>last</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!" [...] She continued, [...] "Taking off my clothes is not the easiest thing, but with the magic of the effects, I don't have to do a season 1 and go on a cliff and do it, I'm in control of it." ...|$|E
