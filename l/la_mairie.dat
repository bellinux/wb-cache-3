5000|$|Even in the {{lifetime}} of Madame de Maintenon, many establishments were set up or transformed {{on the model of}} the Maison, generally by the Maison's former students. In 1705 one of those students, Madame de la Viefville or Viesville, aged only 28, became abbess of the Bernardine convent at Gomerfontaine, in the diocese of Beauvais, near Trie (present day Trie-Château). She had joined a convent at Argensol on leaving the Maison and the first thing she did on her appointment as abbess was to ask Madame de Maintenon her opinions and for the honour of her protection, in reply to which she began by her sending her Mademoiselle d'Aumale [...] "to help better raise her students and assist in her councils". In 1712, Madame de <b>la</b> <b>Mairie,</b> another alumna of Saint-Cyr, reformed the convent at Bisy on advice from Madame de Maintenon, who wrote to de <b>la</b> <b>Mairie</b> in May that year: Both Viefville and Mairie made their establishments give a similar education to that of the Maison, and many other alumnae also became teachers, whilst other alumnae entered convents and passed on the Maison's teaching methods at ground level in all the major convents, which began to take more account of their pupils' teaching and wellbeing rather than putting religious education above all else.|$|E
50|$|<b>La</b> <b>Mairie</b> (Town Hall) in Yanaon is {{now called}} as Municipality Building.

The children; François Gelbert, Gilbert and Maxime Allouche that Chaumet saved their lives, attended the commemoration to honour her. Also, she was commemorated in Israel as she saved the lives of Jewish children during WWII in France.

5000|$|Its grid layout {{follows the}} {{standards}} of the typical Bastides grid. The basic architectural element is the central square boarded by arcades and stone and half-timbered houses. This square was the market place and the center of the communities’ economy. The market hall (market building) in the central square was built with stone and with wooden pillars. Now it hosts the Town Hall (Place de <b>la</b> <b>Mairie),</b> which has a beautiful steeple with clock. This Town Hall was better known as “maison commune”. Apart from that central square, Saint-Clar has one more arcaded square, both just a few steps away from each other. This is located in the south, in the original village, in the “castet bielh” (old quarter).|$|E
50|$|Venables {{comprises}} the main village and several hamlets within {{an area of}} 14.87 km2. The main village {{is located at the}} top of the hill and centers around the town church. It also contains the village elementary school and <b>La</b> <b>Mairie</b> (town hall). The hamlets include: La Mare (Hamlet of the Lake) located in the valley below the main village; La Rive (Hamlet on the River Bank) located along the banks of the Seine; Lormais which is nestled between the Seine river and the hills; Moulin a Vent (Hamlet of the Windmill) located at the edge of the Madrie Plateau; Val d'Ailly (Hamlet of the Ailly Valley) where only a 16th-century manor house and its surrounding farm remain which was a residence of the Charadas families and Mangin (a French naval officer at the turn of the century); and lastly Fontaine-La-Verte (Hamlet of the Green Fountain) which derives its name from the many springs that flow through the flowering ground cover.|$|E
5000|$|The commune's {{territory}} is underlain in its totality by Variscan basement rocks (Piégut-Pluviers Granodiorite). Transgressing the basement from the West are liassic sediments {{belonging to the}} Aquitanian Basin. The base conglomerate can be seen near La Chapoulie. Stratigraphically higher follow arkoses, dolostones and limestones. A NW-SE striking fault zone originating in Nontron traverses the territory and raises the Northeastern basement block. Movements along this fault zone must {{have been going on}} well into the Pleistocene, because one can observe stream rejuvenation along some of the southwestward-draining creeks. This fault zone is strongly mineralised in mainly baryte, but there is also galena, sphalerite, pyrite and the rather rare cadmium mineral greenockite. This fault zone has been mined in the past, the shaft of the mine de <b>la</b> <b>Mairie</b> [...] still {{can be seen in the}} village. Associated with the ores is an intensive recrystallization and silicification of the country rocks along the fault line. Between 1825 and 1850 manganese was mined near Talivaud in the contact region between the arkoses and the overlying Sidérolithique, iron-rich Tertiary sediments.|$|E
