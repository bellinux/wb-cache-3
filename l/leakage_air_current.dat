40|$|One of {{the most}} {{troublesome}} complications is intraoperative or prolonged <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> from the lung. Advances in surgical techniques, {{including the use of}} stapling devices, have minimized but not abolished such complications. Lung parenchymal defects are difficult to suture often both damages the normal lung and fails to stop the <b>air</b> <b>leakage.</b> <b>Current</b> methods including the use of various sealants, are ineffective in the closure of intraoperative air leaks, resulting in a increased patient morbidity, delayed removal of thoracic tubes, and prolonged hospitalization. We present the development of a novel lung air leak sealant using tissue engineered cell sheets. Cell sheets immediately and permanently seal air leaks in a dynamic function that allows for the extensive tissue contraction and expansion involved in respiration, with no postoperative recurrences. Moreover, we demonstrate that host mesothelial cells can migrate to cover the transplanted cells sheets, thereby confirming excellent biocompatibility and integration with host tissues. Finally, we show the use of skin fibroblasts as an effective autologous cell source that can be easily applied. This study shows for the first time, the development of an immediate and permanent lung air leak sealant, suitable for future clinical applications...|$|R

40|$|In {{one type}} of duct {{efficiency}} retrofit, additional insulation is added to a duct system that is already insulated. For example, a layer of R- 4 insulation might be: added to a duct system that already has R- 4 installed. It is possible that [...] either by chance or by design [...] the add-on layer, while not stopping duct leaks, might cause the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> to flow longitudinally for a distance, parallel to the duct, before it finds {{a way out of}} the newly added outer layer. This could happen by chance if the outer and inner layers of insulation have seams at different locations. Perhaps more usefully, if such longitudinal displacement of the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> turned out to be useful, it might be designed into the makeup of the outer insulation layer intended to be used in the retrofit. It is plausible that this <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> might serve a useful function in keeping the insulation layer warmer (or, in the air-conditioning mode, cooler) than it would be in the absence of the leakage. By being held close to the ducts for a while, it might establish an artificially warmer (or cooler, in air conditioning) zone around the ducts. To the extent that this effect would reduce the heat losses from the ducts, the leakage should be credited with a ''thermal regain'' in the same way that leakage into buffer zones is credited with thermal regain when the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> warms (or cools) the buffer zone relative to the temperature it would have in the absence of such duct leakage. The purpose of this report is to investigate whether and to what extent such thermal regain exists. The model developed below applies to a situation where there are two distinct layers of insulation around the duct, with <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> moving between them in a longitudinal direction for a distance before it finds its way out from the outer insulation layer. It may also apply approximately where there is a single insulation layer with an air barrier on the outside. <b>Leakage</b> <b>air</b> may pass into the insulation itself and thence longitudinally through the insulation material until it finds an opening in the air barrier through which it can escape...|$|R

The experiments were performed at the low speed cascade wind tunnel (NGG) of the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), GÃ¶ttingen. The investigated cascade consists of three large nozzle guide vanes. The effect of tip leakage flow was simulated by blow-off air. This was ejected through a leakage gap in the side wall closely upstream of the cascade. To investigate the different, possible constructive solutions of tip clearances, at least two different blowing directions were investigated: tangential and perpendicular to the mainstream at three different mass flow ratios. The influence of inlet turbulence was investigated too, applying an active turbulence grid in the intake. To get a realistic temperature gradient the <b>leakage</b> <b>air</b> was cooled down by a heat exchanger to adjust a distinctive temperature difference to the mainstream.

40|$|The {{most common}} method of {{measuring}} <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> is to perform single (or solo) blower door pressurization and/or depressurization test. In detached housing, the single blower door test measures leakage {{to the outside}}. In attached housing, however, this "solo" test method measures both <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> to the outside and <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> between adjacent units through common surfaces. Although minimizing leakage to neighboring units is highly recommended to avoid indoor air quality issues between units, reduce pressure differentials between units, and control stack effect, the energy benefits of air sealing can be significantly overpredicted if the solo <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> number {{is used in the}} energy analysis. Guarded blower door testing is more appropriate for isolating and measuring leakage to the outside in attached housing.

The propagation of local arcs is necessary for a flashover to occur on an ice-covered insulator. It was supposed that the local AC arc extended when it satisfied the arc re-ignition conditions. Therefore, the minimum applied voltage for maintaining an arc burning steadily across an air gap under various conditions is a major parameter and it is referred as arc maintenance. Although ANNs have usually achieved good performances in several domains, those performances and the ANN training process are directly influenced by an appropriate choice of the network architecture.

This <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> adversely affects the gas drainage efficiency. Despite the extensive research conducted on air-leakage prevention strategies, the effects of coal properties on the <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> {{has not yet been}} properly investigated. This paper presents a fully-coupled numerical study on the effects of coal properties such as Young 2 Ì 7 s modulus, Poisson 2 Ì 7 s ratio and porosity on the <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> into drainage boreholes. This was achieved through an integrated approach of the orthogonal design method and the F-test theory.

METHODS: Patients undergoing elective pulmonary lobectomy who had grade 1 or 2 <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> (evaluated by the water submersion test) after primary stapling and limited suturing were randomised at 12 European centres to open-label treatment with TachoSilÂ® or standard surgical treatment (resuturing, stapling or no further treatment at the surgeons' discretion). Randomisation was performed during surgery using a centralised interactive voice response system. Duration of postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> (primary end point), reduction of intra-operative <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> intensity (secondary end point) and adverse events (AEs), including postoperative complications, were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 486 patients were screened and 299 received trial treatment (intent-to-treat (ITT) population: TachoSilÂ®, n= 148; standard treatment, n= 151). TachoSilÂ® resulted in a reduction in the duration of postoperative <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> (p= 0. 030). Patients in the TachoSilÂ® group also experienced a greater reduction in intra-operative <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> intensity (p= 0. 042). Median time until chest drain removal was 4 days with TachoSilÂ® and 5 days in the standard group (p= 0. 054). There was no difference between groups in hospital length of stay.

This paper presents the methodology used in an experimental study, conducted to measure multizone <b>air</b> <b>leakages,</b> using the guarded zone pressurization technique. We developed a detailed innovative database with 456 exterior and internal partition wall <b>air</b> <b>leakage</b> measurements, taken in 23 detached houses.
