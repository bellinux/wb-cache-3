5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) {{a short distance}} after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, <b>left-hand</b> entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional flyovers. In 2008, interchange reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the <b>left-hand</b> entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining <b>left-hand</b> entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|E

5|$|Although {{all of the}} {{original}} Class A1 locomotives were eventually rebuilt to Class A3 specifications, it was a drawn-out process that lasted until 1949; 60068 Sir Visto was the last locomotive to be converted.

5|$|Bernhard {{was caught}} by Duval and used his car's hybrid boost system on the Kemmel straight, moving ahead of the German under braking for Les Combes corner. Fässler briefly {{pressured}} Bernhard before entering the pit lane for a scheduled stop and Lotterer took over his seat. Lotterer lapped in the 1:58 second range which allowed him to run 12 seconds behind race leader Dumas. Bonanomi's <b>left-hand</b> window became detached on the Kemmel straight, necessitating an extra pit stop for a replacement window. Patrick Dempsey spun the No. 77 car at the Bus Stop chicane, forcing several drivers to take avoiding action. Trummer drove into his garage with back-end technical problems with his car and retired. Dempsey's co-driver Marco Seefried spun and heavily struck the <b>left-hand</b> turn tyre barrier before Pouhon corner.|$|E
5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of <b>left-hand</b> fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists.|$|E

5|$|The panel {{may have}} been {{conceived}} as either the <b>left-hand</b> wing of a since dismantled diptych, or as the front piece of a double-sided panel. Art historian Erwin Panofsky suggests that the Washington Saint George and the Dragon of 1432–35 {{is the most likely}} opposite wing. In that work, St. George, facing inwards and to the right, slays the dragon before a Libyan princess. Although the pairing might seem incongruous, his Madonna Standing is widely thought to have been attached with the St. Catherine of Alexandria in Vienna. In both panels, the saints face inwards and are within fully realised landscapes. In contrast, in both <b>left-hand</b> panels, the Madonna and Child are positioned frontally (although eye contact is avoided) and isolated within cold grisaille architectural spaces.|$|E
5|$|After the I-95 interchange, Route 37 widens {{to three}} lanes in each direction. The freeway crosses Jefferson Boulevard and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor {{railroad}} on twin-span bridges and passes {{to the north}} of the Lincoln Park Cemetery before interchanging with US 1 at exits 5A-B. The freeway terminates at a trumpet interchange with US 1, with the two <b>left-hand</b> lanes defaulting onto US 1 north and the right-hand lane serving US 1 south, which connects to T. F. Green Airport.|$|E

5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with <b>left-hand</b> entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the <b>left-hand</b> exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a <b>left-hand</b> drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of <b>left-hand</b> export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E

5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the <b>left-hand</b> technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|It {{only took}} three minutes of extra {{time for the}} first goal to be scored. Thompson passed to Byrne, who cross was headed into the Leeds goal by Hunt. Liverpool's lead was {{short-lived}} as Leeds equalised eight minutes later. Norman Hunter crossed {{the ball into the}} Liverpool penalty area from the <b>left-hand</b> side of the pitch. Charlton headed the ball down to Bremner, whose shot beat Lawrence in the Liverpool goal to level the score at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{the strains}} in the piece, the final D strain {{is perhaps the}} most interesting. It is written in B-flat minor. When Joplin used minor keys in the {{previous}} sections, he used the relative key of G minor (i.e., relative to the main key of B-flat major). However, in this fourth section, he instead used the parallel key. This strain also features sections where the right hand and left hand play notes in unison, and in which the standard 2/4 time <b>left-hand</b> beat is noticeably absent.|$|E
