5|$|In 1994, {{she first}} met Trinny Woodall {{at a party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley. Though they did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at first, the two women {{proceeded}} to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style guide for The Daily Telegraph which ran successfully for seven years. The column promoted affordable high-street fashion and they used themselves to illustrate which clothing suited which figure. Constantine and Woodall also became the co-founders of Ready2shop.com, a dot-com, but the business venture failed, and investors subsequently lost a reputed £10 million.|$|E

5|$|During auditions for {{the school}} play, a romantic tension builds between Sunny and Zeke and {{they are asked to}} play the lead roles. Sunny quits the play when she realises that she has to kiss Zeke. Sunny then finds out that Zeke is 'Lost Boy', but she forgives him. When she sees Donna Freedman practising the kissing scene with Zeke, Sunny becomes upset. Sunny and Zeke almost share a kiss one night when they are alone. However, they are {{interrupted}} by Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine). Due to rewrites of the play, Sunny's new character has to kiss Zeke too and Sunny grows uncomfortable again. During drama camp, Sunny and Zeke are locked in a cupboard during a game of truth or dare. They almost kiss again, but are interrupted when the door is opened. Karl realises that Sunny and Zeke <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and he tries to keep them apart. However, they eventually start a relationship.|$|E
5|$|In 1308, Edward's {{marriage}} to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his custos regni {{in charge of}} the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was unusual, and involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's dower and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Henry rebuilt his {{alliance}} with Fulk of Anjou, {{this time by}} marrying Matilda to Fulk's eldest son, Geoffrey. The pair were betrothed in 1127 and married the following year. It is unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping his son-in-law's status deliberately uncertain. Similarly, although Matilda was granted a number of Normandy castles {{as part of her}} dowry, it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. Fulk left Anjou for Jerusalem in 1129, declaring Geoffrey the Count of Anjou and Maine. The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and the disputed castles proved a point of contention, resulting in Matilda returning to Normandy later that year. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but in 1131 the couple were reconciled. Much to the pleasure and relief of Henry, Matilda then gave birth to a sequence of two sons, Henry and Geoffrey, in 1133 and 1134.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} proved difficult, as {{the couple}} did not particularly <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, {{but it was}} not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them. It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain. Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy. Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131. Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August. It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey {{at a meeting of the}} King's great council in September. The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.|$|E
25|$|Here, an R-pronoun is a {{reflexive}} pronoun (like herself) or reciprocal pronoun (<b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other).</b> The minimal governing category (or MGC) is defined, broadly, as {{the smallest}} category that contains both the pronoun and a governor of that pronoun.|$|E
25|$|Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine {{teamed up}} in 1994 to write Ready to Wear, a weekly style {{guide for the}} Daily Telegraph which ran for seven years. They had {{previously}} met {{at a dinner party}} hosted by David, Viscount Linley but did not actually <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at first. They both perceived each other in negative ways: Woodall looked upon Constantine as if she was a stuck-up English aristocrat and Constantine saw Woodall as 'Eurotrash'.|$|E

Steve and Jefferson do not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> for personal reasons. In several episodes, Jefferson is implied to have had a past life as a former spy/CIA operative.|$|E
25|$|The way a DP can bind {{given this}} domain {{depends on the}} kind of that DP that is being bound. Anaphors (reflexives pronouns like herself and reciprocals <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other)</b> must be bound in their domain, meaning they must have a c-commanding {{antecedent}} in their domain. Pronouns (such as she or he) must not be bound in their domain, meaning they cannot have a c-commanding antecedent in their domain. Finally, R-expressions (such as proper names, descriptions, or epithets) must not be bound, meaning they must not have a c-commanding antecedent at all.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen and Sperrle made an {{effective}} team in Spain. Sperrle was an experienced officer and was intelligent, {{with a good}} reputation. Richthofen was considered a good leader in combat. They combined to disagree with Franco {{on a number of}} topics and debates could become heated. Both men were blunt, and although the Germans and Spanish did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they had a healthy respect which translated into {{an effective}} working relationship. Richthofen even learned a little Spanish and Italian, an effort appreciated by the Nationalist officers.|$|E

25|$|Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till): Travis is a {{childhood}} friend from Tennessee. It is said in the movie that they both used to <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> when they were younger. The two become reacquainted during Miley's return to Tennessee in Hannah Montana: The Movie. He discovers that Miley is Hannah Montana and the two kiss, assuming that they get together. However, even though the movie does not show it, it is implied that they broke up {{due to the fact}} that Miley went back to California and their relationship would not work long distance. Also, he is not mentioned during the episodes following the movie.|$|E
25|$|Psychometricians {{have also}} {{developed}} methods {{for working with}} large matrices of correlations and covariances. Techniques in this general tradition include: factor analysis, a method of determining the underlying dimensions of data; multidimensional scaling, a method for finding a simple representation for data {{with a large number}} of latent dimensions; and data clustering, an approach to finding objects that are <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, structural equation modeling and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.|$|E
25|$|The {{advance of}} Reynier's corps to Reggio deeply troubled Craig and Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood. Fearing a French {{invasion}} of Sicily, the two procured reinforcements from Malta. Soon after, the sick Craig {{went home to}} be succeeded by John Stuart and Collingwood appointed Rear Admiral Sidney Smith to command the local Royal Navy squadron. Stuart and Smith did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> but they agreed to cooperate {{in the defense of}} Sicily. However, Smith's stories of his actions at the 1799 Siege of Acre greatly irritated Stuart. Deciding that a raid on Calabria might forestall a French invasion of Sicily, Smith's squadron took 5,200 of Stuart's troops aboard on 30 June 1806. Underestimating Reynier's strength, they intended to drive the French from Calabria {{with the help of the}} local partisans.|$|E

His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Suddenly {{becoming}} upset over multiple interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit {{at the bottom of}} the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley's coarse behavior.|$|E
500|$|After {{wandering}} around Kentucky for a week, Hines rejoined General Morgan at Brandenburg, Kentucky. Colonel Basil W. Duke made a disparaging comment {{in his memoirs}} about how Hines appeared on the Brandenburg riverfront, saying Hines was [...] "apparently the most listless inoffensive youth that was ever imposed upon"; despite being Morgan's second-in-command, Colonel Duke was usually not told of all the espionage Hines was carrying out, causing some to believe that Hines and Duke did not <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> which was not the case.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} Montreux award it seemed {{inevitable}} {{that the show}} would get a third series. At a Christmas party, a BBC executive expressed a wish for the ratings of a third series [...] "to go like Everest", indicating a steep slope with his hands. Bathurst replied, [...] "But, Everest goes down the other side..." [...] The show was not recommissioned. Moffat says {{that he had no}} idea for a third series anyway, as it would have been difficult to contrive how {{a group of people who}} did not particularly <b>like</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> would get together so regularly.|$|E
