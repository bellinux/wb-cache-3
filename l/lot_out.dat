The Constitutional Convention met for 43 days debating and writing the first California Constitution. The 1849 Constitution copied (with revisions) a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> of the Ohio and New York Constitutions but had parts that were originally several different state constitutions as well as original material.|$|E

The Intertoto and UEFA Cup expedition took a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> of the players – but the team started the season sharper than the others, resulting in a comfortable upper-midtable position by the halfway point of the season. Tiredness, loss of form and a build-up of injuries resulted in a slide downwards towards the end of the season, eventually resulting in a ninth-place finish and a third consecutive year in the top half.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the railway}} was {{successful}} in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders got any of their money back and Brogdens had invested a <b>lot.</b> <b>Out</b> of 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 £150,000 had been raised by shares and only £2,600 by debentures. In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but debentures stood at £180,000, loans £17,500 and creditors at £65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about £13,700, plus one share of £1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.|$|E

[...] Leterrier made the film's final shot of Banner ambiguous; the thought being {{if there is a}} sequel, it would mean Banner finally masters control over his anger; if there is not a sequel, the shot indicates instead that he becomes a menace in The Avengers. Leterrier had also intended for a scene in the credits showing Blonsky, human once more, imprisoned and chained in a box. The character of Samuel Sterns, played by Tim Blake Nelson, was introduced to set him up as a villain in a possible future film, where he would become the Leader. Aaron Sims, the lead designer on The Incredible Hulk, also took time to work on concepts for the Leader. Nelson is [...] "signed on" [...] to reprise the role.

500|$|In September 2014, Wirkola {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to direct the sequel: “I have been lately attached to a few more things, it’s just a matter of time and priorities. I did Dead Snow, then Hansel & Gretel, and then [...] I want to do something a little bit different now and not just do sequels. I did write the script and I hope to be involved in it. But yeah, I won’t be directing it.” He said [...] "the first film was a learning curve for me working in the studio system and the script I wrote for the original was so different [...] We ended up taking a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> and altering stuff that first time. I tried taking what I learned and still delivered a sequel script that’s an R-rated action film." [...] Cinema Blend reported Renner said that despite his busy schedule he agreed to reprise the role of Hansel because the first film [...] "was a lot of fun doing the movie," [...] but without Wirkola directing again he might be less likely to return for the sequel.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in Australia on the Seven Network on 6 June 2002. Robin Oliver for The Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "Unlike {{any of the}} other seemingly compulsory Oz adventures to which British TV panders, this one presents a superior storyline while soaking up the views." [...] Oliver complimented the performances of Gary Sweet and Kimberley Joseph, and Ciaran Donnelly's direction. The Ages Debi Enker was critical, decrying the plot as [...] "fairly creaky" [...] and the locations as [...] "a very glossy ad for the sights of Sydney". She also thought Gary Sweet and James Nesbitt looked bored in their roles. In New Zealand, the episode was broadcast on TV ONE on 17 September 2002. The New Zealand Heralds reviewer Michele Hewitson was critical of the clichés in the script, particularly the stereotypical characterisation of Rod Ellison, who she described as [...] "a bit of a bastard". Hewitson was also critical of Karen's reaction to David's attempts to repair their relationship, and concluded by writing, [...] "God only knows why they had to drag the entire cast all the way to Australia. You can take this <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> of Manchester but they'll still be moaning, angst-ridden and selfish." ...|$|E

500|$|The Volunteers {{started at}} their 27-yard line {{to begin the}} drive, but went three and out and punted back to the Hokies without gaining a first down. The kick was {{returned}} to the Tech 39-yard line, where the Hokies' offense started with 31 seconds remaining in the quarter. On the first play of the drive, wide receiver Bryan Still {{broke away from the}} Tennessee defense and was wide open for a pass. Maurice DeShazo threw the ball to Still, but Still dropped the pass after it bounced off his chest, thus denying the Hokies a touchdown. Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer later cited the dropped pass as a critical turning point in the game, saying, [...] "I think if he could have made that catch, we could have gotten back in the game." [...] Tech player Torrian Gray agreed, saying, [...] "When he dropped the ball, that took a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> of us."

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a <b>lot</b> <b>out</b> of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{plan of the}} town consisted of two square blocks of land. Most of the western square was divided into sixteen blocks, each usually containing twelve lots, and {{this part of the}} town was split diagonally by the 100 ft path of the railroad. Unlike many towns found in the 1870s, there was no Depot Ground. The eastern square of land and a strip along the north edge of the western square was divided into <b>out</b> <b>lots,</b> each of which were several times the size the lots in the western square. The combination of in <b>lots</b> and <b>out</b> <b>lots</b> was fairly common in central Illinois and may be found, for example, at Hudson and Chenoa. The small triangle of landcut off by the railroad from the remainder of block ten became thelocation of the town jail. The station was located {{on the south side of}} the tracks and the two early elevatorswere on railroad land. By 1895 both in <b>lots</b> and <b>out</b> <b>lots</b> held residences. R. E. Moreland established the first business. Bellflower quickly became a major grain shipping center serving the fertile surrounding land. By 1879 it was shipping over 350,000 bushels of grain a year.

2500|$|Though Norwood has {{acknowledged}} that the creative focus of the album was very much on its technical realization and its sound, she declared Full Moon a concept album based {{on the development of}} a male-female relationship: [...] "It's definitely the concept for the album —me falling in love, then going through some turbulence, and then, at the end, I find the person that I really want to be with— so it's a great concept and it's a great experience that I had.

[...] Accounting the last three years of her life, Norwood decided to name the album after its title track, stating: [...] "I have done a complete circle and I feel whole.

2500|$|The {{next two}} weeks the {{division}} supported the 43rd Division during its attempts to capture Hill 112 in Operation Jupiter, which was followed by its participation in Operation Greenline, part of the Second Battle of the Odon.

After a brief rest the division, on 23 July, transferred to Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall's XXX Corps and saw further very tough action to secure the Bois du Homme as part of Operation Bluecoat {{at the end of}} July/beginning of August. On 3 August, MacMillan was wounded in the knee by shrapnel and evacuated to England, later Broadstone Hospital, Port Glasgow. That evening, Lieutenant General O'Connor, GOC VIII Corps, who greatly admired MacMillan (and had been one of his instructors at the Staff College in the late 1920s), wrote in the following words to his wife: [...] "Babe is slightly wounded.
