The effect of different source plant treatments, the effect of light on test plant susceptibility, and the effect of a second virus on the transmission of BYMV were tested. Effects from the first two factors would help explain the variation within and among experiments on the transmission of BYMV by aphids. The level of transmission of BYMV by aphids was not affected by the different amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, or manganese supplied the source plant. There was no effect on the level of transmission when the source plants were subjected to different light-temperature treatments which caused marked differences in plant growth. The presence of a second virus, white clover mosaic virus (WCMV), in the source plant had no effect on the transmission of BYMV by aphids. The effects of different photoperiods, light intensities, light spectrums, and post- and pre-inoculation light treatments on the susceptibility of the test plant to inoculation with BYMV by aphids was tested. Photoperiods of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 hours had no effect. There was no difference in the effects of one-fourth, half, three-fourths, and maximum light intensity. Light from lamps with different spectrums had no effect. Post-inoculation light or dark treatments had no effect on the susceptibility of the test plants to inoculation with BYMV by aphids.

The study was conducted at the Greenville Farm, Logan, Utah. The farm has about 1 percent surface slope and is a well-drained Millville silt loam that occurs on an alluvial fan. It is high in potash and phosphorous and is alkaline, having a pH of 7. 9 to 8. 2. Only mixtures gave significant percent forage protein results. Clipping, irrigation and fertilization treatments did not significantly affect the percent of forage protein but did affect the forage yield and thus the total protein production per acre. The total forage protein yield increases were n early lineal with the nitrogen treatment increases. The yield of forage from the 35 day clipping frequency was greater than from the 28 day clipping frequency for all five mixtures. The mixtures containing alfalfa showed greater response to the harvest frequency in increased forage yield than the other mixtures. All nitrogen applications gave forage yield increases. The first 50 pound increment gave the greatest and the second 50 pound increment gave the l east forage yield response. The different irrigation intervals, with the same total seasonal water applied, resulted in no significant forage yield differences. <b>Ladino</b> <b>clover</b> had the greatest root dry weight per acre with the 28 day harvests and 50 pounds of nitrogen. The alfalfa and grass root dry weights per acre were largest with the 35 day harvests, the first 50 pound increment of nitrogen application and the longest irrigation lnterval.

40|$|Marked week-to-week {{fluctuations}} in forage consumption by chickens on range {{have been reported}} in previous studies (Wood, 19 S 6; and Wood et al., 1958). In attempting to explain these fluctuations such variables as kind of pastures, stage of forage growth and age, sex, breed, and in-dividuality of the ranging bird have all been proffered as contributing factors. It was shown that a considerable quantity of for-age may be consumed by some birds on oc-casion.

It was discerned further that if one bird consumed relatively large amounts of forage on a given date, then the range mates, with due allowance for individuality, would likewise consume forage in quantity.

The principal objective {{of this study was}} to compare the relative values of each of these methods based upon information collected from bi-fistulated (esophageal and rumen) sheep selecting their own forage from a tall-forb community in early summer and late summer, and from confined sheep fed a hand-mixed diet of known composition. Microscope slide mounts were made of plant fragments collected from the esophagus, rumen, and feces of sheep grazing a beauty cinquefoil /velvet lupine Kentucky bluegrass /timothy community in northeastern Oregon. Ocular estimates of forage utilization were made concurrently. Data were converted to percent composition on a dry weight basis for comparisons. Significant differences (p <. 05) in percent diet composition among methods occurred for 18 of the 31 plant species consumed in the early summer trial, and for 17 of the 31 plant species consumed in the late summer trial. Diets as determined by the ocular-estimate-by-plot method were generally lower in graminoids and higher in forbs than those as determined by other methods. The esophageal fistula method yielded diets that were lower in graminoids and higher in forbs than diets as determined by stomach content analysis and fecal analysis. Diets as determined by fecal analysis were higher in graminoids and lower in forbs than diets as determined by other methods. In the second study phase, ten confined bi-fistulated sheep were separately fed a dry, ground, hand-composited mixture of orchardgrass, fawn fescue, alfalfa, and <b>ladino</b> <b>clover.</b> The botanical composition of this mixture was determined by microscopic examination of plant fragments and compared to the botanical composition of diets as determined by microscopic examination of esophageal, rumen, and fecal samples. The composition of each of the species contained in esophageal samples was similar to that of the actual diet. Rumen samples were similar to the actual diet only in their composition of orchardgrass, and contained significantly higher (p <. 05) amounts of total grasses and significantly lower (p <. 05) amounts of total forbs than the actual diet and esophageal samples. Fecal samples were significantly higher (p <. 05) in their composition of grasses and significantly lower (p <. 05) in their composition of forbs than the actual diet and samples collected from the esophagus or rumen...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Copper {{deficiency}} and Mo-induced Cu deficiency are nutrition {{problems of}} ruminant livestock in the Burns and Klamath Falls area of Oregon. Chemical analysis {{of plant and}} soil samples was used to survey Cu and Mo levels in forage in these areas. The objectives were to assess the possibility of animal nutrition problems and to study the relationship between forage levels of Cu and Mo and plant species, stage of plant maturity, time of growing season, management factors, and soil characteristics. A total of approximately 400 plant samples was collected during the 1972 grazing season. The samples from Burns were taken from an alfalfa maturity experiment, improved pastures, native meadows, and a forage nursery. The legumes sampled were alfalfa (Medicago sativa), <b>Ladino</b> <b>clover</b> (Trifolium repens), and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciaefolia). Grasses sampled were Fawn tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), Manchar brome (Bromus inermis), Greenar and Oahe intermediate wheatgrass (Agropyron intermedium), wildrye (Elymus triticoides), Rush (Juncus sp.), and Sedge (Carex sp.). The Klamath samples were from an Alta tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) -quack-grass (Agropyron repens) comparison and from 13 sites {{on a variety of}} pastures throughout the area. In addition to alfalfa, clover, sedge, rush, Alta fescue and quackgrass, the species sampled were Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), and meadow foxtail (Alopecuris pratensis). Most of the sites were clipped periodically to simulate grazing and were sampled at two week intervals from May through August. Plant analysis was valuable for indicating the type of livestock nutrition problem encountered in a particular area. The Burns forage contained high levels of Mo and a Mo-induced Cu deficiency is probable. The survey in the Klamath area identified two sites on muck soils with potentially toxic Mo levels. Several sites had such low Cu levels that uncomplicated Cu deficiency may be a problem in livestock. A wide range of values was encountered and forage analysis would be valuable for identifying problems on a local basis. Large differences were found in Cu and Mo levels between plant species. Legumes contained much higher levels of Cu and Mo than did grasses. Changes in maturity, or clipping interval, had different effects on Cu and Mo content for grasses and legumes. Alfalfa was found to decrease in Cu and Mo content with increased maturity. However, legumes in pastures maintained relatively constant levels through the grazing season. Many grasses were found to decrease markedly in Cu levels, and some to increase in Mo levels as the season progressed. This may result in a reduction in the Cu/Mo ratio through the season. Forage analysis was shown to be a valuable technique for identifying potential Cu and Mo livestock nutrition problems and for investigating environmental and management factors which may regulate Cu and Mo levels in forage plants...|$|E
