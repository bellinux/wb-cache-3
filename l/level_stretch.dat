5|$|In late 1829, with {{construction}} of the railway almost complete, the Rainhill Trials were held on a short <b>level</b> <b>stretch</b> of the completed line near Rainhill, to test how the track withstood locomotives running over it and to determine which type of locomotive would be used, with a £500 prize at stake. The Trials were widely publicised, and 10,000–15,000 people attended the first day on 6October 1829. Of the five entrants Rocket, built by George Stephenson and his son Robert, was the only entrant to complete the trial without suffering a serious failure, and was duly selected as the design to be used. (Although often described as a race, and shown as such in illustrations, the Rainhill Trials were a series of independent trials. Each engine ran on a different day.) At {{around the time of}} the Rainhill Trials the tunnel to the forthcoming Liverpool terminus—the first tunnel ever dug under a major built-up area—was completed. To win over sceptical locals it was whitewashed, fitted with lighting and a band, and the public charged a shilling apiece to walk through it.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, I-87 intersects NY9N again at exit34, the southernmost {{junction}} to feature bilingual guide signs in English and French {{due to the}} road's proximity to Quebec. Past NY9N, the Northway curves to the north, running along {{the west side of}} Keeseville before entering another rural but fairly <b>level</b> <b>stretch</b> that follows I-87 out of Adirondack Park. Now outside the park, the highway encounters more frequent pockets of development as it follows NY22 into the town of Plattsburgh. Just inside the town line, the Northway crosses over the Salmon River and intersects NY22 at exit36, a junction serving nearby Plattsburgh International Airport. While NY22 heads northeast into the city of Plattsburgh, I-87 runs north through its western suburbs, passing over the Saranac River and intersecting NY3 at exit37. The Northway and NY22 meet again north of downtown at exit38.|$|E

50|$|From 1938, the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) {{designated}} the locomotives class 12.0. In {{the summer of}} 1939, they hauled 600 tons express trains out of Vienna over Wienerwald at a speed of 65 km/h, reaching 120 km/h over <b>level</b> <b>stretches.</b>|$|R
25|$|Once {{clear of}} the tunnel, the canal passes Blisworth village and reaches Gayton Junction where the Northampton Arm {{branches}} off to the east. This arm has 17 narrow locks as it descends to join the navigable River Nene (see below). The long <b>level</b> <b>stretch</b> continues past several villages including Nether Heyford and Weedon Bec and is very rural in character.|$|E
25|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L) was the world's first {{intercity}} passenger railway {{in which}} all the trains were timetabled and operated by steam locomotives. This differed from the Stockton and Darlington, as sections of this line employed cable haulage, and only the coal trains were hauled by locomotives. Further, horse-drawn traffic could use the Stockton and Darlington upon payment of a toll. The passenger-carrying Canterbury and Whitstable Railway opened three months before the L However, it used cable haulage by stationary steam engines over much of its length, with steam locomotives restricted to the <b>level</b> <b>stretch.</b> The L was primarily built to provide faster transport of raw materials and finished goods between the port of Liverpool and mills in Manchester in north-west England.|$|E
2500|$|No. 10 became {{particularly}} famous when, on 20 July 1892, it achieved 64.4mph (103.6km/h) hauling a {{test train}} along the <b>level</b> <b>stretch</b> of line between Levin and Shannon, {{at the time}} the world speed record for the [...] gauge. [...] The locomotive was withdrawn in 1928 and dumped in the Waimakariri River to help stabilise the riverbank, and its final resting place is a mystery.|$|E

60|$|The {{train was}} a {{comfortable}} one, {{and all of}} the party slept well. When they arose, they found themselves crossing the <b>level</b> <b>stretches</b> of Indiana.

25|$|The {{road was}} built with {{mortgages}} from New York, Boston and London, backed by land grants. There were no federal cash subsidies, But {{there was a}} loan to the Central Pacific that was eventually repaid at six percent interest. The federal government offered land-grants in a checkerboard pattern. The railroad sold every-other square, with the government opening its half to homesteaders. The government also loaned money—later repaid—at $16,000 per mile on <b>level</b> <b>stretches,</b> and $32,000 to $48,000 in mountainous terrain. Local and state governments also aided the financing.|$|R

50|$|Geologically, Dominica {{is part of}} {{the rugged}} Lesser Antilles {{volcanic}} arc. The country's central spine, a northwest-southeast axis of steep volcanic slopes and deep gorges, generally varies in elevation from 300 to 1400 m above sea level. Several east-west trending mountain spurs extend to the narrow coastal plain, which is studded with sea cliffs and has <b>level</b> <b>stretches</b> no wider than 2000 m. The highest peak is Morne Diablotins, at 1447 m; Morne Trois Pitons, with an elevation of 1423 m, lies farther south and is the site of the national park.|$|R
50|$|The S11s were {{regarded}} as good locomotives on expresses around the ports served by the LSWR. The class was at first rostered to the West Country in order to ply their trade upon the gradients they were designed for. However, it was soon realised that the smaller wheels and larger boilers were {{not living up to}} expectations of successful operation on the route. The class was slower and more cumbersome than their siblings. This led to crews displaying their preference for the T9's higher speeds downhill and on the <b>level</b> <b>stretches</b> of railway.|$|R
