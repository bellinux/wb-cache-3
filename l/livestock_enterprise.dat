2500|$|In {{recent years}} farmers have been {{producing}} alternative crops which are economically viable, and amongst these are organic farm crops. [...] Hemp and wool from sheep {{are the main}} areas of fibre production of Canada. [...] Wool production was on average 16,022,000pounds (7,267t) in the 1930s and 9,835,000 pounds (4,461t) in 1949. Fibre flax from flaxseed has been exported to the United Kingdom. Crop growers may supplement their income with beeswax and honey and learn beekeeping. Enterprising land owners have had success growing as well as packaging and marketing the sunflower seed. Crops are not only for human consumption but also for animal consumption, which opens a new market such as canary seed. Cuniculture, or rabbit farming, is another <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Cannabis is an important crop in some areas, making up 5% of British Columbia's GDP. According to BC Business Magazine, the crop is worth $7.5 billion to the province annually, and gives employment to 250,000 people.|$|E

By 1944, the Big Cypress Seminole wanted their own trustees and drafted {{an agreement with the}} government.

It said that the tribal trustees would be appointed, with each of the cattle trustee groups and the BIA agent to appoint a tribal trustee. The three appointees on each reservation would also serve as tribal representatives. In essence, this requirement ensured that those adept at navigating between the Indian and white worlds would gain the positions. According to Covington, men who were adept at developing consensus decisions and had converted to Christianity were most likely to be selected.|$|E

50|$|The {{livestock}} {{sector is}} {{an important component of the}} farming system. Up to 1950, only local cattle and goats were reared for milk and meat, with the establishment of artificial insemination in 1950 exotic cross breeds such as Jersey and Indian breeds of cattle were introduced and high milk yield was obtained. Further Jamunapari and Sannan breeds of goats were also introduced for meat and milk. With this introduction of new breeds many farmers started rearing cross breeds of cattle, goat and poultry. From 1950 to 1984 <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprise</b> developed very fast and it was a single or supplementary source of income for nearly 30% of the district population. Backyard poultry and rearing milking cows and goat for milk and meat generate additional income for the farmers.

50|$|In 2001 India {{became the}} {{world leader in}} milk {{production}} with a production volume of 84 million tons. India has about {{three times as many}} dairy animals as the USA, which produces around 75 million tons. Dairy Farming is generally a type of subsistence farming system in India, especially in Haryana, the major producer of milk in the country. More than 40% of Indian farming households are engaged in milk production because it is a <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprise</b> in which they can engage with relative ease to improve their livelihoods. Regular milk sales allow them to move from subsistence to earning a market-based income. The structure of the livestock industry is globally changing and putting poorer livestock producers in danger because they will be crowded out and left behind. More than 40 million households in India are at least partially dependent on milk production, and developments in the dairy sector will have important repercussions on their livelihoods and on rural poverty levels. Haryana was chosen to assess possible developments in the Indian dairy sector and to broadly identify areas of interventions that favour small-scale dairy producers. A methodology developed by the International Farm Comparison Network (IFCN) examined impacts of change on milk prices, farm management and other market factors that affect the small-scale milk production systems, the whole farm and related household income.|$|E

30|$|Income from {{livestock}} and non-agricultural sources is positively and {{significantly associated with}} {{adaptation to climate change}} in the wet lowland parts of the study area.

40|$|In an ever-changing agriculture, {{producers}} are constantly faced with decisions concerning profit maximization. To remain competitive with other farmers, and even {{other sectors of}} the non-agricultural economy, the producer must make maximum use of all available technology and management skills. To do so requires current knowledge of the latest productive practices, and an adaptation of those which will improve relative income position and returns to employed resources. Under changing technology, emphasis must be placed on determination of optimum farm organization, and expanding or realigning resources in those areas of greatest returns. The study {{is part of the}} Great Plains Research Program, in cooperation with the Farm Production Economics Division, Economic Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture. The Great Plains study area includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Nebraska. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze one representative livestock farm in each of the study areas previously described, to determine the optimum combination of crop and <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprises</b> on these farms. Of particular importance is to determine what relationship wheat production has in optimum farm organization when compared to roughage and feed grain utilized in <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Intuitively, there might be a closer dependence on feed grain and roughage production on a livestock farm, than on a commercial crop farm which emphasizes wheat production. A further goal is to examine the changes in the <b>livestock</b> <b>enterprises</b> when varying prices of wheat are considered. The role and interaction between pasture and roughage production will be examined. If cropland has a high opportunity cost, it could be hypothesized that livestock production may be limited to the availability of pasture and other roughage, or a livestock feeding system employed to the extent of the grain produced. If cropland has a low opportunity cost, there might be more dependence on cropland in furnishing roughage with greater numbers of livestock and less dependence on pasture hay. Advisor:Glenn A.
