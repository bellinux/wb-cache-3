40|$|In 1972, I was apprenticed to {{an elderly}} {{mountain}} man {{steeped in the}} traditions of <b>log</b> <b>crib</b> <b>construction.</b> Cyrus Paul Lewis taught me the skills of 18 th and 19 th century rough and finish carpentry as it pertained to folk architecture. The craft training of log construction added on top of several years experience as a modern day carpenter enabled me to build a company that restored houses and other log buildings all over the United States from 1974 to 2006. In 1978 I continued my formal education in anthropology and preservation specializing in log structures at George Washington University in Washington, D. C. Having read all the authoritative works on log buildings and compared them to what I was learning in the field, it was obvious there were many gaps in the collective body of knowledge concerning the development and dissemination of log crib structures. During a brief first trip to Europe, {{it was easy to}} see that the log crib buildings in Alpine and northern Europe in no way resembled the American log cribs erected for three centuries by the settlers arriving on the American shores and those pushing west to establish their farms and build their houses. It became clear American scholarship had a long way to go in understanding the log crib, its development, technology and dissemination throughout the world much less in America. In 2009 a quest to fill in some of the gaps was begun. After four years of intense research with field trips to Turkey, southern Europe and ranging all the way north to the Scandinavian and Baltic countries ringing the Baltic Sea two findings became very clear. First, no one person can possibly conduct the massive research needed to fully understand origins, technology and dissemination of the world's log cribs. Secondly, it was apparent, contrary to what had been declared in former publications, that Europeans did not transfer their log crib technologies intact to the eastern shores of the US. Rather only a small number of scattered details mixed with a few processes of material manufacturing and building commonly used in Europe were configured into what was to become an American log crib style almost from the first settlements. These discoveries bore witness to the fallacy of single or two person research efforts that resulted in broad, sweeping declarations of origins and disseminations concerning log crib technologies. Most authors were not familiar with the professional training needed to fully understand the hands-on traditions of building with logs and have largely missed the facts concerning the developmental history of log buildings in a specific country and the world. Far more collaborative research between the multiple disciplines and experienced master craftsmen is needed. Even in Estonia further studies are needed to determine how the dual-purpose barn-dwelling developed and where it originated. With seven centuries of multiple foreign occupations responsible for bringing in many different types of technologies form their occupiers' homelands, Estonia is a perfect research area for studying and tracking details of development within the country and tracing them back to their origins. Estonia is not the only country where a rich tradition of log construction needs further research. Further Continental and world-wide log crib studies are needed on a global basis. National surveys must be completed and all resulting data shared to a central data base and collated for developmental research to take place. This work is vital to the understanding of the origins, development and disseminations of log crib technologies throughout the world much less the US and the European Continent. The results of multiple global log crib research efforts will have far reaching effects in craft training, log crib technology training, and in reintroducing relative millennia's old technologies in a modern day world rife with toxic fixes that do not work very well in new construction. New restoration techniques of wooden buildings will be learned and culled from the research. Environmental considerations that reduce CO 2 levels, green house effects and increase local community cohesiveness all will benefit from global in-depth research efforts to fill in the missing information gaps in log crib development and technologies. In order for all this research to be coordinated, collated and disseminated, a single global organization dedicated to the study of log crib development must be formed. A new organization focused solely on ferreting out log construction histories, developing techniques of restoration, forest management and timber conservation is necessary in part to provide continued introductory and higher level job training for a log crib work force. The research and training is imperative if the world is to maintain and develop additional higher paying jobs, lower taxes, maintain existing log structures, wisely use limited natural resources in an efficient manner and better living conditions for millions of people...|$|E
50|$|At the {{southern}} end of the park, the formal esplanade follows the curve of the shore and turns back toward Concord Street. At Exchange Street, the park merges into restored salt marshes, creating valuable maritime habitat. Pedestrians can walk to the edge of the river at this point from Exchange Street to North Adger's Wharf. At the riverfront end of North Adger's Wharf, the 17th century pier was rebuilt in the original footprint with the original granite which was fished out of the river and reused. The pier was reconstructed using <b>log</b> <b>cribbing</b> <b>construction</b> of native palmetto trees to last for many generations. The pier marks {{the southern}} edge of the park.|$|R

40|$|Systems used to {{stabilise}} {{steep slopes}} and gullies usually consist of technical and biological measures. While the lifespan of engineering structures principally {{depends on the}} mechanical properties of the building materials, the long-term behaviour of vegetated structures and biological measures is influenced by additional factors and interactions. Based on previous studies, the mechanical strength of 60 -year-old wooden check dams was found to still average within the values defined by the now relevant Swiss timber design code. The two steep scree slopes Schwandrübi and Valzalära-Gazi have been documented and inves-tigated since their stabilisation in the early nineteen eighties. They were stabilised by combinations of gabion walls, timber <b>log</b> <b>crib</b> walls and biological measures. As such combinations are quite often used in modern eco-engineering, the two investigation areas may be considered as fairly representative. Not unexpectedly, the gabions were still fully functional after about 25 years. The timber of the <b>log</b> <b>crib</b> walls, on the other hand, had considerably deteriorated and the future stability of the structures is assumed {{to depend on the}} surrounding vegetation and/or on the plants growing in the interstices...|$|R
50|$|Advantages of <b>crib</b> <b>construction</b> include its {{simplicity}} and strength. Logs need only be cut and notched for stability, then lain crosswise until a certain height is reached. As each layer of wood is only {{used as a}} compressive layer, the wood need not be strong. Since there are few load-bearing fasteners in the lower levels, reasonable strength is possible.|$|R
50|$|The Edward Ransom Farmstead, Livestock and Equipment Barn was a {{historic}} agricultural outbuilding in rural White County, Arkansas. It was {{located on the}} Ransom Farmstead, a few miles south of Midway, {{on the west side}} of United States Route 167. It was a 1-1/2 story structure, built in part out of logs and in part out of wood framing. Its principal form was derived from three <b>log</b> <b>cribs,</b> joined by saddle- and V-notching, a form not seen anywhere else in the county. It was built about 1915.|$|R

40|$|Wood cribs {{are used}} {{extensively}} to stabilize openings in underground coal mines. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report describes {{the results of}} full-scale testing of several multitimbered wood crib configurations. Multitimbered configurations are wood cribs that are constructed with two or more timbers per layer. Nine different crib configurations were evaluated. Configuration parameters under study included the aspect ratio (height-to-width relationship) {{and the percentage of}} solid rr:aterial used in <b>crib</b> <b>construction.</b> Test results and generalized wood crib behavior are discussed and recommendations are made concerning <b>crib</b> <b>constructions</b> to maximize strength and stability. Crib performance is enhanced by reducing buckling effects by decreasing the aspect ratio and geometry considerations that increase the moment of inertia. A cost benefit analysis of multitimbered wood crib configurations is made. Generally, increasing the percentage of solid provides more resistance at less unit construction cost. A comparison of laboratory results and underground observations of several wood pack wall supports suggest in situ load capacity is less than that measured in laboratory testing. Reasons for the apparent decrease of in situ load-bearing capability include load rate effects, stiffness of reaction surfaces, and varying boundary conditions that alter the load transfer mechanics of the crib structure...|$|R

5000|$|According to A Brief History of the Northern Railway, a {{switchback}} with 5.6 percent {{grade was}} studied by Chief Engineer Anderson {{as early as}} 1884. The line was surveyed in spring of 1886. There were three switchbacks {{on each side of}} the Cascades, and a great double horseshoe at the summit. Construction of the switchback was plagued by snowfall, and a cut through snow 40 ft deep was required at the summit. The switchback included a mile of solid <b>log</b> <b>cribbing,</b> ¾ miles of snowsheds, and 31 trestles. When the ground thawed in the spring of 1887, it shifted and settled the newly laid track, requiring more work. The Northern Pacific spent $15,000 (...) on laborers' protection during the switchback's construction.|$|R

A photograph of the bridge is available which shows the [...] "structure consisted of massive masonry abutments with a short pole bridge suspended between them. Pole bridges were probably {{the most common type}} of bridge erected in frontier days and are still used today for simple county bridges. These bridges consist merely of poles (trees or logs) extending from one abutment to another with a deck of saplings or planks laid across these poles. Obviously these could be quite primitive with the ground or a natural feature such as a rock shelf serving as the abutments, but they could only be used for short spans.

500|$|To {{the north}} of Jackson Hole, Yellowstone National Park had been {{established}} in 1872, and by {{the close of the}} 19th century, conservationists wanted to expand the boundaries of that park to include at least the Teton Range. By 1907, in an effort to regulate water flow for irrigation purposes, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had constructed a <b>log</b> <b>crib</b> dam at the Snake River outlet of Jackson Lake. This dam failed in 1910 and a new concrete Jackson Lake Dam replaced it by 1911. The dam was further enlarged in 1916, raising lake waters [...] as part of the Minidoka Project, designed to provide irrigation for agriculture in the state of Idaho. Further dam construction plans for other lakes in the Teton Range alarmed Yellowstone National Park superintendent Horace Albright, who sought to block such efforts. Jackson Hole residents were opposed to an expansion of Yellowstone, but were more in favor of the establishment of a separate National Park which would include the Teton Range and six lakes {{at the base of the}} mountains.
