40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{this paper}} offers an overview of approaches on general marine maintenance and clarifies the significance of modern maintenance techniques, {{as well as their}} application in shipping practice. Unplanned down times and accidents, which result from inappropriate maintenance, create additional expenses. In today’s shipping practice the widely shared concept of planned maintenance is not the most effective of the approaches. The appropriate maintenance system needs to prevent or reduce down times. Modern condition-based and reliability-centered maintenance systems recognize the market demand for a better ratio of the invested funds and complex tasks that the maintenance systems need to fulfill. The paper further analyses the possibilities of adjusting the maintenance intervals, which are shown on the example of a modern system for cargo liquefaction on a <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tanker...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{endeavors to}} {{determine}} whether farmers adjust their consumption of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in response {{to changes in the}} unit price of energy. A demand model is specified and estimated. The conclusions suggest that the unit price of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> is a factor impacting the quantity of natural <b>gas</b> (<b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas)</b> demanded by farmers, but {{there is no indication that}} other types of energy are substitutes for natural <b>gas</b> or <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Additionally, the number of acres irrigated is an important factor driving the demand for natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Finally, the estimated models of natural <b>gas</b> and <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> demand were structurally stable over the period 1971 - 1989. ...|$|R

Utilizing both computer simulation analysis of the combustion model and experiment analysis of the <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> engine, the study obtains the relation curve of cylinder pressure and temperature of burned mixture gas and crank angle.

50|$|Natural gas {{distributors}} {{were required}} to add thiols, originally ethanethiol, to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many gas distributors were odorizing gas prior to this event. Most gas odorants utilized currently contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with t-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and ethanethiol in <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> <b>tankers</b> and bulk handling systems, an oxidizing catalyst is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.|$|R

40|$|Household {{surveys in}} Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka were {{analyzed}} using a two-stage Heckman model to examine the factors influencing {{the decision to use}} <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> (stage 1) and, among users, the quantity consumed per person (stage 2). In the first stage, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in all six countries increased with household expenditure and the highest level of education attained by female and male household members. Electricity connection increased, and engagement in agriculture and increasing household size decreased, <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> selection in five countries; urban residence increased selection in four countries; and rising firewood and kerosene prices increased selection in three countries each. In the second stage, the quantity of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumed increased with rising household expenditure and decreasing price of <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> in every country. Urban residence increased and engagement in agriculture decreased <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. Surveys in Albania, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, which did not report quantities, were also examined by calculating quantities using national average prices. Although fuel prices faced by individual households could not be tested, the findings largely supported those from the first six countries. Once the education levels of men and women were separately accounted for, the gender of the head of household was not statistically significant in most cases across the ten countries. Where it was significant (five equations), the sign of the coefficient was positive for men, possibly suggesting that female-headed households are burdened with unmeasured economic disadvantages, making less cash available for purchasing <b>liquefied</b> <b>petroleum</b> <b>gas.</b> Energy Production and Transportation,Markets and Market Access,Energy Conservation&Efficiency,Renewable Energy,Energy and Environment...|$|R
