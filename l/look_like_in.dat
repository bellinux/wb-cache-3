5|$|Carolyn Porco of NASA was {{consulted}} on {{the planetary}} science and imagery. The animators realistically recreated what an explosion would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> space: short blasts, which suck inward and leave debris from a ship floating. For shots of an imploding planet, the same explosion program {{was used to}} simulate it breaking up, while the animators could manually composite multiple layers of rocks and wind sucking into the planet. Unlike other Star Trek films and series, the transporter beam effects swirl rather than speckle. Abrams conceived the redesign to emphasize the notion of transporters as beams that can pick up and move people, rather than a signal composed of scrambled atoms.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what it will <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E
5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass of the Sun and 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

25|$|A {{slightly}} different {{edition of the}} fragment of the Thalia from De Synodis is given by G.C. Stead, and served {{as the basis for}} a translation by R.P.C. Hanson.

25|$|When {{a diesel}} {{locomotive}} has been {{attached to the}} train for operational reasons such as assistance on a bank, shunting, or for generation in the heating role, this is also often removed. The locomotive livery may also be changed to simply demonstrate what a locomotive would <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> an alternative, and possibly extinct or never used, livery. Photographers also often compensate for poor weather conditions {{at the time of}} the photograph, for example when the wrong wind direction causes the smoke trail from the locomotive chimney to obscure all or part of the train. Livery changes or scene reinstatement for smoke removal is often achieved through the use of short term rephotography, where the photographer takes two images at the same site and overlays one onto the other.|$|E
25|$|Produced by Manilow, Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook was {{released}} on September 30, 2003. It {{was the first time}} that the pair had worked together in more than twenty years. The album went gold, and they collaborated again in 2005 on Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook. On December 3, 2003, A aired A Barry Manilow Christmas: Live by Request, his second of two concerts for the series. The two-hour special had Manilow taking requests for Christmas songs performed live with a band and an orchestra. Manilow told the audience that he was what Clay Aiken was going to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> thirty years, thus acknowledging an ongoing comparison between the two. Also on the special were guests Cyndi Lauper, José Feliciano, and Bette Midler (Midler, busy preparing her own tour in Los Angeles, appeared only in a pre-taped segment).|$|E

A new story for the DS version was written by Takahashi.

500|$|The Rescue was {{the first}} in a new {{production}} block of Doctor Who; the first production block lasted for 52 weeks with one episode filmed per week, though the final two stories, Planet of Giants and The Dalek Invasion of Earth, were held back and the first season ended early. As such, there was a six-week break for the regular cast before work on The Rescue began.The Rescue used the same production team as the following story, The Romans, and the two were combined to form a single six-episode production block. Model filming took place in Ealing studios on 16 November 1965. The models were made by an outside modelmaker called Shawcraft. As they were not designers, Doctor Who designer Raymond Cusick drew what he wanted the spacecraft to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> more detail than he normally would have. He drew the spacecraft in flight as well as it wrecked so they could visualise it from the two. Cusick had found a cheap material he called [...] "reeded hardboard", which was spray-painted silver and used for the outside of the craft prop. The design of Koquillion was based on a close-up of a fly.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron {{succeeds in}} the top {{priority}} of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do, {{but this time the}} action scenes don't always measure up." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety wrote, [...] "If this is what the apotheosis of branded, big-studio entertainment has come to <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>in</b> 2015, we could be doing much worse. Unlike its title character, Age of Ultron most definitely has soul." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times and giving the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, Richard Roeper said, [...] "Some day, an Avengers film might collapse under the weight of its own awesomeness. I mean, how many times can they save the world? But this is not that day." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Age of Ultron is a whole summer of fireworks packed into one movie. It doesn't just go to 11, it starts there. [...] takes a few wrong turns, creating a jumble when the action gets too thick. But he recovers like a pro, devising a spectacle that's epic {{in every sense of the}} word." [...] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, stating that despite being [...] "bigger, louder and more disjointed" [...] than its predecessor, [...] "it’s also got more personality—specifically Whedon's—than any other film in the now seven-year-old franchise." [...] Helen O'Hara of Empire praised the interactions between the characters, the action set-pieces and Whedon's ability as a director in her review, stating that the film [...] "redefines the scale we can expect from our superheroes." ...|$|E
