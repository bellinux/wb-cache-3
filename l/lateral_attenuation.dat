A B- 747 was flown at low altitudes over the ends of two microphone arrays. One array covering a lateral distance of 1600 m consisted of 14 microphones positioned over grass. The second array covered a lateral distance of 1200 m and consisted of 6 microphones positioned over a concrete runway. Sixteen runs were flown at altitudes ranging from 30 to 960 m. The acoustic information recorded in the field was reduced to one third octave band spectral time histories and synchronized with tracking and weather information. <b>Lateral</b> <b>attenuation</b> {{as a function of}} elevation angle was calculated in overall, A-weighted, tone-corrected perceived noise level, and effective perceived noise level units. The B- 747 results are compared with similar results for a turbojet-powered T- 38 airplane and the SAE recommended <b>lateral</b> <b>attenuation</b> prediction procedure.

In this paper, a new concept for <b>lateral</b> vibration <b>attenuation</b> by integrated piezoelectric stack transducers in the elastic support of a beam with circular cross-section is presented.

A 747 is flown at altitudes from 30 to 960 m past a 20 -microphone array, and ground effects are calculated from noise measurements {{as a function}} of elevation angle and slant range.

Measured ground effects are found largest at 200 Hz, and no definite shielding differences are apparent for a directivity angle of 122. 5 deg.

30|$|Our study {{demonstrated}} that the <b>lateral</b> variation of <b>attenuation</b> coefficients estimated by the proposed method can identify sharp lateral discontinuities such as lithological boundaries and fracture zones. Estimating attenuation coefficients separately from positive- and negative-offset data is effective in identifying lithological boundaries. We also {{demonstrated that}} attenuation coefficients are more sensitive to localized fractures than phase velocities, although both attenuation coefficients and phase velocities are sensitive to lithological boundaries. Therefore, simultaneous interpretation of <b>lateral</b> variation of <b>attenuation</b> coefficients and that of phase velocities has a potential to distinguish lithological boundaries from the localized lateral discontinuities (fractures associated with faults). This ability would be valuable in applications such as fluid injection studies, where it may allow localized fractures to be detected using conventional seismic data.|$|R

In such laterally heterogeneous media, estimated values of Î± not only reflect attenuation coefficients related to quality factors but also include the effect of scattering (e.g., reflection) due to lateral heterogeneity. To detect lateral discontinuities, Bergamo and Socco (2014) utilized <b>lateral</b> variation of <b>attenuation</b> coefficients related to scattered surface waves. They estimated two attenuation coefficients at each local point (i.e., CMP in this study) from positive- and negative-offset data (e.g., Fig.Â  1 c). Their results demonstrated that a distinct difference between the <b>lateral</b> variation of <b>attenuation</b> coefficients from positive- and negative-offset data is a good indication of the locations of a sharp lateral discontinuity. To effectively characterize lateral heterogeneities, we also focus on spatial variation of local attenuation coefficients related to scattering and separately estimate attenuation coefficients at each CMP from positive- and negative-offset data.|$|R

Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we described the prevalence of soft-tissue attenuation patterns in normal SPECT-MPI studies acquired with a supine patient-position SPECT system. Results: In 263 normal, clinically-indicated, supine-acquisition SPECT-MPIs the attenuation patterns observed were: anterior (35. 4 %), inferior (41. 8 %) and lateral (13. 3 %). Anterior attenuation was more prevalent among women (50. 7 % vs. 15. 7 %, P< 0. 001) and was associated with chest circumference among men. Conversely, inferior attenuation was more prevalent among men (78. 3 % vs. 13. 5 %, P< 0. 001) and was not affected by body-habitus. <b>Lateral</b> <b>attenuation</b> was more common among women (19. 6 % vs. 5. 2 %, p= 0. 001) and was associated with obesity (p= 0. 015).

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simplified model (Rapid Aviation Noise Evaluator â RANE) for {{the calculation of}} aviation noise {{within the context of}} multi-disciplinary strategic environmental assessment where input data is both limited and constrained by compatibility requirements against other disciplines. RANE relies upon the concept of noise cylinders around defined flight-tracks with the Noise Radius determined from publicly available Noise-Power-Distance curves rather than the computationally intensive multiple point-to-point grid calculation with subsequent ISOcontour interpolation methods adopted in the FAAâs Integrated Noise Model (INM) and similar models. Preliminary results indicate that for simple single runway scenarios, changes in airport noise contour areas can be estimated with minimal uncertainty compared against grid-point calculation methods such as INM. In situations where such outputs are all that is required for preliminary strategic environmental assessment, there are considerable benefits in reduced input data and computation requirements. Further development of the noise-cylinder-based model (such as the incorporation of <b>lateral</b> <b>attenuation,</b> engine-installation-effects or horizontal track dispersion via the assumption of more complex noise surfaces formed around the flight-track) will allow for more complex assessment to be carried out. RANE is intended to be incorporated into technology evaluators for the noise impact assessment of novel aircraft concepts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract â Propagation {{models for}} forest environments at the VHF and UHF bands are examined. To that end, an {{integrated}} model combining the excess vegetation attenuation and the direct wave {{as well as}} the ground effect, is presented. The vegetation attenuation models considered here are the <b>lateral</b> wave <b>attenuation</b> model, the maximum attenuation (MA) model, and the foliage attenuation model which were recommended by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU-R). The following well-known propagation loss models that involve only the direct wave, or the direct wave and the ground effect are considered: Free space model, plane earth model, modified Okumura-Hata model for open area (or shortly: modified Hata), Lee model for free space area, and Lee model for open area. These models, combined with the vegetation attenuation, are compared with the experimental measurements performed in the forests of Nigeria at 92. 1 MHz. The comparison reveals that the proposed model can accurately predict the propagation in the forest environment. Furthermore, the propagation in the forest is predicted for different frequencies in the very high frequency (VHF) and the ultra high frequency (UHF) bands, where the attenuation increases with the higher frequency, as expected...|$|R

Which of these abnormalities contributes more to the habituation deficit cannot be determined with the common methods used to record transient visual responses. We investigated lateral inhibition in the visual cortex during the migraine cycle and in healthy subjects by using differential temporal modulations of radial windmill-dartboard (WD) or partial-windmill (PW) visual patterns. Methods: Transient (TR-VEP) and steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SS-VEP) were recorded in 65 migraine patients (21 without and 22 with aura between attacks; 22 patients during an attack) and in 21 healthy volunteers (HV). Three stimulations were used in each subject: classic checkerboard pattern (contrast-reversion 3. 1 Hz), WD and PW (contrast-reversion ~ 4 Hz). For each randomly presented stimulation protocol, 600 sweeps were acquired and off-line partitioned in 6 blocks of 100. Fourier analysis allowed data to extract in SS-VEP the fundamental (1 H) and the second harmonic (2 H) components that reflect respectively short-(WD) and long- range <b>lateral</b> inhibition (<b>attenuation</b> of 2 H in WD compared to PW).

40|$|As {{trains are}} {{continually}} designed for {{higher and higher}} speeds the problems of railway carriage vibration are on the increase. Lateral vibrations in a railway carriage are noticeable to passengers if the vibration frequencies are lower than approximately 20 Hz. Below this frequency discomfort is a common problem for the passengers and below approximately 1 Hz motion sickness is a problem. The passive solution of stiffening the carriage chassis to shift the vibrational frequencies higher up results in inflated manufacturing and running costs, and opposes higher travel speeds due to increased weight. Semi-passive solutions such as modifying the structural dynamics of the carriage body by decoupling heavy underfloor equipment do not reduce the vibrations sufficiently. However, by appending a multi-reference feedforward active vibration control system, one way expect a substantial reduction in the lateral vibration level. Using a dynamic computer model of a railway carriage simulating the lateral vibration, and using as input bogie acceleration data measured on a running train, multiple-input/single-output coherence spectra were shown to constitute a suitable set of reference signals for an active control system.

A clear linear relation of salinity and the <b>lateral</b> <b>attenuation</b> coefficient with R 2 = 0. 939 exists to address the close correlation of the attenuation of LPL with the scattering from the brine.

Our numerical experiments demonstrated that when used together, attenuation coefficients and phase velocities could characterize a lithological boundary as well as fracture zone. We applied the proposed method to multifold seismic reflection data acquired in Shikoku Island, Japan. We clearly observed abrupt changes in lateral variation of estimated attenuation coefficients around fault locations associated with a lithological boundary and with well-developed fractures, whereas phase velocity results could detect only the lithological boundary. Our study demonstrated that simultaneous interpretation of attenuation coefficients and phase velocities has the potential to distinguish localized fractures from lithological boundaries.|$|R

Expressions are derivedâfor the zeroth {{and first}} moments of an {{isolated}} normal mode multiplet {{in the presence}} of rotational anisotropy, <b>lateral</b> heterogeneity and <b>attenuation.</b> It is demonstrated that, to first order, the zeroth moment is independent of the heterogeneity and the first moment is a linear functional of the heterogeneity. The location of the multiplet, defined in terms of the ratio of the first moment to the zeroth moment, is used to set up a linear inverse problem for lateral variations. The approxima-tions employed in deriving the differential kernels are uniformly valid for all angular orders. In addition, formula for the differential kernels asymptotically valid in the limit of large angular order are developed, and the correspondence between these formulae and the geometrical optics approximation is estab-lished.

40|$|A merged, {{high-quality}} waveform dataset {{from different}} seismic networks {{has been used}} to improve our understanding of <b>lateral</b> seismic <b>attenuation</b> for Northern Italy. In a revious study on the same region, Morasca et al. (Bull Seismol Soc Am 98 : 1936 â 1946, 2008) were able to resolve only a small area due to limited data coverage. For this reason, the interpretation of the attenuation anomalies was difficult given the complexity of the region and the poor resolution of the available data. In order to better nderstand the lateral changes in the crustal structure and thickness of this region, we selected 770 earthquakes recorded by 54 stations for a total of almost 16, 000 waveforms derived from seismic networks operating totally or partially in Northern Italy. Direct S-wave and coda attenuation images were obtained using an amplitude ratio technique that eliminates source terms from the formulation. Both direct and early-coda amplitudes are used as input for the inversions, and the results are compared. Results were obtained for various frequency bands ranging between 0. 3 and 25. 0 Hz and in all cases show significant improvement with respect to the previous study since the resolved area has been extended and more crossing paths have been used to image smaller scale anomalies. Quality-factor estimates are consistent with the regional tectonic structure exhibiting a general trend of low attenuation under the Po Plain basin and higher values for the Western Alps and Northern Apennines.

Even though Y 2007 provides improved geometric-spreading correction of Pn amplitudes over the traditional power-law model, the corrected amplitudes exhibit undesirable decay-rate variations. To address this issue, we used a procedure to develop Pn spreading models based on observed data. We first correct the Pn amplitudes for attenuation using an average quality factor Q estimated from Y 2007 -corrected Pn amplitudes. We then develop a spreading model, which is a simplified version of Y 2007, by fitting the corrected amplitudes. Compared with Y 2007, the new spreading model significantly reduces amplitude variations, particularly at short distances. To more accurately model the complex data behavior, we also developed a segmented spreading model in which separate sets of model parameters are derived for amplitudes in different distance ranges. The spreading models developed in this study account for radially symmetric elastic and other effects, such as velocity gradient, forwarding scattering and potential depth-dependent attenuation variation, as well as geometric wavefront expansion and the spherical shape of the Earth. Using the new model for spreading correction results in better attenuation isolation and allows amplitudes in a broader distance range {{to be used in the}} accurate mapping of <b>lateral</b> <b>attenuation</b> variations. The method we employed in this study could be used as a general procedure to develop observation-based Pn spreading models for other regions...|$|E
40|$|Spiroperidol, which blocks {{dopamine}} (DA) receptors, attenuated self-stimulation of {{the nucleus}} accumbens, septal area, hippocampus, anterior hypothalamus and ventral tegmental area. Dopamine is thus involved in self-stimulation of many sites (in {{addition to the}} <b>lateral</b> hypothalamus). The <b>attenuation</b> was not a simple motor impairment {{of the speed of}} bar-pressing in that the nucleus accumbens and septal self-stimulation rates were lower than those in treated animals self-stimulating at other sites (Experiment 1). Feeding was partly attenuated, and drinking was much less attenuated by the spiroperidol. Since the rats bar-pressed for brain- stimulation reward, chewed pellets to eat, and licked a tube to drink, dopamine-receptor blockade may attenuate complex motor responses most. Alternatively, the blockade could affect brain- stimulation reward more than the controls of eating, and these latter more than the controls of drinking (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, feeding and drinking were equally and severely attenuated when rats had to bar-press to obtain food or water. The attenuation was to a level similar to that found for self-stimulation. These experiments suggest that dopamine receptor blockade impairs eating, drinking and self-stimulation by interfering with complex motor responses...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of source to building separation distances to screen sites that need further field investigation {{is becoming a}} common practice {{for the evaluation of}} the vapor intrusion pathway at sites contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons. Namely, for the source to building vertical distance, the screening criteria for petroleum vapor intrusion have been deeply investigated in the recent literature and fully addressed in the recent guidelines issued by ITRC and U. S. EPA. Conversely, {{due to the lack of}} field and modeling studies, the source to building lateral distance received relatively low attention. To address this issue, in this work we present a steady-state vapor intrusion analytical model incorporating a piecewise first-order aerobic biodegradation limited by oxygen availability that accounts for lateral source to building separation. The developed model can be used to evaluate the role and relevance of <b>lateral</b> vapor <b>attenuation</b> as well as to provide a site-specific assessment of the lateral screening distances needed to attenuate vapor concentrations to risk-based values. The simulation outcomes showed to be consistent with field data and 3 -D numerical modeling results reported in previous studies and, for shallow sources, with the screening criteria recommended by U. S. EPA for the vertical separation distance. Indeed, although petroleum vapors can cover maximum lateral distances up to 25 - 30 m, as highlighted by the comparison of model outputs with field evidences of vapor migration in the subsurface, simulation results by this new model indicated that, regardless of the source concentration and depth, 6 m and 7 m lateral distances are sufficient to attenuate petroleum vapors below risk-based values for groundwater and soil sources, respectively. However, for deep sources (> 5 m) and for low to moderate source concentrations (benzene concentrations lower than 5 mg/L in groundwater and 0. 5 mg/kg in soil) the above criteria were found extremely conservative as the model results indicated that for such scenarios the lateral screening distance may be set equal to zero...|$|R
30|$|Thus far, {{this study}} has focused {{primarily}} {{on the influence of}} the major features of crustal structure on Lg propagation and blockage. However, the influence of thick sediment cover over heterogeneous crust could well cause additional Lg attenuation effects, and some components of the Lg wave propagation variation across Japan might be associated with such thick sediment covers in addition to the crustal thickness changes. In the present large-scale (1, 900 km[*]Ã[*] 2, 000 km) 3 -D FDM simulation, the implementation of the low-wave speed (e.g., V s[*]<[*] 0.5 km/s) sediments while retaining the same span of frequencies is somewhat difficult, even when the most advanced supercomputers are used. However, the steadily improving state of computer technology should enable such simulations in the near future. In such high-resolution simulations, we will also need a detailed model of sedimentary layers that can be produced by combining different data derived by reflection experiments, tomography, etc. Furthermore, so far, we have assumed a constant Qs value in the crust and mantle, but <b>lateral</b> variation of <b>attenuation</b> structure could also cause a strong effect on high-frequency Lg wave propagation, such as when the waves cross the volcanic zone in the Tohoku region of Japan.|$|R
