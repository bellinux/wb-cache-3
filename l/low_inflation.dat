25|$|Macroeconomic {{policy-making}} is {{a context}} requiring multi-objective optimization. Typically {{a central bank}} must choose a stance for monetary policy that balances competing objectives — <b>low</b> <b>inflation,</b> low unemployment, low balance of trade deficit, etc. To do this, the central bank uses {{a model of the}} economy that quantitatively describes the various causal linkages in the economy; it simulates the model repeatedly under various possible stances of monetary policy, in order to obtain a menu of possible predicted outcomes for the various variables of interest. Then in principle it can use an aggregate objective function to rate the alternative sets of predicted outcomes, although in practice central banks use a non-quantitative, judgement-based, process for ranking the alternatives and making the policy choice.|$|E

40|$|The strong rise in {{consumer}} prices continues in Austria. During {{the last few}} months the rate of inflation hovered around 3. 5 percent and was markedly above the OECD average. In a comparison of inflation rates among industrial countries, Austria is doing very poorly and is now ranked 15 th, after having belonged to the top countries with the <b>lowest</b> <b>inflation.</b> Austria's inflation problems are "home-made". Inflationary pressures ease only very slowly despite lower prices of raw materials, more favourable exchange rates and the slack in demand. The high increase in prices of manufacturing products is especially startling. Apparently only part of the reduction in producer and import prices is being passed on to consumers. Furthermore, there are indications that the increase in the value added tax in Germany has also triggered a wave of price increases in Austria.

25|$|The early 2000s {{recession}} was {{a decline}} in economic activity which mainly occurred in developed countries. The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation. Japan's 1990s recession continued.

The Zimbabwean government stated that it would credit 5 US dollars to domestic bank accounts, with balances of up to 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars, and that it would exchange Zimbabwean dollars for US dollars at a rate of 1 USD to 35 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars to accounts with balances above 175 quadrillion Zimbabwean dollars. This move was meant to stabilise the economy and establish a credible nominal anchor under <b>low</b> <b>inflation</b> conditions. The exercise brought closure to the outstanding issue on the Zimbabwe dollar, further confirming the government's position that the local unit will not return anytime soon. The Government has maintained that the return of the Zimbabwe dollar would only be considered when key economic fundamentals, such productivity in key sectors, have been achieved.|$|E

Crime has continued to grow as a considerable social concern in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and a reversal of the currency peg where hyperinflation ensued. Consequently, the arms and drug trade has flourished and slums in Buneos Aires grew by 114% during the 1990s to around 113,000 people. These slums lack basic public services and law enforcement, and have become safe havens for criminal activities.|$|E
