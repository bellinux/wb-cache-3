Due to the different regions in this site regarding typography the site was divided up in to numerous areas assigned by letters covering 410m² and examining 11,500m² of sifted deposits. Area A is 2 x 1 x 1.7m large and nine layers were identified. Layer 2 at 9-30 cm deep Sgraffiato pottery with incisions and blue white porcelain bowl fragments were found. Layer 4 at 40-70 cm deep, revealed imported pink pottery sherds of Sgraffiato and green monochrome, these dated to 1430-1650 A.D. Layer 5 at 70-86 cm deep other pottery was found but white stoneware from the Tang dynasty was found, dated to 618-908 A.D. <b>Layer</b> <b>6</b> at 86-100 cm deep produced many blue-green pottery sherds and charcoal samples tested to be from 600-770 A.D.

40|$|SummaryRepeated cocaine {{exposure}} triggers adaptations in <b>layer</b> 5 / <b>6</b> glutamatergic neurons in {{the medial}} prefrontal cortex (mPFC) that promote behavioral sensitization and drug-seeking behavior. While suppression of metabotropic inhibitory signaling has {{been implicated in}} these behaviors, underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that Girk/KIR 3 channels mediate most of the GABAB receptor (GABABR) -dependent inhibition of <b>layer</b> 5 / <b>6</b> pyramidal neurons in the mPFC and that repeated cocaine suppresses this pathway. This adaptation was selective for GABABR-dependent Girk signaling in <b>layer</b> 5 / <b>6</b> pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex (PrLC) and involved a D 1 / 5 dopamine receptor- and phosphorylation-dependent internalization of GABABR and Girk channels. Persistent suppression of Girk signaling in <b>layer</b> 5 / <b>6</b> of the dorsal mPFC enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity and occluded behavioral sensitization. Thus, the cocaine-induced suppression of GABABR-Girk signaling in <b>layer</b> 5 / <b>6</b> pyramidal neurons of the prelimbic cortex appears to represent an early adaptation critical for promoting addiction-related behavior...|$|R

50|$|It {{is argued}} that the entire ventral visual-to-hippocampal stream is {{important}} for visual memory. This theory, unlike the dominant one, predicts that object-recognition memory (ORM) alterations could result from the manipulation in V2, {{an area that is}} highly interconnected within the ventral stream of visual cortices. In the monkey brain, this area receives strong feedforward connections from the primary visual cortex (V1) and sends strong projections to other secondary visual cortices (V3, V4, and V5). Most of the neurons of this area are tuned to simple visual characteristics such as orientation, spatial frequency, size, color, and shape. Anatomical studies implicate layer 3 of area V2 in visual-information processing. In contrast to layer 3, <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> of the visual cortex is composed of many types of neurons, and their response to visual stimuli is more complex.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} layers at Mummy Cave {{yielded a}} few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300 BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> the first parallel-oblique points appeared. By Layer 8, roughly corresponding to 6500 BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers 8, 9, 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf-shaped projectile points {{which have been}} interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer 16, radiocarbon dated to 5630 BC, {{a new type of}} point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers 21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau.|$|E

Morphologically distinct classes of <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> projection neuron {{have been identified in}} the mammalian visual cortex, which exhibit contrasting receptive field properties, but little information is available on their functional specificity. To address this we combined anatomical tracing techniques with high-resolution patch-clamp recording to identify morphological and functional distinct classes of <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> projection neurons in the rat primary visual cortex, which innervated separable subcortical territories. Multisite whole-cell recordings in brain slices revealed that corticoclaustral and corticothalamic <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> projection neurons exhibited similar somatically recorded electrophysiological properties. These classes of <b>layer</b> <b>6</b> projection neurons were sparsely and reciprocally synaptically interconnected, but could be differentiated by cell-class, but not target-cell-dependent rules of use-dependent depression and facilitation of unitary excitatory synaptic output.
