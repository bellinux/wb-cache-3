Mandel, however, left the band after a few tours, so female singer and guitarist Becky Barksdale was brought in for a tour of France, Germany and Hawaii; but lasted no longer. Smokey Hormel was also considered, but only played one gig before friction between de la Parra and Larry Taylor caused Taylor to bitterly go his separate way with Hormel in tow.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{progressing}} industrialization, {{the town}} outgrew its mediaeval town limits. In 1903 came the amalgamation of Niedergirmes with its extensive industrial works and the railway station neighbourhood. By {{the end of the}} First World War, the population had risen to over 15,000. Owing to increasing transportation problems, a ringroad was built {{to the west of the}} Old Town (Altstadt), taking the <b>load</b> <b>off</b> the old stone bridge across the Lahn by building a further bridge. In the Second World War, the town, being an industrial stronghold, also became the target of heavy bombing, which destroyed much of the railway station neighbourhood and Niedergirmes. The historic Old Town, however, was mostly spared the air raids.|$|E
25|$|With {{air traffic}} {{congestion}} reaching an unacceptable threshold in Mumbai, the AAI put its age-old plan of reviving the Juhu airport {{on the fast track}} to ease some pressure off of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport (CSIA) in 2010. The AAI appointed consulting major KPMG to draw up a development plan for Juhu airport. It was envisioned that the Juhu airstrip could take up to 18% <b>load</b> <b>off</b> CSI Airport with turboprop ATR and Boeing 737 aircraft. The plan was to extend the runway to 2000 meters in phases, this would have ultimately seen the airstrip jutting into the sea and utilizing reclaimed parts of the Juhu beach and seafront. Permission for the expansion was denied by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2010. Instead, the ministry asked for conservation of the land around the airstrip, stating that no development should take place there and that it should be conserved as a green space to compensate for the pollution caused by the airstrip.|$|E

500|$|As matches often {{started the}} day after the {{previous}} fixture, sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week—Sunday was always a rest day—Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate, except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire, the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower's XI, when they chose their strongest team. As a result, no member of the squad—Bradman included—played in more than 23 of the first-class matches. Thus, the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested, and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them. Wisden opined that [...] "in addition to his playing ability Hassett's cheerfulness and leadership, which extended to off-the-field relaxation {{as well as in the}} more exacting part of the programme, combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable <b>load</b> <b>off</b> Bradman's busy shoulders".|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, Prest-O-Lite made a [...] "Black Box" [...] {{ignition}} amplifier, {{intended to}} take the <b>load</b> <b>off</b> of the distributor's breaker points during high r.p.m. runs, which was used by Dodge and Plymouth on their factory Super Stock Coronet and Belvedere drag racers. This amplifier was installed on the interior side of the cars' firewall, and had a duct which provided outside air to cool the unit. The rest of the system (distributor and spark plugs) remains as for the mechanical system. The lack of moving parts compared with the mechanical system leads to greater reliability and longer service intervals.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Friedrich Kirchstein of Siemens of Berlin {{developed}} the V-2 radio control for motor-cut-off (...) [...] For velocity measurement, Professor Wolman of Dresden created an alternative of his Doppler tracking system in 1940–41, which used a ground signal transponded by the A-4 {{to measure the}} velocity of the missile. By 9 February 1942, Peenemünde engineer de Beek had documented the radio interference area of a V-2 as [...] around the [...] "Firing Point", and the first successful A-4 flight on 3 October 1943, used radio control for Brennschluss. Although Hitler commented on 22 September 1943 that [...] "It is a great <b>load</b> <b>off</b> our minds that we have dispensed with the radio guiding-beam; now no opening remains for the British to interfere technically with the missile in flight", about 20% of the operational V-2 launches were beam-guided. The Operation Pinguin V-2 offensive began on 8 September 1944, when Lehr- und Versuchsbatterie No. 444 (...) launched a single rocket guided by a radio beam directed at Paris. Wreckage of combat V-2s occasionally contained the transponder for velocity and fuel cutoff.|$|E

2500|$|Schmidt was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1973 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000. He was credited with revolutionizing the linebacker position with his speed, doing the job formerly performed by middle guards in stopping the run game while also taking the <b>load</b> <b>off</b> the defensive backs on pass defense. Some have credited him with [...] "virtually invent the middle linebacker position." [...] His biography at the Hall of Fame credits him with a big role in changing defensive play in the NFL:"Without question, {{he was the first to}} play the [...] position with such finesse that even the masses in the stands could see the growing value of the 'defensive quarterback.' He anticipated plays with uncanny accuracy. He was a deadly tackler. He was fast enough to evade a 250-pound guard, to follow a play along the line or to drop back to cover a pass. He was strong enough to power past a potential blocker to crumble a play. But his greatest talent may well have been his uncanny knack of knowing what the opposition was going to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{new service}} plan was {{designed}} to redistribute Queens-bound passenger loads along the heavily used IND Sixth Avenue Line by encouraging use of the additional local trains provided for shorter trips, and to improve service and transfer opportunities for passengers using local stations along Queens Boulevard.

[...] New York Times columnist Randy Kennedy wrote that four months after it opened, the service was operating at only 49% of capacity. However, ridership had [...] "increased 30 percent since it began, and every new V rider, as lonely {{as he or she}} might be, relieves crowding on the [...]" [...] Several years experience with the service running, has shown its value and seen further gains. V trains, while by no means consistently full, have taken some <b>load</b> <b>off</b> the [...] train; however, some riders have complained that the passenger load on the [...] train has worsened, while others said it has gotten better, due to its becoming the only express train that runs along 53rd Street. The overcrowding on the E train was, in part, due to riders' propensity to board an express even in situations where it offers no real advantage in travel time over the local.|$|E
