50|$|In {{addition}} to designing the recovery ship and its <b>lifting</b> <b>cradle,</b> the U.S. used concepts developed with Global Marine (see Project Mohole) that utilized their precision stability equipment {{to keep the}} ship nearly stationary above the target (and do this while lowering nearly three miles of pipe). They worked with scientists to develop methods for preserving paper that had been underwater for years in hopes {{of being able to}} recover and read the submarine's codebooks. The reasons this project was undertaken are likely to include the recovery of an intact nuclear missile (R-21, also known as NATO SS-N-5 Serb), and cryptological documents and equipment.|$|R
50|$|Shell {{received}} over 200 individual {{suggestions for}} {{what could be done}} with the Brent Spar. One of these came from the Stavanger Port Authority. They were planning a quay extension at Mekjarvik, to provide new Roll-On/Roll-Off ferry facilities. It was hoped that using slices of the Spar's hull would save both money and energy that would otherwise have been spent in new steel construction. The Spar was raised vertically in the water by building a <b>lifting</b> <b>cradle,</b> placed underneath the Spar and connected by cables to jacks on board heavy barges. Jacking the cables upwards raised the Spar so that its hull could be cut into 'rings' and slid onto a barge.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1983 he {{appeared}} during a public political demonstration by the Italian Communist Party, {{with which he}} was a sympathiser, and on this occasion he <b>lifted</b> and <b>cradled</b> the party's national leader Enrico Berlinguer. It was an unprecedented act, given that until that moment Italian politicians were proverbially serious and formal. Benigni was censored again in the 1980s for calling Pope John Paul II something impolite during an important live TV show ("Wojtylaccio", meaning [...] "Bad Wojtyla" [...] in Italian, but with a friendly meaning in Tuscan dialect).|$|R
60|$|Familiar as {{consolation}} by vague quotation was to Sister Hiler, {{there was}} an occult sympathy in the tone in which this was offered that lifted her for an instant out of her narrower self. She raised her eyes to his. The personal abstraction of the devotee had {{no place in the}} deep dark eyes that were <b>lifted</b> from the <b>cradle</b> to hers with a sad, discriminating, and almost womanly sympathy. Surprised out of her selfish preoccupation, she was reminded of her apparent callousness to what might be his present disappointment. Perhaps it seemed strange to her, too, that those tender eyes should go a-begging.|$|R
40|$|A systems level {{mechanisms}} {{test was}} conducted on the Orbital Sciences Corp. 's Transfer Orbit Stage (TOS). The TOS is a unique partially reusable transfer vehicle which will boost a satellite into its operational orbit from the Space Shuttle's cargo bay. The mechanical cradle and tilt assemblies will return to earth with the Space Shuttle while the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) and avionics package are expended. A mechanisms test was performed on the forward cradle and aft tilting assemblies of the TOS under thermal vacuum conditions. Actuating these assemblies under a 1 g environment and thermal vacuum conditions proved to be a complex task. Pneumatic test fixturing was used to <b>lift</b> the forward <b>cradle,</b> and tilt the SRM, and avionics package. Clinometers, linear voltage displacement transducers, and load cells were used in the thermal vacuum chamber to measure the performance and characteristics of the TOS mechanism assembly. Incorporation of the instrumentation and pneumatic system into the test setup was not routine since pneumatic actuation of flight hardware had not been previously performed in the facility. The methods used are presented along with the problems experienced during the design, setup and test phases...|$|R
2500|$|On 9 December 1971, {{ownership}} of the boat {{was transferred to the}} Oklahoma Maritime Advisory Board. The towing was divided into two phases. Phase one was a direct offshore tow from Orange to the Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans. At the shipyard, Batfish would be raised on steel <b>lifting</b> straps and <b>cradled</b> between two pairs of bare-decked barges, so the submarine's draft would be high enough to make phase two of the tow, [...] upriver, possible. Strike action at the Orange drydock caused the submarine to instead be towed to the Bethlehem Steel drydock in Beaumont, Texas. After a general inspection and clearing of fuel and ballast tanks, Batfish was sealed up and was ready to tow to Avondale on 1 March 1972. At Avondale, {{it was found that the}} four barges were insufficient to reduce the submarine's draft, and a new plan for six [...] barges, ballasted to the outside and linked together by steel cables. On 13 March, Batfish was partially secured to the barges by lifting straps, but no cables had been placed to bind them together. That afternoon, the English tanker Silverman passed through a nearby [...] zone at : the resulting wake sank one barge and seriously damaged several others, although Batfish herself escaped major harm.|$|R

50|$|The Western Electric model 500 {{improved}} upon several {{design features}} over the earlier telephones. While the 302 had the dial and hook switch mounted {{directly on the}} metal or plastic housing, all operational parts of the 500 telephone were mounted on the base plate, and the housing only contained two plungers to activate the hook switch when the handset was <b>lifted</b> from the <b>cradle.</b> Thus, the phone could be tested and serviced easily without the housing. This design improved manufacturing and servicing efficiency. The earlier 302 had been equipped with an enamel-coated dial plate that displayed the numerals and letters through the holes of the rotary finger-wheel. Years of use caused the lettering and numbering, and even the porcelain coating, to wear off. The design of the 500 improved this by molding the characters into the plastic, through a double-injection molding process. This design was carried over to the 1500 and 2500-series telephones and {{was used in the}} touch-tone keys to eliminate wear. The numbers and letters on the 500 were moved to the circumference of the dial plate to make them clearly visible {{from a wide range of}} viewing angles even while the dial was spinning back to its resting position, and dots were placed in the center of the finger holes as targets to help position the finger quicker for dialing of the next digit while the wheel was still spinning back. After extensive testing, this arrangement had the benefit of reducing the rate of dialing errors, and increased the speed of dialing each digit by fractions of a second. The 500 series replaced many metal parts, especially in the dial, with much more durable Nylon components.|$|R
5000|$|IMTS systems {{typically}} had 25 {{watts of}} transmitter {{power at the}} mobile station and 100-250 Watts at the terminal â€” unlike the older cellular car telephones that had maximum power output of 3 watts and modern cellular handsets with power outputs of 0.6 watts. Mobile installations normally consisted of a [...] "head unit" [...] or the telephone handset which sat in a cradle with a direct dialing keyboard. These looked and functioned much like a landline, or hardwired, telephone. Unlike cellular handsets, these units passed through a dial tone when the receiver was <b>lifted</b> from the <b>cradle</b> {{and in this way}} seemed more like a landline telephone than a cellular handset. There was a separate large radio transceiver chassis, typically measuring at least a foot square and 6 inches high, that was mounted either in the trunk or under the seats of an automobile. These transceivers were connected to the handset cradle with a multi-conductor cable usually around [...]5 inch thick. The mobile antennas almost always required a hole to be drilled {{in the body of the}} car to mount the antenna in; until the 1970s there were no [...] "on-glass" [...] antennas - these were developed later for the cellular car-mounted telephones. The antennas looked much like those used for CB radios and were about 19 in. long (1/4 wavelength at 155 MHz). These mobile telephone systems required a large amount of power (10 to 15 amperes at 12 volts) and this was supplied by thick power cabling connected directly to the automobile's battery. It therefore was quite possible and not uncommon for an IMTS telephone to drain an automobile's battery if used for moderate periods of time without the automobile engine running or if left on overnight. Optionally these units were also connected to the car's horn and were switched to honk the horn as a ringer when receiving an incoming call if the user was away from the car at the time of the call.|$|R
