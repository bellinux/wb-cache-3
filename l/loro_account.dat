25|$|The {{central bank}} {{maintains}} loro {{accounts for a}} group of commercial banks, the so-called direct payment banks. A balance on such a <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> (it is a nostro account {{in the view of the}} commercial bank) represents central bank money in the regarded currency.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central bank money is generated in the seller's <b>loro</b> <b>account,</b> increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E
50|$|The {{central bank}} CB(Ccy) of a {{currency}} can maintain a <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> for a bank (which the bank {{would call a}} nostro account).|$|E
50|$|If the payer P {{maintains}} a <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> for another bank X, P {{can act as}} a payment agent for X:X instructs P to pay to R; then P instructs CB(Ccy) to pay on behalf of X: X→P→CB→R.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also the}} notion of a <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> ("theirs"), which is a record of an account held by a second bank on behalf of a third party; that is, my record of their account with you. In {{practice}} this is rarely used, the main exception being complex syndicated financing.|$|E
50|$|Classical {{economic}} theory postulates a distinctive {{relationship between the}} supply of central bank money and short-term interest rates: like for a commodity, a higher demand for central bank money would increase its price, the interest rate.When there is an increased demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds.

A balance on such a <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> (it is a nostro account {{in the view of the}} commercial bank) represents central bank money in the regarded currency.Since central bank money currently exists mainly in the form of electronic records (electronic money) rather than in the form of paper or coins (physical money), open market operations can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (crediting or debiting) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank. This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop methods of {{evaluating}} the liquidity level for the banking sector by using a new indicator called structural liquidity. The paper carries out in detail mathematical conclusions about influence of CBR refinancing policy on the <b>loro</b> <b>account</b> and, as a consequence, on the structural liquidity. A model of determination of CBR changes in the money level supply necessary to reach the target interest rate of the Federal fund market is also proposed. The model includes the Kalman filter and offers target policy asymptotic estimatesRefinancing; structural liquidity; loro account; Kalman filter; interbank market; target policy...|$|E
