50|$|Each of the AX-60's 6 {{synthesizer}} voices {{consist of}} a single oscillator, which can output sawtooth, triangle, square, or sawtooth+triangle waveforms. Interestingly, pulse-width modulation is available for all four waveforms, with a dedicated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> for this parameter. Pitch can be modulated by an LFO or the VCF cutoff frequency ADSR envelope generator, while the VCA volume has its own envelope generator.|$|E

50|$|The {{resistor}} can {{be replaced}} with a FET in its ohmic mode to implement a voltage-controlled phase shifter; the voltage on the gate adjusts the phase shift. In electronic music, a phaser typically consists of two, four or six of these phase-shifting sections connected in tandem and summed with the original.

50|$|The Yamaha CS30/CS30L is {{an analog}} {{keyboard}} synthesizer that {{was released in}} 1977. It is {{the top of the}} range in Yamaha's original line-up of monophonic synthesizers, others in the range being the CS5, CS10 and CS15. It features two voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs), two voltage controlled filters (VCFs - both featuring low-pass, band-pass and high-pass options), two voltage controlled amplifiers (VCAs) and three envelope generators. It also sports a ring modulator and a voltage controlled <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO).</b>|$|E
50|$|The Solo rank {{features}} a 3-octave keyboard with 37 keys that are full width but shorter than standard. Directly above the Solo keyboard runs the Portamento keyboard - a ribbon controller {{which can be}} used to play continuously variable pitches roughly corresponding to the Solo keyboard note below. The Portamento keyboard overrides the solo keyboard if used simultaneously. The Solo rank has only a single oscillator, but has a dedicated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO),</b> pitch envelope generator and ring modulator.|$|E

50|$|Four rubber {{rectangular}} pads {{connected to}} a main module with one oscillator producing pulse and sawtooth waveforms. It also had a white noise generator, Low Frequency <b>Oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> with triangle and pulse waveforms, a mixer and a low-pass filter with Resonance and Cutoff controls. It also had an envelope generator with attack, decay, sustain, and release. Made from 1975 to 1981.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{document}} is a design and realization of a synthesizer combining additive and subtractive synthesis in Max/MSP. The synthesizer will distinguish itself from others with its high variability of amplitude envelopes, low frequency <b>oscillators</b> (<b>LFO)</b> and an option of micro interval tuning and inharmonious spectrum. There will also be an option to setup the parameters by typing a text string...|$|R
5000|$|There is {{a variant}} of auto-wah that {{utilizes}} a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> instead of an envelope detector to alter the effect. The filter response varies constantly with time and is not linked to playing dynamics. The Boss AW-2 {{is an example of}} such a device. The difference in sound is subtle, but careful listeners will notice the constant period of the filter sweep. The song [...] "Falling Into Grace" [...] by the Red Hot Chili Peppers is an example of an LFO controlled auto-wah applied to the bass guitar.|$|E
50|$|Most SD synthesizers use {{a single}} DCO (plus a digital noise {{generator}} for certain waveforms) per voice, and offer 32 possible waveforms. The top-of-the-line Casio HT-6000 offered 64 possible waveforms, 4 DCO's per voice, velocity, detuning, ring-modulation, and an expanded SD parameter set. In SD synthesis, an analog voltage-controlled resonant filter (VCF) {{is used to}} shape the DCO's waveform (whereas on Casio CZ Synthesizers the phase distortion engine could only emulate a resonant filter). The SD sound is further shaped by a digitally controlled amplitude (DCA) envelope. Both the VCF and DCA are programmed with traditional 4-stage attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) curves the CZ line used sophisticated 8-stage envelopes and also included a pitch envelope. Finally, like on the CZ's, a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> is programmable to modulate the DCO pitch, but unfortunately it cannot modulate the VCF or DCA. Nearly all of the SD synth parameters had 5-bit precision, allowing a stepwise range of 0-31.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} somewhat {{similar to those}} found in the Roland JX-3P or Teisco SX-240, in that there are two oscillators (referred to as [...] "OSC"s) per voice, with the option of sawtooth and/or square waveforms. These oscillators are controlled digitally with analog circuitry used only to create the sawtooth waveshape. OSC2 can be synchronized to OSC1, or the two oscillators can be cross-modulated. The OSCs can be separated by semitone intervals (up to four octaves) and detuned (to approximately a semitone). There is pulse-width modulation of the square wave of OSC1 (with a dedicated <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> for this) and a square-wave sub-oscillator that is fixed at one octave lower. OSC2's pitch can be modulated by one of the two ADSR envelope generators, which are dedicated to VCA volume and VCF cutoff frequency. The filter is a 24dB/octave (four-pole) resonant lowpass type, and there is also a separate 12 dB/octave highpass filter that is not envelope controlled.|$|E
50|$|The chorus {{consists}} of two modules - a dual <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> and the triple delay line <b>oscillator.</b> The <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> puts out 0,6 Hz and 6 Hz mixed together as a tri-phase of the low-frequency oscillation to the delay line oscillator. The delay line oscillator {{consists of}} three TCA350 circuits - a chain of 185 MOS double transistor stages, which samples the audio signal, which is then modulated (FM) by the dual LFO so the output samples are shorter or longer.|$|R
50|$|Two partials grouped {{together}} created a tone. Tones could be modified using {{up to three}} <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> a pitch envelope, a programmable equalizer, and on-board effects such as reverberation and chorus. Two tones {{grouped together}} created a patch.|$|R

5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A [...] "poly mod" [...] parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's voltage-controlled filter (VCF) when they are layered in [...] "double" [...] mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff frequency, resonance (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. [...] "Unison" [...] (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released ("legato", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be [...] "linked" [...] to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds.|$|E
40|$|Frequency {{multiplication}} (FM) {{can be used}} {{to design}} low power frequency synthesizers. This is achieved by running the VCO at a much reduced frequency, while employing a power efficient frequency multiplier, and also thereby eliminating the first few dividers. Quadrature signals can be generated by frequency- multiplying low frequency I/Q signals, however this also multiplies the quadrature error of these signals. Another way is generating additional edges from the <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> and develop a quadrature FM. This makes the I-Q precision heavily dependent on process mismatches in the ring oscillator. In this paper we examine the use of fewer edges from LFO and a single stage polyphase filter to generate approximate quadrature signals, which is then followed by an injection-locked quadrature VCO to generate high- precision I/Q signals. Simulation comparisons with the existing approach shows that the proposed method offers very good phase accuracy of 0. 5 deg with only a modest increase in power dissipation for 2. 4 GHz IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard using UMC 0. 13 mum RFCMOS technology...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new class of digital audio effects which can {{automatically}} relate parameter values to the tempo of a musical input in real-time. Using a beat tracking system as the front end, we demonstrate a tempo-dependent delay effect and a set of beat-synchronous low frequency <b>oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> effects including auto-wah, tremolo and vibrato. The effects show better performance than might be expected as they are blind to certain beat tracker errors. All effects are implemented as VST plug-ins which operate in real-time, enabling their use both in live musical performance and the off-line modification of studio recordings...|$|R
40|$|Envelope {{generator}} (EG) and Low Frequency <b>Oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> parameters give {{a compact}} representation of audio pitch envelopes. By estimating these parameters from audio per-note, {{they could be}} used as part of an audio coding scheme. Recordings of various instruments and articulations were examined, and pitch envelopes found. Using an evolutionary algorithm, EG and LFO parameters for the envelopes were estimated. The resulting estimated envelopes are compared to both the original envelope, and to a fixedpitch estimate. Envelopes estimated using EG+LFO can closely represent the envelope from the original audio and provide a more accurate estimate than the mean pitch. 1...|$|R
50|$|The primary {{oscillator}} circuits of a synthesizer {{are used}} to create the audio signals. A LFO is a secondary oscillator that operates at a significantly lower frequency (hence its name), typically below 20 Hz. This lower frequency or control signal is used to modulate another component's value, changing the sound without introducing another source. Like a standard oscillator, this usually {{takes the form of}} a periodic waveform, such as a sine, sawtooth, triangle or square wave. Also like a standard <b>oscillator,</b> <b>LFOs</b> can incorporate any number of waveform types, including user-defined wavetables, rectified waves and random signals.|$|R
25|$|A phaser is an {{electronic}} sound processor used to filter a signal {{by creating a}} series of peaks and troughs in the frequency spectrum. The position of the peaks and troughs of the waveform being affected is typically modulated so that they vary over time, creating a sweeping effect. For this purpose, phasers usually include a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{modulation}} {{section of this}} synthesizer features a <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillator</b> with four available waveforms (triangle, square, sawtooth and random) which can be routed to VCF cutoff, VCO pitch or VCA amplitude. These also have a programmable delay before their effect sets in. A second LFO is dedicated to pulse-width modulation, and only its rate and depth are programmable.|$|R
50|$|The Omni {{featured}} preset, electronically generated Orchestral ensemble String voices including polyphonic Violin and Viola {{sounds as}} well as monophonic Bass and Cello. The instrument also included a monophonic Bass Synthesizer section and a polyphonic Synthesizer section. The Synthesizer section featured a 24 dB/oct Voltage-Controlled Low Pass Filter (LPF); an ADSR envelope generator and a single waveform (triangle) Low Frequency <b>Oscillator</b> (<b>LFO)</b> were both routed to control the VCF Cutoff frequency. A Waveform Enhancement switch allowed selection of a square wave voice waveform vs. the default quasi-sawtooth waveform. The ARP Omni had a unique logo that was painted on to the back face of the unit.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{very similar}} to a Korg Poly-800, in that it {{operates}} like an analog synth, but its <b>oscillators,</b> <b>LFO</b> and envelope generators are all digital. Like the Poly-800, the DK-70 has eight oscillators/voices, but all the voices are mixed together through a single [...] "monophonic" [...] analog lowpass filter which was shared for all voices. Like a monophonic synthesizer, the filter was switchable between single or multiple modes. In single mode, the first key pressed triggers the filter envelope, and unless all keys are released, the filter does not re-trigger. In multi mode, each key pressed in turn triggers the filter envelope, even if other keys are still pressed down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{former is}} termed the optical-spring effect and {{may lead to}} {{significant}} frequency shifts {{in the case of}} <b>low-frequency</b> <b>oscillators,</b> such as pendulum mirrors.

For a harmonic oscillator, the relation between a frequency shift and a change in the spring constant originates from Hooke's law.|$|R
