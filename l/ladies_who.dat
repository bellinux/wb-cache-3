5|$|Because of the immigrants’ {{loneliness}} {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr described one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and everyone was moved by it.|$|E
5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like beard and the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E

25|$|In Limehouse, Chang {{opened the}} Shanghai Restaurant. He lived at 13 Limehouse Causeway {{on the middle}} floor of a three-storey house, with just a kitchen and bedroom at his disposal. The bedroom was luxuriously {{decorated}} with a blue and silver design featuring dragons. Chang's customers were far more conspicuous in Limehouse, however, {{than they had been}} in the West End and a police detective noted the stream of glamorous young <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> visited him. Chang's home was raided twice and on one of those occasions the police found two chorus girls in his bed.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, Palin {{has written}} and {{presented}} occasional documentary programmes on artists that interest him. The first, on Scottish painter Anne Redpath, was Palin on Redpath in 1997. In The Bright Side of Life (2000), Palin continued on a Scottish theme, {{looking at the}} work of the Scottish Colourists. Two further programmes followed on European painters; Michael Palin and the <b>Ladies</b> <b>Who</b> Loved Matisse (2004) and Michael Palin and the Mystery of Hammershøi (2005), about the French artist Henri Matisse and Danish artist Vilhelm Hammershøi respectively. The DVD Michael Palin on Art contains all these documentaries except for the Matisse programme.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the company}} in the train were four <b>ladies,</b> <b>who</b> are deserving of honourable mention, from the courage they {{displayed}} in accompanying it, namely, Mrs. Nichs. Wood, and Miss F. Wood, Mrs. I. L. Bell, and her sister, Miss Pattinson of Washington. As the train passed steadily over the bridge the anxiety of the immense multitude seemed intense, and the scene was truly exciting, yet fearful—not only from the lofty eminence occupied by the train, but, from the apparent narrowness and nakedness of the platform on which it rolled along. It seemed from its noiselessness, rather an aerial flight, than the rattling sweep of the iron horse.|$|E

25|$|His {{first wife}} was Woizero Ejigayehu (whom he married in 1844 and {{divorced}} in 1845); their one child, baptised Sahle Mariam, was renamed Menelik by Negus Sahle Selassie. Her background is disputed; some {{believe she was}} of Oromo origin, others insist that she was among the <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> were brought from the Imperial court at Gondar to Ankober to instruct the royal women of Shewa on court etiquette so that the Shewan branch of the dynasty could adopt the same court practices as the elder Gondar branch. In May 1845 he married his second wife, Woizero Tideneqialesh, who was a former wife of a court official.|$|E
25|$|In October 1806 Ball sent Spencer to {{negotiate}} with the Dey of Algiers for the release of some Maltese whom the Algerians had enslaved before Malta became a British possession. As Spencer was about to leave, his mission unsuccessful, the Dey, expressing his wish to be friendly with Britain, released 30 men and two <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> had been slaves for more than 15 years. He also requested that a British frigate come to take his ambassador to Constantinople. On Spencer's return, the Government of Malta presented him with a piece of plate valued at 100 guineas. At a later date, Spencer received a second piece of plate, this one worth 40 guineas, in appreciation of his efforts to protect Malta's trade.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1509 Mary Scrope's first husband, Edward Jerningham, {{was one of}} {{the gentleman}} ushers at the funeral of King Henry VII, and Mary herself, as 'Mrs Jerningham', was among the ladies granted mantlets and kerchiefs for the funeral. On 12 June 'Edward Jerningham and Mary his wife' were granted a life estate in the manors of Lowestoft and Mutford, which had been {{forfeited}} to the Crown by the attainder of Mary's brother-in-law, Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk. On 24 June Edward Jerningham was chief cup-bearer at the coronation of Catherine of Aragon, and Mary, listed as 'Mrs Mary Jerningham', was among the ladies granted cloth for gowns for the occasion.

25|$|Guinevere {{has been}} portrayed as {{everything}} from a weak and opportunistic traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous gentlewoman. In Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in Marie de France's Lanval (and Thomas Chestre's Middle English version, Sir Launfal), she is a vindictive adulteress, disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien {{were some of the}} first to elaborate on the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> played highly social roles.|$|E
25|$|Adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom was {{not made}} a {{requirement}} for entry into LDS Church temples until 1902. However, even then, church president Joseph F. Smith encouraged stake presidents to be liberal with old men who used tobacco and old <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> drank tea. Of those who violated the revelation, it was mainly habitual drunkards that {{were excluded from the}} temple. Around the turn of the century, the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom were not strictly adhered to by such notable church leaders. Anthon H. Lund, a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank beer and wine; apostle Matthias F. Cowley drank beer and wine; Charles W. Penrose, who also served as a First Counselor in the First Presidency, drank wine; Relief Society general president Emmeline B. Wells drank coffee; and church president George Albert Smith drank brandy for medicinal purposes. In 1921, church president Heber J. Grant made adherence to the proscriptions of the Word of Wisdom an absolute requirement for entering the temple.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{concentrates}} on witchcraft to such degree that {{she goes to}} live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess. Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan still {{will be able to}} control demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. After Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there, Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this. In the Vulgate La Mort le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just Mort Artu), Morgan vanishes {{for a long time and}} stops troubling Arthur, who assumes her to be dead. One day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king is overjoyed of their reunion and allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon to live there with other sorceresses. However, the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Sir Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. At the end of Mort Artu, Morgan is the first among the black-hooded <b>ladies</b> <b>who</b> take the dying Arthur to his final rest in Avalon.|$|E

[...] As a woman, Victoria saw them without veils. The Munshi and his family were housed in cottages at Windsor, Balmoral and Osborne, the Queen's retreat on the Isle of Wight. Victoria visited regularly, usually bringing her female guests, including the Empress of Russia and the Princess of Wales, to meet the Munshi's female relatives.
