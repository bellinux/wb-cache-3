5|$|Most of {{the address}} is an {{extended}} policy statement about his eight years in office, with some pointed comments mixed in highlight certain points, in which he builds a case for the steps needed to perpetuate the union, a concept that began to germinate among and between the states during the Revolutionary War. In doing so he <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> a well-formed and functioning Constitution (the rule of law), along with the proper habits and dispositions (both intellectual and religious) of the people as essential. Washington also lays out the greatest threats he sees to the Union, warning Americans to: distrust the passions of political factionalism, be wary of foreign interference in the nation's domestic affairs, and avoid an entangling foreign policy.|$|E
5|$|A US {{version of}} the music video was {{directed}} by Tim Hope. The video employs a dream-like animated world, with woodland glades, cartoon flowers which bloom instantly and the air full of clockwork-like insects and birds, but with real people embedded within it. On top of a mountain, a woman (Nerys Davies) waters plants inside a house. The band are aboard a horse carriage that travels through a rural landscape. A small coloured bird flies from the carriage up to the house, lands on the woman's windowsill and flaps its wings as if delivering a message. It transforms into a crow and then into a huge black menacing bird. The bird flies over the house and turns into a black cloud, which pours rain onto the land. The rain burns holes on the things it falls on, and crow feathers protrude from the holes. Finally a tornado <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the house, spinning it across the sky and then dropping it precisely on a normal suburban street. The video's acclaimed visuals earned Hope an MTV Video Music Award for Best Art Direction in 2002. It was also nominated for Breakthrough Video.|$|E
25|$|Moving {{the pointer}} a long distance: When a {{practical}} limit of mouse movement is reached, one <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the mouse, brings {{it to the}} opposite edge of the working area while it is held above the surface, and then replaces it down onto the working surface. This is often not necessary, because acceleration software detects fast movement, and moves the pointer significantly faster in proportion than for slow mouse motion.|$|E

25|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is striken, the hammer <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|E
25|$|Pécs is {{open from}} the south. Mecsek <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> to 400–600 {{meters from the}} Pécsi plain of about 120–130 meters. Jakab-hill, located in western Mecsek, is 592m high, Tubes, {{straight}} above Pécs, is 612 m, and Misina is 535 m. Higher {{parts of the city}} climb up to 200–250 m, mainly Pécsbánya, Szabolcsfalu, Vasas and Somogy. Graveyards pulled back to a relatively small area. Woody areas generally start from about 300 m height. Mecsek is divided by several valleys which have key role in ameliorating the climate of the city without lakes and rivers. Waters coming down from Mecsek are collected by Pécsi water under the east-west rail road leading them eventually to the Danube.|$|E

500|$|The cap is convex to broadly convex before {{flattening}} out in age, {{and reaches}} diameters between [...] wide. The surface is dry to moist, smooth, and in maturity {{appears to be}} made of flattened fibers arranged radially. As the mushroom ages, the cap color changes from white to fuscous (dusky brownish grey) or brown, usually with olive, grayish or pale tan regions. The cap margin, initially curved downward, <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> and becomes lobed or irregular with age. The flesh is thick and white, with a strongly [...] odor similar to cucumber or watermelon rind. Gills initially have an emarginate (notched) to adnate attachment to the stipe, but pull away as the mushroom matures to become seceding or almost free from attachment. They are thick and closely spaced, and whitish in color, sometimes developing pale pink tints. The solid stipe measures [...] long by [...] thick, and is either equal in width through its length or slightly club-shaped. It has a dry surface, and a texture that is smooth to silky fibrillose above the ring, and appressed fibrillose to scaly below the ring. The ring, located in the middle to upper half of the stem, is sometimes inconspicuous. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown with certainty, although it has been noted to have a strongly farinaceous taste, and an unpleasant odor [...] "strongly reminiscent of rotting white potatoes." ...|$|E

Mark, after he was dead and buried, 'In hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' Second. That all that are ungodly, and do live and die in their sins, so soon as ever they die, they go into hell: he died and was buried; 'And in hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' Third. That some are so fast asleep, and secure in their sins, that they scarce know well where they are till they come into hell; and that I gather from these words, 'In hell he <b>lifted</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.' He was asleep before, but hell makes him <b>lift</b> <b>up</b> his eyes.|$|R

2500|$|Feeney {{attended}} Portland High School, Portland, Maine, {{where he}} was a successful fullback and defensive tackle. He earned the nickname [...] "Bull" [...] {{because of the way he}} would lower his helmet and charge the line. A Portland pub is named Bull Feeney's in his honor. He later moved to California and in 1914 began working in film production as well as acting for his older brother Francis, adopting [...] "Jack Ford" [...] as a professional name.

2500|$|If all {{the players}} choose to not take the card, then the dealer calls, [...] "Second", which means there is another chance in taking the card. If someone takes it as Sun, then {{no one else can}} buy it over him even if they were of a higher priority. That is a {{significant}} advantage of buying Sun in the second round over the first; that no one else can take it from you even if they were of a higher priority. They lose that right by saying no in the second round. But if someone takes it as Hokom, then the Hokom must be something different from the suit of the public card because it is on the second mode. Other players can take the card as Sun. The player that takes it as Hokom, has the option to choose between three suits before lifting up the two cards that the dealer just gave. Or it is Sun if the player <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the two cards before naming a suit for Hokom. There is not [...] "Ashkal" [...] in the second round.|$|E
2500|$|The deacon {{presents}} the Gospel Book for the priest to kiss (if the bishop is present, {{it is presented}} to him instead) The deacon then points to the Holy Doors with his orarion, and bowing says to the priest, [...] "Bless, Master, the holy entrance." [...] The priest blesses with his hand and says, [...] "Blessed is the entrance of Thy holy ones, always, now and ever, and unto the ages of ages." [...] When the choir finishes singing the Third Antiphon (usually the Beatitudes), the deacon (or priest) <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the Gospel Book and says, [...] "Wisdom! Let us attend!" [...] (if it is a Great Feast of the Lord, he first says a special entrance verse, usually taken from the Psalms) The choir then sings the Entrance Hymn: [...] "Come let us worship and fall down before Christ! O Son of God, save us who sing to Thee: Alleluia!" [...] and the Troparia and Kontakia of the day. Meanwhile, the deacon and priest go in through the Holy Doors, the deacon replaces the Gospel Book on the Holy Table, and both he and the priest kiss the Holy Table. The priest silently says the Prayer of the Trisagion.|$|E

2500|$|Weeks later, Takua {{and fellow}} Matoran Jaller {{discover}} a great Kanohi mask hidden under their village. After {{playing in the}} opening tournament of the popular Matoran sport, Kohlii, they {{take it to the}} Turaga, who confirm it is the Avohkii - the Mask of Light - prophesied to be worn by a seventh Toa with the elemental power of Light who can defeat the Makuta for good and begin the process of reawakening Mata Nui. Learning of Takua and Jaller's mission, Makuta unleashes his [...] "sons", the Rahkshi - six robotic suits of armor powered by slug-like Kraata created from his very essence - to track down and kill the herald who Makuta identifies as Takua, despite the Chronicler's denial. The Toa Nuva battle the Rahkshi across Mata Nui, who destroy the villages of Ta-Koro and Onu-Koro in their search. Toa and Rahkshi and Matoran come together at Kini Nui in a final confrontation, killing Jaller in its last moments. The death of his friend convinces Takua that he is the true herald. Donning the Avohkii, he transforms into Takanuva - Toa of Light - and travels underground to face the Makuta. Followed {{by the rest of the}} Mata Nui populace, Takanuva confronts Makuta in his lair and clashes with him in a game of Kohlii, before both fall into a pool of energized protodermis and re-emerge as Takutanuva, a fusion of the two. The being <b>lifts</b> <b>up</b> the gate to an underground city to let the Toa, Turaga and Matoran through and manages to revive Jaller, before the weight of the gate crushes him. The Turaga retrieve the intact Avohkii from his demise and use it to revive Takanuva, while the Makuta's fate is unknown. Preparing to journey to the lost city, the Turaga reveal its name as Metru Nui, the Matoran's original home, and go on to reveal that the Toa Nuva are not in fact the first Toa.|$|E
