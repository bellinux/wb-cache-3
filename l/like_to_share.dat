2500|$|Snowden's {{decision}} to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March 2007 posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station.

Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January 2013. According to Poitras, Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney. What originally attracted Snowden to both Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras' controversial films had made her a target of the government.|$|E

The distribution of property influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power.

60|$|A {{study of}} New York civilization in 1849 has lately {{come into my}} hands, with a mortifying effect, which I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> with the reader, to my pride of modernity. I had somehow {{believed}} that after {{half a century of}} material prosperity, such as the world has never seen before, New York in 1902 must be very different from New York in 1849, but if I am to trust either the impressions of the earlier student or my own, New York is essentially the same now that it was then. The spirit of the place has not changed; it is as it was, splendidly and sordidly commercial. Even the body of it has undergone little or no alteration; it was as shapeless, as incongruous; as ugly when the author of 'New York in Slices' wrote as it is at this writing; it has simply grown, or overgrown, on the moral and material lines which seem to have been structural in it from the beginning. He felt in his time the same vulgarity, the same violence, in its architectural anarchy that I have felt in my time, and he noted how all dignity and beauty perished, amid the warring forms, with a prescience of my own affliction, which deprives me of the satisfaction of a discoverer and leaves me merely the sense of being rather old-fashioned in my painful emotions.|$|E
