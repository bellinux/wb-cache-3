5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Iron Curtain and the {{economic}} and political barriers that followed, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market. Exported porcini and other wild fungi are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists, but collection on a commercial scale does not. Picking B.edulis has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like Bulgaria, especially for many Roma communities and the unemployed. A <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.|$|E
5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged geographic location {{at the crossroads of}} three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control,</b> many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{sun drying}} {{has been used}} for some {{products}} such as tomatoes, mushrooms, and beans, spreading the produce on racks and turning the crop at intervals. This method suffers from several disadvantages including <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over drying rates, spoilage when drying is slow, contamination by dirt, wetting by rain, and attack by rodents, birds, and insects. These disadvantages can be alleviated by using solar powered driers. The dried produce must be prevented from reabsorbing moisture during storage.|$|E

5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, but the report claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 20 November Stavka telephoned Stalingrad Front {{commander}} Andrei Yeremenko asking if he would begin his portion of the offensive on schedule, at 08:00. He responded he would do so only if the fog lifted; although the 51st Army opened its artillery barrage on time because front headquarters could not contact the division, {{the rest of the}} forces prepared for the operation received orders to postpone the attack until 10:00. The 51st Army engaged the Romanian 6th Corps, taking many prisoners. As the 57th Army joined the attack at 10:00, the situation developed {{in such a way that}} the Stalingrad Front could throw its armored corps into battle. The German 297th Infantry Division watched as its Romanian support failed to put up resistance against the Red Army. However, confusion and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> caused the Soviet 4th and 13th Mechanized Corps to stumble as they began to exploit the breakthroughs achieved by the opening offensive.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October 1999, Minister of Transport Dag Jostein Fjærvoll {{asked the}} {{directors}} of the three involved parties, Osmund Ueland of NSB, Sverre Quale of the inspectorate and Steinar Killi of the National Rail Administration, to meet at his office the following day if the issue was not resolved. The following day, the inspectorate gave permission for the trains to be taken into use, despite noting a series of non-conformities with safety regulations: the inspectorate lacked a list of the train's deviations from the safety regulations; lack of a system to automatically monitor the speed of the trains, particularly when automatic train stop was disconnected; lack of safety training for the crew; lack of an evacuation analysis; and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> of the marking of safety equipment. Most of the deviations were to be followed up within two weeks. Quale stated that the deviated issues were of a nature which had not previously been applied to trains and that it was therefore not critical.|$|E

5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on the subject at the time, criticized the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E
5|$|As Garfield entered {{office in}} March 1881, the Republican party schism {{that had been}} patched up for the {{election}} tore apart once more. Garfield appointed Blaine to the cabinet, and Conkling's Stalwart faction became irked at their <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> over patronage, even in Conkling's home state of New York. Garfield appointed William H. Robertson, a civil service reform supporter, to the most lucrative government post in New York, and refused to withdraw the nomination despite Conkling's protests; in response, Conkling and his allies brought all legislative action in the closely divided Senate to a halt. In May, Conkling and fellow New York Senator Thomas C. Platt resigned from the Senate in protest. The two Stalwarts expected the New York legislature to reelect them in triumph; instead, the legislature deadlocked for months, eventually declining to return either man to the Senate. Before that result was known, however, tragedy struck as Charles Guiteau, a mentally unstable man disappointed at being unable to secure a patronage appointment, shot Garfield on July 2, 1881.|$|E
5|$|Bickford was {{expected}} to start the 1948 season {{in the minor leagues}} due to <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> However, a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster. His Major League debut was on April 24, 1948 in a 16–9 loss against the New York Giants. He entered in relief {{at the top of the}} fourth inning, after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning. He got Sid Gordon to hit to a double play and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize, he retired Willard Marshall on a grounder to end the inning. He made his first career start against the Pirates, a 4–1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits. On June 7, he pitched a four-hitter in an 11–1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, throwing five perfect innings before giving up a hit to Dick Culler to start the sixth inning. He finished with an 11–5 mark and a 3.27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians. In his only World Series appearance, he started Game 3, where he gave up one run on four hits in 3.1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss.|$|E
40|$|To {{federate}} collections {{with varying}} degrees of metadata richness across continents poses a number of challenging issues such as: how to build a rich unified search interface when there is a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> vocabulary, and how to federate collections in different languages. The focus of this paper is on the approaches we have taken to address these issues in Arc, an OAI compliant federated digital library. The first Arc implementation had addressed the issue related to the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> vocabulary in an ad hoc way, and had not addressed altogether the cross-language issue. One approach to address <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> vocabulary is by proposing a unified vocabulary and mapping individual library vocabulary to the unified vocabulary. This approach, particularly when applied to the subject metadata field, has two major limitations: (1) The standard subject classification (unified vocabulary for the subject field) may differ in terms of levels and semantics from that of an individual library leading to low precision searches. (2) Adding of a new collection to the federation leads to the complexity of updating mapping tables. Moreover, the new library may differ significantly in terms of the unified subject classification necessitating an update to the unified subject classification scheme. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel user-centric approach that addresses the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>controlled</b> vocabulary issue for the subject field, and does not suffer from above limitations. For the cross-language issue, the focus is more on how to integrate an existing cross-language technique based on query translation into Arc to support searches across English and German collections. 1...|$|R

5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> she had on her work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the absence}} of any named satraps (i.e. Achaemenid provincial governors) for Sogdiana in {{historical}} records, modern scholarship has concluded that Sogdiana was governed from the satrapy of nearby Bactria. The satraps were often relatives of the ruling Persian kings, especially sons who were not designated as the heir apparent. Sogdiana likely remained under Persian control until roughly 400 BC, during the reign of Artaxerxes II. Rebellious states of the Persian Empire took advantage of the weak Artaxerxes II, and some, such as Egypt, were able to regain their independence. Persia's massive loss of Central Asian territory is widely attributed to the ruler's <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control.</b> However, unlike Egypt, which was quickly recaptured by the Persian Empire, Sogdiana remained independent until it was conquered by Alexander the Great. When the latter invaded the Persian Empire, Pharasmanes, an already independent king of Khwarezm, allied with the Macedonians and sent troops to Alexander in 329 BC for his war against the Scythians of the Black Sea region (even though this anticipated campaign never materialized).|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly.

The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel.
