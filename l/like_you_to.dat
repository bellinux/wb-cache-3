Belldandy appears before Keiichi and offers to grant him a wish. Convinced that the whole incident is a prank played on him by his seniors (Senpais), Keiichi half-jokingly wishes her {{to stay with him}} forever. ("I want a goddess <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be by my side forever"). The wish, of course, is granted—thus providing one of the key premises of the series.|$|E

She was created by Kōsuke Fujishima as one of three Goddesses who come to Earth to reside with Keiichi Morisato, and she serves as his love interest. She is depicted as a beautiful and powerful young woman, with strong nurturing tendencies, a trusting and innocent character, and an extremely kind heart. Belldandy is accidentally summoned from heaven by Keiichi in order to grant him a wish and stays when Keiichi wishes for [...] "a goddess <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be by my side forever". The stories follow Belldandy as she builds a relationship with Keiichi, using her powers (which include teleportation, telekinesis, telepathy, and levitation) to help both Keiichi and his friends while keeping her true identity a secret.|$|E

500|$|... "My Love" [...] {{was criticized}} {{for some of the}} lyrics and sounds that were featured. Sanneh {{reported}} that Timberlake [...] "exhales his clumsy pickup lines" [...] with the lyrics [...] "If I told you you were beautiful / Would you date me on the regular?". Murphy contemplated that the song is [...] "ultimately ruined" [...] by a [...] "bizarre Crazy Frog-meets-Laughing-Policeman underlay". Emily Vaughan of North by Northwestern commented that Timberlake claims to have gone around the world twice in [...] "My Love" [...] and [...] "Damn Girl" [...] and that he is also [...] "running out of creative ways to say he would <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go to bed with him". Vaughan, however, was positive towards [...] "My Love", stating that the song, along with [...] "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", sounded considerably {{different from the rest of}} the album.|$|E
500|$|Gandhi's views {{came under}} heavy {{criticism}} in Britain {{when it was}} under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, [...] "I would <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If these gentlemen choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them." [...] George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{used the}} Compact Disc's pregap, so a {{listener}} {{would have to}} actually manually rewind the first track a full nine minutes to hear two additional hidden tracks, [...] "Time Jesum Transeuntum Et Non Riverentum" [...] and a cover of The X-Files theme song, both performed by Nick Cave and Dirty Three. This is hinted at in the album's liner booklet, which notes [...] "Nick Cave and the Dirty Three would <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> know that [...] "0" [...] is also a number". The use of these hidden tracks {{has been described as}} [...] "just the sort of surprise one might have suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries". Not all CD or DVD players will allow the album to be [...] "rewound" [...] back to these tracks as this violates Red Book standards.|$|E

500|$|A {{minority}} of apparently more discerning listeners felt that Connotations {{was the right}} music for its time and place. Composer Arthur Berger states, [...] "I think [...] wrote exactly the piece he wanted to write {{because he wanted to}} make a statement about the new Philharmonic Hall in New York—it wasn't going to be a temple of easy listening, as it were, but a place for serious music-making." [...] Minna Lederman Daniel, a music writer and editor of Modern Music magazine, told Copland, [...] "I think Connotations was the right place for the people and the occasion—indeed the only one properly related to them. It sounds a good deal like certain aspects of the building—big, spacious, clear, long-lined, and it sounds very <b>like</b> <b>you...</b> <b>To</b> those familiar with your music, the characteristic, identifying moods are perfectly apparent. The special Copland eloquence is there." ...|$|E
500|$|Loxton {{joined the}} Armadale {{branch of the}} Liberal Party in 1950. Henry Bolte, the Liberal leader in Victoria, was the state {{opposition}} leader at the time, and encouraged him to enter politics. The cricketer’s entry into electoral politics came after {{he was involved in}} a debate at a cricket club meeting. A person at the gathering reported his argumentative performance to senior Liberal Party figures, and soon after, Bolte began actively courting the cricketer. On 28 September 1954, Loxton won pre-selection and was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the electorate of Prahran. At the time, the seat was comfortably held by the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP), who had captured 61.59% of the vote at the previous election. The Liberals were not optimistic about their chances, and Bolte told his candidate [...] "You won't win , but we'd <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> fly the flag".|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by James Foley, who worked with Madonna in her music video for [...] "Live to Tell", produced by David Naylor and Sharon Oreck, and Michael Ballhaus {{was in charge of}} the photography. The video was shot on location over three days in Staten Island, New York and Manhattan. Staten Island was chosen on Foley's suggestion as it was where he grew up: [...] "We talked about wanting to tap into a working-class environment, because by that time she had done 'Material Girl' and 'Like a Virgin' and other stuff that was very glamorous and stylized. She wanted to do something a bit more grounded and 'drama'." [...] Actor Alex McArthur was signed to play Madonna's boyfriend and the father of her child in the video. Madonna had spotted McArthur in a small role as a naive youth in the 1985 film Desert Hearts, and she thought he was a natural to play her mechanic boyfriend. [...] "I was out in the garage working on my Harley," [...] said McArthur, [...] "I answered the phone and a voice said, 'Hi, this is Madonna. I would <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be in my next video.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he did. So much of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> keep closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E
500|$|At a pre-E3 2005 press conference, the {{president}} of Nintendo, Satoru Iwata, announced the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was not only already in development for their next gaming console, but {{hoped it would be}} a launch title with Wi–Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement was unexpected to the creator of the Super Smash Bros. series, Masahiro Sakurai. Back in 2003, he had left HAL Laboratory, the company that was in charge with the franchises' development and was never informed of this announcement despite the fact shortly after resigning from the company, Iwata said if a new game was to be made, he would be in charge. It was not until after the conference Sakurai was called to Satoru Iwata's room {{on the top floor of}} a Los Angeles hotel, where he was told by Iwata [...] "We'd <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be involved in the production of the new Smash Bros., if possible near the level of director". Although Iwata had said he was hoping for it to be a launch title, Sakurai stated [...] "I decided to become director. And as of May 2005, I was the only member of the new Smash Bros. development team". Development of the game never actually started until October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Nintendo also enlisted outside help from various developer studios, mainly Game Arts. Sakurai also stated that these people had spent excessive amounts of time playing Super Smash Bros. Melee. This team was given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory. Also, several Smash Bros. staff members that reside around the area of the new office joined the project's development.|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sam Lanksy of Idolator gave the song a favorable review, calling it [...] "an emotional ballad that shows off Mars’ sweet vocals." [...] Lansky also praised it, naming it [...] "another exceptional offering from Unorthodox Jukebox, which {{is shaping up}} {{to be one of the}} year’s best pop releases." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust gave the song a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, commenting that 'When I Was Your Man' is [...] "a much more satisfying, less ostentatious ballad than 'Young Girls'— though maybe the lyrics are a little too clichéd to result in a classic soul ballad the way Bruno seems to be going for." [...] However, he praised Mars, which according to him, [...] "nobody puts a song like this over quite like him, and when he hits the big high note on the song’s bridge, it’s about as striking a moment as you’re likely to hear on a pop record this year. It might be a little too perfect to be as devastating as a song like 'Someone Like You', but it might be a big hit just the same, and it’s guaranteed to absolutely slay in a live set." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was positive, writing that [...] "Old-school charm still gets Mars the furthest, and the best thing here is the classic torch song 'When I Was Your Man', which finds him at the piano listing all the ways he wronged an ex. 'Caused a good, strong woman <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> walk out my life,' he cries in his Sinatra-smooth tenor, oozing charm. Maybe he's a jerk. But he's the jerk that girl's going home with tonight." ...|$|E
