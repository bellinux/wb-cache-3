50|$|Tegotomono, {{which has}} a long {{instrumental}} interlude without a <b>vocal</b> <b>part,</b> {{is the most common}} and most often performed style of jiuta. This is because Tegoto, the instrumental part, is takes precedence over the <b>vocal</b> <b>part.</b> Some pieces make full use of the three octave range of the shamisen, which has {{led to the development of}} technically challenging shamisen parts.Few pieces are purely instrumental; most include a <b>vocal</b> <b>part.</b> Some instrumental pieces for koto, called 'Danmono' ('段もの' things of parts and verses), are arranged for shamisen. Most pieces in this style are considered to be highly artistic as pure instrumental music, not as a simple description of nature and emotion.|$|R

50|$|As for {{female-to-male}} transgender individuals, it {{is generally}} presumed that hormone therapy does successfully masculinize the voice and <b>lower</b> <b>vocal</b> pitch. However, {{this may not be}} the case for all female-to-male transgender individuals. Although it is far less common, surgery to <b>lower</b> <b>vocal</b> pitch does exist, and may be considered if traditional hormone therapy did not adequately lower it. Medialization laryngoplasty (or masculinization laryngoplasty) is a procedure where the vocal fold contours are medially augmented with the injection of silastic implants. This mimics the changes that the vocal folds go through during male puberty, which causes a lower sounding voice.|$|R

5000|$|The piece clearly {{lays out}} that the tonic is in A minor. An example occurs in the {{beginning}} where the lyrics say “flowers.” In the syllables “-weres,” it is held with a sustaining A, clearly labeling the tonic of piece. In the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts,</b> when one line {{is in the middle}} of a phrase another line comes in, and creates a sustaining echo.In each of the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts,</b> it remains diatonic. In the beginning, the range in each of the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> is only an octave from A3 to A4. Each of the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> resolve on the tonic. Although, sometimes the Alto’s resolves on 6th, which gives a minor third harmony (starting on measure 23). Whenever the lyrics says [...] "flowers," [...] the first syllable is either down a 4th or 5th then leaps up to the tonic on the second syllable. Most of the dissonances in the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> are whole step apart. Then in measure 30 the last syllable of “flowers” ends on a G. And then the song changes. In measure 34, rather than the vocalists resolving to the tonic through a 4th or a 5th they resolve in sixteenth tones a whole step apart. In measure 52, everyone sings staccato eighth notes and the dissonances are either are primarily a whole step apart, or a 4th and 5th apart.|$|R
50|$|Brahms {{prepared}} {{an alternative}} {{version of the}} work to be performed as a piano duet with four hands on one piano. This version also incorporates the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts,</b> suggesting that it {{was intended as a}} self-contained version probably for at-home use. However, the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> can also be omitted, making the duet version an acceptable substitute accompaniment for choir and soloists in circumstances where a full orchestra is unavailable.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> {{are spread}} {{throughout}} the 22 minutes, separated by lengthy instrumental segments. The verses are in 12/8 while the choruses in a slow 6/8 (with the last chorus in a still slower tempo) while the stinging interludes immediately after the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> revert to the elevens-based time. [...] The rhythms underneath the guitar solos start slow and then build up in complexity and volume until their climaxes.|$|R

The <b>vocal</b> <b>parts</b> and the continuo were fully notated. Occasionally, some of the prominent orchestral parts were briefly indicated, such as the first violin part of the Rex tremendae and Confutatis, the musical bridges in the Recordare, and the trombone solos of the [...] "Tuba Mirum". What remained to be completed for these sections were mostly accompanimental figures, inner harmonies, and orchestral doublings to the <b>vocal</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|R
