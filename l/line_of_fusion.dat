40|$|As a {{consequence}} of permanent rising demands on electronic devices the application of adapted materials gains in importance and leads to increasing challenges for the joining technologies. In this context the following article deals with laser micro-welding of copper-aluminium connections, whereas especially the influences of power modulations on mixing effects and formation of brittle phases in the welding zone are under examination. In contrast to spot welding without laser modulation actions, samples welded with frequencies less than 1 kHz and modulation factors up to 10 % reach about 20 % higher breaking resistances during tensile tests. These results are mainly caused by modified mixing scenes of both base materials during the molten state, which affects more favourable element dispersions and lower addictions {{for the formation of}} brittle fractures. Notably disadvantageous for the ductility of the connections are these brittle phases in case of conglomeration in the zones between the welding spot and the base materials. Since the mixing processes in these critical areas nearby the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> show no dependence on laser power modulations, no significant exertion of influence on the implied zones can be established up to now...|$|R

Thirty-four, 13 and 1 were located in the upper, middle and lower third of the face. Twelve were in the neck. All were treated with surgery under general anesthesia.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{variation}} {{in the pattern of}} mystacial vibrissae in ICR mice, of which one-half of the about 600 animals investigated showed one or more supernumerary whiskers (SWs). The SWs and their follicles—in all respects identical to the units of the standard pattern except for their smaller size—occurred at a restricted number of sites. In addition, a limited number of mice from two BALB/c strains were analyzed. Half of them also had one or more SWs, but mainly at one site. Mice of the C 3 H/HeJ and DBA/ 2 J(a) strains were virtually without SWs, whereas animals from the NMRI strain were standard without exception. Nearly all animals of the C 57 BL/ 6 J strain lacked between 1 and 4 vibrissae, always from {{one or two of the}} same adjacent sites. There was a slight overall predominance for the left side of the face to bear SWs and there was no clear-cut association with sex; the entire population was without obvious defects.

40|$|To {{examine the}} freeze-fracture {{appearance}} of membrane alterations accompanying {{the preparation of}} sperm membranes for fusions-the first preparatory stage occurring before physiological release of the acrosomal content, the second afterward-we induced the acrosome reaction in capacitated guinea pig spermatozoa by adding calcium to the mixture. The most common features observed before fusion of the acrosomal and plasma membranes were the deletion of fibrillar intramembranous particles from the E-fracture faces of both membranes, and the clearance of globular particles from the P face of the plasma membrane-events taking place near the terminus of the equatorial segment. Large particles, > 12 nm, remained {{not far from the}} cleared E-face patches. The P face of the outer acrosomal membrane is virtually clear from the outset.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of evidence, drawn from ancient human remains and from ethnographic accounts, greatly changed our views on past and “traditional” medicine. Surgical {{treatment}} of the skull, requiring intimate anatomical knowledge and high skills, has been very influential in that process. Forms of trephination, carried out in order to remove part of the injured skull, are documented since the Neolithic through historical times and in recent ethnographic reports. The case presented here provides evidence of a less invasive technique applied to the skull of an adult individual found during archeological excavations in a cave deposit (Garbu du Surdu, Finale Ligure, Savona, Italy). A 14 C AMS date obtained from a fragment of the mandible (Erl- 13879 : 4624 +/- 21 BP) points to a calibrated age range between 3527 - 3328 BC, placing the material {{at the beginning of}} the Copper Age, in agreement with associated archaeological remains that include decorated pottery fragments and shell ornaments. The skull was lying on the surface deposit among other bones belonging to at least six individuals whose inhumations were strongly disturbed by natural events. The commingled state of the material made it impossible to associate any of the postcranial bones to this specific skull. Thus, in the absence of hip bones, sex attribution remains uncertain, although a diagnosis of female is suggested by cranial characteristics such as frontal and parietal bossing, weak glabella and supraorbital ridges, and small mastoid processes. The skull is affected by a left temporal bone fracture healed with loss of bony fragments. The squama appears slightly depressed and, radiographically, shows two main <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> radiating from the lower part of the bone where three lacunae can be observed. On the parietal bone, immediately above the area affected by trauma, the skull exhibits two regularly curved grooves. One, about 3 cm long, starts from the posterior border of the squamosal suture; the other, 9 cm long, runs above the first and reaches the coronal suture. Remodelling of compacta indicates that the two incisions were made during life. This case provides the first evidence of such a treatment of an injured skull and proves once more the therapeutic knowledge of prehistoric populations, emphasizing their ability to modulate surgical procedures according to specific needs...|$|R

Such transformation of a ball- into a worm-shaped embryo is an ancestral and fundamental feature of bilaterian development, {{yet this is}} modified or absent in the protostome model organisms Caenorhabditis or Drosophila. In the polychaete annelid Platynereis dumerilii, early embryonic and larval stages resemble a sphere that subsequently elongates into worm shape. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of polychaete body elongation are yet unknown. Our in vivo time-lapse analysis of Platynereis axis elongation reveals that the polychaete neuroectoderm converges and extends by mediolateral cell intercalation.

We detect a morphogenetic boundary between the converging and extending trunk neuroectoderm and the anterior otx-expressing head neuroectoderm that does not elongate. Our comparative analysis uncovers striking similarities but also differences between convergent extension in the polychaete and in the frog (the classical vertebrate model for convergent extension). Based on these findings, we propose that convergent extension movements of the trunk neuroectoderm represent an ancestral feature of bilaterian development that triggered the separation of mouth and anus along the elongating trunk...|$|E

The critical events occur between about 15. 5 d postcoitum (p. c.) and 12 d after birth, and were studied by conventional histology and by scanning electron microscopy. At about 15. 5 d p. c. the cornea of the eye is clearly visible with the primitive eyelids being represented by protruding ridges of epithelium at its periphery. Over the next 24 h, eyelid development proceeds to the stage when the cornea is completely covered by the fused eyelids. Periderm cells stream in {{to fill the gap}} between the developing eyelids. Their proliferative activity is such that they produce a cellular excrescence on the outer surface of the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> of the eyelids. This excrescence had almost disappeared by about 17. 5 d p. c. Keratinisation is first evident at this stage {{on the surface of the}} eyelids and passes continuously from one eyelid to the other. Evidence of epidermal differentiation is more clearly seen in the newborn, where a distinctive stratum granulosum now occupies about one third of its entire thickness. Within the subjacent dermis, hair follicles are differentiating. By about 5 d after birth, a thick layer of keratin extends without interruption across the junctional region. While a noticeable surface indentation overlies the latter, a similar depression is only seen on the conjunctival surface by about 10 d after birth. Keratinisation is also observed to extend in from the epidermal surface to involve the entire region between the 2 eyelids at about this time. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Focal facial dermal {{dysplasia}} (FFDD) Type IV {{is a rare}} syndrome {{characterized by}} facial lesions resembling aplasia cutis in a preauricular distribution along the <b>line</b> <b>of</b> <b>fusion</b> of the maxillary and mandibular prominences. To identify the causative gene(s), exome sequencing was performed in a family with two affected sibs. Assuming autosomal recessive inheritance, two novel sequence variants were identified in both sibs in CYP 26 C 1 - a duplication of 7 basepairs that was maternally inherited, c. 844 _ 851 dupCCATGCA, predicting p. Glu 284 fsX 128, and a missense mutation, c. 1433 G>A, predicting p. Arg 478 His, that was paternally inherited. The duplication predicted a frameshift mutation that lead to a premature stop codon and premature chain termination, while the missense mutation was not functional based on its in-vitro expression in mammalian cells. The FFDD skin lesions arise along the sites of fusion of the maxillary and mandibular prominences early in facial development and Cyp 26 c 1 was expressed exactly along the fusion line for these facial prominences in the first branchial arch in mice. Sequencing of four additional, unrelated Type IV FFDD patients and eight Type II or III TWIST 2 -negative FFDD patients revealed {{that three of the}} Type IV patients were homozygous for the duplication, whereas none of the Type II or III patients had CYP 26 C 1 mutations. The 7 basepair duplication was present in 0. 3 % of healthy controls and 0. 3 % of patients with other birth defects.

40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{characterized}} by deletions of the short arm of chromosome 1 (1 p) and amplification of the N-myc oncogene. We have made somatic cell hybrids of two human neuroblastoma cell lines, one with and one without N-myc expression and amplification. The expression of the amplified N-myc gene is completely switched off in the hybrids. This suggests that N-myc expression results from loss of a repressor function. As N-myc amplification is associated with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 1 p 36, we analysed 1 p deletions in 16 neuroblastoma cell lines. The seven cell lines without N-myc amplification have no deletions or relatively small deletions, with an SRO on 1 p 36. 23 - 33. This suggests that a tumor suppressor gene maps in this region. All nine cell lines with N-myc amplification have larger deletions, with an SRO from 1 p 35 - 36. 1 to the telomere. This suggests that a second tumor suppressor gene which is associated with N-myc amplification maps more proximally.

40|$|ABSTRACT Extensive and unequivocal tight {{junctions}} are here reported between the lateral {{borders of the}} cellular layer that circumscribes the arachnid (spider) central nervous system. This account details the features of these structures, which form a beltlike reticulum that {{is more complex than}} the simple linear {{tight junctions}} hitherto found in invertebrate tissues and which bear many of the characteristics of vertebrate zonulae occludentes. We also provide evidence that these junctions form the basis of a permeability barrier to exogenous compounds. In thin sections, the tight junctions are identifiable as punctate points of membrane apposition; they are seen to exclude the stain and appear as electron-lucent moniliform strands along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> membrane <b>fusion</b> in en face views of uranyl-calcium-treated tissues. In freeze-fracture replicas, the regions of close membrane apposition exhibit P-face (PF) ridges and complementary E-face (EF) furrows that are coincident across face transitions, although slightly offset with respect to one another. The free inward diffusion of both ionic and colloidal lanthanum is inhibited by these punctate tight junctions so that they appear to form the basis of a circumferential blood-brain barrier. These results support the contention that tight junctions exist in the tissues of the Invertebrata in spite of earlier suggestions that (a) they are unique t...|$|R
5000|$|A cyst is a {{pathological}} epithelial lined cavity that fills with fluid or soft material and usually grows from internal pressure generated by fluid being {{drawn into the}} cavity from osmosis (hydrostatic pressure). The bones of the jaws, the mandible and maxilla, are the bones with the highest prevalence of cysts in the human body. This {{is due to the}} abundant amount of epithelial remnants that can be left in the bones of the jaws. The enamel of teeth is formed from ectoderm (the precursor germ layer to skin and mucosa), and so remnants of epithelium can be left in the bone during odontogenesis (tooth development). The bones of the jaws develop from embryologic processes which fuse together, and ectodermal tissue may be trapped along the <b>lines</b> <b>of</b> this <b>fusion.</b> This [...] "resting" [...] epithelium (also termed cell rests) is usually dormant or undergoes atrophy, but, when stimulated, may form a cyst.
