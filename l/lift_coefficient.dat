5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum <b>lift</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E

The hardware implementation of a filter bank requires that the <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> be quantized. The quantization method determines compression performance, hardware size, hardware speed and energy. We investigate the implementation of two <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficient</b> sets, rational and irrational, for the biorthogonal 9 / 7 wavelet. Six different approaches are used to find optimal quantized <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> from these sets.

30|$|In general, the {{relaxation}} of these filter constraints leads to poorer decorrelation of the input image. If, however, {{the adverse effects}} of rounding decrease due to the modification of the <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients,</b> then {{there might be an}} optimal compromise.

25|$|The {{all-metal}} rotor blades, {{through which}} the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of ing thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature faired roots in order to the increase their <b>lift</b> <b>coefficient.</b> According to aerospace publication Flight International, the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the main spar. Additionally, the blade had no risk of icing {{as a consequence of}} the internal current of warm air passing though. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the collective pitch control (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims.|$|E
25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the relative velocity experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the relative velocity decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high <b>lift</b> <b>coefficient</b> airfoils. Currently, single rotor helicopters are practically limited to advance ratios less than 0.7.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high <b>lift</b> <b>coefficient</b> position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E

25|$|The 703 was a wood framed {{aircraft}} {{covered with}} a mixture of plywood and fabric. Its cantilever mid-mounted wing had a single spar and an associated D-box, skinned in plywood, formed the leading edge. The wing was fabric covered behind the spar. The leading edge was straight from root to tip, with slight sweep-back. From root out almost to half-span the wing tapered in plan only gently but further out, where the trailing edge was entirely formed by the aileron the wing tapered more strongly to a rounded tip. The NACA-derived airfoil provided a high maximum <b>lift</b> <b>coefficient</b> and small pitching moments and the wing had washout to avoid tip stall. There were Schempp-Hirth style airbrakes mounted on the rear of the spar in the central section, extending above and below the wing. On the first two 703s the central sections were set with strong (6.5°) dihedral and the outer section with none, forming a gull wing. The third 703 had the same wing but with constant dihedral from root to tip.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} the precedence constrained knapsack problem. More specifically, {{we are interested}} in classes of valid inequalities which are facet-defining for the precedence constrained knapsack polytope. We study the complexity of obtaining these facets using the standard sequential lifting procedure. Applying this procedure requires solving a combinatorial problem. For valid inequalities arising fromminimal induced covers, we identify a class of <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> for which this problem can be solved in polynomial time, by using a supermodular function, and for which the values of the <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> have a combinatorial interpretation. For the remaining <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> it is shown that this optimization problem is strongly NP-hard. The same lifting procedure can be applied to (1,k) -configurations, although in this case, the same combinatorial interpretation no longer applies. We also consider K-covers, to which the same procedure need not apply in general. We show that facets of the polytope can still be generated using a similar lifting technique. For tree knapsack problems, we observe that all <b>lifting</b> <b>coefficients</b> can be obtained in polynomial time. Computational experiments indicate that these facets significantly strengthen the LP-relaxation. 1...|$|R
