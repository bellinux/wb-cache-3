40|$|Abstract Background Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) {{are large}} multimodular enzymes that {{synthesize}} {{a wide range}} of biologically active natural peptide compounds, of which many are pharmacologically important. Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by the Condensation (C) domain. Various functional subtypes of the <b>C</b> domain exist: An <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain catalyzes a peptide bond between two L-amino acids, a D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain links an L-amino acid to a growing peptide ending with a D-amino acid, a Starter C domain (first denominated and classified as a separate subtype here) acylates the first amino acid with a β -hydroxy-carboxylic acid (typically a β -hydroxyl fatty acid), and Heterocyclization (Cyc) domains catalyze both peptide bond formation and subsequent cyclization of cysteine, serine or threonine residues. The homologous Epimerization (E) domain flips the chirality of the last amino acid in the growing peptide; Dual E/C domains catalyze both epimerization and condensation. Results In this paper, we report on the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationship of NRPS C domain subtypes and analyze in detail the sequence motifs of recently discovered subtypes (Dual E/C, D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> and Starter domains) and their characteristic sequence differences, mutually and in comparison with <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domains. Based on their phylogeny and the comparison of their sequence motifs, <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> and Starter domains appear to be more closely related to each other than to other subtypes, though pronounced differences in some segments of the protein account for the unequal donor substrates (amino vs. β -hydroxy-carboxylic acid). Furthermore, on the basis of phylogeny and the comparison of sequence motifs, we conclude that Dual E/C and D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domains share a common ancestor. In the same way, the evolutionary origin of a C domain of unknown function in glycopeptide (GP) NRPSs can be determined to be an <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> domain. In the case of two GP C domains which are most similar to D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> but which have <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L</b> activity, we postulate convergent evolution. Conclusion We systematize all C domain subtypes including the novel Starter C domain. With our results, it will be easier to decide the subtype of unknown C domains as we provide profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) for the sequence motifs {{as well as for the}} entire sequences. The determined specificity conferring positions will be helpful for the mutation of one subtype into another, e. g. turning D <b>C</b> <b>L</b> to <b>L</b> <b>C</b> <b>L,</b> which can be a useful step for obtaining novel products. </p...|$|R

40|$|Characterization {{of populations}} {{by means of}} DNA {{techniques}} provides a tool for precise identification and a quantitative estimate of genetic diversity, crucial in evaluation of genetic fragmentation within and among populations. NBS profiling are PCR-based approaches that sample genetic variation in resistance genes (R-gene), and R gene analogs (RGA). To date, myb patterns have not been used for evaluating genetic diversity in other species. NBS primers are homologous to the conserved sequences in the Nucleotide-Binding-Site of the NBS-LRR class of R-genes. A total of 12 populations from five Campanula species (<b>C.</b> barbata <b>L.,</b> <b>C.</b> latifolia <b>L.,</b> <b>C.</b> rapunculoides <b>L.,</b> <b>C.</b> spicata <b>L.</b> and <b>C.</b> trachelium <b>L.),</b> autochthonous of the West Italian Alps, were genotyped via nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and myb gene profiling.

The correlation between genetic variability and geographical location suggests that the five Campanula species {{have been subjected to}} long-term evolutionary processes consistent with the natural fragmentation of continuous mountains areas...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{specimens of}} five subspecies of gray wolves from southwestern North America and assessed their systematic affinities using both univariate and multivariate statistical procedures. Because wolves exhibit considerable sexual dimorphism the sexes were separated for the analyses. Principal components analyses revealed considerable overlap among the individuals, but tended {{to separate the}} Mexican wolf (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> baileyi) from northern wolves (<b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> youngi). Specimens from other subspecies were intermediate to these two. Discriminant function analyses using various groupings of wolves supported these results.

40|$|The rock rattlesnakes Crotalus lepidus {{comprise}} a group (lepidus, klauberi, morulus and maculosus) of poorly known mountain cold-tolerant snakes in Mexico. In particular, Crotalus lepidus morulus is a snake endemic {{of the northeast}} of Mexico, whereas Crotalus lepidus klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus are distributed in some regions of the north and central Mexico and southern U. S. Until now very little data are available from C. lepidus subspecies from Mexico, as the terrain inhabited by these snakes is generally steep and rugged. In this work, we have determined some biochemical and biological properties of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus crude venoms. Some minor differences in venoms were noted in SDS-PAGE, HPLC profile and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. Partial sequences of metalloproteinases, phospholipases A 2 (PLA 2) and galactose-specific lectins were identified in the venoms. Venoms of <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus had significantly higher hemorrhagic and lethal activities than <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus venom. Proteolytic activity in azocasein was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> morulus venom, whereas gelatin hydrolysis was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi. Fibrinogenolytic and PLA 2 activities were very similar in all venoms tested. The histological observations in the gastrocnemius muscle damaged by venoms from all the subspecies confirmed myonecrotic and hemorrhagic activities (at 3 and 24 h), {{which resulted in a}} poor regenerative response after 14 days. However, <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus and <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> klauberi venom induced a higher increase in the plasma activity of creatine kinase (CK), evidencing higher myotoxicity, whereas paw edema-inducing activity was higher in <b>C.</b> <b>l.</b> lepidus venom. The results indicate that the venoms from the three subspecies have similar protein profiles in electrophoresis, HPLC and molecular weight determinations. However, differences were found in the biological activities in mice.

40|$|Cellular tropism of {{vaccinia virus}} (VACV) is {{regulated}} by host range genes, including K 1 <b>L,</b> <b>C</b> 7 <b>L,</b> and E 3 L. While E 3 L {{is known to}} support viral replication by antagonizing interferon (IFN) effectors, including PKR, the exact functions of K 1 <b>L</b> and <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> are unclear. Here, we show that K 1 <b>L</b> and <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> can also inhibit antiviral effectors induced by type I IFN. In human Huh 7 and MCF- 7 cells, a VACV mutant lacking both K 1 <b>L</b> and <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> (vK 1 LC 7 L) replicated as efficiently as wild-type (WT) VACV, even {{in the presence of}} IFN. However, pretreating the cells with type I IFN, while having very little effect on WT VACV, blocked the replication of vK 1 LC 7 L at the step of intermediate viral gene translation. Restoring either K 1 <b>L</b> or <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> to vK 1 LC 7 L fully restored the IFN resistance phenotype. The deletion of K 1 <b>L</b> and <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> from VACV did not affect the ability of the virus to inhibit IFN signaling or its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of PKR and the subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2, indicating that K 1 <b>L</b> and <b>C</b> 7 <b>L</b> function by antagonizing an IFN effector(s) but with a mechanism that is different from those of IFN antagonists previously identified for VACV. Mutations of K 1 L that inactivate the host range function also rendered K 1 L unable to antagonize IFN, suggesting that K 1 L supports VACV replication in mammalian cells by antagonizing the same antiviral factor(s) that is induced by IFN in Huh 7 cells.
