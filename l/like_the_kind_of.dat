It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003 under the title of [...] "Everytime I Try" [...] and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song of the album along with [...] "Touch of My Hand", explaining, [...] "It's one of the songs that when you hear, it's <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song when you go to heaven.

[...] Gary Graff of the same publication wrote that [...] "Stefani's Madonna reverence remains intact" [...] on the song, with The Washington Post [...] J. Freedom du Lac agreeing, noting a [...] "Madonnaism" [...] on the track. Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic also thought that the song [...] "recalls a 'Crazy for You'-era Madonna", also noting that it is [...] "pure Stefani—and understandably, [...] far superior to any of her attempts at mimicking other artists." [...] Norman Mayers of Prefix Magazine wrote that the song [...] "soar thanks to Stefani's girlish vocals and brilliant hook that reference iconic moments from Madonna and Tears for Fears." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator called it [...] "a breezy yet emotive '80s-ballad that highlights her tender vocals." [...] Alex Miller of NME described the song as [...] "an expertly conceived tear-jerker", stating that [...] "t feels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> song a teenage Stefani, miming along to Talk Talk, would have dreamt of singing one day." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Customer Loyalty" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. James Poniewozik of Time magazine {{concluded that it}} [...] "showed the stakes behind its characters' paper-pushing lives {{in a way it}} hasn't since Michael Scott left Scranton." [...] He called the first half a [...] "wacky ensemble show", but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to [...] "all but hear the old machinery [...] waking up and sliding into place". Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for." [...] She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] was the right episode for them {{to come back to the}} series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam [...] "jarring in and of itself". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> argument that two real people would have." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was [...] "fine" [...] and was composed of [...] "several small storylines, all of which worked". Davinger called the ending [...] "odd" [...] but [...] "effective".|$|E

From the {{way that}} Peirce uses this term {{throughout}} his work, {{it is clear that}} he means what he elsewhere calls a [...] "triple correspondence", and thus this is just another way of referring to the whole triadic sign relation itself.

500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} music critics. [...] Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times noted similarities between [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] and [...] Beyoncé's previous singles including [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "If I Were a Boy", [...] {{and concluded that}} Beyoncé [...] "certainly knows how to dump a man in style". Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] could be [...] "Irreplaceable Part Two" [...] and noted that Beyoncé's vocal performance brings depth to the song. Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice wrote that the song is not as iconic as its reference point [...] "Irreplaceable", but [...] "nor is it as shady". He commended the optimism in the song's lyrics. Consequence of Sound writer Chris Coplan commented that the ballad is a powerful moment of self-realization, which is enhanced by Beyoncé's vocal performance [...] "as [...] wounded bird turned resilient lioness". Choosing [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] as the highlight of 4, Andy Kellman of Allmusic described it as [...] "a bombastic kiss-off saved by Beyoncé's ability to plow through it". Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly noted the moderate chart performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", and wrote: [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] finds Beyoncé mining {{the same kind of}} girl-power imagery as she did on 'Run the World (Girls)'. But there is something more direct and honest about the lyrics on the new single (perhaps it's the instant greatness of the line, 'When I think of the time I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you'). 'Best Thing I Never Had' feels <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> crossover hit that will help 4 join the rest of Beyoncé's discography in multiplatinum land.|$|E
500|$|TV Squad writer Jay Black {{praised the}} main plot, and wrote, [...] "I was delighted that {{the trip to}} the Prince Family Paper Company became a test of Michael's morals rather than the usual {{exercise}} in his stupidity." [...] Black said Dwight's attempts to get Michael to give up the client list were among the best set of scenes for the season. However, Black said the Hilary Swank subplot suffered in comparison, and felt like a vain attempt to find something for the supporting cast to do. The A.V. Club writer Nathan Rabin was disappointed with [...] "Prince Family Paper", calling it overly dependent on throwaway gags and describing it as [...] "about as inconsequential as The Office gets". Rabin complimented the opening gag with Jim and Dwight, but said it [...] "felt <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> gag the show has pulled off dozens, if not hundreds of times, before". Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly said it was not one of the strongest Office episodes, and that the script took a particularly mean tone with the Prince Family Paper subplot. But Wheat said it included some enjoyable moments, like Jim's prank against Dwight in the opening scene. Will Leitch of New York magazine was very critical of the episode, especially the Hilary Swank subplot, which he said [...] "sounded like a conversation B. J. Novak had with himself at a party and submitted as a backup script". Leitch also pointed out the episode {{had nothing to do with}} the show's ongoing plotlines: [...] "It's the definition of filler. Which would have been fine, had it been funnier." [...] "Prince Family Paper" [...] was voted the lowest-rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally, where the episode was rated 6.98 out of 10.|$|E

Bob Almond, inker {{for much of the}} run of The Black Panther vol. 3, dedicated his work in memoriam to Graham in an introductory note to issue #17 (April 2000). The pseudonymous Buzz Maverik wrote in Ain't It Cool News, [...] "I know the [...] artist, Billy Graham, was black. His cool Marvel Bullpen name was 'The Irreverent' Billy Graham. For me, even though I later learned that Jack Kirby created the Panther, Graham will always be the definitive Panther artist. His art, even more than McGregor's writing, made T'Challa one of what I call the 'grown men' of the Marvel Universe, the others being Daredevil and Iron Man. Those three seemed <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> adult I aspired to be, with cool jobs, cool hobbies (superheroing), and cool chicks."
