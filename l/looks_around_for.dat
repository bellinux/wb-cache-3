60|$|ROBERTS, {{entering}} the room before Campbell, and {{shaking hands with}} his guests: 'Ah, Mr. Bemis; Mrs. Bemis; Aunt Mary! You've heard of our comical little coincidence--our--Mr. Bemis and my--' He halts, confused, and <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> the moral support of Willis, who follows hilariously.|$|E
6000|$|SECRETARY--[Turning {{around on}} his stool.] What the devil is that--someone knocking? [Shouts:] Come in, why don't you? [All {{the men in the}} room look up. YANK opens the door slowly, gingerly, as if afraid of an ambush. He <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> secret doors, mystery, is taken aback by the commonplaceness of the room and the men in it, thinks he may have gotten in the wrong place, then sees the {{signboard}} on the wall and is reassured.] ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So I starts {{foraging}} for breakfast. For the honour of old Mojada County I didn't want to seem {{green to}} them abolitionists, so every time I {{turned a corner}} in them marble halls I {{went up to the}} first desk or counter I see and <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> grub. If I didn't see what I wanted I asked for something else. In about half an hour I had a dozen cigars, five story magazines, and seven or eight railroad time-tables in my pockets, and never a smell of coffee or bacon to point out the trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "So, Bassett rents a room over a saloon and <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> some {{furniture}} and chromos. The same night I went to Monty Silver's house, {{and he let}} me have $200 on my prospects. Then I went to the only store in Los Perros that sold playing cards and bought every deck in the house. The next morning when the store opened I was there bringing all the cards back with me. I said that my partner {{that was going to}} back me in the game had changed his mind; and I wanted to sell the cards back again. The storekeeper took 'em at half price.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{continued}} Zenobia, [...] "the Ditch didn't boom ez soon ez they kalkilated. And {{then the}} boys kept gettin' poorer and poorer, and Ned he kept gettin' poorer and poorer in everything but his hopefulness and grit. Then he <b>looks</b> <b>around</b> <b>for</b> more capital. And about this time, that coyote Harkins smelt suthin' nice up there, and he gits Ned {{to give him}} control of it, and he'll lend him his name and fix up a company. Soon ez he gets control, {{the first thing he}} does is to say that it wants half a million o' money to make it pay, and levies an assessment of two hundred dollars a share. That's nothin' for them rich fellows to pay, or pretend to pay, but for boys on grub wages it meant only ruin. They couldn't pay, and had to forfeit their shares for next to nothing. And Ned made one more desperate attempt to save them and himself by borrowing money on his shares; when that hound Harkins got wind of it, and let it be buzzed around that the Ditch is a failure, and that he was goin' out of it; that brought the shares down to nothing. As Ned couldn't raise a dollar, the new company swooped down on his shares for the debts THEY had put up, and left him and the boys to help themselves. Ned couldn't bear to face the boys that he'd helped to ruin, and put out, and ain't been heard from since. After Harkins had got rid of Ned and the boys he manages to pay off that wonderful debt, and sells out for a hundred thousand dollars. That money--Ned's money--he sends to Sacramento, for he don't dare to travel with it himself, and is kalkilatin' to leave the kentry, for some of the boys allow to kill him on sight. So ef you're wantin' to hunt suthin', thar's yer chance, and you needn't go inter the snow to do it." ...|$|E

Closures, sackings and loss of patient services has been its traditional negative stance. The CCG therefore has the near impossible task of winning reform in the face of these negotiating tactics." ...|$|E
