5|$|At the Santa Monica Pier, a magician, The Amazing Maleeni, twists {{his head}} {{completely}} around at a carnival, while Billy LaBonge, another magician, heckles Maleeni during the event. As he's leaving, his severed head falls completely off. Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); {{he tells the}} agents that he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, {{he died of a}} heart attack. She also finds that he was dead for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.|$|E
5|$|Chandru keeps {{following}} Rekha; one {{day when}} she goes to visit her friend, he makes her unconscious and takes her away to a bungalow in Ooty. When she regains consciousness, he tells {{her that he had}} purchased this house in Ooty only for her, and again asks her to marry him. When Rekha refuses and begs to be freed, he asks her to stay for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> so that she can understand him better, and then reduces it to a week. He makes all the arrangements to ensure that she cannot escape. Rekha later slams Chandru with a spade and runs away. However, he catches and imprisons her in the garage of his house, but is hospitalised for his injury.|$|E
5|$|Drogba came on as a {{substitute}} for Anelka against Manchester United in the Community Shield, but could not help prevent Chelsea from succumbing to a 3–1 loss. However, he started the Premier League season in fine form, continuing from where he left off {{on the last day of}} the previous campaign as he scored a hat-trick against West Bromwich Albion in a 6–0 victory. In Chelsea's next game against Wigan Athletic at the DW Stadium, Drogba made three assists in another 6–0 win. Drogba also played the next game at home against Stoke City where he played the whole 90 minutes and scored his fourth Premier League goal of the season when he kicked home a penalty after Nicolas Anelka was brought down by Thomas Sørensen inside the box. On 7 November 2010, Drogba missed the first half of Chelsea's 2–0 defeat by Liverpool. It was later revealed that he had been suffering from malaria for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> He had first complained of feeling unwell before the October 2010 international break but the illness was only diagnosed on 8 November 2010. Having diagnosed the problem, Chelsea insisted that he would make a full recovery within days.|$|E

5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b>|$|E

Factors increasing mortality are identical to those indicating hospitalization.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{scholars}} and studies draw the opposite conclusion.

However, enough was left for looting to continue for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> after the invasion.|$|E
25|$|P. praelongus is not {{in general}} cultivation, though it is an {{attractive}} plant. Unlike many other pondweeds it remains wintergreen. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. Its preference for relatively deep water and intolerance of turbid conditions may make it unsuitable for many garden ponds. If possible it should be grown in water at least 70cm deep on a sandy, peaty or silty substrate. Good water quality is needed {{to reduce the risk}} of turbid water or growth of blanket weed. Seed can be encouraged to germinate by immersing dried seed in water for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> exposing them to a cold period, or by scarifying them.|$|E
25|$|Schmeichel {{remained}} {{the first choice}} goalkeeper for Leicester's return to the Premier League, including playing the full 90 minutes in the 5–3 victory against Manchester United on 21 September 2014. In December 2014, Schmeichel suffered a broken metatarsal in training, ruling the Dane out for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> While he was out, Leicester signed goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer as a replacement. Schmeichel eventually returned from injury on 21 March 2015, and beat Schwarzer {{to play in the}} 4–3 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Clean sheets against Swansea City and Burnley as Leicester won four out of five games in April earned Schmeichel a nomination for the Premier League Player of the Month award. After securing Premier League safety following a goalless draw with Sunderland on 16 May, Schmeichel stated his belief that manager Nigel Pearson should win Manager of the Season and that Pearson is the best manager Schmeichel has played for. Pearson, however, was sacked in the off-season.|$|E

On 29 August, Johnson scored his second goal for Liverpool in a 3–2 win against Bolton Wanderers. On 30 December 2009, Johnson sustained a tear of the medial collateral ligament {{in his right knee}} during a league fixture against Aston Villa, which then-Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez said would keep him out of action for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> On his return from injury in March, Johnson returned to form, scoring his third goal for the club against Sunderland at Anfield. Johnson went on to make eight more appearances {{for the rest of the}} season, including helping Liverpool reach the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League where they were knocked out by Atlético Madrid. Johnson played 35 times and scored three goals in his debut season with the Reds.|$|E
25|$|A paddy {{field is}} a flooded parcel of arable land used for growing semiaquatic rice. Paddy {{cultivation}} {{should not be}} confused with cultivation of deep water rice, which is grown in flooded conditions with water more than 50cm (20in) deep for at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Genetic evidence shows that all forms of paddy rice, both indica and japonica, spring from a domestication of the wild rice Oryza rufipogon that first occurred 8,200–13,500 years ago South of the Yangtze River in present-day China. However, the domesticated indica subspecies currently appears to be a product of the introgression of favorable alleles from japonica at a later date, so that there are possibly several events of cultivation and domestication. Paddy fields are the typical feature of rice farming in east, south and southeast Asia. Fields can be built into steep hillsides as terraces and adjacent to depressed or steeply sloped features such as rivers or marshes. They can require a great deal of labor and materials to create, and need large quantities of water for irrigation. Oxen and water buffalo, adapted for life in wetlands, are important working animals used extensively in paddy field farming.|$|E
25|$|In the US, {{the long}} curing time of at <b>least</b> <b>a</b> <b>month</b> for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Mr. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E
