40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{proposed}} a new design for all optical NAND gate. By combining nonlinear Kerr effect with photonic crystal ring resonators, we designed an all optical NAND gate. A typical NAND gate is a logic device with one bias and two <b>logic</b> <b>input</b> and one output ports. It has four different combinations for its <b>logic</b> <b>input</b> ports. The output port of the NAND gate is OFF, when both logic ports are ON, otherwise the output port will be ON. The switching power threshold obtained for this structure equals to 1. 5 kW/μm 2. For designing the proposed optical logic gate we employed one resonant ring whose resonant wavelength is at 1554 nm. The functionality of the proposed NAND gate depends on the operation of this resonant ring.
