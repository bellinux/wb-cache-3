500|$|The company owned 54ships {{during its}} 122years of existence, many being small cargo vessels. Originally, {{all of the}} line's steamboats were of wooden {{construction}} with side paddlewheels and used wood logs for fuel. The first boat with an iron hull acquired by the Old Bay Line was the Georgeanna, in 1860. By the late 1870s, the company had acquired its last paddlewheel steamers: Florida, Carolina, and Virginia. Later, ships would use coal for fuel until the 1930s, when oil began to be used. Beginning with the Georgia built in 1887, their ships used the more modern propeller or [...] "screw" [...] design. The Georgia also was the first Old Bay <b>Line</b> <b>vessel</b> to be equipped with electric lighting and steam heating. Passenger ships of the line provided large, lavishly furnished staterooms to accommodate passengers on the overnight trip. The Alabama built in 1892 represented the inception of modern shipbuilding and design for the Old Bay Line: the first vessel to have a steel hull instead of iron or wood and propelled by a four-cylinder triple-expansion reciprocating engine, the same type engine {{that all of the}} line's later steamers would have. Notable Old Bay Line passenger vessels used in scheduled overnight service, with dates acquired and gross tonnages, were: ...|$|E

In 1922-1923 the Drottningholm was refurbished, re-engined and her superstructure enlarged.

On arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalls that his mother [...] "ran down the gangplank ahead of everyone else and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, and knelt on the soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, 'Oh, Australia, Australia, I'm home, I'm home.

2500|$|In 1970 Finland SS Co, Bore and Svea {{restructured}} {{their joint}} operations, {{creating a new}} marketing company Silja Line. [...] As a result, the Ilmatar came to be marketed as a Silja <b>Line</b> <b>vessel</b> and logos of the new company were painted on her sides. In 1973 she was lengthened at HDW Hamburg. Following the lengthening she was mainly used in Finland Steamship Company cruise traffic, and only occasionally for Silja Line service. In 1974—1975 she was used in Finland SS Co's Helsinki—Copenhagen—Travemünde service. In 1975 the company withdrew from the joint Finland—Germany service with Finnlines. As a result, the Ilmatar was chartered to Finnlines from 25 May 1975 until 6 July 1976 and used on the Helsinki—Copenhagen—Travemünde service. In 1976 Finland Steamship Company changed their name to Effoa. Following the end of charter to Finnlines, the Ilmatar was used by Effoa on cruise traffic aimed at the German and Finnish markets, with her itenaries taking her to the Baltic Sea, Norwegian Fjords and the Mediterranean.|$|E

2500|$|Rederiaktiebolaget Sverige-Nordamerika (literally, [...] "shipping {{corporation}} Sweden-North America") {{was born}} {{from the idea}} of Wilhelm R. Lundgren, the owner of Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, with the purpose of offering ocean liner service from Sweden to North America. Both Norway and Denmark already operated their own transatlantic liners, and the establishing of a Swedish company for the trade was a matter of national pride. Lundgren died in September 1914, but his successor Gunnar Carlsson managed {{to attract the attention of}} Dan Broström of the Broström Concern, and on 4 December 1914 the new Rederiaktiebolaget Sverige-Nordamerika was founded in Gothenburg. The Broström Concern had already operated freighters across the North Atlantic since 1911 under the name of Swedish American Mexico Line (often abbreviated SAML). Originally the new company had planned to commission two purpose-built 18000-ton ships, but this plan was never realised. Instead, in September 1915 the company acquired the 1900-built Holland America <b>Line</b> <b>vessel</b> SS Potsdam, which was renamed [...] On 11 December 1915, in the midst of World War I, the Stockholm left on her first crossing from Gothenburg to New York. En route she was stopped by a British naval vessel and forced to make a stop at Kirkwall, where all mail onboard was confiscated. In the end, the Stockholms first transatlantic crossing took no less than 15½ days. Initially the new company concentrated on immigrant trade, with substantial provision made for passengers traveling in steerage. Despite the difficulties caused by the war, the Stockholm continued transatlantic services until 1917, when Germany's unrestricted submarine warfare forced her to be laid up in Gothenburg until June 1918, when she resumed service.|$|E
