50|$|<b>Licostinel</b> (INN) (code name ACEA-1021) is a competitive, silent {{antagonist}} of the glycine {{site of the}} NMDA receptor (Kb = 5 nM). It {{was under}} investigation by Acea Pharmaceuticals as a neuroprotective agent {{for the treatment of}} cerebral ischemia associated with stroke and head injuries but was ultimately never marketed. In clinical trials, <b>licostinel</b> did not produce phencyclidine-like psychotomimetic effects at the doses tested, though transient sedation, dizziness, and nausea were observed. In addition to its actions at the NMDA receptor, <b>licostinel</b> also acts as an antagonist of the AMPA and kainate receptors at high concentrations (Kb = 0.9 µM and 2.5 µM, respectively).|$|E
