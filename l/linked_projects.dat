50|$|The {{electronic}} {{delivery of}} test results from clinical laboratories to clinical users is rightly {{seen as a}} service that can provide clinical benefit by speeding up diagnostic processes and ensuring accurate and timely delivery of critical clinical information. Such electronic transfers were begun in the UK and Europe in the early 1990s using ad hoc message standards. In the mid-1990s the NHS in the UK took the bold step of making this a universal feature of result delivery to general practice (GPs) and embarked on two <b>linked</b> <b>projects</b> to achieve this. In the first, the Pathology Messaging Enabler Project, standards were defined and infrastructure installed to link 200 laboratory systems to 8,500 GP systems. In the second project, the Pathology Messaging Implementation Project, these standards and the associated software was rolled out. By 2004 more than 35 million results messages were being transmitted each year and in 2007 some 50 million such messages were safely and securely delivered.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of an increasing reliance on project forms for learning within organizations. In particular, {{we focus on the}} tensions between learning at project level and the stocks and flows of organizational knowledge. Based on a review of the existing literature, we outline propositions on two major processes of project-based learning (PBL) : ‘learning-by-absorption’ and ‘learning-by-reflection’. Subsequently, the paper applies and refines this framework through the analysis of the findings from a qualitative study of three <b>linked</b> <b>projects</b> in the UK water industry. The findings from our study support and highlight the role of the above-noted processes in determining the extent and transfer of PBL. In particular, they indicate the role played by ‘quasi-organizational’ forms in enabling ‘learning-by-absorption’ and ‘learning-by-reflection’ at a project level. But equally, they help to explain limitations on the ability of project-based learning to bring about significant changes in knowledge stocks and flows in the wider organization...|$|E

40|$|This article reports {{findings}} from two <b>linked</b> <b>projects.</b> The first examined the housing, support and care needs of 400 visually impaired people aged 55 and over. The second {{looked at the}} housing and support needs of 121 adults aged 18 - 55. Only one half of younger informants and just over half of older informants had made physical alterations to their home to manage with impaired sight. A quarter of older people and three in ten younger people made no use whatsoever of aids or assistive technology. A lack of basic information prevented both groups from taking informed decisions about obtaining and adapting their accommodation. Older visually impaired people are the larger group numerically within society, and we found serious under provision of housing and services to ameliorate the problems of chronic ill health, social isolation and anxiety that many faced on a daily basis. Yet the difficulties faced by younger people were if anything even greater, especially if they had additional disabilities, were female or came from an ethnic minority. These findings challenge housing and service providers to devise innovative, person-centred and cost-effective solutions that {{improve the quality of}} life for adults of all ages with impaired vision...|$|E

In 2007 DEFRA commissioned the ALSF Dissemination Project, to bring together and disseminate the results of all research funded by the ALSF during the six years between 2002 and 2007.

40|$|PROPOSAL: With the {{changing}} mosaic of educational landscapes, educators attempt to implement creative strategies to engage students as committed contributors of knowledge. Effective learners embrace change-imposed challenges as valuable learning opportunities for academic advancement and scholarly progress. This session will describe a capstone undergraduate course that implements {{a fusion of}} problem-based learning (PBL) and inquiry frameworks {{to encourage students to}} apply concepts to synthesize solutions addressing real and pressing issues in Biology. The model utilizes in-lecture and online research activities, integrated presentations and reports, constructive feedback critiques, insight share-a-thons, “experts in the field” networking, and reflection journals. It sparks interdisciplinary mentorship involving upper level undergraduate students via the production of learning tools for current and future students. This capstone experience also scaffolds community-engaged and globally <b>linked</b> <b>projects.</b> A unique feature of the course involves students disseminating scientific knowledge using creative multimedia and distinctive role playing presentation themes, such as reality show global ecology policy makers, superheroes serving eco-wise agencies, and bio tourism info-commercials. These modes facilitate learning. Participants of this session will get “hands on” access to resources that show the model’s structure, educator/ students’ activities, assessment rubrics, and creative exemplars. It is anticipated that attendees will be inspired to implement these course components to support self-directed, team-based knowledge mobilization, and problem solving...|$|E
40|$|In this article, Ann Lewis, Professor of Education at the University of Birmingham, and Ian Davison, Jean Ellins, Louise Niblett, Sarah Parsons, Christopher Robertson and Jeremy Sharpe {{from the}} {{research}} team provide a summary of discussions and selected recommendations arising from four <b>linked</b> <b>projects</b> run between 2004 and 2006. The projects were funded by the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) {{and looked into the}} experiences of disabled pupils and their families across England, Scotland and Wales. A central aim of the research was to identify the key concerns and priorities in relation to their experiences of education for children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) or disabilities and their families in the UK. The research encompassed a UK-wide parent survey (N= 1776); in-depth case studies of individual children and young people(N= 36); group case studies (of, for example, school councils) (N= 3); and a series of project advisory groups involving disabled people. Underlying these aspects was an emphasis on the importance and validity of hearing directly from (potentially all) children and young people themselves. Thus the work meshes closely with initiatives worldwide concerning the recognition of children’s ‘voice’ in matters that concern them. The authors are not aware of any comparable evidence which focuses in-depth on a wide cross-section of pupils with disabilities or special needs and their families in the UK-wide educational context and which is located alongside concurrent authoritative data concerning the views of parents and carers...|$|E
