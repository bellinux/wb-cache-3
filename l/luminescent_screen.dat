40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} {{has provided}} philosophers of science with many counterintuitive insights and interpretive puzzles, but {{little has been}} written about the role that time plays in the theory. One reason for this is the celebrated argument of Wolfgang Pauli against the inclusion of time as an observable of the theory, which has been seen as a demonstration that time may only enter the theory as a classical parameter. Against this orthodoxy I argue that there are good reasons to expect certain kinds of `time observables' to find a representation within quantum theory, including clock operators (which provide the means to measure the passage of time) and event time operators, which provide predictions for the time at which a particular event occurs, such as the appearance of a dot on a <b>luminescent</b> <b>screen.</b> I contend that these time operators deserve full status as observables of the theory, and on reflection provide a uniquely compelling reason to expand the set of observables allowed by the standard formalism of quantum mechanics. In addition, I provide a novel association of event time operators with conditional probabilities, and propose a temporally extended form of quantum theory to better accommodate the time of an event as an observable quantity. This leads to a proposal to interpret quantum theory within an event ontology, inspired by Bertrand Russell's Analysis of Matter. On this basis I mount a defense of Russell's relational theory of time against a recent attack...|$|E
40|$|Nanostructures {{with high}} aspect ratio, e. g. carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) and metallic nanowires (NW), have opened attractive possibilities {{for development of}} high performance cold field emission (FE) cathodes for vacuum electronics. CNT on porous alumina were synthesized using ferrocene as a single source precursor in a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. In order to influence the number density of CNT emitters and their anchoring, the pore diameter of the alumina templates was varied between 20 and 200 nm. The field emission performance of such CNT cathodes of some ten mm 2 size was integrally measured in a spacer-free diode configuration with <b>luminescent</b> <b>screen,</b> and the current distribution has been derived by means of developed image analysis software, which utilizes a calibration of the light intensity as function of the current. A strong increase of the integral dc current density has been found for pore diameters below 60 nm. The current distribution and conversion results in maximum local values of 108 mA/cm 2 at 7 V/µm (dc). In pulsed mode, peak values of up to 0. 2 A/cm 2 at 11. 5 V/µm averaged over several mm 2 size have been achieved with much improved luminescence and homogeneity of the emission which is, as demonstrated, suitable for light source applications.      The high current carrying capability of the CNT emitters on porous alumina was confirmed by local measurements with a field emission scanning microscope (FESM), which provided Fowler-Nordheim-like (FN) currents of up to 19 µA from single emitters. FESM voltage scans show high emitter number densities of up to 60000 /cm 2 at E < 20 V/µm. It was found that both field enhancement factors (β) and emitter number densities are strongly dependent on the CVD growth conditions. Moreover, sparse emitters with comparably low average β ~ 300 are preferable for high current densities, rather than those which are densely grown with β ~ 1100. Single CNT emitters on porous alumina have shown fluctuations, long-term instabilities, and strong (~ 50 %) current drift over some hours. Resolved in a ms time scale the emission current reveal a switching between several electronic states, which {{is caused by the}} adsorbates. Cathode processing at different pressures and currents results in much improved current stability of ± 10 % as measured over 18 hours.      First experiments on copper NW with different geometrical properties, electrochemically grown in the etched ion-tracked pores of polymers, resulted in an emission site density of up to 1. 4 x 10 5 cm - 2 at 6 V/µm. Only 6 % of the free-standing and vertically aligned NW were strong emitters. Nearly all NW showed unstable FN behavior with a mean β value of ~ 250, which corresponds to a cylindrical emitters with sharp edges...|$|E

UHT milk samples were analyzed for the presence of mesophilic and psychrotrophic aerobic microorganisms using Plate Count Agar (PCA), Brain-Heart Infusion (BHI) media and PetrifilmTM Aerobic Count (AC) plates.

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{technical}} solutions used in multi-energy radiography is conversion of the penetrating X-ray radiation by a detector with its subsequent amplification and digitalization of the signal. We used detector arrays of types "scintillator-photodiode " (S-PD) and scintillator-photoreceiving device (PRD). In non-destructive testing systems using S-PD arrays {{it is possible to}} use scintillators of different atomic number and density, which allows functioning in the energy range from 20 keV to 10 MeV, i. e., steel equivalent thickness is from 100 µm to 300 mm. For different objects and different purposes, different types of detector arrays and methods of control can be recommended. Results of experimental studies of detector arrays S-PD and S-PRD used for X-ray digital radiography have shown that there exist further possibilities to increase spatial resolution of this system up to 2 - 3 line pairs per mm. Theoretical analysis and experimental estimates show that the two-energy detection method not only allows one to detect organics on the background of metal, but also substantially increases (by 3 - 5 times) the detection ability of the system.

40|$|Abamectin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insecticides worldwide. It is used against major agricultural pests and insects of public health importance, as well as against endoparasites in animal health. Abamectin has been used successfully for the control of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a major agricultural pest with global distribution, an extremely diverse host range, and a remarkable ability to develop resistance against insecticides including abamectin. Target site resistance mutations may explain a large part of resistance, although genetic evidence and transcriptomic data indicated that additional mechanisms may also be implicated in the abamectin resistant phenotype. To investigate a functional link between cytochrome P 450 -mediated metabolism and abamectin resistance, we recombinantly expressed three cytochrome P 450 s (CYP 392 A 16, CYP 392 D 8 and CYP 392 D 10) that have been associated with high levels of abamectin resistance in a resistant T. urticae strain isolated from Greece. CYP 392 A 16 was expressed predominately in its P 450 form however, both CYP 392 D 8 and CYP 392 D 10 were expressed predominately as P 420, despite optimization efforts on expression conditions. CYP 392 A 16 catalyses the hydroxylation of abamectin (Kcat = 0. 54 pmol/min/pmol P 450; Km = 45. 9 μM), resulting in a substantially less toxic compound as confirmed by bioassays with the partially purified metabolite. However, CYP 392 A 16 did not metabolize hexythiazox, clofentezine and bifenthrin, active ingredients that also showed reduced toxicity in the abamectin resistant strain.

40|$|For {{practical}} use of nanosized zinc oxide as the phosphor its luminescence quantum yields should be maximized. The {{aim of this}} work was to enhance luminescent properties of ZnO nanoparticles and obtain high-luminescent ZnO/SiO 2 composites using simpler approaches to colloidal synthesis. The luminescence intensity of zinc oxide nanoparticles was increased about 3 times by addition of silica nanocrystals to the source solutions during the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles. Then the quantum yield of luminescence of the obtained ZnO/SiO 2 composites is more than 30 %. Such an impact of silica is suggested {{to be caused by}} the distribution of ZnO nanocrystals on the surface of silica, which reduces the probability of separation of photogenerated charges between the zinc oxide nanoparticles of different sizes, and as a consequence, there is a significant increase of the luminescence intensity of ZnO nanoparticles. This way of increasing nano-ZnO luminescence intensity facilitates its use in a variety of devices, including optical ultraviolet and visible <b>screens,</b> <b>luminescent</b> markers, antibacterial coatings, luminescent solar concentrators, luminescent inks for security printing, and food packaging with abilities of informing consumers about the quality and safety of the packaged product...|$|R

We analyzed the effect of 1, 280 pharmacologically active compounds with diverse structures on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. Our screening paradigm identified many compounds previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK- 3) consistently caused a strong short period phenotype in contrast to the well-known period lengthening by lithium, another presumed GSK- 3 inhibitor. siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK- 3 β also caused a short period, confirming the phenotype obtained with the small molecule inhibitors.

40|$|Plasmonic {{resonators}} are nanosized metallic antennas that convert {{electromagnetic waves}} at optical frequencies into localized fields, providing an effective route to couple photons {{in and out}} of nanoscale volumes. This unique ability makes these nanostructures excellent tools to study and manipulate light-matter interaction at the nanoscale. The strong coupling of a plasmonic resonator to light, resulting in optical cross-sections of more than 10 times the particle’s physical size, is driven by collective oscillations of the conduction electrons in the metal – the so-called surface plasmon resonances. In {{the first part of this}} presentation, we will discuss how plasmonic resonances influence the second harmonic generation (SHG) from different resonator geometries. Linear optical properties examined by reflection spectroscopy, aperture scanning near-field optical microscopy (aperture-SNOM), and finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations reveal the supported plasmonic modes and their field and current distributions [1, 2]. These results are then compared with SHG microscopy measurements [3 - 5].

40|$|Lanthanide compounds, {{specifically}} those containing europium and terbium can exhibit luminescent properties {{when combined}} with ligands that promote this characteristic. Lanthanide luminescence has proven to have an array of useful applications, {{one of which is}} the formation of luminescent powders for exposure of latent fingerprints. The aim {{of this study was to}} synthesise a novel ligand to support luminescent character in europium and terbium compounds, and then dope these compounds in to talcum powder. This resulting powder would ideally give exposure of latent fingerprints that can then be enhanced, through excitation of the luminescent compounds dispersed in the powder. A novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand (p=o) was synthesised, and in turn was used to synthesis a range of Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) compounds. These compounds were assessed for potential luminescent activity, and doped into talcum powder. These powders were then appraised for their prospective use as latent fingerprint exposing agents. Through modification of a published procedure, the (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was synthesised, and characterised by Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) Mass spectrometry, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Infra‐red (IR) spectroscopy, melting point analysis and elemental analysis. With β‐diketonate ligands acetylacetone (acac) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone (tta), lanthanide metals lanthanum, europium and terbium and the (p=o) ligands a series of novel compounds were synthesised (Ln(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o)). These compounds were characterised by the methods listed above. Using the neutral ligands 1, 10 ‐phenanthroline (phen) and 2, 2 ‐bipyridine (bipy), a series of Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy) compounds were synthesised and doped into talcum powder, to investigate the effects on particle and structure character of the doped talcum powders. Talcum powder was also sonicated to investigate the effect of this on particle size, along with effect on use as a fingerprinting agent. Laser diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy studies informed of a notable decrease in particle size with sonication, and an increase in specific surface area. However the effect of this process on increasing exposure of latent fingerprints was deemed too insignificant to justify the procedure. The compounds Eu/Tb(acac/tta) ₃(phen/bipy), (Eu/Tb(β‐diketonate) ₃(p=o) and [H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu/Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were investigated for luminescent activity. Fluorescence spectroscopy determined the dominant emission wavelengths from 254 nm and 312 nm excitation were at 510 nm and 625 nm respectively. The talcum powders, doped with the luminescent compounds were analysed for <b>luminescent</b> activity. Direct <b>screening</b> with an ultra‐violet (UV) lamp with emission wavelengths of 254 nm and 312 nm informed of the powders with the most intensely observed luminescent emissions. From these results, Eu(tta) ₃(p=o), H₂NMe₂]₃[Eu(2, 6 ‐ dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O, Tb(acac) ₃(p=o) and H₂NMe₂]₃[Tb(2, 6 ‐dpa) ₃]. 2 H₂O were chosen as the most promising candidates for more in‐depth investigation of latent fingerprint exposure potential. Furthermore, it was determined that the novel (Me) ₃CN(CH₂P(O) Ph₂) ₂ ligand was successful as a neutral ligand for supporting luminescence. The powders were trialled by several variables, including surface, powder quantity, age of latent print, temperature, and the brush used to determine their effectiveness. Powders were compared to commercial Greenwop and Redwop fingerprint powders, as these were the most similar industrial samples in terms of use. Through trials in the laboratory and the police fingerprinting laboratory, it was determined that the doped talcum powders were inferior to the commercial “wop” samples in terms of latent print definition under UV conditions. However, the talcum powders had several useful applications, specifically the dual effect of exposing prints clearly under UV and non‐UV conditions. It was concluded the best application for the fingerprint powders was on smooth surfaces such as glass, with a gradual application of powder. Small amounts of powder gave more clarity under non‐UV print exposure, but higher quantities of powder were required to get ample luminescent intensity under UV conditions...|$|R
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), a Gram-negative {{opportunistic}} rod with ubiquitous {{presence in}} a panoply of different environments, secretes {{a wide array of}} virulence determinants that have established it as one of the leading nosocomial pathogens. Many of these virulence factors are regulated by the quorum sensing (QS) system that responds to environmental cell density variations. PA can ultimately trigger the onset of severe acute and chronic infections, especially in immunosuppressed subjects. The QS network in PA is comprised of at least four multi-layered interconnected subsystems with hierarchical organisation. From these, three (las, rhl and pqs) play a pivotal role in the production of virulence factors (e. g., lectins and pyocyanin) with relevant participation in the development and maintenance of biofilm matrices. The QS network is divided in two major signaling pathways, the one driven by N-acylhomoserine lactone signals and the one driven by 2 -alkyl- 4 -quinolone molecules. Two alkyl quinolones of core importance exist in PA, the 2 -heptyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 (1 H) quinolone, typically recognised as the “Pseudomonas quinolone signal” (PQS) and its precursor 2 -heptyl- 4 (1 H) -quinolone (HHQ). In addition to the regulatory involvement of the las and rhl quorum sensing systems, the biosynthesis of PQS production is also positively regulated by PqsR-dependent transcription of the pqsABCDE operon (a multivirulence factor regulator also known as MvfR). For that reason, the alkyl quinolone (AQ) signalling pathway, and more specifically its major regulator PqsR, are widely seen as promising targets for novel antimicrobial approaches. Because of the growing presence of multidrug resistant PA in the clinical setting, representing both an immediate menace to immunocompromised patients and a heavy burden on hospital budgets, the development of more rapid and affordable screening strategies for detection of the pathogen are required. Thus, new screening strategies adapted to clinical samples and successful novel synthetic small PqsR antagonists can lead the way to a new Era in the battle against hyper-virulent/-resistant PA strains. Primarily focusing on the AQ system, this research project investigated three inter-related areas, namely: (a) the highthroughput screening of novel synthetic small molecule antagonists of the PqsR protein, designed for suppression of virulence-associated phenotypes, (b) the development of a <b>luminescent</b> PQS-based <b>screening</b> bioreporter to be applied in the clinical setting, and finally (c) the optimisation of a methodology combining liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) and mass spectrometry (MS) for screening PQS-related AQs from in vivo bacterial extracts, and also intended for future screening of a variety of clinical samples (e. g., blood plasma, urine and saliva). A large number of synthetic small molecules with putative PqsR antagonism were obtained from our French partner GreenPharma, and studied for their capacity to interfere with expression of the key player of the pqs system, PqsR. By applying a rational selection strategy, based on the inhibitory effects on pqsA expression, assessment of metabolical exertion, and assay studies on the ultimate repression of key virulence-associated phenotypes (lectins LecA and LecB, pyocyanin, PQS-associated AQs) and impact on biolfilm formation, a final selection comprised of the four best antagonists was obtained. Compounds GPZ 002966, GPZ 004927, GPZ 824390 and GPZ 273902 had their cytotoxicity subsequently studied keeping in mind their applicability in pre-clinical studies. Overall, these PqsR antagonists promoted very strong inhibition of pqsA and lecA expression, strongly reduced production of pyocyanin and PQS-related AQs (HHQ, HQNO and C 7 -PQS itself), showed a strong degree of biofilm inhibition, with IC 50 scores sitting at the nanomolar level, and no signs of metabolical arrest was reported by the test strains used. Some explanations, focusing on the functional and structural organisation/composition of these compounds are also offered based on a comparative analysis against a number of the most prolific PqsR antagonists recently developed. The bioluminescent PQS-based biosensor for the detection of PA was engineered to respond to the presence of exogenous PQS that forms a complex with the regulatory PqsR protein, ultimately stimulating the expression of a luxCDABE-fused pqsA promoter. The biosensor was subsequently inserted in a non-pathogenic E. coli recipient by means of chromosomal integration, devoid of the sdiA LuxR homolog that could potentially interfere with the recognition of PqsR. A silent reporter was observed when in E. coli, but further assessments to its genetic integrity did not reveal any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). In addition, after further testings to its activity in different established PA mutants, devoid of genes that constituted the bioreporting system or to it directly associated, a fully functional bioreporter was confirmed. Finally, a few possible explanations as to what might be in the origin of a defective bioreporter in E. coli are discussed. Lastly, a new LESA-MS protocol based on the surface sampling of dried bacterial extracts, envisaging its potentialities as a rapid and cheap screening method for detection of AQs, was designed and optimised. Even though the method has been widely used in a variety of research scenarios, {{this is the first time}} LESA-MS is applied as a screening methodology in the context of bacterial extract screening. Overall, the optimisation process showed that LESA-MS is an approach with numerous potentialities and immediate advantages, where one emphasises sampling simplicity, fast delivering of results, sensitivity to AQs at the nanomolar level (especially for C 7 -PQS and the precursor HHQ). But simultaneously, this methodology also revealed limitations inherent to its setting up that constrain an effective screening. The most emphatic ones being the volatility of the preparations to intra-sampling variability, and to a certain degree, an unexpected insensitivity to important QS N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), namely C 4 -HSL and 3 -oxo-C 12 -HSL. Nevertheless, such limitations do not present themselves as an insurmountable barrier, and based on results from available studies making use of the LESA-MS a number of possibilities to work around these are also presented...|$|R
