5|$|While {{appearing}} in Don't Just <b>Lie</b> <b>There,</b> Say Something! at the Metro Theatre, Sydney in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, {{upon his return}} to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with Parkinson's disease. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a similar}} ambivalence in Janus Djurhuus’ six-stanza “Atlantis” (1917), where {{a celebration of the}} Faroese {{linguistic}} revival grants it an ancient pedigree by linking Greek to Norse legend. In the poem a female figure rising from the sea against a background of Classical palaces is recognised as a priestess of Atlantis. The poet recalls “that the Faroes <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> in the north Atlantic Ocean/ where before lay the poet-dreamt lands,” but also that in Norse belief, such a figure only appears to those about to drown.|$|E
25|$|On 8 December 1904 the Italian crypt was shipped, in sixteen crates from Italy. It {{travelled}} on {{the same}} ship that the remains of Smithson travelled on. Architecture firm Hornblower & Marshall designed the mortuary chapel, which included marble laurel wreaths and a neo-classical design. Smithson was entombed on 6 March 1905. His casket, which had been held in the Regent's Room, was placed into the ground underneath the crypt. This chapel was {{to serve as a}} temporary space for Smithson's remains until Congress approved a larger memorial. However, that never happened, and the remains of Smithson still <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> today.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge of}} any kind between the two parishes of Fulham and Putney was built during the Civil War: after the Battle of Brentford in 1642, the Parliamentary forces built a bridge of boats between Fulham and Putney. According to an account from the period:The Lord General hath caused a bridge to be built upon barges and {{lighters}} over the Thames between Fulham and Putney, to convey his army and artillery over into Surrey, to follow the king's forces; and he hath ordered that forts shall be erected at each end thereof to guard it; but for the present the seamen, with long boats and shallops full of ordnance and musketeers, <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> upon the river to secure it.|$|E

25|$|Use of the fMRI {{has been}} left out of legal debates {{throughout}} its history. Use of this technology has not been allowed due to holes in the evidence supporting fMRI. First, most evidence supporting fMRIs accuracy was done in a lab under controlled circumstances with solid facts. This type of testing does not pertain to real life. Real-life scenarios can be much more complicated with many other affecting factors. It has been shown that many other factors affect BOLD other than a typical <b>lie.</b> <b>There</b> have been tests done showing that drug use alters blood flow in the brain, which drastically affects the outcome of BOLD testing. Furthermore, individuals with diseases or disorders such as schizophrenia or compulsive lying can lead to abnormal results as well. Lastly, there is an ethical question relating to fMRI scanning. This testing of BOLD has led to controversy over if fMRIs are an invasion of privacy. Being able to scan and interpret what people are thinking may be thought of as immoral and the controversy still continues.|$|E
500|$|Only a {{few days}} after Ballard's {{discovery}} of the wreck, Jack Grimm – the author of the unsuccessful early 1980s attempts to find Titanic – claimed ownership of it on the grounds that he had allegedly been the first to find it.

500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> and you would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E

500|$|During Meisdalshagen's {{time the}} lines between various parts of {{government}} were somewhat blurred. When the state budget was presented by the cabinet, and subsequently treated by the standing committees of the Parliament, committee members would contact the Ministry of Finance directly to ask whether a proposed budgetary change was feasible (after Meisdalshagen's resignation this practice was altered, in that the contact was initiated by the Labour Party committee fraction, not by the committee as a whole). Meisdalshagen also became known for nontraditional arrangements {{when it came to}} the Ministry's bureaucrats: assistant secretary Egil Lothe, who had a [...] "very good relationship" [...] with Meisdalshagen, doubled as assistant secretary and State Secretary from 1948 until Meisdalshagen's resignation in 1951. Such a double role, where a person was both bureaucrat and politician at the same time, was very uncommon, probably unique. Lothe was not formally appointed, either, and thus does not appear on historical lists of state secretaries. According to Einar <b>Lie,</b> <b>there</b> was no clear division of tasks between Meisdalshagen and Lothe {{when it came to the}} Ministry's daily work. In addition to Lothe, the consultant Karl Trasti, another friend of Meisdalshagen, had influence in this period, especially in budgetary questions.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 November 2012, a {{reporter}} for Channel 5 revealed that filming for the storyline had commenced during the week. Scenes were filmed at FremantleMedia Australia's Melbourne studios, {{as well as on}} location in Kangaroo Ground. The episodes were filmed over four days; the wedding ceremony and the reception scenes were shot in the first two days, with the explosion being shot on the third day and the aftermath on the fourth. Morey commented [...] "It was nice that it was all broken up, as it meant that we could actually enjoy the happy wedding part! It was so lovely filming it, so it was quite surreal to know that it was all going to explode later on! When we did the aftermath, I just had to <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> so I was lucky, but everyone else was running around screaming. It was hectic!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of a Southern continent is confidently asserted on the hemispheres shown [...] in the pamphlet, which bear the inscription in Latin which translates:"This part of the coastline that has been revealed to us by voyages is not yet evident". A paragraph in the text explains: To the south, land {{has been found in}} two places south of America toward the South Pole, stretching in longitude 43 degrees westward, to latitude south sometimes to 54, sometimes 53, sometimes 55 degrees as the topography reveals. Moreover in the year 1526 a land has been discovered at 0 degrees longitude and 52 degrees south latitude, parts of which are empty of inhabitants. The rest of the Austral coasts still lie in obscurity, but to me it seems very likely that that part of the Earth is not overspread and covered by the Ocean. Indeed it is conjectured and argued that vast and extensive regions and islands <b>lie</b> <b>there,</b> but because of the distances between places and the infertile nature of the soil, they are less frequented.|$|E

Fortunately, I was an acrobat growing up, and a very very good one — I won a lot of contests — so I knew how to control my body and be 'quiet.' You had to do that, you had to be very still and lay there and be a 'good patient.' A young actor will do anything to get their mug on the screen! I remember that the makeup process took about three hours. I had to lay back and be perfectly still as they put this plaster mold on my face. After seeing the test, everyone was very enthusiastic about going ahead with making Planet of the Apes. But they felt the makeup needed a little more work and perfecting before it would look good on screen." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{island is}} {{triangular}} in its form, {{and one of}} its sides is opposite to Gaul. One angle of this side, which is in Kent, whither almost all ships from Gaul are directed, [...] to the east; the lower looks to the south. This side extends about 500 miles. Another side lies toward Spain and the west, on which part is Ireland, less, as is reckoned, than Britain, by one half: but the passage from it into Britain is of equal distance with that from Gaul. In the middle of this voyage, is an island, which is called Mona: many smaller islands besides are supposed to <b>lie</b> <b>there,</b> of which islands some have written {{that at the time of}} the winter solstice it is night there for thirty consecutive days. We, in our inquiries about that matter, ascertained nothing, except that, by accurate measurements with water, we perceived the nights to be shorter there than on the continent. The length of this side, as their account states, is 700 miles. The third side is toward the north, to which portion of the island no land is opposite; but an angle of that side looks principally toward Germany. This side is considered to be 800 miles in length. Thus the whole island is about 2,000 miles in circumference.|$|E
2500|$|Another Jewish {{tradition}} tells {{that when}} Jacob {{was brought to}} be buried in the cave, Esau prevented the burial claiming he had the right {{to be buried in}} the cave; after some negotiation Naphtali was sent to Egypt to retrieve the document stating Esau sold his part in the cave to Jacob. As this was going on Hushim, the son of Dan who was hard of hearing, did not understand what was going on, and why his grandfather was not being buried, so he asked for an explanation; after being given one he became angry and said: [...] "Is my grandfather to <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> in contempt until Naphtali returns from the land of Egypt?" [...] He then took a club and killed Esau, and Esau's head rolled into the cave. This means that the head of Esau is also buried in the cave. Some Jewish sources record the selling of Esau's right to be buried in the cave – according to a commentary on the [...] "Book of Exodus", Jacob gave all his possessions to acquire a tomb in the Cave of the Patriarchs. He put a large pile of gold and silver before Esau and asked, “My brother, do you prefer your portion of this cave, or all this gold and silver?” Esau's selling to Jacob his right to be buried in the Cave of the Patriarchs is also recorded in Sefer HaYashar.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were two}} parties, one that {{supported}} the pretensions of King John I of Castile and the other, represented by the bourgeoisie of Lisbon, whose objective was to expel the foreigners from the government so that the kingdom would be governed only by the Portuguese. This party proposed the marriage of the dowager queen with the master of Aviz, the future King John I of Portugal, but Leonor rejected this proposal. In Lisbon, supporters of the master of Aviz who refused to recognize Beatriz as queen for fear of Portugal's loss of independence, organized a conspiracy to assassinate Juan Fernández de Andeiro. The first two attempts (one of them was organized by Leonor's brother, João Afonso Telo) failed. The third and last attempt took place on 6 December 1383. The master of Aviz gave him a thrust and once on the ground, Rui Pereira killed him. This happened in the royal palace next to Leonor's chamber. The master apologized for {{what had happened and}} asked her to prevent the Castilian king from entering the kingdom of Portugal. Leonor demanded that Andeiro be buried with dignity and said to him, [...] "And haven't you got any pity for that man lying there dead in such dishonor? Just for the sake of being a nobleman like you, take pity on him and have him buried; don't let him <b>lie</b> <b>there</b> so". He ignored her plea and Leonor was personally responsible for the burial of her friend that night in the Church of Saint Martin.|$|E
