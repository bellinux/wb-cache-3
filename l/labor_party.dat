5|$|Following her {{departure}} from parliament at the 2013 election, Gillard has remained engaged with the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b> After Labor's defeat {{at the federal}} election held in September 2013, Gillard penned an op-ed for Guardian Australia, wherein she wrote about her legacy and how she believes the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> ought to rebuild. In June 2015, Gillard participated in Sarah Ferguson's The Killing Season, a three-part documentary series which chronicles {{the events of the}} Rudd–Gillard years in power. The television series featured in-depth interviews with key <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> officials during the Rudd–Gillard Governments. Prior to the 2016 election campaign, Gillard offered her assistance to the <b>Labor</b> <b>party,</b> whereby a video was released of her endorsing and seeking donations for the party's education policy. She later joined former Labor Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating at Bill Shorten's Labor campaign launch on 19 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Weaver, {{now living}} in Dubbo, contested the seat of Ashburnham for the Liberal Party but was {{defeated}} on 46-53% against the Labor Party's John Lynch. Undeterred, Weaver stood again in 1913 as the Farmers and Settlers Party candidate for the seat of Macquarie but was narrowly defeated with 49.61% against the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> candidate's 50.39%. Weaver contested the result, accusing the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party,</b> but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{achievements}} {{and support for}} Catholics were particularly praised by Bob Santamaria, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the Democratic <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the Australian <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> (ALP), the nation's main centre-left social democratic party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the McCarthyism scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP {{on the basis that}} the ALP was too lenient towards communists. One of the reasons that Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and accentuate the divisions among his left wing opponents.|$|E

5|$|However, {{despite the}} efforts of Mair and Bruxner, the {{controversy}} surrounding Stevens' departure and a resurgent <b>Labor</b> <b>Party,</b> now led by the moderate William McKell, ensured that the popularity of the government never recovered. At the campaign for the 10 May 1941 election, the government performed poorly, finding it difficult to distinguish themselves from the past and proposing policies but only promising action after the war. McKell's <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> did the opposite, leaving war matters to the federal government and promising current reforms. At the election, the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> polled more than half the vote while Bruxner's Country Party lost nine seats and Mair's UAP lost twenty seats. Bruxner retained his seat with 56%. Bruxner would never again hold ministerial office and the conservative political forces would not take government again until Robert Askin and Charles Cutler won the 1965 election.|$|E
5|$|In the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Hamersley {{is split}} between the electorates of Girrawheen and Balcatta, ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b> At polling place level, Hamersley {{supported}} the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election. In both the 2001 and 2005 elections, polling places in Hamersley, as with those in many northern Perth suburbs, switched to the Australian <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> at state level. However, at the 2008 and 2013 elections, the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Kevin Rudd {{suffered}} {{a decline in}} his personal ratings, and a perceived loss of support among his own MPs, following {{the failure of the}} Government's insulation program, controversy regarding the implementation of a tax on mining, the failure of the government to secure passage of its carbon trading scheme and some policy debate about immigration policy. Significant disaffection had arisen within the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> as to the leadership style and direction of Rudd. On 23 June 2010 he announced that Gillard had asked him to hold a leadership ballot the following day to determine the leadership of the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party,</b> and hence the Prime Ministership of Australia.|$|E
5|$|The first <b>Labor</b> <b>party</b> in South Australia was the United <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> in 1891, {{born out}} of a trade union {{association}} that recommended and supported trade unionist candidates. In response, the National Defence League (NDL) was born two years later. In 1909, the NDL combined with the Liberal and Democratic Union and the Farmers and Producers Political Union to form the Liberal Union, later known as the Liberal Federation. The ULP morphed into the Australian <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> in 1910, and has been known by this name ever since. A separate Country Party subsequently emerged, representing rural interests, but this was assimilated back into the conservative side of politics {{with the formation of}} the Liberal and Country League (LCL) in 1932. The South Australian party system has not deviated from this two-party divide, and all other parties gained negligible representation or influence, until the emergence of smaller parties such as the Australian Democrats in the late 20th century, and the Australian Greens and Family First Party in the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Dacey {{became a}} senior party {{figure in the}} late 1890s and began to work on {{political}} strategy to win support in suburban seats and from white-collar voters. He stood in opposition to his party's support for the Premiership of Sir George Reid and instead threatened to resign if the party did not switch its support to William Lyne's Protectionist Party. At a <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> conference in 1899, the party executive decided to put forward the protectionism/free trade debate to a referendum of all party members, despite Dacey's campaigning. Dacey's standing in the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> continued to grow: he was the party's treasurer from 1901 to 1910 and on the Party Central Executive in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform of railroad regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union <b>Labor</b> <b>party,</b> had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union <b>Labor</b> <b>party</b> courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Weaver was {{appointed}} by Premier Thomas Bavin on 16 April 1929 as the Secretary for Mines and Minister for Forests. Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of non-union labour in the Rothbury coal mine. The resultant protests led to the Rothbury Riot {{and the death of}} one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b> This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the October 1930 election, at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%, by Jack Lang's Australian <b>Labor</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
