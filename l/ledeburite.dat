5000|$|White {{cast-iron}} {{is composed}} mostly of a microstructure called <b>ledeburite</b> mixed with pearlite. <b>Ledeburite</b> is very hard, making the cast-iron very brittle. If the white cast-iron has a hypoeutectic composition, {{it is usually}} tempered to produce malleable or ductile cast-iron. Two methods of tempering are used, called [...] "white tempering" [...] and [...] "black tempering." [...] The purposes of both tempering methods is to cause the cementite within the <b>ledeburite</b> to decompose, increasing the ductility.|$|E
50|$|In {{iron and}} steel metallurgy, <b>ledeburite</b> {{is a mixture of}} 4.3% carbon in iron and is a {{eutectic}} mixture of austenite and cementite. <b>Ledeburite</b> is not a type of steel as the carbon level is too high although it may occur as a separate constituent in some high carbon steels. It is mostly found with cementite or pearlite in a range of cast irons.|$|E
50|$|It {{is named}} after the {{metallurgist}} Karl Heinrich Adolf Ledebur (1837-1906). He was the first professor of metallurgy at the Bergakademie Freiberg and discovered <b>ledeburite</b> in 1882.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ledeburite</b> {{arises when}} the carbon content is between 2.06% and 6.67%. The {{eutectic}} mixture of austenite and cementite is 4.3% carbon, Fe3C:2Fe, with a melting point of 1147 °C.|$|E
50|$|Malleable (porous) {{cast-iron}} is {{manufactured by}} white tempering. White tempering {{is used to}} burn off excess carbon, by heating it for extended amounts of time in an oxidizing environment. The cast iron will usually be held at temperatures as high as 1000 C {{for as long as}} 60 hours. The heating is followed by a slow cooling rate of around 10 °C (18 °F) per hour. The entire process may last 160 hours or more. This causes the cementite to decompose from the <b>ledeburite,</b> and then the carbon burns out through the surface of the metal, increasing the malleability of the cast-iron.|$|E

Nr. 1. 2379 (OCR 12 VM) after welding with SAW, TIG, microplasma and laser welding techniques is presented in this paper. Special attention was paid on the behaviour of carbides. The occurrence of secondary <b>ledeburite</b> {{is a result of}} local enrichment of the austenite matrix with alloying elements, due to partial or complete dissolution of primary/eutectic carbides.

The centrifugal casting and electromagnetic centrifugal casting apparently improve the solidification structure of HC-HSS. With the increase of magnetic intensity (B), the volume fraction of austenite in the HC-HSS solidification structure increases significantly while the eutectic <b>ledeburite</b> decreases. Moreover, the secondary carbides precipitated from the austenite are finer with more homogeneous distribution in the electromagnetic centrifugal castings.

40|$|The {{so-called}} adamitic cast steels are characterised {{by a high}} abrasion resistance. These cast steels are of a pearlitic matrix with uniformly distributed hypereutectoid cementite precipitates. Apart from hypereutectoid cementite {{very often}} transformed <b>ledeburite</b> also occurs in the microstructure of these cast steels. Such cast steels contain chromium (app. 1 %) and nickel (app. 0. 5 %) as alloy additions and sometimes their silicon content is increased. The presence of molybdenum is also permissible (app. 0. 4 %). The basic problem in application of these steels for structural elements constitutes their insufficient crack resistance.

40|$|Samples of a {{low alloy}} Cr-Ni-Mo mottled cast iron were melted using CW CO 2 laser radiation. The laser treated layer {{presents}} severe defects, mainly cracks and pores. The amount of defects depends on the laser treatment technique, on the exact choice of operating parameters, {{as well as on}} the cast iron elaboration procedure. The best results were obtained using moderate power density, long interaction times, a moderate overlap between consecutive tracks and preheating the samples. The size of the graphite lamellae and the impurity content must be restricted to reduce the density of pores. The microstructure of the resolidified material depends also on the laser treating parameters. When the scanning speed is low, the solidification structure contains primary austenite dendrites in a ledeburitic matrix. During cooling, austenite transforms partially into martensite. An increase in the scanning speed leads to a decrease in the fraction of <b>ledeburite</b> and to a increase in the fraction of retained austenite. When the scanning speed exceeds a limit which depends on the power density, normal lamellar <b>ledeburite</b> disappears and a solidification structure consisting of long austenite dendrites with a interdendritic film of cementite forms.

This {{is achieved by}} carbothermic reduction of ilmenite ore along with varying amount of steel scrap in a plasma reactor in one step. Three composites containing TiC particles varying from 4 to 9 % have been prepared. Microstructures of composites show TiC particles in the matrix of transformed <b>ledeburite</b> (pearlite and cementite). Distribution of TiC particles {{has been found to}} be satisfactorily uniform and size varies from 2 to 3 microns. Composite having 9 vol % has shown non-uniform distribution of TiC particles and size variation from 2 to 8 microns. In 9 % TiC composites, graphite flakes have also been found. It has also been observed that composite having TiC content greater than 9 % becomes very difficult to cast because of higher viscosity of the melt during pouring. These composites have been characterized by hardness measurement, optical microscopy, FE-SEM, and XRD. Hardness of these composites has been found to depend on vol. % of TiC and on the nature of the matrix.

The {{results showed that the}} {{fracture of}} the camshaft mainly results from white section in macrostructure and <b>Ledeburite</b> in microstructure; the crack in the fractured camshaft should be recognized to initiate at the boundary of coarser needle-like carbide and matrix, and then propagate through the transverse section. At the same time, the casting defects such as dendritic shrinkage, accumulated inclusion and initiated crack and abnormal external force might stimulate the fracture of camshaft as well.

The {{development}} of heat treatment modes of white cast irons for structure {{changes in their}} eutectic constituent, namely in disturbing the monolithic structure of <b>ledeburite</b> colonies cementite structure and eutectic net continuity. Also the mentioned heat treatment modes are targeted to the eutectic net shift for the most suitable position {{from the point of}} plastic deforming. Methodology. The hypoeutectic white cast irons with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and hot twist tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to cast irons mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the white cast irons low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of white hypoeutectic cast irons have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition white cast irons hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium white cast irons. It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in <b>ledeburite</b> colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value.

Therefore, upon cooling from the liquid, the primary phase to solidify is free graphite. Graphite forms directly from the melt as flakes (black) rather than dendrites. These flakes are interconnected and align themselves in the heat flow direction. Upon further cooling the remaining liquid forms initially as a eutectic mixture of austenite and cementite, known as <b>ledeburite.</b> The austenite within the eutectic further transforms to a mixture of pearlite and cementite.
