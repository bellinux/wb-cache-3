50|$|In photometry, {{illuminance}} is {{the total}} luminous flux incident on a surface, per unit area. It {{is a measure of}} how much the incident light illuminates the surface, wavelength-weighted by the luminosity function to correlate with human brightness perception. Similarly, luminous emittance is the luminous flux per unit area emitted from a surface. Luminous emittance is also known as <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{intensity}} refers {{strictly to}} the amount of light that is emitted per unit of time and per unit of surface, in units of lux. Note, however, that in many fields of science this quantity is called <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance,</b> as opposed to luminous intensity, which is a different quantity. These distinctions, however, are largely irrelevant to gamma compression, which is applicable to any sort of normalized linear intensity-like scale.|$|E
40|$|InGaN {{light-emitting}} diodes of stripe geometries have been demonstrated. The elongated geometry facilitates light spreading in the longitudinal direction. The chips are further shaped by laser-micromachining to have partially-inclined sidewalls. The light extraction efficiencies of such 3 D chip geometries are enhanced by ~ 12 % (~ 8 % according to ray-trace simulations), {{leading to a}} reduction of junction temperatures. The effective emission area is also increased four times compared to a cubic chip. The stripe LEDs are thus more efficient emitters with reduced <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance,</b> making them more suitable {{for a wide range}} of lighting applications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simplified method to evaluate daylight distribution in rooms with window systems utilizing solar shadings and light redirecting devices. The daylight calculation {{is useful to}} evaluate visual comfort, electric energy consumption for artificial lighting, and can be coupled to a simplified thermal model to evaluate the impact of daylight utilization on hourly temperatures, heating and cooling demands. Calculation of the daylight distribution in a room {{is based on the}} radiosity method and all internal surfaces are assumed to be diffuse reflectors. The daylight transmitted through windows is split into three parts: diffuse light, direct transmitted light, and redirected transmitted light. The surfaces in the room are divided into smaller rectangular elements and the radiosity method is applied to calculate illumination on each element based on their initial <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance.</b> The direct transmitted light and the redirected transmitted light are distributed on the rectangular elements based on the sun path of direct and redirected light. The elements which are hit by direct or redirected light are treated as light sources with <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance</b> based on the amount of direct and redirected light on the element. The objective of the method is to enable coupled evaluation of daylight, artificial lighting, energy consumption for heating and cooling in the early design phase based on a limited amount of information on the building design. The chosen approach enables a simplified hourly evaluation of the daylight utilization with fast calculation speed and reasonable accuracy. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid ray-tracing and radiosity method for processing luminous flux in spaces equipped with venetian blinds. The method considers both diffuse and specular characteristics of blinds and aims {{to establish a}} balance between computational speed and accuracy. Specular components are treated using ray-tracing techniques using a shining factor for the blinds to split between directly and diffusely reflected components. The direct components are traced inside the blind cavity and inside the room while the direct-diffuse components inside the blind cavity are processed in a two-dimensional radiosity calculation until the final diffuse flux departing the cavity is determined. Diffuse-to-diffuse transmission is considered using a traditional radiosity method. Each room surface is divided into sub-surfaces and given an initial <b>luminous</b> <b>exitance,</b> after accounting for directly traced portions. Then a 3 -D radiosity method is employed for the entire room to compute illuminance distributions on each subsurface and on the work plane. The developed model will help in the estimation of daylight distributions in spaces with venetian blinds and potential lighting energy savings calculations if combined with electric lighting controls. It will also lead to development of new control algorithms for shading and lighting systems for perimeter spaces with controllable shading devices...|$|E
