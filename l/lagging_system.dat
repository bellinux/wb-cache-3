40|$|Scaling {{computations}} on emerging massive-core supercomputers is {{a daunting}} task, which {{coupled with the}} significantly <b>lagging</b> <b>system</b> I/O capabilities exacerbates applications ’ end-to-end performance. The I/O bottleneck often negates potential performance benefits of assigning additional compute cores to an application. In this paper, we address this issue via a novel functional partitioning (FP) runtime environment that allocates cores to specific application tasks — checkpointing, de-duplication, and scientific data format transformation — so that the deluge of cores {{can be brought to}} bear on the entire gamut of application activities. The focus is on utilizing the extra cores to support HPC application I/O activities and also leverage solid-state disks in this context. For example, our evaluation shows that dedicating 1 core on an oct-core machine for checkpointing and its assist tasks using FP can improve overall execution time of a FLASH benchmark on 80 and 160 cores by 43. 95 % and 41. 34 %, respectively.

40|$|In this paper. a new {{identification}} method is proposed which can obtain a good accuracy of identification of nonlinear time <b>lag</b> <b>system</b> {{on the basis}} of combination of genetic algorithm and sequence method. The nonlinear system may be described as a discrete model of a polynomial type with unknown parameters using Kolmogorov-Gabor's method. The task of system identification is to determine these parameters. Though the system parameters can be obtained through the search of GA. there is a potential risk. in using a simple GA, that a solution is usually stuck at a local minimum. In order to solve this problem. a new GA search method is proposed by adding a sequence search. which is carried out nearby the value of each estimated parameter coming from a simple GA. By this method. the individual whose fitness is larger can be found. As a result. the solution escapes from a local minimum and converges to the optimum one. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulation of the identification of nonlinear time <b>lag</b> <b>systems.</b> As an application. the proposed {{identification method}} is applied to explosion-proof pneumatic robots, which are modeled as nonlinear time <b>lag</b> <b>systems</b> because the controller links with an actuator by a long pneumatic tube to prevent explosion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a robust stabilization prob-lem of discrete model-reference control systems on integer grid coordinates. Currently, all feedback control systems are realized using discretized signals. However, {{the analysis and}} design of discrete-time and discrete-value (point-to-point) control systems has not been established. In this paper, the robust stability of that type of discretized control systems is examined in a frequency domain. A robust stability condition for such discrete control systems with multi-nonlinearity is derived by applying Ostrowski’s M-matrix. Using these results, the stabilization and design of model-reference control systems is performed. It {{can be seen that}} the model-reference control using a second-order <b>lag</b> <b>system</b> is equivalently transformed into a traditional PID control scheme. Numerical examples for discrete model-reference control are provided to verify the design method. I...|$|R

40|$|A two-thermocouple probe, {{composed}} of two fine-wire thermocouples of unequal diameters, is a novel technique for estimating thermocouple time constants without any dynamic calibration of the thermocouple response. This technique is most suitable for measuring fluctuating temperatures in turbulent combustion. In the present study, the reliability and applicability of this technique are appraised in a turbulent wake of a heated cylinder (without combustion). A fine-wire resistance thermometer (cold wire) of fast response is simultaneously used to provide a reference temperature. A quantitative and detailed comparison between the cold-wire measurement and the compensated thermocouple ones shows that a previous estimation scheme gives thermocouple time constants smaller than appropriate values, unless the noise in the thermocouple signals is negligible and/or the spatial resolution of the two-thermocouple probe is sufficiently high. The scheme has been improved so as to maximize the correlation coefficient between the two compensated-thermocouple outputs. The improved scheme offers better compensation of the thermocouple response.
