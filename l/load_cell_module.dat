40|$|The {{success of}} {{flexible}} instruments in surgery requires high motion and force fidelity and controllability of the tip. However, the friction {{and the limited}} stiffness of such instruments limit the motion and force transmission of the instrument. In a previous study, we developed a flexible multibody model of a surgical instrument inside an endoscope in order to study {{the effect of the}} friction, bending and rotational stiffness of the instrument and clearance on the motion hysteresis and the force transmission. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an experimental setup for the validation of the flexible multibody model and the characterization of the instruments. A modular design was conceived based on three key functionalities: the actuation from the proximal end, the displacement measurement of the distal end, and the measurement of the interaction force. The exactly constrained actuation module achieves independent translation and rotation of the proximal end. The axial displacement and the rotation of the distal end are measured contactless via a specifically designed air bearing guided cam through laser displacement sensors. The errors in the static measurement are 15 [*]μm in translation and 0. 15 deg in rotation. Six 1 -DOF <b>load</b> <b>cell</b> <b>modules</b> using flexures measure the interaction forces and moments with an error of 0. 8 % and 2. 5 %, respectively.

Drilled shaft foundation elements provide a cost-effective foundation alternative for the support of building and bridge superstructure loads. Bi-directional pile loading tests (BDPLTs) to evaluate the capacity of drilled shafts have become popular owing to their capacity to save time and effort as compared to the use of top-down loading tests. However, the use of BDPLTs requires that production shafts be post-grouted following testing in order to assure appropriate in-service performance. Commonly used single-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> and/or <b>loading</b> <b>cell</b> construction details can pose the potential for the development of voids following post-grouting due to their monotonic jacking action and large footprint. This paper described the development and use of high pressure bi-directional <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> intended to minimize the possibility of post-test construction defects. First, a comparison was made between the single-acting and double-acting <b>loading</b> <b>cells.</b> Second, the results of laboratory calibrations on the pressurized <b>loading</b> <b>cells</b> were performed, as were component testing of the pumps, hoses, and hydraulic fluid synchronization lines.
