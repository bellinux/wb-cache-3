40|$|International audienceContactless torque {{transmission}} {{through a large}} airgap is required in some industrial applications in which hermetic isolation is necessary.

40|$|The {{wireless}} communication technologies {{has been found}} in all aspects of our social and economic life. However, the research on the wireless power transmission (WPT) has not been well established relatively. A strong driving force for the WPT technologies comes from the consumer electronics and the commercialization of electric vehicles (EV) recently. WPT provides a simple, unified and safe means to recharge the battery. With an extensive integration of this technique, the built-in battery size can be minimized to reduce system volume and cost. After performing a comprehensive review of the near-field WPT technologies, three major issues including unstable magnetic coupling, inflexible system architecture and susceptible power transmission are identified as the obstacles in extending the WPT technique into the dynamic application. To provide a stable magnetic coupling for power transmission, the optimal design of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>coupler</b> is studied. The power transfer efficiency and power transfer capability are first modelled by combination of circuit theory and finite element analysis (FEA) to provide a basic for subsequent design. A comparative study is then conducted to evaluate most of the design considerations for <b>magnetic</b> <b>couplers.</b> An optimal design method is finally introduced. A 30 × 30 cm single layer compound winding transmitter is proposed for charging the portable devices. The uniform magnetic coupling is targeted such that the power transmission is less sensitive to the relative position of the receiver. The system with multiple modular transmitter and receiver are proposed to provide a more flexible system structure. The interaction of the magnetic field between adjacent modular is first studied. The flux cancellation phenomenon is identified and found relative to the direction of the exciting currents. A comprehensive comparison of the system configuration is then conducted. The magnetic coupling and the power transfer capability are evaluated for two system topologies and six different configurations by FEA. Two most promising configurations are selected with either the most stable magnetic coupling or the most significant power transfer capability. To avoid the power transfer sensitivity to the magnetic coupling and load variations, a new prototype and corresponding control method are proposed. The load-independent operation modes for different compensation topologies are derived by circuit analysis. Then, one of the aforementioned modular transmitter topology is selected for stable magnetic coupling, such that the load-independent characteristics extends into the dynamic situations. As a result, the load-independent and free-positioning features are satisfied simultaneously. An experimental prototype has been built tentatively for the wireless LED lighting system. A constant output voltage is guaranteed on the receiver side when the receiver moves along the transmitter array or when the load changes. Additionally, due to the decoupled control between the primary side and the secondary side the requirement on communication is eliminated. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} the design, modeling, {{experimental}} testing and scaling analysis of a novel MAgnetic Variable stiffnEess spRIng-Clutch (MAVERIC) device, which may be used as the elastic element of Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs). The device, comprising two co-axial diametrically magnetized hollow cylinders, has two degrees of freedom: a rotation of the two cylinders around the common axis and a relative translation along the same axis. For small rotations, the torque arising from the magnetic interaction of the two cylinders is almost linearly proportional to their relative rotation, as in mechanical torsion springs. In addition, the stiffness of the equivalent spring can be varied continuously from a maximum value down to exactly zero by changing the axial overlap of the two cylinders. In this way the proposed device can be used both as a clutch (i. e., perfectly compliant element) and as a variable stiffness torsion spring. A prototype, designed after magnetostatic FEM simulations, has been built and experimentally characterized. The developed MAVERIC has an experimentally determined maximum transmissible torque of 109. 81 mNm, while the calculated maximum stiffness is 110. 2 mNmrad− 1. The amplitude of the torque-angle characteristic can be tuned linearly with a sensitivity of 12. 63 mNmmm− 1 rad− 1. Further simulations have been computed parameterizing the geometry and the number of pole pairs of the magnets. The maximum torque density reached for one pole pair is 47. 21 · 103 Nm m− 3, whereas for a fixed geometry {{similar to that of the}} developed prototype, the maximum torque is reached for seven pole pairs.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, public {{awareness}} of the environmental, economic and social consequences of using fossil fuels has considerably grown. Moreover, not only the supply of fossil resources is limited, but also the environmental impact represents a relevant issue, so leading to an increased consideration of clean and renewable alternatives to traditional technologies. During recent years, the automotive industry has shown a growing interest in electric and hybrid electric vehicles. However, the transition to all-electric transportation is now limited by the high cost of the vehicles, the limited range and the long recharging time. Distributed IPT (inductive power transfer) systems can be the solution to the range restrictions of EVs by charging the vehicle while driving thanks to, a set of loosely coupled coils, so also reducing required battery size as well as overall cost of the vehicle. The concept of wireless power transfer via magnetic induction was introduced two decades ago. Nowadays, this technology is becoming more efficient and more suitable for new applications. This dissertation made an effort to address the requirements of IPT EV battery charging system with high efficiency and good tolerance to misalignment. A survey of a typical IPT for EV application has been reported, while a concentrated DD-BP solution has been proposed in order to enhance the IPT charging system capability of transferring power to a stationary EV with good efficiency and good tolerance to movement. The current trend in EV battery charging application is represented by the lamped coil system, whose different structures have been reviewed. Moreover, this thesis presented the design of a charging pad magnetic structure, called Double D pad combined with a Bipolar secondary pad, in order to enhance coupling performance.

40|$|Recent {{high power}} tests of x-band {{accelerating}} structures at SLAC {{have shown that}} their performance is limited by breakdowns in couplers. The behavior of these breakdowns {{is consistent with a}} model of pulsed heating due to high magnetic fields. The observed damage is located in the region of high magnetic fields. To calculate these magnetic fields, 3 D electrodynamics models of the couplers were built and matched. Coupler models were matched with an automated procedure that uses the commercial code HFSS. This matching procedure is based on calculation of reflection from the coupler cell using the electric field distribution on the axis of the structure. After matching, the magnetic and electric fields in the couplers were calculated for typical operation parameters. Highest magnetic fields on the order of 1 MA/m were found on sharp (� 80 micron radius) edges of the waveguide-to-coupler-cell irises.

40|$|The Seaformatics {{project is}} a five year AIF project that intends to develop {{wireless}} marine sensors for use in monitoring seabed processes. The sensor pods will be selfpowered through ocean bottom currents and {{will be able to}} communicate with each other This research is focused on development of a device to harvest energy from water currents near the ocean floor to power such seabed marine technologies. The research is very interdisciplinary in nature and involves design, structures, fluid dynamics, nonlinear control and power electronics, which makes it very challenging. A major outcome of the research is a robust small marine current energy conversion system that can extract power from the low marine current. A prototype was designed and constructed. It was tested in the towing tank in the Faculty of Engineering at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Power output was controlled using a DSP PI controller. The device consisted of a watertight hull. An electric generator was installed inside the hull and the turbine rotor was installed outside. The rotor of the device has blades like conventional wind turbines but the blades face forward into the flow and not perpendicular to it. This unique arrangement of the blades ensures high starting torque even in low currents. It used simple flat plate blades. A unique <b>magnetic</b> torque <b>coupler</b> was used to connect the generator to the turbine. This used sets of magnets inside and outside that repelled each other. Besides acting as a coupler, this arrangement of magnets also acted as a bearing. Ideally, it would have been good to use a generator designed specifically for the device but that would have been expensive and beyond the project budget so we used a commercial generator. To increase the rotational speed of this generator, a set of gears was inserted between the turbine and generator shafts. Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis and Potential Flow Hydrodynamics Theory were used to study the hydrodynamics of the rotor. This allowed us to explore geometry variations too expensive to study experimentally. For example, it showed that curved blades would give significantly more power than flat blades. This dissertation also presents an adaptive back stepping nonlinear maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control strategy for the system. Because of tow tank scheduling constraints, this was tested in simulation only. The proposed control strategy does not require any flow sensors and also does not need the parameters of a PMSG. A Lyapunov based online estimation approach is used to continually estimate the input voltage and the output load resistance of the converter. Detailed simulation results of the proposed adaptive back stepping control are presented and fully analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed nonlinear controller can incessantly extract maximum power from the ocean current at various flow speeds...|$|R
