ObjectiveTo study early-life food-related characteristics associated with child’s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> different foods at 5 y with a longitudinal study. Design 1142 5 y- old children completed a <b>liking</b> test <b>for</b> “fruit and vegetables”, “meat, fish and eggs”, desserts and cheese. Data related to maternal food intake before pregnancy, infant feeding {{during the first year}} of life, maternal feeding practices at 2 y, child’s food intake at 3 y, and child’s food neophobia from 1 to 4 y were collected prospectively from the mother. The associations between these factors and child‘s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> each category of foods were analyzed using structural equation modelling. ResultsHigh food neophobia at 4 y was related to lower child’s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> all food groups. Maternal feeding practices at 2 y were associated with <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> dessert: negatively for the practices allowing child to control his/her own food intake, positively for restriction of child’s food intake for weight reasons. Moreover, child’s food intake at 3 y was positively associated with child’s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> “fruit and vegetables” as well as for cheese. Finally, adherence to the infant feeding pattern “long breastfeeding, later introduction of main meal components and use of home-made products” was positively associated with child’s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> meat/fish/eggs. ConclusionsFor all food groups, food neophobia was a common determinant of child’s <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> food at 5 y, whereas other factors were associated with food <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> specific food groups...|$|R

5|$|Based on {{a decree}} by Emperor Francis II inflicting punishments on German {{subjects}} who {{collaborated with the}} French revolutionary government, Forster was declared an outlaw and placed under the Imperial ban; a prize of 100 ducats was set {{on his head and}} he could not return to Germany. Devoid of all means of making a living and without his wife, who had stayed in Mainz with their children and her later husband Ludwig Ferdinand Huber, he remained in Paris. At this point the revolution in Paris had entered the Reign of Terror introduced by the Committee of Public Safety under the rule of Maximilien Robespierre. Forster had the opportunity to experience the difference between the promises of the revolution of happiness for all and its cruel practice. In contrast to many other German supporters of the revolution, <b>like</b> <b>for</b> instance Friedrich Schiller, Forster did not turn back from his revolutionary ideals under the pressure of the terror. He viewed the events in France as a force of nature that could not be slowed and that had to release its own energies to avoid being even more destructive.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just <b>like</b> <b>for</b> the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E

The authors explored whether liking and experience with an RTD soft-drink base predicts <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> the RTD. Participants (N = 350) from ages 12 to 30 years sampled 3 RTDs and their respective soft-drink and alcoholic components. For milk- and fruit-based RTDs, <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> and familiarity with their soft-drink base was {{the best predictor of}} <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> and familiarity with the RTD itself.

40|$|Background: Food fussiness (FF) {{is common}} in early {{childhood}} and {{is often associated with}} the rejection of nutrient-dense foods such as vegetables and fruit. FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit are likely all heritable phenotypes; the genetic influence underlying FF may explain the observed genetic influence on <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit. Twin analyses make it possible to get a broad-based estimate of the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies these traits. Objective: We quantified the extent of the shared genetic influence that underlies FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit in early childhood {{with the use of a}} twin design. Design: Data were from the Gemini cohort, which is a populationbased sample of twins born in England and Wales in 2007. Parents of 3 -y-old twins (n = 1330 pairs) completed questionnaire measures of their children's food preferences (<b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit) and the FF scale from the Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Multivariate quantitative genetic modeling was used to estimate common genetic influences that underlie FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit. Results: Genetic correlations were significant and moderate to large in size between FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> both vegetables (20. 65) and fruit (20. 43), which indicated that a substantial proportion of the genes that influence FF also influence liking. Common genes that underlie FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> vegetables and fruit largely explained the observed phenotypic correlations between them (68 - 70 %). Conclusions: FF and <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> fruit and vegetables in young children share a large proportion of common genetic factors. The genetic influence on FF may determine why fussy children typically reject fruit and vegetables...|$|R

In September, they set sail from Glasgow aboard the RMS Empress of Russia; because the Mediterranean was controlled largely by enemy naval forces, {{they were forced to}} travel via the Cape of Good Hope, before taking shore leave in Durban. There, Wheeler visited the local kraals to compare them with the settlements of Iron Age Britain. The ship docked in Aden, where Wheeler and his men again took shore leave. They soon reached the British-controlled Suez, where they disembarked and were stationed on the shores of the Great Bitter Lake.

5|$|Wulfstan {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} and effective Old English prose writers. His writings cover a wide range of topics in an even greater range of genres, including homilies (or sermons), secular laws, religious canons, and political theory. With Ælfric of Eynsham, he is one of the two major vernacular writers in early eleventh-century England, a period which, ecclesiastically, was still very much enamoured of and greatly influenced by the Benedictine Reform. The Benedictine Reform was a movement which sought to institute monastic standards among the secular clergy, a movement made popular by the churchmen of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth and tenth centuries. The Reform promoted a regular (i.e. based on a regula, or rule) life for priests and clerics, a strict church hierarchy, the primacy of the Roman see, the authority of codified or canonical church law, and stressed the importance of catholic, that is universal, church practices throughout all Christendom. These ideas could only thrive in a social and political atmosphere which recognised the importance of both the clergy's and the laity's obedience to the authority of the church on all things spiritual, and also on many things secular and juridical. This {{was one of the}} main theoretical models behind much of Wulfstan's legal and quasi-legal writings. But Wulfstan was not blind to the fact that, in order for this Reform model to thrive in England, the English clergy and laity (especially the laity) needed to be educated in the basic tenets of the faith. Nothing less than the legitimacy of English Christendom rested on Englishmen's steadfastness on certain fundamental Christian beliefs and practices, <b>like,</b> <b>for</b> example, knowledge of Christ's life and passion, memorisation of the Pater Noster and the Apostles' Creed, proper baptism, and the correct date and method of celebrating Easter mass. It is towards the promotion of such beliefs and practices, that Wulfstan engaged in writing a number of homilies dedicated to educating both clergy and laity in those Christian fundamentals which he saw as so important for both the flourishing of Christian lives and the success of the English polity.|$|E

We found that consumers' expectations of <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> the food generated by the appearance of the cooked product was related to expectation of liking from viewing the raw product. Under some conditions, consumers liked a food less after consumption if a raw product that generated low expectation of liking had been presented beforehand. There was no evidence that private body consciousness modified the consumers' susceptibility to expectation effects. It was concluded that expectations of <b>liking</b> <b>for</b> a food generated by appearance both when raw and cooked influenced final evaluation of the product during consumption.
