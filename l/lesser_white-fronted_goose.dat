5|$|The {{number of}} ducks, geese and swans is {{greatest}} in winter, with large flocks of greater white-fronted geese, sometimes {{with a rare}} <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> amongst them. Bewick's swans are a feature of Slimbridge in winter, arriving from northern Russia to enjoy the milder climate of southern England. Their behaviour has been studied intensively at Slimbridge. Birds of prey such as peregrine and merlin also visit the centre in the winter, as well as wading birds and some woodland birds, {{and it is a}} good place to see the elusive water rail.|$|E

25|$|Waterfowl which {{breed in}} or pass through Kaziranga include several rare species of geese (<b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose),</b> and ducks (ferruginous pochard, Baer's pochard). Other rare {{riverine}} birds include kingfishers (Blyth's kingfisher), herons (white-bellied heron), pelicans (Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican), shanks (spotted greenshank) and terns (black-bellied tern). Rare migratory storks and cranes are also seen wintering {{in the park}} (lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, Asian openbill).|$|E

40|$|The {{species of}} {{waterfowl}} breeding in North America have distribution patterns that collectively reflect the past geologic and ecological histories of this continent. In general, our waterfowl species {{may be grouped}} into those that are limited (endemic) to North America, those that are shared between North and South America, {{and those that are}} shared with Europe and/or Asia. Of the forty-four species known to breed in continental North America, the resulting grouping of breeding distributions is as follows: Limited to North America: Snow goose (also on Greenland and Wrangel Island), Ross goose, Canada goose (also on Greenland), wood duck, American wigeon, black duck, blue-winged teal, redhead, canvasback, ringnecked duck, lesser scaup, Labrador duck (extinct), surf scoter, bufflehead, hooded merganser. Shared with Eurasia: Trumpeter swan (whooper swan), whistling swan (Bewick swan), <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> brant goose, gadwall, green-winged teal, mallard, pintail, shoveler, greater scaup, common eider, king eider, harlequin duck, oldsquaw, black scoter, white-winged scoter, common goldeneye, red-breasted merganser, common merganser. Shared with South America: Fulvous whistling duck, black-bellied whistling duck, muscovy duck, cinnamon teal, masked duck, ruddy duck. Shared with Asia only: Emperor goose, spectacled eider, Steller eider (rarely to Norway). Shared with Europe only: Barrow goldeneye (Iceland and Greenland). Native to Eurasia, introduced into North America: Mute swan. It is thus clear that the strongest zoogeographic affinities of our waterfowl are with Europe and Asia, since twenty-three out of the forty-four native North American species have. populations shared with one or both of these areas. Only six species are shared with South America, and, of these, the fulvous whistling duck has a more general tropical distribution that includes Africa and southern Asia. Consequently, it would appear that South America has played only a minor role in providing waterfowl stock for North America, and vice versa. Certainly the great number of waterfowl species shared between the North American and Eurasian landmasses can be largely attributed to Pleistocene and post-Pleistocene history. Ploeger (1968) analyzed the distributions of eighteen species of arctic-breeding Anatidae and concluded that both their present distributions and their described geographic variations could be at· tributed to the physical-geographical situation existing in the Northern Hemisphere during Late Glacial times. Only a minority (38 percent) of these species exhibit noticeable geographic variation, and most of the eighteen have breeding ranges that include both North America and Eurasia. The exceptions are three Eurasian geese (red-breasted, bean, and <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese),</b> three North American geese (Canada, Ross, and snow geese), and the North Atlantic barnacle goose. It is of interest that these are all geese, a group noted for their strongly traditional wintering and breeding grounds, as opposed to the less tradition-bound ducks...|$|R
25|$|Northern Ponds is {{a series}} of naturalistic ponds home to a variety of {{waterfowl}} and other aquatic birds both wild and captive. Captive residents include black-necked crane, red-breasted goose, <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose,</b> American ruddy duck, barnacle goose, and trumpeter swan. A wide variety of wild bird species can also be found in the ponds, including several native ducks such as mallards and mergansers, as well as other birds such as black-capped night-herons.|$|E

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> is {{considered}} an endangered species, but there are programmes to reintroduce animals into the wild to strengthen the population.

To provide information on the distribution and abundance of the two species in Greenland during the prelude to the autumn migration back to winter quarters, we here report on the first ever post-moult aerial surveys of West Greenland between 64 ° and 73 °N (from regular transects and transit reconnaissance flights in August 2007), which located 1888 Greenland <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese</b> and 6071 Canada geese.

5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser erythropus) is a goose {{closely related}} to the larger white-fronted goose (A. albifrons). It breeds in northernmost Asia, but it is a scarce breeder in Europe. There is a re-introduction scheme in Fennoscandia. The {{scientific}} name comes from anser, the Latin for [...] "goose", and erythropus, [...] "red-footed", derived from the old Greek eruthros [...] "red" [...] and pous [...] "foot".|$|E
50|$|Barak Kol is an {{important}} wetland for migrating geese, specifically Anser anser, the greylag goose, and Anser erythropus, the <b>lesser</b> <b>white-fronted</b> <b>goose.</b> The lake is approximately 3.5 km wide and 4 km long.

50|$|Weather {{conditions}} {{are a key}} factor in the annual breeding success of <b>white-fronted</b> <b>geese.</b> In the Arctic, the window of opportunity for nesting, incubating eggs, and raising a brood to flight state is open briefly, for about three months.

This means that a delayed snowmelt or late spring storm can significantly reduce the birds' reproductive success.|$|R
