25|$|The first green Routemasters, {{apart from}} {{prototype}} CRL4, now RMC4, were 69 RMCs (Routemaster Coach) for Green <b>Line</b> <b>work.</b> These {{were the same}} length as the RMs but had luxury seating, luggage racks, strip lights and platform doors. The later 43 RCLs (Routemaster Coach Lengthened) were the same length as the RMLs but again with coach seating and platform doors.|$|E
40|$|Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are {{computer}} systems, which store, {{display and}} analyse spatial data. Scanning the map {{is one way}} to input data into a GIS system. But many maps, such as the soil map, contain a large amount of additional information such as characters, <b>line</b> <b>works</b> and the contours between regions, which can be considered as noises in the maps. In this project, some techniques are developed to eliminate the noises from the maps. And a new algorithm called moving window algorithm is developed to eliminate the contours and <b>line</b> <b>works</b> according to the different characteristics between the noises and soil type. The system was implemented by JAVA language. As a result, around 95 % of the <b>line</b> <b>works</b> and characters are eliminated correctly while less than 5 % of the soil is mis-deleted...|$|R

The desire for automated workflow in companies is intended to reduce costs and support the company at the operational level.|$|E

25|$|A {{proposal}} {{to upgrade the}} Mark II to a Mark IIA was put forward in 1974. The upgrade {{would have been to}} a 100ft circular aperture which could have been used on wavelengths down to 6mm, which would have enabled it to be used as part of the high-frequency component of the original MERLIN array. It was also planned that the telescope would be used for spectral <b>line</b> <b>work</b> at millimeter wavelengths. However, the upgrade was never approved.|$|E

25|$|The Pennsylvania and Newark Railroad was {{incorporated}} in 1905 {{to build a}} low-grade line from Morrisville, Pennsylvania to Colonia, New Jersey. It was never completed, but some work {{was done in the}} Trenton area, including bridge piers in the Delaware River. North of Colonia, the alignment was going to be separate, but instead two extra tracks were added to the existing <b>line.</b> <b>Work</b> was suspended in 1916. Another low-grade line across the mountains of Pennsylvania, to avoid the congestion of Pittsburgh, was contemplated but never built.|$|E
25|$|In September 1960, the quadruplication {{project was}} {{suspended}} {{on the northern}} <b>line.</b> <b>Work</b> continued between Roma Street and Corinda as the signalling contract had been already let. The northern line stations of Nundah and Toombul were constructed within this time frame, and Eagle Junction shortly after. The quadruplicated Corinda to Roma Street line opened on 1 December 1963, providing greater flexibility {{in the provision of}} peak hour suburban services and allowing the passage of long distance goods and livestock trains which travelled through these suburban networks to the main western line.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, on a {{visit to}} England, Hills became fascinated by {{miniature}} paintings on ivory. She taught herself the painstaking technique and by 1893 had completed a series of miniature portraits of girls from her hometown. These Seven Pretty Girls of Newburyport, which launched her on a decades-long career as a miniature portrait painter, are now {{in the collection of the}} Boston Museum of Fine Arts along with other of her miniature paintings. She was considered one of the best miniature painters in America and something of an innovator in the medium, especially in her use of broad paint handling, bright colors, and <b>line</b> <b>work</b> in place of traditional stippling.|$|E

He also praised the plotlines, writing that [...] "what made this episode so great was {{that not only did}} every plot <b>line</b> <b>work</b> ... but every moment positively sang".

500|$|The show's color {{has been}} {{described}} by Karacas as {{a major part of the}} visuals; inspirations included Paul Klee and Katsuhiro Otomo, as well as the concept of fluorescence. The team wanted to create [...] "a bold, fresh look" [...] that reflected the universe, and so they chose to be minimal with their palette to attract attention to the <b>line</b> <b>work.</b> In addition, they eschewed the use of vivid primary colors and instead chose more secondary colors. However, they took to accentuate the scenes with [...] "pop colors" [...] that mimic the glow of neon lighting, and lastly they added vertical reflections to the floors and grunge textures to the backgrounds.|$|E

Soule's evolution of her powers and costume will hopefully also coincide with further opportunities later in the story to learn more about her views on the resistance and reasons for supporting Attilan – solidifying this version of Kamala as a comparatively matured hero forced to make difficult moral choices." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the album, DOOM uses {{a number}} of {{literary}} devices, including multi-syllable rhymes, internal rhymes, alliteration, assonance, and holorimes. Music critics also noted extensive use of wordplay and double entendres. PopMatters wrote, [...] "You can spend hours poring over the lyric sheet and attempting to grok Doom’s infinitely dense verbiage. If language is arbitrary, then many of Doom’s verses exploit the essence of words stripped of meaning, random conglomerations of syllables assembled in an order that only makes sense from a rhythmical standpoint", the critic added. The Observer stated that [...] "the densely telegraphic lyrics almost always reward closer inspection" [...] and that DOOM's [...] "rhymes miss beats, drop {{into the middle of}} the next <b>line,</b> <b>work</b> their way through whole verses" [...] allows for a smooth listen.|$|E
