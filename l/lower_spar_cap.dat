40|$|Surface heating {{rates and}} surface {{temperatures}} for {{a space shuttle}} reentry profile were calculated for two wing cross sections and one fuselage cross section. Heating rates and temperatures at 12 locations on the wing and 6 locations on the fuselage are presented. The heating on the lower wing was most severe, with peak temperatures reaching values of 1240 C for turbulent flow and 900 C for laminar flow. For the fuselage, the most severe heating occured on the lower glove surface where peak temperatures of 910 C and 700 C were calculated for turbulent flow and laminar flow, respectively. Aluminum structural temperatures were calculated using a finite difference thermal analyzer computer program, and the predicted temperatures are compared to measured flight data. Skin temperatures measured on the lower surface of the wing and bay 1 of the upper surface of the wing agreed best with temperatures calculated assuming laminar flow. The measured temperatures at bays two and four on the upper surface of the wing were in quite good agreement with the temperatures calculated assuming separated flow.

40|$|The {{buckling}} {{resistance is}} a key design driver for large wind turbine blades with a significant influence on the material costs. During the structural design process the choice was made for carbon <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and two shear webs, which were set relatively far apart in order to stabilize the panels. This design presented a major challenge for {{the stability of the}} <b>spar</b> <b>caps.</b> The topology of these <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> has been modified with regard to stability, comparing a continuous <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> with split <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> concepts and considering both lay-ups with hybrid carbon glass <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> or sandwich concepts. Within those concepts, parametric studies were conducted varying different geometrical parameters of the <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and its layups. In order to determine the buckling resistance of the <b>spar</b> <b>cap,</b> an analytical model considering a 2 D cross section discretized blade model was utilized to select the basic concept, after which a 3 D numerical finite element model taking the whole blade into account was used to evaluate the chosen design concepts. The stability limit state analysis was conducted according to the certification scheme of GL guideline 2012. The various concepts were evaluated based on the blade's mass, tip deflection and modal properties. The results of this design process of the <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and the evaluation of the used analysis tools are presented within the paper...|$|R

50|$|The modern lateen {{is often}} used as a simple rig for catboats and other small {{recreational}} sailing craft. In its most basic form, it requires only two lines, a halyard and a sheet, making it very simple to operate. Often, additional lines are used to pull down the <b>lower</b> <b>spar</b> and provide tension along the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>spars,</b> providing greater control over the sail shape.|$|R
50|$|The modern lateen {{differs from}} {{traditional}} loose-footed lateens {{by the addition}} of a spar along the foot of the sail, similar to the crab claw sail traditionally used on the proa. The <b>lower</b> <b>spar</b> is horizontal, and is attached to the mast where it crosses. The front ends of both spars are joined together. Both joints are designed to allow free rotation in all directions. The sheet is attached to the <b>lower</b> <b>spar,</b> and the halyard to the upper spar. The geometry of the sail is such that the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>spars</b> are confined to a plane parallel to the mast. This results in the sail forming a conic section, identical to half of the Rogallo wing commonly found in kites and hang gliders.|$|R

40|$|Improving {{wind turbine}} blades via bend-twist {{coupling}} confronts two difficult challenges. The first is that off-axis fiber for the major structure is difficult to fabricate. Suitable fabrics with the primary fiber ~ 20 degrees off-axis are not commonplace and may present dimensional stability problems when handled, due to a tendency to shear when tensioned along their long dimension. These are ultimately cost issues. The second category of challenges is {{in the area of}} possible fatigue limits due to ending or curving angled fibers. <b>Spar</b> <b>caps</b> with angled fibers must either end those fibers at the edge or have them carry around a web type structure. Either approach implies additional stresses in the resin system binding the fibers and may lead to lowered fatigue allowables for design. The vision driving this work was to look at the possibility of using novel planform and structural combinations to provide response similar to classical bend twist coupling, but without the use of off-axis lay-up in the structure. Sweep distributed along the span is used to create a moment that induces twist, and airfoil thickness reduction via carbon fiber <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> is used to increase twist response to the induced moment. If a suitable magnitude of twist response can be shown using this approach, then the blade structure might be fabricated much as it is now, without off-axis <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> fiber, and the benefits of bend twist coupling could still be obtained...|$|R

This work presents a combined hydrodynamic-structuraldesign methodology for a commercial scale (1. 5 MW) tidal turbine. A hydrodynamic analysis of theblade is carried out to determine force distributions along the blade span under normal and extremeoperating conditions. Using output from the hydrodynamic model, a pre-processor for computing bladestructural properties is used to determine the strain distribution along the blade <b>spar</b> <b>caps.</b> The straindistributions from this analysis are then compared with a finite element model of the blade which is thenused to compare the structural performance of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) and carbon fibrereinforced polymer (CFRP) as <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> materials...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{structural}} fatigue performance of an adhesive joint, imitating {{the connection of}} the shear web to the <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> of a wind turbine blade, is investigated. An asymmetric three point bending test has been developed from early design steps to manufacturing and testing. The sub-component is supposed to fail in the bondline, behavior consistently validated after a comprehensive testing campaign. Similar failure patterns to the full scale wind turbine blades have been observed in the bond line during the fatigue tests. Tensile cracks propagated transverse to the adhesive longitudinal axis, approximately at 10 % of the total lifetime. Their growth was hindered from the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> and web laminate. After around 60 % of the specimen life, cracks changed their direction resulting in disbonds between the adhesive-adherend interface.

In summary, these findings indicate that the conventional structural layout of a wind turbine blade is suboptimal under the static load conditions, suggesting an opportunity to reduce blade weight and cost...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the development of an optimization methodology for the composite materials used in wind turbine blades. Goal of the approach is to guide designers in the selection of the different materials of the blade, while providing indications to composite manufacturers on optimal trade-offs between mechanical properties and material costs. The method works by using a parametric material model, and including its free parameters amongst the design variables of a multi-disciplinary wind turbine optimization procedure. The proposed method is tested on the structural redesign of a conceptual 10 MW wind turbine blade, its <b>spar</b> <b>caps</b> and shell skin laminates being subjected to optimization. The procedure identifies a blade optimum for a new <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> laminate characterized by a higher longitudinal Young's modulus and higher cost than the initial one, which however in turn induce both cost and mass savings in the blade. In terms of shell skin, the adoption of a laminate with intermediate properties between a bi-axial one and a tri-axial one also leads to slight structural improvements...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{sensitivity}} of the structural integrity of wind turbine blades to debonding of the shear web from the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> was investigated. In this regard, modal analysis, static and fatigue testing were performed on a 45. 7 m blade for three states of the blade: (i) as received blade (ii) when a crack of 200 mm was introduced between the web and the <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> and (iii) when the crack was extended to 1000 mm. Calibration pull-tests for all three states of the blade were performed to obtain the strain-bending moment relationship of the blade according to the estimated target bending moment (BM) which the blade is expected to experience in its service life. The resultant data was used to apply appropriate load in the fatigue tests. The blade natural frequencies in flapwise and edgewise directions over a range of frequency domain were found by modal testing for all three states of the blade. The blade first natural frequency for each state was used for the flapwise fatigue tests. These were performed in accordance with technical specification IEC TS 61400 - 23. The fatigue results showed that, for a 200 mm crack between the web and <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> at 9 m from the blade root, the crack did not propagate at 50 % of the target BM up to 62, 110 cycles. However, when the load was increased to 70 % of target BM, some damages were detected on the pressure side of the blade. When the 200 mm crack was extended to 1000 mm, the crack began to propagate when the applied load exceeded 100 % of target BM and the blade experienced delaminations, adhesive joint failure, compression failure and sandwich core failure...|$|R

The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon <b>spar</b> <b>cap</b> to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the outboard portion of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads.

The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain gages as well as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life.
