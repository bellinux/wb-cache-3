25|$|From the presbytery two lateral painted doors {{provide access}} to the sacristy and the archive room (to {{the right and left}} of the altar, respectively). The sacristy is small and its walls painted white, with a painted chest, topped with painted {{backrest}} (laterally and frontally decorated with floral motifs and drapery). In the archive room, to the left, is a wardrobe (interiorly divided in two) with painted motifs, while between pillars is a rectangular <b>lavabo</b> with an arch of ashlar and double frieze below. The <b>lavabo</b> has a convex base and faucett, and is decorated with florians and surmounted by pinnacles.|$|E

25|$|Symbolic hand washing, using {{water but}} no soap to wash hands, {{is a part}} of ritual hand washing {{featured}} in many religions, including Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, and tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism.

50|$|The cloister of {{a monastery}} was {{supposed}} to be a replica of the Garden of Eden, protected from the outside world. Simple fountains, called <b>lavabos,</b> were placed inside Medieval monasteries such as Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence and were used for ritual washing before religious services.|$|R
50|$|The {{forecourt}} {{leads to}} the cloister, which has 18 arches. Under one of the arches {{on the north side}} there are two Roman sarcophagi that the canons once used as <b>lavabos.</b> The sarcophagi are one above the other, with the upper one being decorated, and the lower one plain. Water flowed from the upper to the lower, and then out a channel to the cloister garden.|$|R
25|$|Art {{historian}} Penny Jolly {{suggests that}} {{in the mid to}} late 1420s Jan may have traveled to Italy {{at the behest of the}} Duke of Burgundy where, in Florence, he probably saw an iconic 14th century annunciation, and perhaps visited more contemporary annunciation scenes. The Florentine annunciations have a number of iconographic similarities to the Ghent panels, including Gabriel's multi-colored wings, the upside down writing, the treatment of light beams, and the separation between angel and virgin by a thin architectural feature. Some of these elements, particularly the spatial separation between the two figures, can be found in Lorenzo Monaco's Bartolini Salimbeni Annunciation in Santa Trinita, finished before his death in 1424, and one that Jan may have seen. In Monaco's painting the angel and Mary are separated by two small spaces, one external and one internal, similar to the city-scape and domestic <b>lavabo</b> panels in the Ghent annunciation.|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{are confronted}} by the still-impressive west front, with a wide central doorway, surmounted by a round arch. This western end was {{finished}} comparatively late, in the 13th century, and the round arch of the doorway is meant to complement the earlier work visible through the portal. The massive stonework on either side originally carried {{the weight of a}} great western tower, probably destroyed in the siege, along with the west window. The northern base has suffered least and still has arcading {{at the level of the}} vanished window sill, decorated in a trefoil pattern. The pointed gothic arches of its windows contrast sharply with the late romanesque gateway. Moving through the gateway, it is possible to climb a narrow staircase on the north wall of the nave to the level of the arcade, thus obtaining a good view of the remains of the church and of the landscape beyond. There is a small, well-preserved <b>lavabo</b> on the southern wall of the nave.|$|E
500|$|Dacre Castle is a moated tower {{house in}} the village of Dacre, [...] {{south-west}} of Penrith, Cumbria. It was constructed in the mid-14th century, probably by Margaret Multon, against the background of the threat of Scottish invasion and raids, and was held in the Dacre family until the 17th century. The tower house is [...] tall, built out of local sandstone, topped by crenellations, with four turrets protruding from a central block, and includes an ornate <b>lavabo</b> in the main hall. Renovated during the 1670s and 1960s after periods of disrepair, the castle is now used as a private home.|$|E
50|$|He {{carried on}} the {{production}} of the enamelled reliefs on a much larger scale than his uncle had ever done; he also extended its application to various architectural uses, such as friezes and to the making of <b>lavabos,</b> fountains and large retables. One variety of method was introduced in his enamelled work. Sometimes he omitted the enamel on the face and hands of his figures, especially in those cases where he had treated the heads in a realistic manner; as, for example, in the tympanum relief of the meeting of St Domenic and St Francis in the loggia of the Florentine hospital of San Paolo, a design suggested by a fresco of Fra Angelico's in the cloister of St Mark's.|$|R
500|$|The {{ground floor}} of the central block {{contains}} two vaulted chambers and the first-floor forms a hall containing an ornate <b>lavabo,</b> with smaller chambers in the turrets. The second floor similarly forms a single large chamber, [...] high, with rooms {{in each of the}} adjacent turrets, and is traditionally called the [...] "Room of the Three Kings", after the legend described by William of Malmesbury. In the 14th century, these large chambers would have been subdivided into smaller rooms. The renovations in the 1960s uncovered a possible priest hole behind the fireplace in the Room of the Three Kings, [...] by this chamber was re-sealed to avoid the cost of restoring it.|$|E
2500|$|An elegant portal, with sculptures by the Mantegazza {{brothers}} and Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, leads {{from the church}} to the Small Cloister (in Italian: Chiostro Piccolo.) This has a small garden in the center. The most striking feature is the terracotta decoration of the small pilasters, executed by Rinaldo de Stauris between 1463 and 1478. Some arcades are decorated by frescoes by Daniele Crespi, now partially ruined. Also noteworthy is the late-14th century <b>lavabo</b> in stone and terracotta, with scenes of the Jesus with the Woman of Samaria at the Well.|$|E
