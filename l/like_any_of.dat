500|$|In their May 2004 issue, the US Army {{publication}} The Preventive Maintenance Monthly, which instructs {{soldiers on}} how to maintain their equipment, featured a spoof comic based on Harry Potter, featuring a character named Topper who resided at Mogmarts School under Professor Rumbledore. The publication received notice from Rowling's lawyers that the comics breached copyright, though the magazine's editor, Ken Crunk, claimed that no violation had taken place, as [...] "he drawings do not look <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the characters from Harry Potter". After a discussion with Rowling's representatives, the magazine agreed {{not to use the}} characters again.|$|E

He is told to interrogate her, and then kill her. Meanwhile, Peter introduces Jessup to their lab at Harvard, and upon performing an autopsy on the man found in the apartment, they find three holes in {{the roof of his}} mouth. Walter shows them archived footage of one of his 1970s experiments of a drugged up girl who says she sees shapechanging soldiers from an parallel universe that can [...] "look <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> us".|$|E

[...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. It would be great to be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them saw me." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to [...] "It's Not the End of the World?" [...] was generally mixed. Website Drowned in Sound described the song as [...] "sweet and charming" [...] but stated that, {{although it is}} a good album track it isn't strong enough to stand up on its own as a single and is rather [...] "bland" [...] compared to some of the band's other songs such as [...] "Demons" [...] and [...] "Fire in My Heart". The NME called the song [...] "a bit rubbish" [...] by the Super Furries' [...] "usual high standards" [...] and went as far as to claim that [...] "John Lennon was shot for less". The Dallas Observer claimed the track is [...] "guaranteed to induce the same type of melancholic, goose-bumpy splendor that tunes like The Kinks' 'Waterloo Sunset', Dennis Wilson's 'Forever' and Jack Bruce's 'Theme for an Imaginary Western' still do", Entertainment Weekly described it {{as one of the best}} songs on parent album Rings Around the World, comparing it to the work of The Beatles while The Daily Telegraph called it a [...] "honey-dripping pop classic". PopMatters claimed the track [...] "sounds <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> Blur's best ballads".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Forcella noted [...] "It has been four episodes now since the super team {{returned}} from Florida, and The Office still hasn't found its footing back in Scranton", {{and he called}} the outing [...] "another lackluster effort". [...] A review from CliqueClack was largely critical of the episode, calling it [...] "worse than usual" [...] and noting that the show had finally hit [...] "rock bottom". WhatCulture! Reviewer Joseph Kratzer felt that the episode's setting—outside of the office building—was detrimental to the episode. He wrote, [...] "The thing is, I in no way felt <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> what occurred in 'Fundraiser' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that’s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode – because the story couldn't function without it. But this time it just felt like a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring, uninspired, weak episode of television." [...] Screen Crave wrote, [...] "Those viewers of The Office that have scolded the show throughout the season for its varying degrees of sucking, {{are not likely to}} be changing their thinking after watching the latest episode." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{wished to}} set the film in a field he {{understood}} and opted for broadcast journalism. After talking with network journalists at the 1984 Republican National Convention, Brooks realised it had [...] "changed so much since I had been near it", and so [...] "did {{about a year and}} a half of solid research," [...] into the industry. When he began writing the screenplay, Brooks felt he [...] "didn't <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the three [...] characters", but decided not to change them and after two months had reversed his original opinion. Brooks stated that this also happens to the audience: [...] "You're always supposed to arc your characters and you have this change and that's your dramatic purpose. But what I hope happens in this film is that the audience takes part in the arc. So what happens is that the movie doesn't select its own hero. It plays differently with each audience. The audience helps create the experience, depending on which character they hook onto." [...] He did not decide on the ending of the film until the rest of it had been completed. Brooks was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay for Broadcast News. At the 38th Berlin International Film Festival, the film was nominated for the Golden Bear and Holly Hunter won the Silver Bear for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do {{you guys want to}} go on tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why she {{thought it would be a}} good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E
500|$|Bostic's {{physical}} {{style of play}} was respected by his peers: Lester Hayes said Raider tight end Todd Christensen is the best receiving tight end and that [...] "The only guy I've ever seen cover Todd is my son, Keith Bostic...Bostic's the only guy I've ever seen pulverize him. I mean he really pulverized him. I call Bostic and Frank Minnifield (Cleveland cornerback) my sons, my sons of dirt." [...] Hayes meant that Bostic and Minnifield played a {{physical style}}, just like Hayes. [...] Bostic {{is known as a}} big hitter blessed with athletic ability. [...] He combined strength and speed to play his physical style according to Ozzie Newsome: [...] "He's as strong as any linebacker and can run <b>like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the guys on the corner." [...] Bostic earned the nickname [...] "Batman" [...] for his style of play. [...] Instead of instructing his team to elect captains, Glanville instructed his team to [...] "...pick the three toughest guys. If somebody throws a grenade into a room, they're the ones who'll jump on it." [...] Bostic was the player chosen from the Oilers' defense. [...] Although much is made of his strength and toughness, it should also be mentioned that he once collared Tony Dorsett from behind in a footrace. [...] At one point in Bostic's career, while Glanville was still defensive coordinator, the Oilers considered moving him to cornerback because of his speed.|$|E

500|$|To prepare {{herself for}} the role of Rufus, Nancy Cartwright, best known for her long-running voice work as Bart Simpson on The Simpsons, {{researched}} naked mole rats extensively to the point of which she became [...] "a font of useless trivia" [...] and knowledge. Cartwright cites Rufus among her two most difficult characters to voice due to the constant use of her diaphragm required to produce 18 mole rat sound effects. Her performance earned her a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program. John DiMaggio was cast as Drakken based on his vocal performance as Bender on the animated sitcom Futurama. The creators mused, [...] "Drakken is as funny as he is because of how funny John is. <b>Like</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the great voiceover guys, he can do multiple voices. He also just has a terrific comedic sense", while director and animator Steve Loter described both Friedle and DiMaggio as [...] "experts in ad-libbing." [...] Schooley and McCorkle had previously worked with Nicole Sullivan on Buzz Lightyear of Star Command and thus created the role of Shego with her in mind. Sullivan's first recording session opposite DiMaggio established a chemistry between the two voice actors and their respective characters, out of which Shego's signature sarcasm was introduced and eventually expanded upon. During the show's inaugural season, the actors generally recorded separate from each other, but Friedle, DiMaggio and Sullivan experienced opportunities to record together during the second season. Having been attending high school in New York at the time, Romano would mostly work remotely and usually be [...] "phone patched in" [...] whenever necessary; there is only one occasion during which the entire main cast recorded together.|$|E

2500|$|However, Milchan {{supported}} Hanson's casting {{decisions and}} this gave the director {{the confidence to}} approach Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and Kevin Spacey.
