25|$|Network {{capacity}} – According to Gerry/Gerald Butters, {{the former}} head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, there is another version, called Butters' Law of Photonics, a formulation that deliberately parallels Moore's law. Butters' <b>law</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the amount of data coming out of an optical fiber is doubling every nine months. Thus, the cost of transmitting a bit over an optical network decreases by half every nine months. The availability of wavelength-division multiplexing (sometimes called WDM) increased the capacity that could be placed on a single fiber by as much as a factor of 100. Optical networking and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) is rapidly bringing down the cost of networking, and further progress seems assured. As a result, the wholesale price of data traffic collapsed in the dot-com bubble. Nielsen's <b>Law</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> the bandwidth available to users increases by 50% annually.|$|E

They tell Marty: [...] "You've got to go by the law. The <b>law</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> a man that pays money for a dog owns that dog." [...] At odds with this philosophy, Marty strongly believes that love—not money—should determine ownership.|$|E

5000|$|This {{does not}} answer whether it is just or unjust for Socrates {{to escape from the}} prison, so Socrates asks what the <b>Laws</b> would <b>say</b> about his leaving. Socrates claims <b>that</b> the <b>Laws</b> would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he destroys the city in leaving, and that this would be unjust. The <b>Laws</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> a citizen stands in {{relation}} to the city as the child does to the parent, as the slave does to his master.|$|R

500|$|Polish <b>law</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> {{treating}} the national symbols, including the flag, [...] "with reverence and respect" [...] is the [...] "right and obligation" [...] of every Polish citizen and all state organs, institutions and organizations. Public disrespect, destruction or intentional {{removal of the}} flag is considered a crime punishable by a fine, penal servitude or up to one year of imprisonment. Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare: 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0.001% of all crimes registered in Poland in those years. Other, unspecified violation of regulations on the Polish flag is an infraction, punishable by a fine or up to one month imprisonment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{institutions}} {{and practices of}} canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern civil law and common law (canon law having a significant effect upon {{the development of the}} system of equity in England) bear the influences of canon law. [...] Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon <b>law,</b> <b>says</b> <b>that</b> canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.|$|E
2500|$|Open source {{development}} allows {{anyone to}} examine source code. A {{school of thought}} popularized by Eric S.

This assertion has been disputed, however: computer security specialist Elias Levy wrote that [...] "it is easy to hide vulnerabilities in complex, little understood and undocumented source code," [...] because, [...] "even if people are reviewing the code, that doesn't mean they're qualified to do so." [...] An example of this actually happening, accidentally, was the 2008 OpenSSL vulnerability in Debian.|$|E
