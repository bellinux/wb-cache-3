50|$|Part of {{a railway}} {{signaling}} system, a slide fence is a fence whose {{purpose is to}} prevent trains from being derailed by <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> in mountainous areas where <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> may occur without warning. The fence {{is designed to be}} displaced by a <b>rock</b> <b>slide,</b> causing the signaling system to display a stop aspect on nearby signals. As an alternative, a structural fence is designed to physically stop falling rocks from reaching the tracks.|$|R
40|$|The present Bachelor {{thesis is}} written about a <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> {{which took place}} in the {{southern}} part of Stockholm in the early 2000 s. The studied area is located relatively close to a steeply-dipping fault with NW-SE orientation. The field work was carried out by four students, with me and other student focussing on the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> slope and two scan lines N and E of the <b>rock</b> <b>slide.</b> The geological structures, which were assumed to be responsible for the <b>rock</b> <b>slide,</b> have been studied carefully during surface mapping. The data was analysed using two rock mass classifications and stereographic projection. Additionally, a digital elevation map of the area was analysed in terms of slope angle distributions using GIS. It was shown that the orientation of discontinuities at the site coincides with the direction of the cutting work. Thus, the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> was unavoidable since the cutting work was carried out subparallel to the fractures main orientation. ...|$|R

30|$|A {{landslide}} inventory map, consisting 595 landslides, {{was prepared}} from field observations and Google earth {{images of the}} study area (Figure  2). Landslides in the area include <b>rock</b> <b>slides,</b> <b>rock</b> falls, debris <b>slide</b> and mudflow. According to Ayalew and Yamagishi (2004) rock falls exist as discernible block topples and wedge failures along the mountains, valley walls and road cuts. Similarly, <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> are also abundant on the ridge sides and valley walls. The intensity of landslides is generally high in the upper catchments of Bechet and Muga valleys and on the road cut near GohaTsiyon town.|$|R
50|$|When a train {{approaches}} a slide fence area, and the signal displays a stop aspect, {{the train is}} not permitted to proceed normally, because a <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> has occurred. However, the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> may not prevent the safe passage of the train. For example, a large rock may have fallen off the cliff, broken through the slide fence, and continued to fall away from the track. After stopping, the train may obtain radio permission from the dispatch center to proceed slowly, watching for a dangerous <b>rock</b> <b>slide.</b> If the train is able to successfully pass through the slide area (that is, there is no danger), it may then be allowed to proceed normally.|$|R
25|$|Mokattam {{village is}} {{situated}} {{at the foot of}} the Mokattam mountains, which has proven to be a precarious geographic location. In 1993, there was a rockslide from Mokattam Mountain, which fell near the bordering area of the Zabbaleen settlement, resulting in the deaths of 40 people. More recently, in 2008, another <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> from the Mokattam hills killed more than 100 people in El-Duweiqa, another shantytown in the Mokattam district. These <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> have brought attention to the precarious location of shantytowns located below the Mokattam mountains as well as to the Zabbaleen. Some attribute these frequent <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> to various development and construction activities on Mokattam Mountain's upper plateau on which the upper middle class residential district of Mokattam City is located.|$|R
50|$|With {{increasing}} {{populations in}} rural areas around the world, the hazards presented by potential <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> are becoming more of a pressing issue moving forward. Luckily, individuals {{working in the fields}} of geologic science and engineering continue to perfect methods of <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> detection, assessment, and warning. New earth observation tools have supplied a much enhanced ability to detect potential <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> hazards. Analysis of sequential InSAR and LiDAR data provides a very valuable regional view of slope movement. Once susceptible areas are discovered, detailed analysis can be carried out at the specific site. These assessments are used to determine the amount of material that will be released as well as the speed at which this material will be transported.|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> tsunami hazard {{is applied to}} all Norwegian lakes larger than 0. 1 km 2 based on their topographical setting. The analysis results in a topographic <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> potential score that indicates the relative hazard in each lake. Even though the score value each lake receives should be interpreted with caution, the distribution of score values shows {{that we are able}} to make a clear distinction between lakes with a high vs. lakes with a low hazard. The results also show a clustering of threatened lakes in parts of Western Norway as well as some locations in Northern Norway. This makes the results useful as a tool for focusing further studies on regions or specific lakes that received high scores. The results also show how the method may be used for more detailed analysis of a given lake (or fjord). Maps can be produced that may serve as a guide when carrying out field campaigns or when designing scenarios for numerical simulations of tsunamis in the lake. It should be emphasised that the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> potential reported for each lake is based on the topographical setting alone and hence, does not represent the actual probability of <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> into the lakes. For a given area, more detailed investigations of the geology, triggering factors and frequency of previous <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> events should be carried out before definite statements about the actual hazard can be made...|$|R

The characteristics of the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> including the short failure time, high velocities, and large accelerations indicate that the sliding forces and energy release rate of the slope are high. The deformation field showed that the sliding body was sliding outwards along the sliding surface while the sliding bed moved in an opposite direction.

The <b>rock</b> <b>slide,</b> which threatens national road SS 63, has an estimated volume of more than 3 million m 3 and is composed by the overlap of highly fractured limestone on an impermeable and weak clay shale layer. Specifically, a network of more than 30 prisms has been measured every 2 h from October 2009 to May 2013.

40|$|Purpose: The complex {{monitoring}} of <b>rock</b> <b>slides</b> {{with the size}} of 16 ha in order to predict the development of other slides and prevent possible human and material losses. Methods: Precise geodetic point measurement, terrestrial laser and image scanning and aerial photogrammetry were used to obtain detailed knowledge about the geometry and behaviour of the <b>rock</b> <b>slide.</b> Except for terrestrial images, the images were taken using an SLR camera (set on a motor paraglide) and a compact camera (set on a remotely piloted system). The state and condition of the locality before the <b>rock</b> <b>slide</b> was taken from archive images taken by a digital large format camera. Results: Vectors and velocities of the displacements of discrete points were determined with high precision; the changes in quarry wall surfaces were determined by laser and photogrammetry scanning. Finally, high resolution orthophotomosaics of the site were generated using aerial photogrammetry at each observation point. Practical implications: The termination of mining and the design of the remediation works were determined according to the results of the measurements. Also, monitoring was carried out in order to observe any changes due to the implementation of a highway project based in the localisation.
