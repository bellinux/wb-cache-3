60|$|Toomai {{knew that}} {{so long as}} he lay still on Kala Nag's neck nothing would happen to him, for even in the rush and {{scramble}} of a Keddah drive a wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the neck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men that night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard the chinking of a <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen Sahib's pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling up the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from Petersen Sahib's camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that he did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too, must have run away from some camp in the hills about.|$|E
50|$|A {{ball and}} chain {{believed}} to {{date to the}} 17th century {{was found in the}} United Kingdom in 2009. It consists of a sphere of high-grade iron approximately 15 cm across and weighing around 8 kg. The chain is of some 90 cm in length and terminates in a <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> or shackle. The weight of the ball makes it difficult for the restrained person to walk.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the general}} {{practice}} of the time, Henry's friends and his physician, Dr. Thomas Hinde, recommended she be moved to the public hospital in Williamsburg. But, after inspecting the facilities, Henry saw that if he agreed, his wife would be locked into a windowless brick cell containing only a filthy {{mattress on the floor}} and a chamber pot. There she would be chained to the wall with a <b>leg</b> <b>iron.</b> Appalled by what he saw, he instead prepared a private, two-room apartment for her in the basement of Scotchtown. Each room had a window, providing light, air circulation, and a pleasant view of the grounds. The apartment also had a fireplace, which provided good heat in the winter, and a comfortable bed to sleep in.|$|E
5000|$|On {{occasions}} when a suspect exhibits extremely aggressive behavior, <b>leg</b> <b>irons</b> {{may be used}} in addition to handcuffs; sometimes the chain connecting the <b>leg</b> <b>irons</b> to one another is looped around the chain of the handcuffs, and then the <b>leg</b> <b>irons</b> are applied, resulting in the person being [...] "hog-tied". In a few rare cases, hog-tied persons lying on their stomachs have died from positional asphyxia, making the practice highly controversial, and leading to its being severely restricted, or even completely banned, in many localities.|$|R

Pip, terrified, steals a pork pie, brandy and a file from his house and brings them to Magwitch the next morning. On his way he encounters another convict, bruised in the face, who he initially thought was Magwitch and then believes to be the young man Magwitch had told him about. Magwitch, upon hearing about the other escapee, realises that Compeyson has also escaped and, after having eaten, drunk, and filed his <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> off, he sets off to search for him. He finds him and decides, not caring for his own fate, {{to take him back}} to the Hulks. The pair are still struggling when soldiers find and seize them.|$|E
5000|$|The Mermentau River {{contains}} the infamous [...] "Negro Island" [...] (also known as [...] "Skull Island") situated near the tiny village of Grand Chenier in extreme southeastern Cameron Parish. In March 1867, John W. Sweeney, Jr., found [...] "countless skulls, skeletons, and leg bones, {{each of the}} latter still shackled by a rusting <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> to the skeleton lying beside it." [...] Since the Civil War had recently ended, slave captains knew that if a slave ship were caught with Africans aboard, the slaver captain would be tried for violating the 1820 U.S. Law on Slave Trade, the penalty {{of which was a}} charge of piracy and death by hanging. Without a doubt the shackled and starving Africans on Skull Island died quickly. Researchers believe this human cargo could possibly be the missing slaves from the topsail hermaphrodite schooner Huntress. This schooner was the last slave ship which left the Congo region of Africa in March 1865 with a capacity of 200 slaves.|$|E
40|$|Impaired venous {{drainage}} of {{the lower}} extremities, mainly due to venous reflux or to venous outflow obstruction, leads to a cascade of pathological events clinically graded by the clinical class (C) of the CEAP classification (Clinical, aEtiological, Anatomical, Pathophysiological) of chronic venous disease (CVD). Varicose veins are the most frequent clinical sign in class C 2. When oedema complicates varicose veins, the clinical picture is graded as C 3. Pigmentation, lipodermatosclerosis and other skin changes are classified as C 4. A small but significant number of the affected patients develop venous ulcers. Healed ulcers are classified as C 5, whereas active ulcers are C 6. Altered venous haemodynamics are a necessary but not exclusive element for explaining progression along the clinical classes {{to the point of}} skin lesion. In 1982, Browse and Burnand observed a peri-capillary fibrin deposition and speculated that cuffs act as a barrier to oxygen diffusion and nutrients, resulting in epidermal cell death. This mechanism of tissue injury has not yet been demonstrated. The fibrin cuff may be more properly considered a scaffold for tissue reparative processes. The cuff contains fibrin, but also laminin, fibronectin, tenascin, and types I and III collagen, encircling the dilated capillary vein The decline of the fibrin cuff theory over the last twenty years has led to investigation of other factors emphasizing inflammatory mechanisms as amplifiers of the insufficient venous drainage. Recent studies demonstrate a pivotal role for tissue iron accumulation in inducing and maintaining inflammation in CVD. Iron deposits in CVD cause readily visible brownish dermal areas which sometimes precede, but always surround, ulcers. The origin of increased <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> stores is extravasation of red blood cells (erythrocytes) in conditions of significant venous stasis. Erythrocytes are degraded by the interstitial macrophages, with the released iron incorporated into ferritin. Over time, with increasing overload of iron, the structure of ferritin changes to haemosiderin. In 1988, Ackermann found a twenty-fold higher average concentration of iron in lower limbs affected by venous ulcers as compared to the upper arm of the same subjects. The phenomenon of leg haemosiderin deposits seems to be significant for the entire body, since this protein has been demonstrated in the urine of patients affected by CVD. Increased iron stores and interstitial protein extravasa- tion are potent chemo-attractants and presumably represent the initial underlying chronic inflammatory signal respon- sible for white blood-cells recruitment and migration in the matrix (Figure 2 B). In 1988, Coleridge-Smith observed leukocytes trapped in the venous microcirculation second- ary to venous hypertension. This work paved the way to the investigation of the relationship between CVD and inflammation. The mechanism of white cell migration in the subcutaneous matrix was further elucidated by studies of the expression of adhesion molecules in a model of venous hypertension. Several studies confirmed the expression of these molecules, including ICAM, VCAM and selectins. Such adhesion molecules block circulating white cells on the vein wall and facilitate transmigration into the tissue. The predominant cells migrating into the extra-cellular matrix are macrophages and T-lymphocytes. Macrophages take up iron accumulated in the tissue and store it in intracellular ferritin-like structures (Figure 3 B). Intra- and extra-cellular overload of iron in the tissue could potentially be dangerous for generation of free radicals due to possible release of free iron from deposits. Wenk et al. and Yeoh-Ellerton found increased iron levels in Panel A, classic fibrin cuffs (arrow) thicken veins (v) in a venous ulcer bed, 40 X. Panel B, fibrin cuffs (arrow) encircles proliferated thick walled veins (v) in a peri-ventricular MS plaque, exudates from chronic leg ulcers as compared to acute wounds. They also observed significant concentrations of metabolites from oxidative stress. The final step of the pathogenetic chain leading to matrix disruption and ulcer development involves over- expression of matrix metallo-proteases (MMPs) that are not substantially balanced by their physiological tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). MMPs cause a substrate-specific degradation of matrix components, including collagen, elastin and laminin. Unrestricted MMP activity can lead to matrix break down and ulcer onset. Some experiments demonstrate that local iron overload may induce MMP hyper-activation through the so-called MMP iron-driven pathway. However, the iron hypothesis does not readily explain why <b>leg</b> <b>iron</b> deposits in CVD produce lesions only in some individuals. We hypothesized that such individual differences could be genetically determined, and investigated the role of the C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations of the HFE gene, associated with hemochromatosis in Northern European populations. C 282 Y mutation significantly increases the risk of ulcer in primary CVD by more than six-fold, while patients carrying the H 63 D variant have an earlier age of ulcer onset by almost 10 years. HFE mutations are associated with increased iron efflux from the macrophage. Our findings support the hypothesis that lesions are promoted by enhanced iron release and ROS generation...|$|E

50|$|Specific {{prisoner}} transport restraints (e.g. Smith & Wesson model 1850 transport restraint) are combinations which {{consist of}} a pair of handcuffs, attached by a longer chain to a pair of <b>leg</b> <b>irons.</b> When being placed in such transport restraints, the prisoner will still have the possibility to manage normal steps, but is prevented from running by the <b>leg</b> <b>irons.</b> The connecting chain also prevents the prisoner from lifting his arms. For transporting prisoners by car, special combinations called auto restraint are used where the chains of the <b>leg</b> <b>irons</b> as well as the connecting chains are shortened, allowing the prisoner only a stooping shuffling walk when he is outside the car.|$|R
