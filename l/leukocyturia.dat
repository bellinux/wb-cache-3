50|$|Indinavir {{inhibits}} urinary {{nitrous oxide}} production and may inhibit nitric oxide production. Treatment with this drug is frequently associated with renal abnormalities, sterile <b>leukocyturia,</b> and reduced creatinine clearance.|$|E
50|$|It {{is normal}} to find up to 3 (occasionally 5) leukocytes per high power field (40X) in a urine sample, with women having {{slightly}} higher results owing to vaginal contamination. Higher numbers indicate urinary infection. The urine test strip test for {{white blood cells}} detects leukocyte esterase, which is present in azurophilic granules of monocytes and granulocytes (neutrophilic, eosinophilic and basophilic). Bacteria, lymphocytes and epithelial cells from the genitourinary tract do not contain esterases. Neutrophil granulocytes are the leukocytes most commonly associated with urinary infections. A positive test for leukocyte esterase normally indicates the presence of bacteria and a positive nitrite test (although {{it is not always}} the case). Infections caused by Trichomonas, Chlamydia and yeasts produce <b>leukocyturia</b> without bacteriuria. The inflammation of the renal tissues (interstitial nephritis) can produce <b>leukocyturia,</b> in particular toxic interstitial nephritis with predominant eosinophils.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prolonged {{administration}} of indinavir {{is associated with}} the occurrence of a variety of renal complications in adults. These well-documented side effects have restricted the use of this potent protease inhibitor in children. DESIGN: A prospective study to monitor indinavir-related nephrotoxicity in a cohort of 30 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 -infected children treated with indinavir. METHODS: Urinary pH, albumin, creatinine, the presence of erythrocytes, leukocytes, bacteria and crystals, and culture were analyzed every 3 months for 96 weeks. Serum creatinine levels were routinely determined at the same time points. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of indinavir were done at week 4 after the initiation of indinavir. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> (> or = 75 cells/ micro L in at least 2 consecutive visits) after 96 weeks was 53 %. Persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> was frequently associated with a mild increase in the urine albumin/creatinine ratio and by microscopic hematuria. The cumulative incidence of serum creatinine levels > 50 % above normal was 33 % after 96 weeks. Children with persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> more frequently had serum creatinine levels of 50 % above normal than those children without persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia.</b> In children younger than 5. 6 years, persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> was significantly more frequent than in older children. A higher cumulative incidence of persistent <b>leukocyturia</b> was found in children with an area under the curve > 19 mg/L x h or a peak serum level of indinavir > 12 mg/L. In 4 children, indinavir was discontinued because of nephrotoxicity. Subsequently, the serum creatinine levels decreased, the urine albumin/creatinine ratios returned to zero, and the <b>leukocyturia</b> disappeared within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with indinavir have a high cumulative incidence of persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia.</b> Children with persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> more frequently had an increase in serum creatinine levels of > 50 % above normal. Younger children have an additional risk for renal complications. The impairment of the renal function in these children occurred in the absence of clinical symptoms of nephrolithiasis. Indinavir-associated nephrotoxicity must be monitored closely, especially in children with risk factors such as persistent sterile <b>leukocyturia,</b> age 19 mg/L x h, and a C(max) > 12 mg/L...|$|E
40|$|Symptomatic {{nephrotoxicity}} is {{a well-known}} complication of indinavir treatment. However, {{little is known about}} the relevance of other abnormalities, such as <b>leukocyturia</b> during use of indinavir. We determined the prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of persistent <b>leukocyturia</b> in a prospectively monitored cohort of indinavir users in three adult outpatient clinics. Patients were monitored for nephrotoxicity at regular visits (every 3 months) between August 1998 and September 2000. Monitoring involved urine dipstick analysis and microscopy for pH, erythrocytes, leukocytes, and indinavir crystals. The urine albumin concentration/creatinine concentration ratio and serum creatinine and indinavir plasma concentrations were measured, and urinary tract infection was excluded. Urologic symptoms were retrieved from medical records. Of 184 patients with at least one assessment, 35 % had <b>leukocyturia</b> (i. e., > 75 cells/microL) at least once during the study period, which coincided with mild increase in the serum albumin level, erythrocyturia, and crystalluria. Thirty-two (24 %) of 134 patients with two or more assessments had persistent <b>leukocyturia</b> (i. e., on two or more occasions). Risk factors were indinavir plasma concentration of > 9 mg/L, urine pH of > 5. 7, and crystalluria. Persistent <b>leukocyturia</b> was associated with a gradual loss of renal function but not with urologic symptoms. The data show that <b>leukocyturia</b> is a frequent finding and emphasize the need for monitoring renal function during indinavir treatment, even in the absence of urologic symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Proteinuria, hematuria, and <b>leukocyturia</b> in {{children}} with mixed urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis. Quantitativeparasitological assessment and quantitative analysis of proteinuria, hematuria, and <b>leukocyturia</b> were carried out in 182 Sudanese schoolboys with mixed urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis. Pathological proteinuria was found in 73 % of patients (median= 380, 95 % confidence limits= 200 to 500 mg/liter). The median protein/creatinine ratio was 0. 54. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed an excretion of albumin, transferrin, and IgG consistent with a postrenal pattern of proteinuria. Pathological erythrocyturia occurred in 84 % of patients (median= 255, 95 % CL= 95 to 629 cells/µl) and <b>leukocyturia</b> in 77 % of patients (median= 148, 95 % CL= 93 to 246 cells/µl). Phase contrast microscopy revealed intact erythrocytes,suggestive of postrenal hemorrhage. Proteinuria, erythrocyturia, and <b>leukocyturia</b> correlated significantly with the ova excretion in the urine, but not with egg excretion in the stool. Oxamniquine reduced ova excretion in the stool but did not influence pathological urine findings. In patients treated effectively with Praziquantel or Metrifonate, pathological PU, EU, and LU decreased markedly 1 month post treatment. PU in severely proteinuric patients reached physiological values 5 months post therapy. We suggest that the proteinuria, erythrocyturia, and <b>leukocyturia</b> inmixed schistosomiasis were of postrenal origin...|$|E
40|$|Kidney {{allograft}} {{interstitial fibrosis}} and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) {{is associated with}} a poorer renal function and outcome. In the current clinical practice, an early diagnosis can only be provided by invasive tests. We aimed to investigate the association of sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> with Banff criteria histological findings in kidney allograft protocol biopsies. We studied 348 allograft biopsies from two different European countries performed at 8. 5 + 3. 5 months after transplantation. In these cases, the presence of sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> (Leuc+, n = 70) or no <b>leukocyturia</b> (Leuc-, n = 278) was analyzed and related to Banff elementary lesions. Only IF/TA was significantly different between Leuc+ and Leuc- groups. IF/TA was present in 85. 7 % of Leuc+ and 27. 7 % of Leuc- patients (p < 0. 001). IF/TA patients had higher serum creatinine and presence of proteinuria (p < 0. 05). Independent predictors of IF/TA were donor age, donor male sex, serum creatinine and Leuc+ (hazard ratio 18. 2; 95 % confidence interval, 8. 1 - 40. 7). The positive predictive value of <b>leukocyturia</b> for predicting IF/TA was 85. 7 % whereas the negative predictive value was 72. 3 %. These studies suggest that <b>leukocyturia</b> is a noninvasive and low-cost test to identify IF/TA.

40|$|Background: <b>Leukocyturia</b> is {{one sign}} of {{infection}} or inflammation of the urinary tract. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic disease {{that can lead to}} several abnormalities in the immune system which allows an increased risk of infections, one of them is urinary tract infection. DM can also cause damage to microvascular complications that occur in various tissues including kidney glomerular capillary. Damage on the glomerular capillary may trigger the inflammatory response. Aim: To analyze differences of <b>leukocyturia</b> among patients with CKD stage V with DM and without DM. Methods: This study is an observational analytic study with case control design. Study sample was patients with CKD stage V in the dr. Kariadi General Hospital of Semarang during July 2011 – November 2011. Sample data obtained from patient’s medical records. Number of 66 samples consisted of 33 cases samples and 33 control samples. The data was analyzed using Chi-Square test. Results: Based on results of the chi-square test obtained p value < 0. 05 (p = 0. 001) and the Odds Ratio (OR) of 6. 250. Conclusion: There is a significant difference of <b>leukocyturia</b> among patients with CKD stage V with DM and non DM. Patients with CKD stage V with a positive history of DM had a 6. 25 times likely to positively had leukosituri compared to patients without a history of DM.

30|$|Nephroprotective {{effects of}} CAN have been {{identified}} in the experimental Heymann autoimmune glomerulonephritis. The herbal monotherapy was shown to partially normalize urodynamics, increase rate of glomerular filtration, mildly decrease blood creatinine, and significantly reduce the severity of <b>leukocyturia</b> due to anti-inflammatory effects of the herbal medicinal product. Combining CAN with the immunosuppressant prednisolone promotes more positive pharmacodynamic effects on the immune and renal systems of rats. Synergistic effects of “Prednisolone[*]+[*]CAN” combination were demonstrated in the enhanced reduction of hematuria and <b>leukocyturia,</b> reduced level of uremic toxins (products of deep protein oxidation and carbonyl proteins) and blood cryoglobulins, and also increased CD 8 [*]+[*]−lymphocyte count.|$|E
40|$|Few urinary {{screening}} {{studies have}} been performed to determine the incidence of urinary abnormalities in antiretroviral therapy-naive, HIV-infected outpatients. From pub-lished data, the incidence appears to be high, particularly when compared with populations outside sub-Saharan Africa. In South Africa, urinary screening in antiretroviral therapy clinics is not routinely practiced. The aim of this descriptive study was to screen antiretro-viral therapy-naive, HIV-infected outpatients attending the HIV clinic for urinary abnormal-ities, namely <b>leukocyturia,</b> microscopic hema-turia, and microalbuminuria/proteinuria. This study showed that 84 % of the screened population had AIDS (CD 4 count, 200 cells/ mm 3), and the incidence of abnormalities on urinary dipstick testing was high: 30 % had <b>leukocyturia,</b> 33 % had microscopic hematuria, and 44 % had microalbuminuria/proteinuria. In patients with <b>leukocyturia,</b> an infective organ-ism was cultured in only 29. 1 % of cases, predominantly Escherichia coli (70 %) with sterile <b>leukocyturia</b> comprising the remainder. There may be an association with tuberculosis (TB) or sexually transmitted infections (STI) in the sterile leucocyturia group, but this remains to be confirmed. In those with a culture positive result the most common organism was E. Coli (70 %), which exhibited 90 % resistance to cotrimoxazole, demonstrating that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is not effective to prevent urinary tract infection in this group. On {{the basis of these}} findings, it has been proposed that urinary screening be considered standard of care in HIV clinics in South Africa.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} history taking to diagnose asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in diabetic women, and the added value of <b>leukocyturia.</b> METHODS: Data were obtained from a multicenter study including 465 women with diabetes. Many patient characteristics were considered as potential diagnostic determinants. A urinary leukocyte count and a urine culture (the criterion standard) were performed. Logistic regression analyses were performed and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. RESULTS: For women with type 1 diabetes (n = 236; ASB 11 %), duration of diabetes and glycosylated hemoglobin (GHb) were powerful predictors of ASB. The AUC of the model including these two variables was 0. 66 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 53 - 0. 78). After addition of <b>leukocyturia,</b> the AUC increased considerably to 0. 78 (95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 88; p = 0. 018). For women with type 2 diabetes (n = 229; ASB 19 %), age {{and the number of}} symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) in the previous year were the strongest predictors of ASB. The AUC of the model including these variables was 0. 70 (95 % CI 0. 61 - 0. 80). After addition of <b>leukocyturia,</b> the AUC increased to 0. 79 (95 % CI 0. 71 - 0. 86; p = 0. 023). CONCLUSION: In diabetic women, ASB can be diagnosed using two easily obtainable variables (duration of diabetes and GHb for women with type 1 diabetes, and age and the number of UTIs in the previous year for women with type 2 diabetes) in combination with a urinary leukocyte count. This results in a model with sufficient accuracy (AUC > 0. 75...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is a {{worldwide}} health problem, {{and promotion of}} the World Kidney Day has improved general population education and awareness of renal illnesses aimed at ameliorating disease prevention. The Kidney Day was also an {{opportunity for us to}} investigate risk factors for CKD in an Italian population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1, 341 subjects from the general population living in the area of Ferrara, a town in the northeast of Italy, aged 50 - 70 years, were investigated. From each participant age, sex, smoking status, current antihypertensive medications, hypercholesterolemic and diabetic status, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and blood pressure (BP) were obtained. All subjects underwent dipstick urinalysis for the evaluation of proteinuria, hematuria and <b>leukocyturia.</b> RESULTS: Fifteen percent of patients were diabetics, and 20 % were smokers. Mean BMI was 26. 9 ± 4. 3 kg/m(2), mean systolic BP was 133. 7 ± 18. 7 mmHg and mean diastolic BP 78. 1 ± 9. 9 mmHg. A total of 828 participants were not taking any antihypertensive drugs. In 24 % of subjects, we found proteinuria, in 18 % hematuria and in 16 % <b>leukocyturia.</b> Proteinuria was significantly associated with age and diabetes, hematuria was associated with age, female sex and smoking status, and <b>leukocyturia</b> was associated with age and female sex. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary abnormalities are common in general population, and in many cases, various abnormalities overlap. These abnormalities could be associated with cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Objective: Comparative {{evaluation}} of the auxiliary laboratory tests used for quick and correct diagnosis with urine culture results in children with suspected urinary system infection was investigated. Material and Methods: A prospective screening study was held on 239 patients {{between the ages of}} 9 months and 14 years, who referred to the outpatient clinic of child health and disease, with suspected urinary tract infection. Complete urine tests, urine cultures, whole blood counts, and tests for urea, creatinine, and C-reactive protein levels were performed in all patients. Results: As urine culture is the gold standard in diagnosis of urinary system infections, definitive tests were compared between groups with or without growth. According to this, while CRP did not differ significantly between groups (p> 0, 05), leukocyte counts, <b>leukocyturia</b> levels, and leukocyte esterase positivity was significantly higher in the group with positive culture growth (p> 0, 05).

40|$|Dense deposit disease (DDD), a subtype of C 3 glomerulopathy, is a {{rare disease}} {{affecting}} mostly children. Treatment options are limited. Debate exists whether eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody against complement factor C 5, is effective in DDD. Reported data are scarce, especially in children. The authors analyzed clinical and histologic data of five pediatric patients with a native kidney biopsy diagnosis of DDD. Patients received eculizumab as therapy of last resort for severe nephritic or nephrotic syndrome with alternative pathway complement activation; this therapy was given only when the patients had not or only marginally responded to immunosuppressive therapy. Outcome measures were kidney function, proteinuria, and urine analysis. In all, seven disease episodes were treated with eculizumab (six episodes of severe nephritic syndrome [two of which required dialysis] and one nephrotic syndrome episode). Median age at treatment start was 8. 4 (range, 5. 9 - 13) years. For three treatment episodes, eculizumab was the sole immunosuppressive treatment. In all patients, both proteinuria and renal function improved significantly within 12 weeks of treatment (median urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of 8. 5 [range, 2. 2 - 17] versus 1. 1 [range, 0. 2 - 2. 0] g/g, P < 0. 005, and eGFR of 58 [range, 17 - 114] versus 77 [range, 50 - 129] ml/min per 1. 73 m(2), P < 0. 01). A striking finding was the disappearance of <b>leukocyturia</b> within 1 week after the first eculizumab dose in all five episodes with <b>leukocyturia</b> at treatment initiation. In this case series of pediatric patients with DDD, eculizumab treatment was associated with reduction in proteinuria and increase in eGFR. <b>Leukocyturia</b> resolved within 1 week of initiation of eculizumab treatment.

30|$|CAN {{monotherapy}} did {{not affect}} immunological parameters and CD 4 +/CD 8 + subpopulation ratio but reduced the level of immune complexes significantly compared to AIG. Biochemically, the drug produced moderate positive effect on creatinine level only. The main targets of nephroprotective effect of the drug were the kidneys, i.e. normalization of diuresis and glomerular filtration rate, probably due to creatinine elimination via tubular secretion. Significant reduction of <b>leukocyturia</b> was observed compared to AIG group which, however, did not exceed prednisolone monotherapy. This {{could be explained by}} anti-inflammatory effects of the drug. Antioxidant effects were supported by the tendency for blood AOPP and PCO reduction in CAN treatment.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: (1) To {{assess the}} rate of {{bacteremia}} in febrile infants less than 3 months of age admitted to a pediatric emergency department at a tertiary hospital; (2) to describe the bacteria isolated; and (3) to analyze factors related to increased probability of having a positive blood culture. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional, 5 -year descriptive study that includes all infants less than 3 months of age who presented with fever without source (FWS) and had a blood culture performed. Results: A blood culture was performed in 1018 (91. 5 %) of 1125 infants admitted, and a bacterial pathogen was grown in 23 (2. 2 %) of these; 8 were associated with a positive urine culture. The most frequently isolated pathogen was Escherichia coli (9), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (4). The risk factors detected by multivariate analysis were: (a) being classified as “not well-appearing ” (12. 5 % vs. 1. 8 %; odds ratio: 8. 37) and (b) <b>leukocyturia</b> and/or nitrituria in a urine dipstick test (5. 6 % vs. 1. 6 %; odds ratio: 3. 73).

By the end of 24 -month, 95.8 % of patients had been in remission. Four episodes of relapse ended in remission followed by retreatment. No life-threatening side effects were observed in 66.6 % of patients with fourteen cases of infection (58.3 %). None of them developed ESRD.|$|E
40|$|Data from 27 {{patients}} with acquired immunedeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC) managed at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center since 1982 were extracted from medical records. Functional renal insufficiency occurred with considerable frequency among the AIDS patients. In contrast renal function was stable in the ARC patients studied. The {{majority of the}} AIDS patients exhibited persistent or transient proteinuria. Hematuria, <b>leukocyturia,</b> bacteruria, and nonvenereal urinary tract infections were seen with considerable frequency among AIDS patients and much less frequently among ARC patients. Similarly various disorders of fluids, electrolytes, acid base and abnormal phosphorus and calcium levels were common among AIDS patients and uncommon among ARC patients. These observations point to the prevalence and significance of the renal and associated abnormalities in acquired immune-deficiency syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Praziquantel is {{the drug}} of choice in {{preventive}} chemotherapy targeting schistosomiasis. Increasing large-scale administration of praziquantel requires monitoring of drug efficacy to detect early signs of development of resistance. Standard protocols for drug efficacy monitoring are necessary. Here, we determined the optimal time point for praziquantel efficacy assessment against Schistosoma haematobium and studied the dynamics of infection parameters following treatment. Methods Ninety school-aged children from south Côte d’Ivoire with a parasitologically confirmed S. haematobium infection were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel (40 [*]mg/kg) and followed up for 62 [*]days post-treatment. Urine samples were collected on 23 schooldays during this period and were subjected to visual examination (macrohaematuria), urine filtration and microscopy (S. haematobium eggs) and reagent strip testing (microhaematuria, proteinuria and <b>leukocyturia).</b> Results Observed cure and egg reduction rates were highly dependent on the time point post-treatment. Egg reduction rates were high (> 97 %) in weeks 3 – 9 post-treatment. Cure rates were highest in weeks 6 (92. 9 %) and 9 (95. 0 %) post-treatment. The prevalence of infection-associated parameters decreased after treatment, reaching a minimum of 2. 4 % in weeks 5 (proteinuria) and 7 (<b>leukocyturia)</b> post-treatment, and 16. 3 % {{at the end of}} week 8 (microhaematuria). Macrohaematuria disappeared between weeks 3 and 6 post-treatment. Conclusions For monitoring praziquantel efficacy against S. haematobium, we recommend that the cure rate is assessed at week 6 post-treatment. The egg reduction rate can be evaluated earlier, from day 14 post-treatment onwards. Reagent strips are a useful additional tool for evaluating treatment outcomes in areas with high endemicity, preferably at weeks 5 and 6 post-treatment. The delayed decrease of microhaematuria confirms that lesions in the urinary tract persist longer than egg excretion post-treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{negative}} effects of dehydration on aerobic activities are well established. However, it is unknown how dehydration affects intermittent sports performance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the level of dehydration in elite badminton players and its relation to muscle strength and power production. Methodology: Seventy matches from the National Spanish badminton championship were analyzed (46 men?s singles and 24 women?s singles). Before and after each match, jump height and power production were determined during a countermovement jump on a force platform. Participants? body weight and a urine sample were also obtained before and after each match. The amount of liquid that the players drank during the match was also calculated by weighing their individual drinking bottles. Results and Discussion: Sweat rate during the game was 1. 1460. 46 l/h in men and 1. 0260. 64 l/h in women. The players rehydrated at a rate of 1. 1060. 55 l/h and 1. 0160. 44 l/h in the male and female groups respectively. Thus, the dehydration attained during the game was only 0. 3760. 50 % in men and 0. 3260. 83 % in women. No differences were found in any of the parameters analyzed during the vertical jump (men: from 31. 8265. 29 to 32. 9064. 49 W/kg; p. 0. 05, women: from 26. 3664. 73 to 27. 2564. 44 W/kg; p. 0. 05). Post-exercise urine samples revealed proteinuria (60. 9 % of cases in men and 66. 7 % in women), <b>leukocyturia</b> (men = 43. 5 % and women = 50. 0 %) and erythrocyturia (men = 50. 0 % and women = 21. 7 %). Conclusions: Despite a moderate sweat rate, badminton players adequately hydrated during a game and thus the dehydration attained was low. The badminton match did not cause muscle fatigue but it significantly increased the prevalence of proteinuria, <b>leukocyturia</b> and erythrocyturia...|$|E
40|$|As per {{guidelines}} and recommendations, screening for renal diseases {{should be performed}} {{at the time of}} diagnosis of human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) infection; however, this remains largely unimplemented in many settings across Sub-Saharan Africa. We evaluated the renal function, urinalysis abnormalities and their correlates in HIV-infected individuals who were naïve to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This was a cross-sectional study of 2 months′ duration involving 104 HIV-infected outpatients naive to HAART (71 women, 68 %) attending the HIV clinic of the Yaoundé General Hospital in Cameroon. Renal and urinalysis parameters were measured and the Student t-test and Fischer exact test were used to compare the groups of participants. The mean age and CD 4 count were, respectively, 35 ± 10. 7 years and 305 ± 202 /mL. Fifty-six (54 %) patients presented with stages 3 and 4 of HIV infection. Forty-three (41 %) patients had urinalysis abnormalities, including proteinuria (36 %), <b>leukocyturia</b> (13 %) and hematuria (12 %). Proteinuria was associated with increased age, advanced stage of HIV infection, decreased CD 4 count, hematuria and renal failure (P < 0. 04). Hematuria and <b>leukocyturia</b> were associated with decreased CD 4 count and advanced stage of HIV infection, respectively (P = 0. 04). The mean estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate was 100. 2 ± 32. 7 mL/min; three (3 %) patients had renal failure (eGFR < 60 mL/min) and 45 (43 %) patients had reduced kidney function 60 ≤eGFR ≤ 90 mL/min. There was a high prevalence of decreased kidney function and proteinuria among Cameroonian HIV-infected patients naïve to HAART. Indicators of the severity of HIV infection, including advanced stage and low CD 4 count, were associated with urinalysis abnormalities...|$|E
30|$|Although {{presentation}} with classic {{symptoms of}} fever and dyspnea, the diagnostic process was complicated {{in the last}} patient. Because she had no respiratory symptoms and pulmonary auscultation and CXR were not remarkable, we focused on the <b>leukocyturia</b> and bacteriuria {{in combination with the}} flank pain and bilateral hydronephrosis. It was not before we got the viral diagnostic test results and saw the consolidations on CT images that we reconsidered pneumonia as the most probable diagnosis. Retrospectively, we can say that the bacteriuria and pyelumdilatation has misled us, leading to unnecessary drainage of both kidneys. Bilateral hydronephrosis can occur during pregnancy due to enlargement of the uterus. Sometimes {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish clinically between pneumonia and urosepsis as the cause of the respiratory deterioration. Maybe the flank pain was caused by the pneumonia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Leukocyturia</b> is {{associated}} with postinfectious glomerulonephritis (GN), interstitial nephritis, and renal allograft rejection. In addition, prominent infiltration of T cells and macrophages is commonly observed in the renal tissues of patients with GN, accompanied by cellular crescent formation and/or interstitial cell infiltration. Because these infiltrating T cells were thought {{to participate in the}} development of the diseases and to appear in the urinary space while functioning as effector cells in the renal inflammatory lesion, the study focused on the characterization of T cells that appeared in urine. Freshly voided urine cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their phenotype and by reverse transcriptase–PCR to detect cytokine mRNA. In urine from patients with different forms of GN, including IgA nephropathy, Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodyassociate...|$|E
30|$|Neither Neisseria gonorrhoeae nor current Treponema pallidum {{infection}} (VDRL positive) {{was detected}} {{in any of}} the 11, 687 parturient women, although 27 women (0.2  %) (one of whom was Chlamydia-infected) had a history of syphilis (CMIA/FTA-Abs positive). Seven women (0.1  %) had HIV infection but none of these was coinfected with C. trachomatis. Only two Chlamydia-positive patients had symptoms attributable to the infection during pregnancy (one woman with cervicitis at week 25 and another with dysuria, <b>leukocyturia</b> and negative urine culture in week 36). A further four women had nonspecific symptoms of doubtful interpretation (vulvovaginal pruritus and/or vaginal discharge). The prevalence of preterm birth (neonates less than 37  weeks of gestational age) in Chlamydia-positive mothers was 7.6  % (n =  9). Perinatal transmission was detected in 10 / 91 (11  %) neonates studied. Four of them were symptomatic and presented conjunctivitis.|$|E
30|$|We {{enrolled}} 20 {{females and}} 4 males with active lupus nephritis with majority documented with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. Two tissue samples (10 %) were compatible with WHO class III, 13 samples were WHO class IV (65 %) and 5 samples were WHO class V (25 %). Adverse predictive {{factors such as}} proteinuria, low GFR, hypertention, were detected in 95.8 %, 33.3 % and 41.6 % of patients respectively. At the beginning of renal disease 21 patients had hematuria and 18 patients had <b>leukocyturia.</b> The average range of proteinuria before treatment was 1.57 [*]±[*] 1 gr/day. Three patients (13 %) had nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria > 3 gr/day). Decrease in C 3 and C 4 levels were seen in 33.30 % {{at the beginning of}} therapy. Anti DNA was positive in 50 % of patients. Renal insufficiency means creatinine > 1.9  mg/dL was seen in one patient at the beginning of therapy.|$|E
