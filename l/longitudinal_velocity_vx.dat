40|$|Positive and {{negative}} surges are generally observed in open channels. Positive surges that occur due to tidal origins {{are referred to}} as tidal bores. A positive surge occurs when a sudden change in flow leads to an increase of the water depth, while a negative surge occurs due to a sudden decrease in water depth. Positive {{and negative}} surges are commonly induced by control structures, such as the opening and closing of a gate. In this study, the free-surface properties and velocity characteristics of negative and positive surges were investigated physically under controlled conditions, as well as analytically and numerically. Unsteady open channel flow data were collected during the upstream propagation of negative and positive surges. Both, physical and numerical modelling, were performed. Some detailed measurements of free-surface fluctuations were recorded using non-intrusive techniques, including acoustic displacement meters and video recordings. Velocity measurements were sampled with high temporal and spatial resolution using an ADV (200 Hz) at four vertical elevations and two longitudinal locations. The velocity and water depth results were ensemble-averaged for both negative and positive surges. The results showed that the water curvature of the negative surge was steeper near the gate at x= 10. 5 m compared to further upstream at x= 6 m. Both the instantaneous and ensemble-average data showed that in the negative surge the inflection point of the water surface and the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>Vx</b> occurred simultaneously. Also, an increase in Vx was observed at all elevations during the surge passage. For the positive surge the propagation of the bore and the velocity characteristics supported earlier findings by Koch and Chanson (2009) and Docherty and Chanson (2010). The surge was a major discontinuity in terms of the free-surface elevations, and a deceleration of the longitudinal velocities Vx was observed during the surge passage. A number of analytical and numerical models were tested, including the analytical and numerical solutions of the Saint-Venant equations and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) package. Overall, all models provided reasonable results for the negative surge. None of the models were able to provide a good agreement with the measured data for the positive surge. The study showed that theoretical models may be applied successfully to unsteady flow situations with simple channel geometry. Also, {{it was found that the}} selection of the appropriate mesh size for CFD simulations is essential in highly unsteady turbulent flows, such as a positive surge, where the surge front is a sharp discontinuity in terms of water elevation, velocity and pressure. It was concluded that the highly unsteady open channel flows remain a challenge for professional engineers and researchers...|$|E

The longitudinal slip of a tyre is often determined using three independent measurements namely the rotational velocity, tyre rolling radius and vehicle speed. However, during terremachanics tests the tyre rolling radius is almost impossible to measure from the outside. Methods have been created to determine the rolling radius on the inside of a tyre using lasers, however these methods generally only provide a single measurement point every few degrees. In this study a stereoscopic rig is used {{on the inside of the}} tyre to determine the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> of a large portion of the tyre in contact with the terrain. This measurement inherently includes the rotational velocity and rolling radius of the tyre. The measurement of the internal <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> is used to determine the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> at the tyre-terrain contact interface.

The research work revealed the quite different <b>longitudinal</b> wave <b>velocity</b> changes between under the simple and pure shear states and also distinguished <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> change under the pure shear state, {{on the other}} hand transverse wave velocity changes under simple and pure shear states showed almost the same change tendencies similar to the texture development under both shear states.

During annealing, the ultrasound velocity behaves in a peculiar way, first decreasing and then increasing {{to a final}} value. The recrystallized fraction evaluated by metallography indicates that recrystallization occurs during both the decrease {{and the increase in}} <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity.</b> Texture evaluated using laser ultrasonics suggests that the peculiar behavior of the velocity might be due to two different regimes of texture evolution. Internal friction, investigated through ultrasound absorption measurements, is also revealed to be very sensitive to the annealing process. This internal friction is attributed to magnetomechanical effects that are also known to decrease the ultrasonic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> and probably contribute to the observed peculiar behavior of the velocity.

The equations {{of motion}} are expressed relative the center of mass for the first vehicle unit and are derived using Lagrangian formalism. The symbolic manipulations of the equations have been done using the software Mathematica. The model derived in this report {{is intended to be}} valid for studies of vehicle cornering in high speed with moderate lateral and longitudinal acceleration levels. In order to keep the model complexity as low as possible, the derived {{equations of motion}} are simplified. The steering angle and the articulation angles of the towed vehicle units are assumed to be small. All products of the steering angle, the yaw rate of the first unit and the articulation angles and their time derivatives are set to zero. Further, the representation of <b>longitudinal</b> vehicle <b>velocity</b> leads to different level of model complexity. Firstly, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> is assumed to be constant. Together {{with the use of a}} linear lateral tyre model this results in a fully linear vehicle model, consisting of eight states and one input. Secondly, the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> is allowed to be varying and is represented as a model state variable. Also here a linear lateral tyre model is used. The resulting vehicle model becomes non-linear, consisting of nine states and six inputs. Further simplifications of the longitudinal dynamics is carried out by assuming e. g. slowly varying <b>longitudinal</b> <b>velocity</b> and <b>longitudinal</b> forces only on the towing unit. This results in a non-linear model consisting of nine states and two inputs. This model is to be compared with the fully linear model. Realistic linear tyre parameters are found by tuning the derived linear single-track model with results from a high fidelity vehicle model developed at Volvo Group Trucks Technology (VGTT).
