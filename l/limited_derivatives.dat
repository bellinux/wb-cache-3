We propose surreal definitions of the arctangent and logarithm functions using truncations of Maclaurin series. Using a new representation of surreals, we present a formula for the limit of a sequence, and we use this formula to provide a complete characterization of convergent sequences and to evaluate certain series and infinite Riemann sums via extrapolation. A similar formula allows us to evaluate <b>limits</b> (and hence <b>derivatives)</b> of functions. By defining a new topology on No, we obtain the Intermediate Value Theorem even though No is not Cauchy complete, and we prove that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus would hold for surreals if a consistent definition of integration exists...|$|R

40|$|Shadowing trajectories {{can play}} an {{important}} role in assessing the reliability of forecasting models, they can also {{play an important role in}} providing state estimates for ensemble forecasts. Gradient descent methods provide one approach for obtaining shadowing trajectories, which have been shown to have many useful properties. There remains the important question whether shadowing trajectories can be found in very high-dimensional systems, like weather and climate models. The principle impediment is the need to compute the derivative (or adjoint) of the system dynamics.

30|$|The {{study of}} calculus, with its {{fundamental}} concepts of <b>limit,</b> <b>derivative</b> and integral, requires {{an ability to}} understand algebraic variables as generalised numbers and as functionally related varying quantities (Gray, Loud, & Sokolowski, 2009). Students’ performance in calculus is undermined by weak basic algebraic skills of factorisation, handling operations in directed numbers, solving equations and poor understanding of indices (Luneta & Makonye, 2010). They further argue that algebraic incompetence has {{a direct impact on}} learning calculus. They suggest that lecturers {{should be aware of the}} educational backgrounds of first year university students in order to design learning activities that may close any gaps that exist between matriculation and the first year university level.

Fourteen students from a secondary Advanced Placement Calculus AB course {{explored the}} <b>limit</b> and <b>derivative</b> concepts from calculus using computational tools in the Maple computer algebra system. Students worked in pairs utilizing the pair-programming collaborative model. Four groups of student pairs constructed computational tools and used them to explore the <b>limit</b> and <b>derivative</b> concepts.

A multiple embedded case design was utilized to explore ways students in two classes, a programming class P and a non-programming class N, constructed understandings focusing upon their interactions {{with each other and}} with the computational tools. The Action-Process-Object-Schema (APOS) conceptual model and Constructionist framework guided design and construction of the tools, outlined developmental goals and milestones, and provided interpretive context for analysis. Results provided insights into the effective design and use of computational tools in fostering conceptual understanding. The study found the additional burden of programming redirected students’ attention away from the intended conceptual understandings. The study additionally found, however, that pre-constructed tools effectively promote conceptual understanding of the limit concept when coupled with a mature conceptual model of development. Four themes influencing development of these understandings emerged: An instructional focus on skills over concepts, the instructional sequence, the willingness and ability of students to adopt and utilize computational tools, and the ways cognitive conflict was mediated...|$|R

TOPICS: real numbers, functions, <b>limits</b> and continuity, <b>derivatives,</b> integrals, series, applications. EXAMINATION: at the end of each of the three terms there is a written test, each graded 0 to 30. A student that gets less than 12 in one test will have to take a comprehensive written and oral examination in one of two sessions (summer and september). A student that gets al least 12 in all tests, but with a mean less than 18 will have to take the oral examination in the summer session. A student that gets at least 12 in all tests with a mean of 18 or more can choose between (1) taking the oral examination in the summer session or (2) skipping the oral and keeping as final grade the mean of the three tests.
