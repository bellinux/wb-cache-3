Data from 9921 cadaveric kidneys, transplanted between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2003, were retrieved from the French National Registry for organ donation. We defined RFR as the number of days for the recipient to reach a plasma creatinine less than 250 μmol/l, and/or a 24 -h urine output greater than 1000 ml. RFR and 1 -year and <b>long-term</b> graft <b>survival</b> were compared between four different donor groups (according to ICMI and diabetes mellitus). A total of 41. 5 % of deceased donors received ICMI before organ procurement and 1. 95 % of them were diabetic.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the occurrence and time course of hem- and lymphangiogenesis after normal-risk corneal transplantation in the mouse model and {{to test whether}} pharmacologic strategies inhibiting both processes improve <b>long-term</b> graft <b>survival.</b> METHODS: Normal-risk allogeneic (C 57 BL/ 6 to BALB/c) and syngeneic (BALB/c to BALB/c) corneal transplantations were performed and occurrence and time course of hem- and lymphangiogenesis after keratoplasty was observed, by using double immunofluorescence of corneal flatmounts (with CD 31 as a panendothelial and LYVE- 1 as a lymphatic vascular endothelium-specific marker). A molecular trap designed to eliminate VEGF-A (VEGF Trap(R 1 R 2); 12. 5 mg/kg) was tested {{for its ability to}} inhibit both processes after keratoplasty and to promote <b>long-term</b> graft <b>survival</b> (intraperitoneal injections on the day of surgery and 3, 7, and 14 days later). RESULTS: No blood or lymph vessels were detectable immediately after normal-risk transplantation in either donor or host cornea, but hem- and lymphangiogenesis were clearly visible at day 3 after transplantation. Both vessel types reached donor tissue at 1 week after allografting and similarly after syngeneic grafting. Early postoperative trapping of VEGF-A significantly reduced both hem- and lymphangiogenesis and significantly improved <b>long-term</b> graft <b>survival</b> (78 % vs. 40 %; P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: There is concurrent, VEGF-A-dependent hem- and lymphangiogenesis after normal-risk keratoplasty within the preoperatively avascular recipient bed. Inhibition of hem- and lymphangiogenesis (afferent and efferent arm of an immune response) after normal-risk corneal transplantation improves <b>long-term</b> graft <b>survival,</b> establishing early postoperative hem- and lymphangiogenesis as novel risk factors for graft rejection even in low-risk eyes...|$|R

5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; <b>long-term</b> <b>survival</b> rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets.

5|$|Most paleontologists regard birds as {{the only}} {{surviving}} dinosaurs (see Origin of birds). It is thought that all non-avian theropods became extinct, including then-flourishing groups such as enantiornithines and hesperornithiforms. Several analyses of bird fossils show divergence of species prior to the K–Pg boundary, and that duck, chicken, and ratite bird relatives coexisted with non-avian dinosaurs. Large collections of bird fossils representing a range of different species provides definitive evidence for the persistence of archaic birds to within 300,000 years of the K–Pg boundary. The absence of these birds in the Paleogene is evidence that a mass extinction of archaic birds took place there. A {{small fraction of the}} Cretaceous bird species survived the impact, giving rise to today's birds. The only bird group known for certain to have survived the K–Pg boundary is the Aves. Avians may have been able to survive the extinction {{as a result of their}} abilities to dive, swim, or seek shelter in water and marshlands. Many species of avians can build burrows, or nest in tree holes or termite nests, all of which provided shelter from the environmental effects at the K–Pg boundary. <b>Long-term</b> <b>survival</b> past the boundary was assured as a result of filling ecological niches left empty by extinction of non-avian dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Throughout most {{of history}} the {{mortality}} rate of TBI {{was thought to be}} 100%. However, in 1871 a healed TBI was noted in a duck that had been killed by a hunter, thus demonstrating that the injury could be survived, at least in the general sense. This report, made by Winslow, was the first record in the medical literature of a bronchus injury. In 1873, Seuvre made one of the earliest reports of TBI in the medical literature: a 74-year-old woman whose chest was crushed by a wagon wheel was found on autopsy to have an avulsion of the right bronchus. <b>Long-term</b> <b>survival</b> of the injury was unknown in humans until a report was made of a person who survived in 1927. In 1931, a report made by Nissen described successful removal of a lung in a 12-year-old girl who had had narrowing of the bronchus due to the injury. Repair of TBI was probably first attempted in 1945, when the first documented case of a successful suturing of a lacerated bronchus was made. Prior to 1950, {{the mortality rate}} was 36%; it had fallen to 9% by 2001; this improvement was likely due to improvements in treatments and surgical techniques, including those for injuries commonly associated with TBI.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the potential role of endogenous interleukin (IL) - 10 in <b>long-term</b> liver allograft <b>survival</b> induced by delayed immunosuppression (FK 506 days 2 - 7). Liver transplantation was performed by using Dark Agouti and Lewis rats as donors and recipients, respectively. The delayed immunosuppression protocol induced indefinite allograft survival. A transient upregulation of plasma IL- 10 levels was detected in the nontreatment and FK 506 treatment groups. Macrophages {{were found to be}} one of the major sources of IL- 10 produced from the liver allografts. Administration of IL- 10 -neutralizing antibody shortened the <b>long-term</b> isograft <b>survival</b> and FK 506 -induced indefinite allograft survival, particularly in the FK 506 group. Damaged liver graft histology and increase of plasma alanine aminotransferase levels were detected in the groups with IL- 10 antibody treatment. In an ex vivo setting, IL- 10 recombinant protein augmented the expression of Foxp 3, downregulated the expression of IL- 2 and interferon gamma, and induced the generation of CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + and CD 8 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + cells, but this effect was blocked by the administration of IL- 10 antibody. Finally, administration of IL- 10 recombinant protein after the decline of endogenous IL- 10 levels improved allograft survival, and a 100 % <b>long-term</b> allograft <b>survival</b> was achieved by the combination of IL- 10 with low-dose FK 506. In conclusion, the delayed immunosuppression could induce <b>long-term</b> liver allograft <b>survival</b> in the presence of endogenous IL- 10 produced by the tissue macrophages.

5|$|Indeed, a {{thorough}} reading of historical newspaper articles and historical government reports {{reveals that the}} whole history of wild Murray cod between the mid–1800s and the mid–1900s was one of citizen agitation, government inaction, and ongoing stock decline. For decade after decade, riverside residents, commercial fishermen, recreational fishermen, local fisheries inspectors, fish retailers, and others agitated in newspapers and other fora about the evidently, continuously declining Murray cod stocks, to be met in turn either with government denials, or conversely, with various ineffective inquiries into Murray cod stocks and fisheries, and various ineffective control measures. For decade after decade, debate about excessive fishing pressure, number of fishermen, number of nets, net mesh size, bag limits, minimum size limits and take of small cod, closed seasons and the taking of spawning cod full of eggs during spring, and other sundry issues, raged on and on without proper resolution, with fishing regulations either not amended, or amended and largely unenforced and completely ignored, and with heavy commercial, recreational and illegal fishing pressure continuing unrelenting and unabated. The end result was a Murray cod population, initially unimaginably abundant, continually fished down and down and down without pause, until in the early to mid 20th century a number of other factors such as river regulation (listed below) emerged to drive the species even further into decline. All of these drivers of decline have left this iconic Australian fish in a perilous situation.
