Early's men were contending with the prisoners when machine gun fire suddenly peppered the area, killing six Americans and wounding three others. The fire came from German machine guns on the ridge. The loss of the nine put Corporal York in charge of the seven remaining U.S. soldiers. As his men remained under cover, guarding the prisoners, York worked his way into position to silence the German machine guns. York recalled: ...|$|E

50|$|On 30 June 1779 Clinton issued {{what has}} become known as the Philipsburg Proclamation (so named because it was issued from his {{headquarters}} at the Philipsburg Manor House in Westchester County, New York). This proclamation institutionalized in the British Army an offer of freedom to enlisted runaway slaves that had first been made in a similar proclamation by Virginia Governor Lord Dunmore in 1775. He justified this offer by citing the fact that the Continental Army was also actively recruiting African Americans. The proclamation led to a flood of fugitive slaves making their way to British <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the offer, and the issue of slave repatriation would complicate Anglo-American relations as the war was ending.|$|E

5000|$|Although most {{traffic on}} the Aire and Calder now passed through Goole, trade with York {{continued}} to use the Selby Canal. The town of Selby declined, {{although there was a}} brief upturn in its fortunes in 1834, following the opening of the Leeds and Selby Railway, which lasted until 1840, when the railway from Selby to Hull opened. Lengthening of the locks on the main Aire and Calder <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> compartment boats was completed by 1873, and the locks on the Selby line were rebuilt between 1885 and 1886. This work included Dole Bank Lock and Beal Lock, on the old course of the Aire, as well as Haddlesey Flood Lock and Selby Lock. The locks were made 78.5 by 16.5 ft, and the navigable depth was increased to 6 ft. The Aire and Calder remained highly successful, although little is heard of the Selby Canal after 1900.|$|E

5000|$|Common beachcasting {{techniques}} used in Britain include the common overhead cast, the off-the-ground Cast and the Pendulum cast.

5000|$|The {{film has}} {{received}} mixed to negative reviews from critics; Rotten Tomatoes maintains that 30% of 86 reviewers gave a positive review {{with an average}} score of 4.6/10. Entertainment Weekly said the film - [...] "theatrically ambitious, musically busy, {{and in the end}} cinematically inert - clearly reflects the authorship of myth-loving director Julie Taymor." [...] USA Today found that [...] "Mirren keeps the film on track. But incomprehensible shouting and pointless shenanigans obscure subtle moments." [...] In a similar vein, Newsweek said [...] "the films special effects, to a surprising extent, add little to the story", and that [...] "next to the concise power of Shakespeares language, the screen wizardry of even a resourceful director like Taymor seems like rough magic indeed". [...] However, The New Yorkers David Denby pointed out the films strengths, most particularly Helen Mirrens performance as Prospera: [...] "Mirren has the range and power to play a woman with unprecedented control of the elements, and over men, too." [...] Sandra Hall in The Sydney Morning Herald is more generous toward Taymors vision, saying, [...] "In the scene that explains the circumstances of mother and daughters banishment from the dukedom of Milan, Taymor has skillfully tweaked Shakespeares <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> account of her new scenario", and praising the films visual elements.|$|E

5000|$|... "It's {{official}} now. The {{municipality of}} Boston is no more. As of August 16, Governor James E.

Mayor Max A. Wood made the announcement earlier this week.In a straw vote election held on last April 23, 1956 citizens voted 120 for to 37 against to change the name of the town and extend the city limits.For many years only a part of the Boston-Brilliant community has been incorporated. Boston was incorporated while the area consisting of Brilliant was not.The town of Boston had its origins sometime {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. Alfred Wates opened the first store and later as the community grew, an early settler named Lee Beauchamp named it Boston for the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and also because the name tied in somewhat with the pioneer Bostick family who settled in the area about the time of the Civil War.Both Boston and Brilliant owe most of their early development and progress to the mines of the Aldredge and Brilliant Coal Companies. Brilliant began with the opening of coal mines around 1897.Mayor Wood said that the increase in population resulting from the extension of the corporate limits would mean more revenue from state sources as well as other advantages." ...|$|E

As his men remained under cover, guarding the prisoners, York worked his way into position to silence the German machine guns. York recalled: And those machine guns were spitting fire and cutting down the undergrowth all around me something awful. And the Germans were yelling orders. You never heard such a racket in all of your life. I didn't have time to dodge behind a tree or dive into the brush... As soon as the machine guns opened fire on me, I began to exchange shots with them. There were over thirty of them in continuous action, and all I could do was touch the Germans off just as fast as I could. I was sharp shooting... All the time I kept yelling at them to come down. I didn't want to kill any more than I had to. But it was they or I. And I was giving them the best I had. During the assault, six German soldiers in a trench near York charged him with fixed bayonets. York had fired all the rounds in his M1917 Enfield rifle, but drew his M1911 semi-automatic pistol and shot all six soldiers before they could reach him.|$|E
5000|$|Wackett later {{transferred}} to No. 3 Squadron AFC in France {{and played a}} significant role in the Battle of Hamel fought on 4 July 1918. Captured German documents revealed that they had been experimenting with dropping ammunition from aircraft and No. 3 Squadron was asked to investigate doing the same. Wackett was asked to do the work as his reputation had spread; 'he had a gift for mechanical inventions' according to his superiors. Now a captain, he devised a small parachute that could be used to drop supplies to troops, designed a modified bomb rack to hold the supplies and then trained No. 3 Squadron personnel in the required technique. General Monash's battle plan for Hamel involved resupplying the engaged machine-gunners with ammunition dropped by aircraft. In the event No. 3 Squadron was assigned other tasks during the battle and the ammunition dropping was performed by No. 9 Squadron RAF. Monash later wrote, [...] "at least 100,000 rounds of ammunition were dropped during the battle with obvious economy in lives and wounds. The method thus initiated became general in later months". Later that year, on 25 September, Wackett undertook a daring reconnaissance mission in 3 Squadron's first Bristol F.2 Fighter, when he penetrated six miles (10 km) behind enemy <b>lines</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> aerial photographs of the German Joncourt-Villers Outreaux line, that were needed for a forthcoming attack. Two days later he carried out an ammunition resupply flight to some isolated troops using the equipment he had designed. As a result of these two actions he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. By the end of the war two months later he had been promoted to the rank of major. On 6 January 1919 he was appointed the Commanding Officer of No. 7 Squadron AFC based at Leighterton in England. 7 Sqn. had acted as the training unit for No. 3 Squadron during the recent conflict and Wackett remained the CO until the Squadron was disbanded in March that year, at which time he returned to Australia.|$|E
