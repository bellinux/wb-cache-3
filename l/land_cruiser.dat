25|$|By {{the time}} the {{production}} of the original FJ40 ended in 1984, Toyota had shifted towards increasing the size and luxury of the <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> line.

25|$|The Toyota <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> {{that killed}} Rehman had the fake number plates LZN-6970. Investigations have {{revealed}} that the car number was actually registered {{in the name of}} Sufi Munawwar Hussain, a resident of Sahiwal district in Punjab province. The men driving the car were allegedly heavily armed and came from Davis's suburban house, raising concerns amongst officials that they were also CIA. The men, who had the same diplomatic visas as Davis, left the country after the U.S. refused Pakistani requests to interview them.|$|E

25|$|The {{vehicles}} (Clarkson's and May's Hilux, {{a second}} Hilux and a Toyota <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> {{for the film}} crew) started to be modified in December 2006 Whilst the vehicle testing was underway the presenters were sent to Austria for cold-weather training by an SAS veteran, who taught them basic survival skills.

25|$|The {{vehicles}} used in {{the special}} challenge to reach the Pole were two 2006 Toyota Hilux double cab 3.0l diesel pickup trucks, one Toyota <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> 120 and a trailer, {{all of which were}} heavily modified by Arctic Trucks. The choice of the Hilux was due to its exceptional durability, as demonstrated in an earlier episode of Top Gear when during a series of challenges a 1988 Hilux was proven to be able to stand up to all the tests the presenters could throw at it without any parts needing to be replaced. One Hilux was rigged with cameras for the presenters, whilst the others were used by the film crew, two driver/repair experts, and one polar expert.|$|E

25|$|In August 1977, an {{outbreak}} {{developed in a}} Somalian nomadic group of twenty families; eight children developed symptoms in August to October. On 12 October 1977, two children with smallpox symptoms were discovered at an encampment near the small inland settlement of Kurtunawarey, around 90km from Merca. Local officials drove the children to Merca, {{where there was a}} nearby isolation camp. Maalin, then aged 23, served as a guide to the party taking them in a closed <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> from the hospital where he worked either to the home of a surveillance supervisor or directly to the isolation camp. He {{is believed to have been}} infected during the journey, which lasted no more than 5–15 minutes. One of the children, a six-year-old girl named Habiba Nur Ali, died two days later. She was the last person to die from naturally acquired smallpox. The outbreak among the nomadic group was successfully contained by WHO workers by 18 October, but – critically – investigators failed to identify Maalin as a contact.|$|E
25|$|The Series III {{continued}} {{this success}} in the early 1970s, but {{from the middle of}} the decade sales declined. A large coal export deal to Japan relied on the subsequent import of Japanese cars and other goods, a combination of this increasing competition and increasingly poor quality of the components being shipped from Britain meant that Land Rover's dominance slipped. A problem specific to Australia was the always-limited supply of new Land Rovers. Leyland's factory never had the capacity to meet possible demand and the need to import almost the entire vehicle in kit form from Britain restricted the supply and manufacturing process further. This led to a long waiting list developing for the Leyland product whilst commercial operators could receive large fleets of Japanese vehicles very quickly. The other problems faced by Land Rover were the same throughout its export markets- compared to the Japanese competition, the Land Rover was underpowered, unreliable and slow with a poor ride quality, despite their superior off-road ability. Poor rust-proofing and low-quality steel used in comparison to the Japanese vehicles turned the buyers away in large numbers and by 1983, with the introduction of the One Ten, the Toyota <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> became the best-selling 4×4 in Australia.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota <b>Land</b> <b>Cruiser</b> Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving slowly down Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin ran back to the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E
