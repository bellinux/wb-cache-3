The method included the use of cartographic EEG and clinical procedure in a 10 -year-old boy with hyperactive syndrome and attention deficit disorder, who has theta dysfunction manifested in standard EEG. Cartographic EEG patterns was performed on NihonKohden Corporation, EEG - 1200 K Neurofax apparatus in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>bipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> assembly schedule by utilizing 10 / 20 International electrode positioning. Impedance was maintained below 5 kΩ, with not more than 1 kΩ differences between the electrodes. Lower filter was set at 0. 53 Hz and higher filter at 35 Hz. Recording was performed in a quiet period and during stimulation procedures that include speech and language basis. Standard EEG and Neurofeedback (NFB) treatment indicated higher theta load, alpha 2 and beta 1 activity measured in the cartographic EEG which was done after the relative failure of NFB treatment. After this, the NFB treatment was applied which lasted for six months, {{in a way that}} when the boy was reading, the visual input was enhanced to the left hemisphere and auditory input was reduced to the right hemisphere. Repeated EEG mapping analysis showed that there was a significant improvement, both in EEG findings as well as in attention, behavioural and learning disorders. The paper discusses some aspects of learning, attention and behaviour in relation to changes in the standard EEG, especially in cartographic EEG and NFB findings...|$|E

In addition, screening microprobe toxicity using cultures of human skin fibroblasts, the biocompatibility of these SU- 8 microprobes for neural interface applications, in particular, was specifically verified using primary cultures of two sensitive cell types found in peripheral nerves: purified Schwann cells and explanted dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and their fibers.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 This {{dissertation}} discusses {{various aspects}} of the fundamental development of fluorescence-enabled electrochemical microscopy (FEEM) into a useful analytical tool for electrochemical imaging and detection. Chapter 1 briefly introduces the technique of FEEM and discusses how {{it can be used to}} overcome current challenges in electrochemical imaging and low-level electrochemical sensing. Chapter 2 discusses the development of a new fluorogenic indicator reaction that makes possible the detection of electrochemical reduction reactions. This chapter also introduces a new fluorophore quenching scheme used to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of FEEM imaging. FEEM imaging is further developed in Chapter 3, which demonstrates the use of a <b>bipolar</b> <b>electrode</b> array to image dynamic concentration gradients in 2 - and 3 -dimensions.
