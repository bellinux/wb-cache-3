25|$|She later {{toured the}} country with Robert L. Downing in classic parts. In 1889 she {{appeared}} in her first Shakespeare play, As You <b>Like</b> <b>It,</b> <b>at</b> Augustin Daly's theater. During {{the course of the}} early 1890s she was managed by Daniel Frohman and appeared in his stock company. From 1892 to 1894 her career was managed by Daniel's brother, Charles Frohman. For a short period during 1891, and in between Frohman brothers, she was under the aegis of A. M. Palmer.|$|E
500|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Pink Moons release, Drake became increasingly asocial and distant from {{those close to}} him. He returned to live at his parents' home in Tanworth-in-Arden, and while he resented the regression, he accepted that his illness made it necessary. [...] "I don't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> home," [...] he told his mother, [...] "but I can't bear it anywhere else." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in 2013, Cher reflected on how her voice had evolved {{during the course of}} her career, eventually getting stronger and suppler over the years. While she didn't really <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the beginning, working with vocal coaches had made a significant difference; she stated in the Toronto Sun: [...] "It's so freaky because people my age are having to lose notes and I'm gaining notes, so that's pretty shocking." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the first}} {{recording}} session on 6 June 1962, Martin had one reservation, {{as he felt}} that using an experienced studio session drummer would improve the recording, rather than using Pete Best (this was normal practice at the time). Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison asked Epstein to sack Best when they learned that Martin wanted to replace him on their recordings. Epstein agonised about the decision, asking The Cavern Club's DJ Bob Wooler {{if it was a}} good idea. Wooler replied that Best was [...] "very popular with the fans" [...] who would not <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> all. Epstein dismissed Best on 16 August, over two and half months after the first recording session at EMI studios. Best was never given an explanation for his dismissal.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} leaving CSSD in 1987, Nesbitt {{got a bit}} part in Virtuoso, a BBC Two Screen Two {{television}} play {{about the life of}} John Ogdon. He worked for two days on the play, earning £250 per day. His first professional stage appearance came in the same year, when he played Keith in Up on the Roof. The musical ran at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, before transferring to the London West End. Nesbitt reprised the role when the production returned to Plymouth in early 1989. Roger Malone in The Stage and Television Today wrote that Nesbitt [...] "steals the show with the best lines and best delivery as he laconically squares up to life with an easy contentment". Nesbitt appeared in two other plays in 1989; in June, he played Dukes Frederick and Senior in Paul Jepson's As You <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> <b>at</b> the Rose Theatre Club, and then appeared in Yuri Lyubimov's version of Hamlet. Hamlet had been translated back to English from Boris Pasternak's Russian translation. It ran at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester for a month before a transfer to the Old Vic and then a nine-month world tour. Nesbitt played Guildenstern, Barnardo and the second gravedigger. He recalled that the play received [...] "shocking" [...] reviews, but was exciting.|$|E
500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't even <b>like</b> <b>it</b> <b>at</b> the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E

[...] In court, the judge Mr Justice Popplewell, caused hilarity by asking Christie to explain the phrase, asking [...] "What is 'Linford's lunchbox?'" [...] The {{reference}} became a part of pop culture, as evidenced in a joke by Nick Hancock: [...] "There's nothing new you can say about Linford Christie, except he's slow and has got a small penis".|$|E

Bush stated, [...] "I don't like it when a friend gets criticized. I'm loyal to my friends. All of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and a really fine person, is under fire. And so, do I like it? No, I don't <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> <b>at</b> all." [...] However, this speculation proved to be incorrect, as Bush nominated D.C.

2500|$|As her elder {{sister had}} done, Irene {{enrolled}} at Sarah Thorne's school of acting, based at Margate, which {{gave her a}} thorough practical grounding.

The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, [...] "Oh, that was really well sung," [...] or [...] "It was nearly perfect." ...|$|E
