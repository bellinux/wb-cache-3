2500|$|Raziel is {{voiced by}} Michael Bell {{in all of}} his appearances. In the series' fictional universe, he is {{described}} as an [...] "ex-vampire", a [...] "wraith", and a [...] "devourer of souls", characterized by his skeletal figure, brown cowl, tattered wings and tridactyl claws and feet. Throughout the games, he is required to consume souls to survive, travels between two planes of existence (the material and spectral realms) to solve puzzles, and wields the wraith-blade—a ghostly version of the Soul Reaver, an ancient sword inhabited by a sentient spirit. The design of his human incarnation in Soul Reaver 2 was inspired by the Roman era. According to Hennig, Raziel's role in the story conforms to that of a tragic hero. While writing dialogue, she considered it important to include character flaws in his personality, enabling him to act as a foil to series protagonist Kain. In Soul Reaver, Raziel is depicted with aspects of both villainy and heroism, and in Soul Reaver 2, Hennig deliberately portrayed him as [...] "kind of a self-righteous little twit" [...] with a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn.</b>|$|E

50|$|Hypofrontality {{is still}} not fully {{understood}} in its entirety, {{but there are a}} number of research projects that have been conducted, leading to progress in recognizing the signs of the symptom. Even though there is still a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> be <b>learned,</b> experiments on NK1R -/- mice has revealed the role of dopaminergic transmission in hypofrontality. Sagvolden and company conducted a loss-of function mutation where mutant mice lacked the NK1R protein resulting in a low dopaminergic transmission supporting the hypothesis of hypofrontality in ADHD. There has been fewer studies of hypofrontality in depressed patients and drug addiction compared to that of schizophrenia but neuroimaging reports signs of hypofrontality in depressed patients. With hypofrontality being linked to psychiatric diseases, depression, and drug addiction, there is a possibility that they all may have some common pathophysiological mechanism linking the diseases. Even with the large amounts of research on hypofrontality in schizophrenia, there is still a <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> be <b>learned</b> about its neuronal mechanisms.
