40|$|Froth {{flotation}} {{is widely}} used by the mining industry to concentrate <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> <b>metal</b> ores. It uses the differences in surface properties between particles of the desired mineral and waste material to separate them using a mineralised froth. The properties of this particle stabilised mineralised froth impact on {{the efficiency of the}} separation process. Due to its dynamic and unstable nature it is difficult to study and remains relatively poorly understood. A deeper insight into the fundamental froth properties can be gained by using computer modelling techniques. Here a series of models are developed using the Surface Evolver (Brakke 1992). They are used to investigate the effects of particle shape, hydrophobicity and packing arrangement on the critical capillary pressure of thin films. Three dimensional simulations of uniformly spaced spherical particles in the film are compared to existing two dimensional (2 D) analytical models. It is shown that 2 D models over predict the capillary pressure required to rupture the film. The models are developed further to simulate randomly distributed particles in a periodic film. The results are then used to derive an expression for film stability based on particle packing density and contact angle. The different possible failure modes of double layers of particles are also investigated and the conditions under which they occur identified. A versatile model for simulating non-spherical particles in an interface or film is also derived and used to find the energetically stable orientations of orthorhombic particles at an interface. This information is then used to investigate the effect of particle orientation on the capillary pressure required to rupture the film. It is shown that the combination of contact angle and shape affect the particle orientation. Certain orientations are then shown to reduce the critical capillary pressure of the film by up to 70 %.

40|$|The nickel of most {{lateritic}} ores {{is extracted}} as a FeNi alloy containing {{a certain amount}} of cobalt. The utilization of this ferroalloy is effectively limited to the fabrication of stainless steels, which absorbs about 40 pct of the total nickel consumption. The production of electrolytic nickel from ferronickel is feasible, but it requires anodes made of alloy enriched to at least 80 pct Ni. Such enrichment is complicated by the simultaneous oxidation of nickel during the slagging of iron, which accelerates as the iron is depleted and becomes prohibitive for an alloy with more than 60 pct Ni. A simple and economical upgrading of ferronickel up to 90 pct Ni is proposed by a two-stage converting with oxygen, under simultaneous addition of nickeliferous laterite. Nickel losses are effectively restricted by the two-stage operation. The rich slags of the second stage, produced in contact with an alloy of more than 60 pct Ni, are recycled in liquid state into the empty first stage converter. The subsequent addition of the <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> liquid <b>metal</b> into the first stage converter ""washes"" the rich slags and reduces their nickel content. The slags of the first stage, produced in contact with <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> alloys, contain little nickel and are discarded. The overall nickel loss is considerably reduced by blowing in short blows with intermediate slag skimmings. The addition of the lateritic ore, during converting, achieves a very satisfactory and inexpensive temperature control, substitutes as a flux, and introduces nickel and oxygen to the process at a very minimal cost. The heat evolved during the oxidation of the iron in the molten alloy is effectively utilized for the smelting of the laterite added. © 1976 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society - ASM International - The Materials Information Society...|$|R

40|$|Wraps are an unleavened, flat, and {{circular}} {{bread that}} is 1 - 2 mm thick. White bread flour made from wheat is extensively {{used in the}} manufacture of wraps in South Africa. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour is a by product of milling and {{can be used as a}} cheaper alternative to white bread flour. Its high phenolic content and associated antioxidant activity may offer potential health benefits such as reduction in the risk of lifestyle diseases related to oxidative stress. In addition, its relatively higher dietary fibre content offers potential anti-diabetic properties unlike white bread flour which has a high glycaemic index. However the weak gluten quality of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour can compromise the dough rheological properties and quality of wraps. Xanthan gum can improve weak gluten quality by mimicking the viscoelastic properties of gluten. Xanthan is also known to improve the quality of baked products. The objective of this research was to produce a health beneficial wrap of good quality using <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with added xanthan gum. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> wheat flour was used to manufacture wraps. Xanthan gum (0. 5 % and 0. 25 % (w/w)) was added to <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour. The dough rheological properties of the flour, the quality, and shelf life of the wraps were determined. White bread flour was used as a reference sample in this research. Water absorption, and Farinograph mixing stability of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour increased with increasing concentration of xanthan gum. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had similar mixing stability to white bread flour. Mixing tolerance index (MTI) of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour decreased with addition of xanthan gum, and the MTI of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum was similar to white bread flour. At 50 % flour hydration (constant hydration), as well as at flour hydration according to Farinograph water absorption (adapted hydration), the dough tenacity of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour was increased by the addition of xanthan gum, while the dough extensibility was decreased by xanthan gum addition. At adapted hydration, the dough extensibility of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the dough extensibility of white bread flour. The P/L ratio expresses the relationship between the dough strength, and the dough extensibility. The P/L ratio of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum had a value of 0. 5 which makes it suitable for bread making. The pasting viscosities of <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour increased with the addition of xanthan gum. Wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour did not puff during baking. Xanthan gum addition however did improve puffing in wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour. The puffing of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 5 % xanthan gum was similar to the puffing of wraps made from white bread flour. Wraps could only be stored for three days before mould growth was visible. Wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with 0. 25 % xanthan gum had the lowest rollability score, a lower modulus and higher extensibility over time. On day 0, all wraps exhibited a B-type crystallinity as determined by X-Ray diffractometer. The % crystallinity of all wraps increased over storage time. Percent crystallinity increased from 5 % to 11. 6 % for wraps made from white bread flour; for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour it increased from 7 % to 11 %; for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour; with added xanthan gum (0. 25 %) it increased from 7 % to 12 %, and for wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour with added xanthan gum (0. 5 %) it increased from 5. 1 % to 13 %. A thermogram peak on the DSC was only visible on day 3 of storage between 95 and 102 ◦C for the wrap made from white bread flour. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour were higher than those of wraps made from white bread flour. Simulated gastro-intestinal digests of the wraps had higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity than the acidified methanol extract. The relatively higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of wraps made from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour indicates that they may offer potential health benefits. <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> flour however produces a poor quality wrap, with a reduced shelf life. Addition of xanthan gum to <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> flour improves dough rheology, as well as the quality of wraps. This is possibly due to the interactions which occur between xanthan gum and wheat proteins, as well as between xanthan gum with the amylose of the starch molecule. The wraps with 0. 25 % xanthan gum produce wraps with a better quality. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2014. lk 2014 Food ScienceMScUnrestricte...|$|R

40|$|Aims The {{classification}} of abdominal mucinous neoplasia is a controversial area. In 2010, WHO published a classification which divides pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) into <b>low</b> and high <b>grades.</b> The {{aim of the}} authors was to correlate this classification with the prognosis and site of primary neoplasm. Methods The authors reviewed 274 patients with PMP who had undergone surgery at a single institution and classified them according to WHO criteria. The findings were correlated with clinical information and survival data. Results PMP was <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> in 78 % of patients and high grade in 22 %. The appendix accounted for 94 % of lesions, and the most common primary tumour was a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Colorectal primaries {{were more likely to}} be associated with high grade PMP. There was an excellent correlation between the grade of the PMP and the primary neoplasm; only two cases showed discordant morphology: both were high grade appendiceal adenocarcinomas that were associated with <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> PMP. Nodal metastases were more likely in high grade lesions, but there was no significant difference in the rate of parenchymal organ invasion between <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> and high <b>grade.</b> <b>Low</b> <b>grade</b> morphology was associated with significantly longer survival than high grade (overall 5 -year survival of 63 % for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> and 23 % for high grade). Conclusions Categorisation as either <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> or high grade by WHO criteria correlates with prognosis.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), a group of proteolytic enzymes with {{a central role in}} extracellular matrix invasion and degradation, in stromal sarcomas. METHODS: 11 endometrial stromal sarcomas (four <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours, seven high grade) were stained for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 using immunohistochemical stains. The surgical material consisted of nine hysterectomy specimens and two pelvic recurrences. Three hysterectomy specimens, removed for leiomyomas, were studied as controls. Staining area was evaluated using image analysis. RESULTS: Age at the time of diagnosis ranged from 21 to 67 years. Four of the 11 patients (three with high grade tumours and one with a <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumour) died of the disease, six remained free of disease, and one was lost to follow up. Staining for MMP- 2, MMP- 3, and MMP- 9 was more diffuse in high grade tumours than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours and controls. Staining for MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 was more pronounced in high <b>grade</b> than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours (p = 0. 04; p = 0. 05). Staining for MMP- 9 was significantly greater in all stromal sarcomas than in controls (p < 0. 001 for high grade tumours v controls; p < 0. 01 for <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours v controls). Diffuse staining for MMP- 2, exceeding 90 % of the tumour area, was observed in three of seven high grade tumours but in no <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours. There was no apparent correlation between staining for any of the three enzymes and survival. CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>low</b> and high <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal tumours express matrix metalloproteinases. MMP- 3 and MMP- 9 are expressed more diffusely in high <b>grade</b> than in <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours. In the individual case, diffuse staining for MMP- 2 appears to best characterise the high grade tumours. Thus staining for MMP- 2 may aid in differentiating high <b>grade</b> from <b>low</b> <b>grade</b> tumours, and MMP- 9 in differentiating normal endometrial stroma from <b>low</b> and high <b>grade</b> endometrial stromal sarcomas.
