5|$|James Van Hise and Hal Schuster {{wrote in}} their 1995 book, The Complete Next Generation, {{that they thought}} the {{relationship}} between Picard and Daren was believable, and that the story itself was very effective. They thought that the <b>loneliness</b> Picard feels {{at the end of}} the episode was part of an ongoing story which would culminate in the subplot about Picard's <b>loneliness</b> in Star Trek Generations.|$|E
5|$|Other drugs may be {{used only}} as coping {{mechanisms}} by individuals who have schizophrenia, to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, and <b>loneliness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 1883, Van Gogh {{moved to}} Drenthe in the {{northern}} Netherlands. In December, driven by <b>loneliness,</b> he {{went to live with}} his parents, then in Nuenen, North Brabant.|$|E
5|$|In {{her later}} life {{she was in}} a {{relationship}} with the Australian author I. A. R. Wylie; the two of them supported Radclyffe Hall during the obscenity trial of Hall's book, The Well of <b>Loneliness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{copyright}} protection for The Well of <b>Loneliness</b> expired in the European Union on 1 January 2014. Because of the URAA, {{copyright protection}} in the United States will continue until at least 2024.|$|E
5|$|The {{two women}} {{remained}} close for some time, and in 1928 were supporters of their close friend Radclyffe Hall, {{during the trial}} of The Well of <b>Loneliness.</b> When Barrett died she left the residue of her estate to Wylie.|$|E
5|$|Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. {{had planned}} to publish The Well of <b>Loneliness</b> in the United States {{at the same time}} as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the {{publication}} date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.|$|E
5|$|Because of the immigrants’ <b>loneliness</b> {{for their}} homeland, Addams started hosting ethnic evenings at Hull House. This would include ethnic food, dancing, music, {{and maybe a}} short lecture on a topic of interest. Some of the themed evenings were Italian, Greek, German, Polish, etc. Ellen Gates Starr {{described}} one Italian evening as having the room packed full with people. One of the ladies who attended “recited a patriotic poem with great spirit” and everyone was moved by it.|$|E
5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} <b>loneliness</b> compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
5|$|Hall, who had {{converted}} to the Roman Catholic Church in 1912, was devoutly religious. She {{was also a}} believer in communication with the dead who had once hoped to become a medium– a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned spiritualism. Both these beliefs {{made their way into}} The Well of <b>Loneliness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Radclyffe Hall drew a crowd after her novel The Well of <b>Loneliness</b> had been {{banned in the}} UK. A reading by poet Edna St. Vincent Millay packed the salon in 1932. At another Friday salon in the 1930s Virgil Thomson sang from Four Saints in Three Acts, an opera based on a {{libretto}} by Gertrude Stein.|$|E
5|$|Keith Foulcher, an Australian {{professor}} of Indonesian literature and language, {{writes that the}} poems published in Poedjangga Baroe were structurally based in reimaginings of traditional forms {{with an emphasis on}} aesthetic diction; thematically, he writes, the poems tended to deal with either lofty goals or a deep sense of <b>loneliness</b> in the midst of natural beauty. According to literary documentarian H.B. Jassin, the poems, though they adapted Western forms and Indonesian diction, retained Malay rhythms.|$|E
5|$|Mary soon {{experienced}} financial troubles, illnesses, and <b>loneliness.</b> In 1528, {{her aunt}} Margaret {{suggested that she}} should marry King James V of Scotland. Mary rejected the idea because she had loved her husband and did not wish another marriage. In 1530 Charles again suggested that she should remarry; he proposed to arrange a marriage to Frederick of Bavaria, who had unsuccessfully courted Mary's sister Eleanor sixteen years before. Mary rejected him as well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} was observed on July11, when a schooner encountered heavy seas {{to the south of}} the Florida Panhandle. As the hurricane moved westward, it remained a short distance off the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing strong winds to New Orleans on July12. High tides surrounded the lighthouse at Timbalier Bay for about 24hours, prompting the lighthouse keeper to resign from <b>loneliness</b> and from fear of the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} {{by a team of}} twelve people, who took two months to make a playable demo and three more to finish the game. Infinity Blade was intended to demonstrate the new iOS version of the Unreal Engine, and to combine the swordplay of Karateka and Prince of Persia with the <b>loneliness</b> of Shadow of the Colossus. The game received four free expansions that added new equipment, endings, and game modes.|$|E
5|$|The {{record was}} a {{departure}} from Jackson's previous work for Motown Records. Its lyrical themes on the record relate to escapism, liberation, <b>loneliness,</b> hedonism and romance. Several critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco, soft rock, jazz, Broadway and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained critical acclaim and recognition, and won the singer his first Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs on}} Devil's Halo {{featured}} an eclectic fusion of styles, including alternative rock, soul, and jazz-rock. Ndegéocello's spiritually complex and ambiguous lyrics spoke of romantic love and <b>loneliness,</b> among other themes. Released by Downtown Records on October 6, 2009, Devil's Halo charted modestly but was well received by most critics.|$|E
5|$|The story {{touches on}} many mature themes and taboo {{subjects}} including: morality, grief, abuse (physical, sexual, etc.), suicide, {{mental illness and}} mental health, death, trauma, rape, guilt, existentialism, bullying, domestic violence, incest, <b>loneliness,</b> body image, murder, substance abuse, pain and suffering, loss of loved ones, relationship issues, euthanasia, self-loathing, and sexuality among others.|$|E
5|$|Although the story's {{central theme}} is <b>loneliness,</b> it uses shoes and rain as motifs, along with Man'yōshū poetry and the Japanese garden {{in which it}} is set. Although rain is {{typically}} seen as sad and gloomy, in The Garden of Words it makes the world more vivid and protects the two main characters from the reality of their lives and the limitations imposed by society. Shinkai also noted a parallel between love and rain—that neither can be controlled or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's <b>loneliness</b> was {{relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|Coexist {{features}} a minimalist musical style with spatial arrangements, loose song structure, little dynamism, and experimentation with tension. Its songs are characterised by sparse {{elements such as}} simple chord progression, keyboard ostinatos, and fading motifs, while Smith's production incorporates both programmed beats and live percussion instruments. Coexist touches on themes of heartbreak, <b>loneliness,</b> and intimacy. The lyrics, written by guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist Oliver Sim, address a failing relationship and changes in a romance with inner monologues and simple metaphors.|$|E
5|$|Everyone offers their {{condolences to}} Ned, and Bart reluctantly plays a Christian video game with Rod and Todd. Homer accompanies Ned back {{home after the}} funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his <b>loneliness</b> and now having to raise his sons alone. To help him get on with his life, Homer {{secretly}} makes a videotape of Ned to show to single girls across Springfield. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, {{but none of them}} are successful.|$|E
5|$|His mysticism is {{informed}} by the influences of Böhme and Franckenberg {{as well as of}} prominent writers Meister Eckhart (1260–1327), Johannes Tauler (–1361), Heinrich Suso (–1366), and Jan van Ruysbroeck (1293/4–1381). Critic and literary theorist Georg Ellinger surmised in his study of Silesius that his poetry was influenced by <b>loneliness</b> (especially due to the death of his parents and becoming an orphan early in life), ungoverned impulsivity, and lack of personal fulfillment, rendering much of his poetry confessional and exhibiting internal psychological conflict.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1828 Greene married Mary Elizabeth Vinton, sister of his best friend at West Point, David Vinton. Elizabeth gave birth to three {{children}} {{over the next four}} years: Mary Vinton, George Sears, and Francis Vinton Greene. While assigned to Fort Sullivan in Eastport, Maine in 1833, tragedy struck Greene's family: Elizabeth and all three of their children died within seven months, probably from tuberculosis. To ease the pain on his mind and to escape the isolation and <b>loneliness</b> of peacetime Army garrison duty, he immersed himself in study of both the law and medicine, coming close to professional certification in both by the time he resigned his commission in 1836 to become a civil engineer.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse {{at the hands of}} his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from <b>loneliness.</b> He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of the Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E
5|$|Loveppears is {{the second}} studio album by Japanese {{recording}} artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released in Japan, Hong Kong and China on November 10, 1999 through Avex Trax and the China Record Corporation, and distributed worldwide on April 10, 2001 by Avex Entertainment Inc. It was entirely written by Hamasaki herself, while the production was handled by Japanese musician Max Matsuura. Musically, Loveppears is a dance album and lyrically focuses on themes of love, frustration of life, <b>loneliness,</b> and individualism.|$|E
5|$|O' Horten is a 2007 Norwegian {{language}} film {{directed by}} Bent Hamer. The film's title character Odd Horten is a habit-bound train driver, {{who is about}} to retire. On the day of his retirement he ends up in an unexpected situation, and is forced to reconsider his life. As in other films by Hamer, the themes are <b>loneliness</b> and old age, and the courage to take chances. O' Horten {{has been described as a}} film without a strong plot or a clear chronology.|$|E

Inside the N-field, Jun is forced into hiding by Kirakisho and contacts an adult version of himself from an alternate world. The adult Jun is able to free Shinku and unite the Rozen Maidens to defeat Kirakisho. Kirakisho returns and successfully captures all the Rozen Maidens' masters. The Rozen Maidens pursue her eventually resulting in most of their defeat except Shinku and Kirakisho. Shinku's sympathy towards Kirakisho's <b>loneliness</b> convinces the latter to surrender her Rosa Mystica. With all seven gathered, Shinku becomes Alice. Using her new powers, Shinku revives her sisters and is put into a coma in return.|$|E
5|$|Sukartono (abbreviated as Tono) is a doctor, Tini's {{husband and}} Yah's lover. He treats poor {{patients}} {{for free and}} thus is well-liked by the general populace. He is also {{a big fan of}} traditional kroncong music: in medical school he preferred to sing rather than study, and as a doctor he keeps a radio in his treatment room. Suffering from <b>loneliness</b> in his loveless marriage with the modern-minded Tini, he becomes involved with Yah, whom he perceives as being more willing to play the traditional wife. However, when Tini and Yah leave him, he is left alone.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{appears in}} the sky, and Azula's {{coronation}} takes place. Azula banishes nearly all of her subjects, haunted by the betrayals of former friends Mai and Ty Lee. Her paranoia and <b>loneliness</b> begin to drive her insane. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara arrive. Zuko accepts Azula's challenge to a one-on-one duel because he realizes Azula is distracted {{and he does not}} want Katara injured. Just as Zuko {{is on the verge of}} defeating Azula, she shoots a bolt of lightning at an unprepared Katara. Zuko throws himself in front of her and intercepts the lightning, preventing Katara from getting hurt, but gravely injuring himself.|$|E
5|$|Troubled by his {{constant}} anger, Chandru meets with {{a psychiatrist who}} advises him to marry soon so that he {{will no longer be}} lonely, saying the <b>loneliness</b> is leading him to dwell on his past and indulge in extreme acts. Chandru meets Rekha at a theatre and then at a book stall. He proposes to Rekha and even pleads with her to marry him. Surprised at his extreme pleading, Rekha politely informs him that she loves someone else (Ravi), and their marriage is already fixed. Raghunath is startled when Rekha tells him about Chandru's marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|When Lord Melbourne loses {{a vote in}} Parliament, the new Prime Minister designate, Sir Robert Peel, {{wishes to}} replace some of her ladies-in-waiting with {{supporters}} {{of his own party}} and the queen refuses. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation to form a new government, allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. Her <b>loneliness</b> during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and she decides to invite him back to Britain. Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage, she proposes to him herself.|$|E
5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, alienation and <b>loneliness.</b> Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having {{a heightened sense of}} reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Within the verse, Coleridge {{seeks to}} {{discover}} the environment that his friends are exploring because {{he is unable to}} join them. The poem links the lime-tree bower to the Quantocks where the Wordsworths, Lamb and Fricker were out walking. Although he is separated from them, the poet connects to his distant friends and they are able to share in a common view on life. The poem describes Coleridge's <b>loneliness</b> and solitude throughout, yet he is glad that his friends are able to experience nature. Because of this, he is able to tolerate his prison, which he views as merely physical rather than intellectual.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she enjoyed}} {{motherhood}} and assumed {{primary responsibility for}} rearing the children, Stanton found herself unsatisfied and even depressed {{by the lack of}} intellectual companionship and stimulation in Seneca Falls. Throughout this period of removal from the woman’s movement, Stanton kept in touch with Susan B. Anthony, and writing Anthony’s speeches became one of Stanton’s primary modes of involvement in the movement from afar. Additionally, Stanton often wrote Anthony letters about the difficulties of balancing domestic and public life, especially in a prejudiced society. As another antidote to the boredom and <b>loneliness,</b> Stanton became increasingly involved in the community and, by 1848, had established ties to similarly minded women in the area. By this time, she was firmly committed to the nascent women's rights movement and was ready to engage in organized activism.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen {{generate}} the most feedback from readers. Martin {{has stated that}} Tyrion is his personal favorite, as the grayest of the gray characters, with his cunning and wit making him the most fun to write. Martin has also said that Bran Stark is the hardest character to write. As the character most deeply involved in magic, Bran's story needs to be handled carefully within the supernatural aspects of the books. Bran is also the youngest viewpoint character, and {{has to deal with}} the series' adult themes like grief, <b>loneliness,</b> and anger. Martin set out to have the young characters grow up faster between chapters, but, as it was implausible for a character to take two months to respond, a finished book represents very little time passed. Martin hoped the planned five-year break would ease the situation and age the children to almost adults in terms of the Seven Kingdoms, but he later dropped the five-year gap (see section Bridging the timeline gap).|$|E
