The {{first one was}} because of a huge {{accident}} involving David Hunt (brother of former F1 champion, James Hunt) {{was involved in a}} massive shunt, clipping Claudio Langes' car as the cars front of them slowed down due to the Bertrand Gachot/Andy Wallace accident at the Zenith Turn (Hunt's car managed to punch a massive hole into a wholesalers' shop wall at the fast <b>Loctite</b> Corner). The second stoppage was due to an incident involving Russell Spence. After his car spun, blocking the road, a crane came to move his car. Spence was still in the car, and frantically waving at the crane driver to put his car down facing the right way. The car was lowered, but not in the right place and Spence got out of his car, and then the leaders {{got caught up in the}} incident. Roberto Moreno took the chequered flag after the 2nd restart, with Martin Donnelly and Martini in second and third respectively.|$|E

50|$|In its liquid form, {{cyanoacrylate}} {{consists of}} monomers of cyanoacrylate molecules. Methyl-2-cyanoacrylate (CH2=C(CN)COOCH3 or C5H5NO2) has a molecular weight equal to 111.1, a flashpoint of 79 °C, and a density of 1.1 g/ml. Ethyl 2-cyanoacrylate (C6H7NO2) has a molecular weight equal to 125 and a flashpoint of >75 °C. To facilitate easy handling, a cyanoacrylate adhesive is frequently formulated with an ingredient such as fumed silica {{to make it}} more viscous or gel-like. More recently, formulations are available with additives to increase shear strength, creating a more impact resistant bond. Such additives may include rubber, as in <b>Loctite's</b> Ultra Gel, or others which are not specified.|$|R

5000|$|In 1953, American {{professor}} Vernon K. Krieble developed anaerobic threadlocking adhesives in {{his basement}} laboratory at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. Krieble’s company, American Sealants, founded the <b>Loctite</b> brand, which was promoted as ushering {{in a new era}} of mechanical reliability by eliminating the vibrational loosening of mechanical fasteners, a frequent cause of machine failure. [...] In 1956, the name <b>Loctite</b> was chosen by Krieble’s daughter-in-law. The <b>Loctite</b> sealant made its official public debut at a press conference at the University Club of New York on July 26 of that year.|$|E

5000|$|During the 1960s, Eastman Kodak sold {{cyanoacrylate}} to <b>Loctite,</b> {{which in}} turn repackaged and distributed it under a different brand name [...] "Loctite Quick Set 404". In 1971 <b>Loctite</b> developed its own manufacturing technology and introduced its own line of cyanoacrylate, called [...] "Super Bonder". <b>Loctite</b> quickly gained market share, and by the late 1970s it was believed to have exceeded Eastman Kodak's share in the North American industrial cyanoacrylate market. National Starch and Chemical Company purchased Eastman Kodak’s cyanoacrylate business and combined it with several acquisitions made throughout the 1970s forming Permabond. Other manufacturers of cyanoacrylate include LePage (a Canadian company acquired by Henkel in 1996), the Permabond Division of National Starch and Chemical, Inc., which was a subsidiary of Unilever. Together, <b>Loctite,</b> Eastman and Permabond accounted for approximately 75% of the industrial cyanoacrylate market. [...] Permabond continued to manufacture the original 910 formula.|$|E

5000|$|This method {{proved to}} be inadequate, and the cam {{sprocket}} could break loose from the camshaft and spin independently from the camshaft (or [...] "walk"). This {{would result in the}} camshaft stopping and thus not activating the valves, allowing the pistons to hit the valves, ruining the engine. The preventive measure of welding the cam sprocket to the camshaft soon {{proved to be}} a fix for engines that had not suffered such a fate yet. Another such fix is [...] "pinning" [...] the cam sprocket, or inserting a pin in the sprocket to keep it aligned on the camshaft. Ford issued a TSB (TSB 03-14-1) prescribing the application of <b>Loctite</b> to the cam sprocket to lengthen the life of the camshafts, but as SHO owners have experienced cam failure after the application of <b>Loctite,</b> most SHO enthusiasts do not recommend this fix.|$|E

50|$|A {{less common}} headset failure {{is really a}} frame failure. The head tube can stretch, {{allowing}} a headset cup, {{which is supposed to}} be a tight interference fit, to become loose in the tube. Lugless frames are most vulnerable; in a lugged frame the lug reinforces the top and bottom of the head tube and generally prevents stretching of this type. A loose cup can be fixed with a retaining compound such as <b>Loctite</b> 660, and some manufacturers produce slightly oversized cups to cope with this situation. It is usually the lower cup that is affected.|$|E
