2500|$|Differentially {{methylated}} regions, are genomic {{regions with}} different methylation statuses among multiple samples (tissues, cells, individuals or others), {{are regarded as}} possible functional regions involved in gene transcriptional regulation. The identification of DMRs among multiple tissues (T-DMRs) provides a comprehensive survey of epigenetic differences among human tissues. For example, these methylated regions that are unique to a particular tissue allow individuals to differentiate between tissue type, such as semen and vaginal fluid. Current research conducted by Lee et al., showed DACT1 and USP49 positively identified semen by examining T-DMRs. DMRs between cancer and normal samples (C-DMRs) demonstrate the aberrant methylation in cancers. It {{is well known that}} DNA methylation is associated with cell differentiation and proliferation. Many DMRs have been found in the development stages (D-DMRs) [...] and in the reprogrammed progress (R-DMRs). In addition, there are intra-individual DMRs (Intra-DMRs) with <b>longitudinal</b> <b>changes</b> in global DNA methylation along with the increase of age in a given individual. There are also inter-individual DMRs (Inter-DMRs) with different methylation patterns among multiple individuals.|$|E

40|$|Impaired {{everyday}} functioning {{is a key}} diagnostic {{criterion of}} dementia, which is usually measured by questionnaires assessing Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Since their quality is questionable a new informant-based tool to measure IADL in dementia was developed, the Amsterdam-IADL-Questionnaire©,a (A-IADL-Q). This questionnaire {{was found to have}} good construct and content validity and high internal consistency. The aim of the current study was to assess the sensitivity to change of the A-IADL-Q. Participants were patients and informants who visited the Alzheimer Center of the VU University Medical Center at baseline and follow-up. First, we assessed the minimal change in score needed to detect change beyond measurement error. Then, to assess sensitivity to <b>change,</b> we related <b>longitudinal</b> <b>change</b> on the A-IADL-Q to diagnosis, caregiver burden, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>change</b> on cognitive measures and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>change</b> on another measure of functional ability. A total of 102 informants completed the A-IADL-Q. We found that a minimum difference of 11 points suggests actual change on the questionnaire. Furthermore, linear mixed modeling with random effects showed <b>longitudinal</b> <b>change</b> on the A-IADL-Q to differ between diagnosis and to be related to caregiver burden and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>change</b> in cognitive measures, even after controlling for age, gender and education. We found no significant relationship with another measure of functional ability, although the direction and magnitude of the correlation matched our expectations. Findings indicate the A-IADL-Q is sensitive to change over time in IADL functioning and can be used for evaluating treatment effects and the assessment of individual disease progress...|$|R
