5|$|The total lipid, or crude fat, content {{makes up}} 2.6% {{of the dry}} matter of the mushroom. The {{proportion}} of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: palmitic acid, 9.8%; stearic acid, 2.7%; oleic acid, 36.1%; linoleic acid, 42.2%, and <b>linolenic</b> acid, 0.2%.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and <b>linolenic</b> acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. <b>Linolenic</b> acid is then converted to jasmonic acid via the octadecanoid pathway and jasmonic acid activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of jasmonic acid. Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|Fatty acids, or {{fatty acid}} {{residues}} {{when they are}} part of a lipid, are a diverse group of molecules synthesized by chain-elongation of an acetyl-CoA primer with malonyl-CoA or methylmalonyl-CoA groups in a process called fatty acid synthesis. They are made of a hydrocarbon chain that terminates with a carboxylic acid group; this arrangement confers the molecule with a polar, hydrophilic end, and a nonpolar, hydrophobic end that is insoluble in water. The fatty acid structure is one of the most fundamental categories of biological lipids, and is commonly used as a building-block of more structurally complex lipids. The carbon chain, typically between four and 24 carbons long, may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be attached to functional groups containing oxygen, halogens, nitrogen, and sulfur. If a fatty acid contains a double bond, there is the possibility of either a cis or trans geometric isomerism, which significantly affects the molecule's configuration. Cis-double bonds cause the fatty acid chain to bend, an effect that is compounded with more double bonds in the chain. Three double bonds in 18-carbon <b>linolenic</b> acid, the most abundant fatty-acyl chains of plant thylakoid membranes, render these membranes highly fluid despite environmental low-temperatures, and also makes <b>linolenic</b> acid give dominating sharp peaks in high resolution 13-C NMR spectra of chloroplasts. This in turn plays an important role in the structure and function of cell membranes. Most naturally occurring fatty acids are of the cis configuration, although the trans form does exist in some natural and partially hydrogenated fats and oils.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and <b>linolenic</b> acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{cross-sectional}} {{studies have}} found associations between early androgenic alopecia, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome, with low HDL being the component of metabolic syndrome with highest association. <b>Linolenic</b> and linoleic acids, two major dietary sources of HDL, are 5 alpha reductase inhibitors. Premature androgenic alopecia and insulin resistance may be a clinical constellation that represents the male homologue, or phenotype, of polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, <b>linolenic,</b> malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|Like composition, fat {{globules}} vary in {{size from}} less than 0.2 to about 15 micrometers in diameter between different species. Diameter may also vary between animals within a species and at different times within a milking of a single animal. In unhomogenized cow's milk, the fat globules have an average diameter of two to four micrometers and with homogenization, average around 0.4 micrometers. The fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K along with essential fatty acids such as linoleic and <b>linolenic</b> acid are found within the milk fat portion of the milk.|$|E
25|$|Seed oils are {{the richest}} sources of α-linolenic acid, notably those of chia, perilla, {{flaxseed}} (linseed oil), rapeseed (canola), and soybeans. α-Linolenic acid is also {{obtained from the}} thylakoid membranes in the leaves of Pisum sativum (pea leaves). Plant chloroplasts consisting of more than 95 percent of photosynthetic thylakoid membranes are highly fluid due to large abundance of <b>linolenic</b> acid, that shows up as sharp resonances in high resolution carbon-13 NMR spectra, invariably. Some studies state that ALA remains stable during processing and cooking. However, other studies state that ALA might not be suitable for baking, as it will polymerize with itself, a feature exploited in paint with transition metal catalysts. Some ALA may also oxidize at baking temperatures. ALA percentages in the table below refer to the oils extracted from each item.|$|E
500|$|Brazil nut oil {{contains}} 75% unsaturated {{fatty acids}} composed mainly of oleic and <b>linolenic</b> acids, {{as well as}} the phytosterol, beta-sitosterol, and fat-soluble vitamin E. [...] Extra virgin oil can be obtained during the first pressing of the nuts, possibly for use as a substitute for olive oil due to its mild, pleasant flavor.|$|E
2500|$|Less {{aggressive}} frying {{temperatures are}} frequently used. A quality frying oil has a bland flavor, at least [...] smoke and [...] flash points, with maximums of 0.1% {{free fatty acids}} and 3% <b>linolenic</b> acid. Those oils with higher <b>linolenic</b> fractions are avoided due to polymerization or gumming marked by increases in viscosity with age. Olive oil resists thermal degradation and {{has been used as}} a frying oil for thousands of years.|$|E
2500|$|... α-Parinaric acid occurs {{naturally}} in {{the seeds of}} the makita tree (Parinari laurina), a tree found in Fiji and other Pacific islands. [...] Makita seeds contain about 46% α-parinaric acid, 34% α-eleostearic acid as major components, with lesser amounts of saturated fatty acids, oleic acid and linoleic acid. α-Parinaric acid is also found in the seed oil of Impatiens balsamina, {{a member of the family}} Balsaminaceae. The major fatty acids of Impatiens balsamina are 4.7% palmitic acid, 5.8% stearic acid, 2.8% arachidic acid, 18.3% oleic acid, 9.2% linoleic acid, 30.1% <b>linolenic</b> acid and 29.1% α-parinaric acid. It is also present in the fungus Clavulina cristata, and the plant Sebastiana brasiliensis (family Euphorbiaceae).|$|E
2500|$|The {{thylakoid}} membrane is {{the site}} of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis with the photosynthetic pigments embedded directly in the membrane. It is an alternating pattern of dark and light bands measuring each 1 nanometre. [...] The thylakoid lipid bilayer shares characteristic features with prokaryotic membranes and the inner chloroplast membrane. For example, acidic lipids can be found in thylakoid membranes, cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic bacteria and are involved in the functional integrity of the photosystems. The thylakoid membranes of higher plants are composed primarily of phospholipids and galactolipids that are asymmetrically arranged along and across the membranes. Thylakoid membranes are richer in galactolipids rather than phospholipids; also they predominantly consist of hexagonal phase II forming monogalacotosyl diglyceride lipid. Despite this unique composition, plant thylakoid membranes have been shown to assume largely lipid-bilayer dynamic organization. Lipids forming the thylakoid membranes, richest in high-fluidity <b>linolenic</b> acid are synthesized in a complex pathway involving exchange of lipid precursors between the endoplasmic reticulum and inner membrane of the plastid envelope and transported from the inner membrane to the thylakoids via vesicles.|$|E
2500|$|Humans usually become {{infected}} after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely {{in the morning}} and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch [...] "hotspots". Children may {{become infected}} more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and <b>linolenic</b> acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on plant oils.|$|E
50|$|The high-proportion of oxidation-prone <b>linolenic</b> acid is {{undesirable}} {{for some}} uses, such as cooking oils. Three companies, Monsanto Company, DuPont/Bunge, and Asoyia in 2004 introduced low <b>linolenic</b> Roundup Ready soybeans. Hydrogenation {{may be used}} to reduce the unsaturation in <b>linolenic</b> acid. The resulting oil is called hydrogenated soybean oil. If the hydrogenation is only partially complete, the oil may contain small amounts of trans fat.|$|E
50|$|Jasmonates (JA) are an oxylipin, i.e. a {{derivative}} of oxygenated fatty acid. It is biosynthesized from <b>linolenic</b> acid in chloroplast membranes. Synthesis is initiated with {{the conversion of}} <b>linolenic</b> acid to 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), which then undergoes a reduction and three rounds of oxidation to form (+)-7-iso-JA, jasmonic acid. Only the conversion of <b>linolenic</b> acid to OPDA occurs in the chloroplast; all subsequent reactions occur in the peroxisome.|$|E
