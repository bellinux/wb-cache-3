25|$|On an {{absolute}} scale, the lowest incomes saw the greatest gains in percentage terms {{and the highest}} incomes actually declined. Half {{of those in the}} bottom 20% in 1996 saw their income at least double during these years, and the median income of the top 1996 top 1% declined by 25.8%. The reason that the results are so inconsistent with household income statistics is that household statistics do not track the same people over time; it is important to specify how many of the households in the top 1% in a given year were still there when <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> category years later and gauging income gains.|$|E
25|$|<b>Looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> picture today {{makes me}} cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon {{the heart and soul of}} innocence.|$|E

500|$|After Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, the Black Hawks gave him {{permission}} {{to play for}} Team Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup tournament. Orr did not play in the 1972 Summit Series against the Soviet Union, and he wanted badly to play for Canada. Orr {{had been unable to}} play in the Summit Series due to knee surgery, although he did participate as a non-player. Orr's participation in the Canada Cup was considered ill-conceived and Eagleson later thought {{it may have been the}} 'last straw' that killed his career. Orr himself said that he knew before the tournament that [...] "I knew I didn't have much longer. That series didn't do it. I thought I could get the next season in, but not much after that.

2500|$|Neither Sherman nor Virgo made {{an effort}} to promote the album or contact other DJs. Reflecting on this, Gabriele of PopMatters felt that [...] "it's {{testament}} to the emotional resonance of the music itself that it grew over the years into something of an underground classic. Sanders has said: [...] "See Eric and I were so kinda, sometimes I actually kinda regret it, 'cause we were so detached from everything. [...] We were really just about the music. As soon as that was done, we were going back and still working on new stuff. We were <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> as just a foot in the door to do something even bigger." [...] As the Radical Records album was solely attributed to Virgo, confusion arose over the band's identity as it [...] "gained traction over the ensuing years."

[...] During the third song, [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", a fight erupted {{in the front of the}} crowd at the foot of the stage, prompting the Stones to pause their set while the Angels restored order. After a lengthy pause and another appeal for calm, the band restarted the song and continued their set with less incident until the start of [...] "Under My Thumb". Some of the Hells Angels got into a scuffle with Meredith Hunter, age 18, when he attempted to get onstage with other fans. One of the Hells Angels grabbed Hunter's head, punched him, and chased him back into the crowd. [...] After a minute's pause, Hunter returned to the stage [...] where, according to Gimme Shelter producer Porter Bibb, Hunter's girlfriend Patty Bredehoft found him and tearfully begged him to calm down and move further back in the crowd with her; but he was reportedly enraged, irrational and so high he could barely walk. Rock Scully, who could see the audience clearly from the top of a truck by the stage, said of Hunter, [...] "I saw what he was <b>looking</b> <b>at,</b> <b>that</b> he was crazy, he was on drugs, and that he had murderous intent. There was no doubt in my mind that he intended to do terrible harm to Mick or somebody in the Rolling Stones, or somebody on that stage." ...|$|E
