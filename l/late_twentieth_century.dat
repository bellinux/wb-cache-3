5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the <b>late</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed quite different from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E

5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the <b>late</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an important aspect of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E

5|$|The {{negative}} attitude towards Schubert's piano sonatas persisted {{well into the}} twentieth century. Only around the centennial of Schubert's death did these works begin to receive serious attention and critical acclaim, with the writings of Donald Francis Tovey, and the public performances of Artur Schnabel and Eduard Erdmann. During the following decades, the sonatas, and especially the final trilogy, received growing attention, {{and by the end}} of the century, came to be regarded as essential members of the classical piano repertoire, frequently appearing on concert programs, studio recordings, and musicological writings. Some <b>late</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> scholars have even argued that Schubert's last sonatas should rank together with Beethoven's most mature sonatas. The B-flat Sonata, the last of them all, has gained the highest acclaim and popularity among the three.|$|E
5|$|A. H. A. Hogg {{identified}} {{four types}} of hillfort: contour forts, promontory forts, cliff forts and ridge forts. Contour forts, where banks and ditches are moulded {{to the shape of}} the hill, are the dominant form in Scotland. Less significant are promontory forts, usually employing coastal features, such as the largest one in Scotland at the Mull of Galloway. Different types of defensive style occurred throughout the Iron Age period, some of which may have been a response to Roman siege warfare. There were different combinations in the use of earth, stone or timber. Timber was frequently in-filled with stone or other materials. In continental Europe the timber is often arranged vertically, but in Scotland horizontal timbers were more common. The function of hillforts has been much debated. It was traditionally assumed that they were primarily defensive in nature, but in the <b>late</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> this view began to be questioned and social, ritual and religious functions were emphasised.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, puffin numbers {{increased}} considerably in the <b>late</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> in the North Sea, including on the Isle of May and the Farne Islands where numbers increased by about 10% per year. In the 2013 breeding season, nearly 40,000 pairs were recorded on the Farne Islands, {{a slight increase}} on the 2008 census and on the previous year's poor season {{when some of the}} burrows flooded. This number is dwarfed by the Icelandic colonies with five million pairs breeding, the Atlantic puffin being the most populous bird on the island. In the Westman Islands, where about half Iceland's puffins breed, the birds were almost driven to extinction by overharvesting around 1900 and a thirty-year ban on hunting was put in place. When stocks recovered, a different method of harvesting was used and now hunting is maintained at a sustainable level. Nevertheless, a further hunting ban covering the whole of Iceland was called for in 2011, although the puffin's lack of recent breeding success was being blamed on a diminution in food supply rather than overharvesting. Since 2000, a sharp population decline has been seen in Iceland, Norway, Faroe Islands and Greenland. A similar trend has been seen in the United Kingdom, where an increase in 1969-2000 appears to have been reversed. For example, the Fair Isle colony was estimated at 20,200 individuals in 1986, but it had been almost halved by 2012. Based on current trends, it is estimated that the European population will decline by 50-79% between 2000 and 2065.|$|E
