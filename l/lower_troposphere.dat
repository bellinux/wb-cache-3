5|$|During the {{afternoon}} hours of February10, 2009, a strong, {{middle and upper}} storm system moved across the Four Corners region into the central and southern Great Plains. A moist, low-level air mass streamed northward across Texas and Louisiana into eastern Oklahoma and the Ozarks ahead of the system. Daytime heating of the moistening boundary layer increased throughout {{the afternoon}} across Oklahoma and Texas as cloud cover shifted eastward. Cooling aloft, {{in conjunction with the}} approaching storm system, led to atmospheric instability, resulting in thunderstorms. A very strong wind field increased with height through the <b>lower</b> <b>troposphere,</b> resulting in a wind shear favorable for rotation in the thunderstorms.|$|E

40|$|Tethered balloon-borne aerosol {{measurements}} were conducted at Syowa Station, Antarctica during the 46 th Japanese Antarctic expedition (2005 – 2006). The CN concentration reached a maximum in the summer, {{although the number}} concentrations of fine particles (Dp > 0. 3 μm) and coarse particles (Dp > 2. 0 μm) increased during the winter-spring. The CN concentration was 30 – 2200 cm− 3 near the surface (surface – 500 m) and 7 – 7250 cm− 3 in the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> (> 1500 m). During the austral summer, higher CN concentration was often observed in the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere,</b> where the number concentrations in fine and coarse modes were remarkably lower. The frequent appearance of higher CN concentrations in the free troposphere relative to continuous aerosol measurements at the ground strongly suggests that new particle formation {{is more likely to}} occur in the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> in Antarctic regions. Seasonal variations of size distribution of fine-coarse particles show that the contribution of the coarse mode was greater in the winter-spring than in summer because of the dominance of sea-salt particles in the winter-spring. The number concentrations of fine and coarse particles were high in air masses from the ocean and mid-latitudes. Particularly, aerosol enhancement was observed not only in the boundary layer but also in the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> during and immediately after Antarctic haze events occurring in May, July, and September...|$|R

500|$|Three notable medicanes {{developed}} in 1996. The first, in mid-September1996, {{was a typical}} Mediterranean tropical cyclone that {{developed in}} the Balearic Islands region.

On the morning of 12September, a disturbance developed off of Valencia, Spain, dropping heavy rainfall on the coast even without coming ashore.

Besides the more common suggestion to inject sulfur compounds into the stratosphere to approximate the effects of a volcanic winter, the injection of other chemical species such as the release of a particular type of soot particle to create minor [...] "nuclear winter" [...] conditions, has been proposed by Paul Crutzen and others.

40|$|First {{long-term}} {{observations of}} South American biomass burning aerosol within the tropical <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> are presented. The observations were conducted between 2007 and 2009 {{at a high}} altitude station (4765 m a. s. l.) on the Pico Espejo, Venezuela. Sub-micron aerosol volume, number concentrations of primary particles and particle absorption were observed. Orographic lifting and shallow convection leads to a distinct diurnal cycle at the station. It enables measurements within the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> during night time and observations of boundary layer air masses during day time and at their transitional regions. The seasonal cycle is defined by a wet rainy season and a dry biomass burning season. The particle load of biomass burning aerosol is dominated by fires in the Venezuelan savannah. Increases of aerosol concentrations could not be linked to long-range transport of biomass burning plumes from the Amazon basin or Africa due to effective wet scavenging of particles. Highest particle concentrations were observed within boundary layer air masses during the dry season. Ambient sub-micron aerosol volume reached 1. 4 ± 1. 3 μm 3 cm − 3, heated (300 °C) particle number concentrations 510 ± 420 cm − 3 and the absorption coefficient 0. 91 ± 1. 2 Mm − 1. The respective concentrations were lowest within the <b>lower</b> free <b>troposphere</b> during the wet season and averaged at 0. 19 ± 0. 25 μm 3 cm − 3, 150 ± 94 cm − 3 and 0. 15 ± 0. 26 Mm − 1. A decrease of particle concentrations during the dry seasons from 2007 – 2009 could be connected to a decrease in fire activity in the wider region of Venezuela using MODIS satellite observations. The variability of biomass burning is most likely linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Low biomass burning activity in the Venezuelan savannah was observed to follow La Niña conditions, high biomass burning activity followed El Niño conditions...|$|R
40|$|Originally, the VAS {{split window}} {{channels}} {{were designed to}} use the differential water vapor absorption between 11 and 12 microns to estimate sea surface temperature by correcting for the radiometric losses caused by atmospheric moisture. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to reverse the procedure in order to estimate the vertically integrated low level moisture content with the background surface (skin) temperature removed, even over the bright, complex background of the land. Because the <b>lower</b> <b>troposphere's</b> water vapor content is an important factor in convective instability, the derived fields are of considerable value to mesoscale meteorology. Moisture patterns are available as quantitative fields (centimeters of precipitable water) at full VAS resolution (as fine as 7 kilometers horizontal resolution every 15 minutes), and are readily converted to image format for false color movies. The technique, demonstrated with GOES- 5, uses a sequence of split window radiances taken once every 3 hours from dawn to dusk over the Eastern and Central United States. The algorithm is calibrated with the morning radiosonde sites embedded within the first VAS radiance field; then, entire moisture fields are calculated at all five observation times. Cloud contamination is removed by rejecting any pixel having a radiance less than the atmospheric brightness determined at the radiosonde sites...|$|R
