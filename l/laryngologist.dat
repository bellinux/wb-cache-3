500|$|Further {{recognition}} of his work came when Negus was made Hunterian Professor at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1925, followed three years later in 1928 by the awarding of the triennial John Hunter Medal (1925–7) from the Royal College of Surgeons, which came with a prize of £50. The following year Negus published his observations and conclusions in The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929), a [...] "classic piece of research" [...] still referred to forty-five years later in 1974 as [...] "the standard reference book" [...] on this topic. Negus's work had shown that the main function of the larynx is as a valve that only allows air into the lower respiratory tract. In humans, the voice is only a byproduct of this more vital function. Another lecture resulting from this work was given {{under the auspices of}} the University of London's Semon Lectureship, named after the German-born British <b>laryngologist</b> Felix Semon (1849–1921). This talk was delivered on 6 November 1930 at the Royal Society of Medicine under the title [...] "Observations on Semon's Law".|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} analyze {{differences}} {{in the evaluation of}} laryngopharyngeal neuropathy by <b>laryngologists</b> in the United States and Europe. Methods: Members of the American Laryngological Association (ALA) and the European Laryngological Society (ELS) were surveyed. Questionnaires were ennailed to all 179 members of the ALA and all 324 members of the ELS. Results: Of the ALA members surveyed, 40 (23. 3 %) responded, compared to 72 members (22. 2 %) of the ELS group. Of the ALA respondents, 79. 5 % identified laryngology as their primary area of practice, whereas 56. 9 % of ELS respondents identified devoting more than 50 % of their practice to laryngology. Of ELS <b>laryngologists,</b> 81. 1 % received training in laryngology or associated subspecialties. For diagnosing laryngopharyngeal neuropathy, the average comfort level on the Likert scale was significantly greater for ALA members than ELS members (P <. 01). Furthermore, ALA <b>laryngologists</b> were less likely to consider laryngopharyngeal reflux as an overdiagnosed condition compared to ELS <b>laryngologists</b> (P <. 05). Conclusion: <b>Laryngologists</b> in the United States and Europe vary significantly in their familiarity with laryngopharyngeal neuropathy. This could reflect either differences in awareness concerning this condition or a more critical perspective of European providers regarding the chronic laryngopharyngeal neuropathy (CLPN) diagnosis. As CLPN is still lacking definitive proof, the addition of European researchers could aid in validating CLPN and determining its overall effect on the chronic cough population...|$|R

500|$|Despite the {{operations}} on {{his throat and}} having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse, and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports {{that his father was}} gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg consulted the distinguished <b>laryngologist</b> Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the hoarseness to a [...] "momentary chill." [...] However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.|$|E
500|$|These earlier {{works were}} {{followed}} after the Second World War by {{the publication of}} Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Larynx (1949). This work was a condensed and updated version of Negus's original 1929 work on the larynx. It was in this post-war period that Negus would increasingly study {{the function of the}} nose, both as the organ for the sense of smell (olfaction) {{and the role of the}} nose in respiration. This was prompted by wartime damage in 1941 to the Royal College of Surgeons' Hunterian Museum, which included the loss of parts of the Onodi Collection. This collection had contained specimens of the accessory sinuses (paranasal sinuses) prepared by the Hungarian <b>laryngologist</b> Adolf Onodi (1857–1919) and demonstrated by him in 1900. Negus undertook to replace the destroyed and damaged specimens and to extend the collection with animal specimens. This work was covered in Negus's Hunterian Lecture, delivered on 20 May 1954 at the Royal College of Surgeons under the title [...] "Introduction to the Comparative Anatomy of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses". This was followed four years later by the publication of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Nose and Paranasal Sinuses (1958). Much of this later work was carried out after retirement in 1952, both at the laboratories of the Royal College of Surgeons and at the Ferens Institute of Otolaryngology at the Middlesex Hospital. Negus's research over many years on these topics and their relation to nose and throat surgery led to the awarding of the 1954 Lister Medal. This was presented the following year when Negus delivered the Lister Oration on 5 April 1955 at the Royal College of Surgeons. The oration was titled [...] "The Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Respiratory Tract in Relation to Clinical Problems". Ten years later, towards the end of his life, Negus published The Biology of Respiration (1965).|$|E

40|$|SummaryProper {{diagnosis}} of laryngeal benign lesions still brings doubts among experienced <b>laryngologists,</b> despite current diagnostic progress. Aim: {{the goal of}} this study was to compare telelaryngoscopy (preoperative) with suspension laryngoscopy (intraoperative) on the {{diagnosis of}} vocal fold benign lesions. Materials and Methods: We carried out a restrospective study analyzing 79 charts from patients followed up in a University Hospital. In all the charts there was at least diagnostic hypothesis suggested by telelaryngoscopy, which was later on compared to intraoperative findings of suspension laryngoscopy. Results: Almost two-thirds of the patients were females, with ages varying between 12 and 66 years (mean of 37 years). Of the 79 patients studied, we diagnosed 95 lesions with telelaryngoscopy and 124 with suspension laryngoscopy. The most frequently found benign lesion was the vocal polyp in both methods. In 64. 5 % of the cases the diagnosis of the lesions in the outpatient ward was the same as those in the surgical findings. Conclusion: <b>Laryngologists</b> must be prepared to alter their surgical planning and treatment approaches because of diagnostic changes that may happen during surgery...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Ministry of Health and Medical Education of Iran, {{and similar}} {{institutions}} {{in many other}} countries, advises physicians to use current guidelines for the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} acute otitis media (AOM). However, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of such guidelines or whether physicians in Iran adhere to them. Thus, as <b>laryngologists</b> are the most important group of people who interact with patients with AOM, the aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the attitude of <b>laryngologists</b> to the established guidelines.  Materials and Methods: A total of 120 anonymous surveys were mailed to 120 otolaryngologists in Tehran, Iran, to evaluate the patterns of diagnosis and treatment of AOM used by these physicians. The survey included questions regarding the otolaryngologists’ age, gender, place of work, and attitude towards diagnosis and treatment of AOM.  Results: Sixty-two completed surveys were received, for a response rate of 51 %. There was no significant difference between respondents to these surveys according to sex, age, practice setting, graduation year, or the number of patients with AOM seen each month.  Conclusion: Our study adds new insights to the previous literature on the use of guidelines in the management of AOM. We can now assess the impact of guidelines on the usual practice of physicians in evidenced-based management of AOM...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Although {{high-speed}} imaging (HSI) {{has been}} identified as a valuable tool in phonatory biomechanics research, to date, there have only been a selected number of reports investigating the clinical utility of HSI. We aim to elucidate the role of HSI in the diagnosis of the dysphonic patient. Methods: The video files from 28 consecutive dysphonic patients with concurrently acquired videostroboscopy and HSI were retrospectively collected. Stroboscopy video files were edited to include vibratory motion only. Videos were then anonymously and randomly presented to four academic <b>laryngologists.</b> Experts were asked to assign a single best diagnosis for each video file. Assigned diagnoses were then compared with treatment diagnoses conferred based on medical history, phonatory evaluation, laryngeal examination, and response to treatment. Results: Interrater analysis for the four <b>laryngologists</b> demonstrated significant and meaningful correlations for the diagnoses of polyps, cysts, nodules, and normal examination using stroboscopy (kappa > 0. 40, P 0. 40, P < 0. 001). Combined intrarater analysis performed by comparing single rater's diagnosis for single patient across both modalities resulted in poor correlation without statistical significance (kappa = 0. 30, P = 0. 07). Both stroboscopy- and HSI-assigned diagnoses matched the treatment diagnoses at equal predicted frequencies (32. 3 %), as demonstrated through multivariate logistic regression analysis (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Overall, HSI did not improve the diagnostic accuracy above stroboscopy alone. Although specific laryngeal states such as presbyphonia may be better diagnosed with HSI, further studies are required to define HSI's precise role in the clinical setting. © 2013 The Voice Foundation...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and {{therapeutic}} office-based procedures under topical anesthesia are {{emerging in the}} daily practice of <b>laryngologists</b> and head and neck surgeons. Since {{the introduction of the}} transnasal esophagoscope, office-based procedures for the esophagus are increasingly performed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of literature on office-based procedures under topical anesthesia for the esophagus. RESULTS: Transnasal esophagoscopy is an extensively investigated office-based procedure. This procedure shows better patient tolerability and equivalent accuracy compared to conventional transoral esophagoscopy, as well as time and cost savings. Secondary tracheoesophageal puncture, esophageal dilatation, esophageal sphincter injection, and foreign body removal are less investigated, but show promising results. DISCUSSION: With the introduction of the transnasal esophagoscope, an increasing number of diagnostic {{and therapeutic}} office-based procedures for the esophagus are possible, with multiple advantages.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of stroboscopic variations {{in a normal}} sample has been created. To most sub-specialized <b>laryngologists</b> and voice therapists, the results confirm primarily anecdotal experience concerning {{the nature of the}} various stroboscopic findings. The analysis provides epidemiologic data inferring the normalcy, or likelihood of pathology, of non-symmetric stroboscopic variations, thus providing evidence in support of intervention, or observation. This analysis may serve as a foundation, promoting further analyses of targeted populations for further epidemiological, normative, and descriptive purposes. For many otolaryngologists just beginning to use videostroboscopy, this analysis illustrates the wide range of normal variations, and provides a reference point from which presumed abnormal findings may be compared. For the voice researcher, the results may encourage modeling of common stroboscopic variations, to provide a more accurate representation of the intricate and complex physiology of normal voice production...|$|R
