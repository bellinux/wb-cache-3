Armitage's designs are hand-drawn, unlike the computer-generated wallpaper that is the current industry trend.

50|$|The first rotary <b>offset</b> <b>lithographic</b> <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> {{was created}} in England and {{patented}} in 1875 by Robert Barclay. This development combined mid-19th century transfer printing technologies and Richard March Hoe's 1843 rotary <b>printing</b> press—a <b>press</b> that used a metal cylinder instead of a flat stone. The offset cylinder was covered with specially treated cardboard that transferred the printed image from the stone {{to the surface of}} the metal. Later, the cardboard covering of the offset cylinder was changed to rubber, which is still the most commonly used material.|$|R

Strain sensitive structures printed via an unmodified <b>offset</b> <b>lithographic</b> <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> using a silver loaded conductive ink have been deposited concurrently with circuit interconnect, to form an electronic smart packaging system. A system populated with SMT components has proven successful in interpreting and logging deformation incidences subjected to a package during testing. It is proposed that with further development such a system could be printed in sync with packaging graphics using a single printing process to form an integrated time – strain monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis project {{conducted}} a market research study of printers {{as well as}} print buyers. The digital <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> that were used are the Xeikon, Indigo, GTO-DI, versus the conventional <b>offset</b> <b>lithographic</b> <b>printing</b> <b>presses.</b> A market analysis was conducted {{to determine how much}} a particular job would cost if it were to be printed on any of these presses. These figures are based on different quantities (printing volume) and different time frames (turnaround times). Samples from each press were presented to various print buyers with a questionnaire and scenarios. Based on the results, a break-even analysis between digital <b>printing</b> and <b>offset</b> lithography was conducted. The questionnaire determined how much more print buyers {{are willing to pay for}} quicker turn around and also when print buyers would choose digital over <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> (i. e. type of work). These results clarify many questions regarding cost/benefit ratios for digital printing. Furthermore, this study assists managers of printing firms in their deliberation of the world of digital printing. This analysis provides them with a better vision of the future market for digital printing...|$|R

Emerald does not grant permission {{for this article}} to be further copied/distributed or hosted elsewhere without the express permission from Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Purpose – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report on the feasibility of the manufacture of printed rechargeable power sources incorporating, in the first instance, electrode structures from the previous study, and moving on to improved electrode structures fabricated, via flexographic printing, using commercially available inks. It has been shown previously that offset lithography, a common printing technique, can be used to make electrodes for energy storage devices such as primary cells. Design/methodology/approach – A pair of the original Ag/C electrodes, <b>printed</b> via <b>offset</b> lithography, were sandwiched together with a PVA-KOH gel electrolyte and then sealed. The resultant structures were characterised using electrochemical techniques and the performance as supercapacitors assessed. Following these studies, electrode structures of the same dimensions, consisting of two layers, a silver-based current collector covered with a high surface area carbon layer, were printed flexographically, using inks, on a melinex substrate. The characterisation and assessment of these structures, as supercapacitors, was determined. Findings – It was found that the supercapacitors constructed using the <b>offset</b> <b>lithographic</b> electrodes exhibited a capacitance of 0. 72 mF/cm 2 and had an equivalent series resistance of 3. 96 Ω. The structures fabricated via flexography exhibited a capacitance of 4 mF/cm 2 and had an equivalent series resistance of 1. 25 Ω The supercapacitor structures were subjected to bending and rolling tests to determine device performance under deformation and stress. It was found that supercapacitor performance was not significantly reduced by bending or rolling. Originality/value – This paper provides insight into the use of printed silver/carbon electrodes within supercapacitor structures and compares the performance of devices fabricated using inks for <b>offset</b> <b>lithographic</b> <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> and those made using commercially available inks for flexographic printing. The potential viability of such structures for low-end and cheap energy storage devices is demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Automatic {{and robust}} ink feed control in a web- fed <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> is the {{objective}} of this work. To achieve this goal an integrating controller and a multiple neural models-based controller are combined. The neural networks-based printing process models are built and updated automatically without any interaction from the user. The multiple models-based controller is superior to the integrating controller as the process is running in the training region of the models. However, the multiple models-based controller may run into generalisation prob- lems if the process starts operating in a new part of the input space. Such situations are automatically detected and the integrating controller temporary takes over the process control. The developed control configuration has success- fully been used to automatically control the ink feed in the web-fed <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> <b>press</b> according to the target amount of ink. Use of the developed tools led to higher print quality and lower ink and paper waste...|$|R
50|$|Offset ink is a {{specific}} type of ink used in conjunction with <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> <b>presses</b> such as those used to produce letterpress or lithography prints. Such ink must be specially formulated to resist other chemicals it will come in contact with on the <b>printing</b> <b>press.</b> It is crucial that offset ink resist water-in-ink emulsification (e.g. repel rather than absorb water). It should also withstand degradation by the fountain solution which covers the non-printing areas of the engraved plate.|$|R

50|$|C. J. Bucher AG {{was taken}} over by the Ringier {{printing}} company in 1973. The new owners saw no interest in Camera, yet instead of ending the publication altogether, Ringier thought that by withdrawing all but a minimum promotional support, readership interest would dwindle and the magazine would find a natural end on its own. One of the first limitations Ringier would impose was a switch to the faster and cheaper <b>lithographic</b> <b>offset</b> <b>printing</b> system rather than the slower and more expensive sheet-fed gravure technology used until then. Porter, having reservations about how Cameras readership would react to the drop in printing quality, with the help of technicians from the still-functioning gravure department, managed to develop a two-colour duplex offset system that would at the same time cut costs and maintain quality.|$|R
