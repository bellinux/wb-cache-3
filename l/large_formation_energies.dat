Using the Modified Embedded Atom Method as the interatomic potential, defect <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> {{are found to}} depend greatly on both the specie of the defect and the surrounding local environment. Ga vacancies are found to have considerably <b>larger</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> than Pu vacancies, due to {{the change in the}} nearest neighbour Pu–Ga ordering. Point vacancy and point interstitial migration involving Ga atoms or Pu atoms in regions close to substitutional Ga, results in much higher energy barriers than for migration in pure Pu. OTF-KMC calculations show that this leads to defect migration pathways confined to areas of high Pu concentration, with the degree of confinement dependent on the location and ordering of the substitutional Ga. Vacancy migration takes place only through displacing Pu atoms and split Ga interstitials become almost instantaneously substitutional, displacing a Pu atom. The results indicate that the presence of Ga within the Pu matrix has a significant effect on the recovery of point defects...|$|R

The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that the defect formation is a complex multi-body collision process (a small collision cascade) where the atom that receives a recoil energy can also bounce back, or kick another atom back to its lattice site.

40|$|Intrinsic interstitials in GaAs {{are known}} to have a <b>large</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> that makes their {{concentration}} almost negligible in as-grown materials. However, interstitials must be explicitly considered in implanted GaAs where collision cascades, induced by the energetic ions, produce a large amount of Frenkel defects: these, indeed, can be considered as a source of interstitials that can migrate and evolve in larger aggregates. Due to the wide relaxation pattern induced by intrinsic interstitials, large supercells are necessary to avoid artifacts that, in practice, make ﬁrst-principles calculations too computationally demanding, even for complexes involving just three interstitials. Following previous papers on di-interstitials, this paper reports on the structural, stability, and electronic properties of I 3 complexes, depending on the topology and the stoichiom- etry, approached by semiempirical tight-binding molecular dynamics and damped dynamics. I 3 complexes reveal a strong tendency to form these structures, and a stability hierarchy is determined between them. All the stable and metastable structures have been studied regarding the electronic structure, the charge distribution through the Mulliken analysis, the localization of the defect related wave function, and the local lattice strain ﬁeld around the complex.

40|$|B {{migration}} in Si and Ge matrices raised a vast attention {{because of its}} inﬂuence on the production of conﬁned, highly p-doped regions, {{as required by the}} miniaturization trend. In this scenario, the diffusion of B atoms can take place under severe conditions, often concomitant, such as very large concentration gradients, non-equilibrium point defect density, amorphous-crystalline transition, extrinsic doping level, co-doping, B clusters formation and dissolution, ultra-short high-temperature annealing. In this paper, we review a large amount of experimental work and present our current understanding of the B diffusion mechanism, disentangling concomitant effects and describing the underlying physics. Whatever the matrix, B {{migration in}} amorphous (a-) or crystalline (c-) Si, or c-Ge is revealed to be an indirect process, activated by point defects of the hosting medium. In a-Si in the 450 - 650 C range, B diffusivity is 5 orders of magnitude higher than in c-Si, with a transient longer than the typical amorphous relaxation time. A quick B precipitation is also evidenced for concentrations larger than 2 x 10 ^ 20 B/cm 3. B migration in a-Si occurs with the creation of a metastable mobile B, jumping between adjacent sites, stimulated by dangling bonds of a-Si whose density is enhanced by B itself (larger B density causes higher B diffusivity). Similar activation energies for migration of B atoms (3. 0 eV) and of dangling bonds (2. 6 eV) have been extracted. In c-Si, B diffusion is largely affected by the Fermi level position, occurring through the interaction between the negatively charged substitutional B and a self-interstitial (I) in the neutral or doubly positively charged state, if under intrinsic or extrinsic (p-type doping) conditions, respectively. After charge exchanges, the migrating, uncharged BI pair is formed. Under high n-type doping conditions, B diffusion occurs also through the negatively charged BI pair, even if the migration is depressed by Coulomb pairing with n-type dopants. The interplay between B clustering and migration is also modeled, since B diffusion is greatly affected by precipitation. Small (below 1 nm) and relatively large (5 - 10 nm in size) BI clusters have been identiﬁed with different energy barriers for thermal dissolution (3. 6 or 4. 8 eV, respectively). In c-Ge, B motion is by far less evident than in c-Si, even if the migration mechanism is revealed to be similarly assisted by Is. If Is density is increased well above the equilibrium (as during ion irradiation), B diffusion occurs up to quite large extents and also at relatively low temperatures, disclosing the underlying mechanism. The lower B diffusivity and the larger activation barrier (4. 65 eV, rather than 3. 45 eV in c-Si) {{can be explained by the}} intrinsic shortage of Is in Ge and by their <b>large</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energy.</b> B diffusion can be strongly enhanced with a proper point defect engineering, as achieved with embedded GeO 2 nanoclusters, causing at 650 °C a large Is supersaturation.

We model strain effects using a set of consistent ab initio calculations, and demonstrate that our calculated results may be simply explained in terms of vacancy formation volume and changes in elastic constants between the bulk and defected states. A positive vacancy formation volume contributes to decreased vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> under tensile strain, and an increase in elastic constants contributes to increases in vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> with compressive and tensile strains, and vice versa. The vacancy formation volume dominates the linear portion of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> strain response, while its curvature is governed by the vacancy-induced change in elastic constants.

Firstly, there is no single {{answer to the question of}} calculations accuracy of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy.</b> Secondly, the existing phenomenological theories tacitly assume that the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> and entropy of vacancy formation do not depend on temperature. Objective. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature factor on the free <b>energy</b> of vacancy <b>formation</b> and its components in a number of metals within the quasi-harmonic approximation. Methods. The vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> and entropy in FCC Al, Ag, and Pd are determined as a function of temperature using ab initio methods within a quasi-harmonic approximation. Results. It was shown, that the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> substantially increases with temperature in all cases, which {{is related to}} the thermal lattice expansion. Such increase of the vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> is compensated by the vibrational vacancy formation entropy contribution.

However, a thermodynamic analysis shows that such increase of vacancy <b>formation</b> <b>energy</b> in the process of calculation is largely underestimated. The latter is compensated by contribution from vibrating entropy of vacancy formation and strongly increases with temperature.

40|$|In {{a recent}} Letter [PRL 96, 226802 (2006) ], Dalpian and Chelikowsky claimed that <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> of Mn {{impurities}} in CdSe nanocrystals increase as {{the size of}} the nanocrystal decreases, and argued that this size dependence leads to "self-purification" of small nanocrystals. They presented density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations showing a strong size dependence for Mn impurity <b>formation</b> <b>energies,</b> and proposed a general explanation. In this Comment we show that several different DFT codes, pseudopotentials, and exchange-correlation functionals give a markedly different result: We find no such size dependence. More generally, we argue that <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> are not relevant to substitutional doping in most colloidally grown nanocrystals. Comment: 1 page, 1 figur...|$|R
