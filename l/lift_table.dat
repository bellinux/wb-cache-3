50|$|In Europe {{there is}} a {{published}} standard BS EN 1570: 1998 + A2: 2009 Safety requirements for <b>lifting</b> <b>tables.</b> Standard EN 1570-1 is now EN 15701-1:2011+A1:2014. It is a Type C standard and compliance with this standard confers conformity with the Machinery Directive, 2006/42/EC. Work is already being undertaken to revise this standard and possibly split it into 3 parts. It specifies the criteria for the raising and lowering of goods and/or persons associated with the movement of goods carried by <b>lifting</b> <b>tables.</b> When using <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> for uses not covered by International / Regional standards e.g. EN1570 then further consideration {{may need to be}} given to the associated Risks and hazards.|$|R

40|$|Chain {{conveyors}} are {{a specific}} type of conveyor often used in a variety of manufacturing and production applications, such as bcxly and paint shops. These conveyors must typically interface with other types of conveyors such as cross-transfer conveyors, and also with other material-handling equipment such as <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> and hold tables. Micromodeling of chain conveyors and their equipment interfaces requires close attention to numerous details. These details include not only static and operational properties of the chain conveyors themselves, but also the particulars of dimensional and operational interfaces of the conveyors and the equipment served by the conveyors, such as <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> and the conveyor acceleration and deceleratio...|$|R

50|$|Lift tables {{can come}} in {{a vast array of}} {{configurations}} and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. The most common <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrically powered pump to actuate the scissor lifting mechanism. Lift tables can also be driven by pneumatic sources, trapezoidal-threaded screw drives, push chains or by hydraulic foot pump when the load is not heavy. Lift tables can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, especially useful for access by manual pallet-pump trucks and the mobility impaired or wheelchair users.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> is {{a device}} that employs a {{scissors}} mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically lift tables are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning. Lift tables are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders [...] by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. Lift tables lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their deckplates.|$|E

50|$|A {{motorcycle}} lift is a <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> that {{is designed}} to handle motorcycles. Many repair shops use such lifts to bring the vehicle off of the ground and up to a level so that the mechanic does not have to put any strain on his or her back or lay upon the ground to perform any kind of work upon the vehicle. Also, motorcycle enthusiasts have put these lifts into their home garages so that they can perform simple maintenance jobs such as changing the oil and cleaning the bike without having to get down on the ground. These lifts are typically made of steel and powered by air or hydraulic cylinders that handle load capacities up to 1500 lb.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s, a {{manufacturing}} {{was started in}} Solna (Sweden) by chain-driven hoists with lift car for rated loads between 200 to 1000 kg. Manufacturing and sales amounted to approx. 30 lifts / year under the brand name Elektroborg. MSc Bertil Svedberg founded the company Cibes in 1947, took over the business Elektroborg during the 1950s.Stenfors Industries in Skillingaryd, Sweden, contract manufactured in the mid-1960s, a housing adapted lift for disabled, the product consisted of a <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> with guardrails, Cibes handled the sales activities of the lift during the 1970s, developed the product and made it accessible {{for the use of}} wheelchairs. This lift was a pioneering product in the disability field, with a design where the car was driven with a screw rod, built on a tripod with legs. This wheelchair lift had a design with inbuilt safety aspects as early as the late 1970s, and was recommended in buildings by the Swedish Work Environment Authority.|$|E
