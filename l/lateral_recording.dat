5000|$|Among their innovations, the {{researchers}} experimented with <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> techniques {{as early as}} 1881. Contrary to the vertically-cut grooves of Edison phonographs, the <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> method used a cutting stylus that moved {{from side to side}} in a [...] "zig zag" [...] pattern across the record. While cylinder phonographs never employed the lateral cutting process commercially, this later became the primary method of phonograph disc recording.|$|E
50|$|The wax {{cylinder}} got {{a competitor}} {{with the advent}} of the Gramophone, which was patented by Emile Berliner in 1887. The vibration of the Gramophone's recording stylus was horizontal, parallel to the recording surface, resulting in a zig-zag groove of constant depth. This is known as <b>lateral</b> <b>recording.</b> Berliner's original patent showed a <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> etched around the surface of a cylinder, but in practice he opted for the disc format. The Gramophones he soon began to market were intended solely for playing prerecorded entertainment discs and could not be used to record. The spiral groove on the flat surface of a disc was relatively easy to replicate: a negative metal electrotype of the original record could be used to stamp out hundreds or thousands of copies before it wore out. Early on, the copies were made of hard rubber, and sometimes of celluloid, but soon a shellac-based compound was adopted.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vertical}} cut recording process {{is an early}} method of audio recording by which a stylus cuts a vertical groove into a phonograph record. This {{is in contrast to}} the <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> system which uses a stylus that cuts side-to-side across a record. The vertical recording process, also known as the hill and dale process, was used to record phonograph cylinder records as well as Edison Disc Records, Pathé disc records, and disc records made by numerous smaller companies. Vertical cut recording was also used as a means of copyright protection by the early Muzak 16-inch background music discs.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the Victor Talking Machine Company issued {{some of her}} European <b>lateral</b> <b>records,</b> albeit not in its celebrity red seal series, but Verlet {{was most}} closely {{associated}} with the Edison company and its diamond discs. Possibly explaining the extent and duration of that association is the following description of her voice, published around the time of her US debut: [...] "Mlle. Verlet's voice is a fine soprano, very clear and even, and admirably trained; not a trace of the objectionable tremolo is perceptible, but all the tones are firm and true." [...] Thomas Edison famously objected to what he considered [...] "tremolo," [...] and company promotional statements emphasized Verlet's freedom from that objectionable quality.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the contrast dependency (from 0. 4 to 98 %) {{of the visual}} evoked potential (VEP) to motion onset and to pattern reversal at an occipital and <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> site using sinewave grating stimuli of 0. 9 c/deg, drifting at 4. 9 deg/sec. Two differing VEP components were identified: a positive component, peaking at around 130 msec, dominating the occipital derivation, enhanced in pattern-reversal stimulation, exhibiting a high-threshold, late-saturating contrast response characteristic with a half-amplitude contrast above 7 %; and a negative component at around 180 msec, dominating the lateral derivation, enhanced in motion-onset stimulation, exhibiting a low-threshold, saturating contrast characteristic with a half-amplitude contrast below 4 %. The results suggest: (1) The negative component (N 180) represents motion mechanisms, located more laterally, while the positive component (P 100 –P 130) represents form-processing mechanisms, located near the V 1 /V 2 areas. (2) A pattern-reversal stimulus triggers both form-processing and motion mechanisms that can be discriminated by latency. In an occipital derivation, the clinical reversal VEP P 100 will be little contaminated by motion responses...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{development}} of automated patch clamp technology {{has increased the}} throughput of electrophysiology but {{at the expense of}} visual access to the cells being studied. To improve visualization and the control of cell position, we have developed a simple alternative patch clamp technique based on microfluidic junctions between a main chamber and <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> capillaries, all fabricated by micromolding of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). PDMS substrates eliminate the need for vibration isolation and allow direct cell visualization and manipulation using standard microscopy. Microfluidic integration allows recording capillaries to be arrayed 20 μm apart, for a total chamber volume of < 0. 5 nl. The geometry of the recording capillaries permits high-quality, stable, whole-cell seals despite the hydrophobicity of the PDMS surface. Using this device, we are able to demonstrate reliable whole-cell recording of mammalian cells on an inexpensive microfluidic platform. Recordings of activation of the voltage-sensitive potassium channel Kv 2. 1 in mammalian cells compare well with traditional pipette recordings. The results make possible the integration of whole-cell electrophysiology with easily manufactured microfluidic lab-on-a-chip devices...|$|E
40|$|Vestibular evoked myogenic {{potentials}} (VEMPs) are short-latency reflexes recorded {{from the}} cervical (cVEMPs) and ocular (oVEMPs) muscles. Both reflexes are commonly elicited using air-conducted (AC) and bone-conducted (BC) stimulus modalities. Despite their growing clinical prevalence, the properties they exhibit remain less well studied. Mapping of the oVEMP {{was carried out}} for AC and BC modalities. A stable latency and larger more linear response to gaze angle were found for a slightly <b>lateral</b> <b>recording</b> electrode compared to the conventional one. Gaze angle can potentially differentiate between extraocular sources depending on the electrode montage used. AC frequency tuning of cVEMPs and oVEMPs {{were found to be}} broadly similar even when middle ear attenuation effects were accounted for. Stimulus phase did not modulate the observed frequency effects. AC stimuli tuning patterns and phase effects differ from those of BC stimuli which suggest differences in their mechanism of activating vestibular receptors. Both BC 500 Hz and BC impulses are effective means of evoking cVEMPs and oVEMPs from mid sagittal skull sites. The effects depend upon both location and phase and differ for cVEMPs and oVEMPs with the most consistent effects occurring for AFz and Fz stimulation. Dissociation between stimulus modalities was found for stimulus phase. Phase did not alter the properties of AC reflexes whereas BC reflexes were affected, more strongly for oVEMPs than for cVEMPs. Differences in phase effects between modalities may relate to their differing mechanisms of transduction. In vestibular neuritis, sparing of cVEMPs and abnormal oVEMPs were observed for AC and BC 500 Hz stimuli while BC impulses were generally affected for both reflexes. Modelling of the findings to AC and BC 500 Hz demonstrated strong utricular dependence for oVEMPs and strong saccular dependence for cVEMPs. Utricular contributions were demonstrated for both reflexes using BC impulses. Properties of cVEMPs and oVEMPs in superior canal dehiscence were not equally useful in separating patients from controls. Thresholds (AC 500 Hz cVEMPs and BC 500 Hz oVEMPs) and amplitudes (AC 500 Hz cVEMPs and oVEMPs) showed high sensitivity and specificity. Amplitudes of cVEMPs to AC and BC 500 Hz were shown to saturate whereas oVEMP amplitudes did not...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to estimate the vertical deviation of the nasal floor and to register dental disturbances (i. e., hypo- and hyperdontia) in patients with an isolated soft tissue cleft lip. Design: Thirty patients with isolated cleft lips were randomly selected from the files of the Department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery and Jaw Orthopedics. As a matched control group, 30 patients were selected from the files of the Department of Orthodontics. Panoramic radiographs were analyzed and the lowest point of the floor of the left and right nasal cavity was measured to the nearest 0. 5 mm. The presence of supernumerary (deciduous or permanent) or missing <b>lateral</b> incisors was <b>recorded</b> from the patient's journals. Results:The vertical position of the nasal floor differed significantly between the cleft and the noncleft side (p < 0. 001). Supernumerary, deciduous, and permanent <b>laterals</b> were <b>recorded</b> in 73 % of the subjects in the cleft lip group (22 patients). In the control group, no {{differences were found between the}} position of the nasal floor on the left and right side and no supernumerary <b>laterals</b> were <b>recorded.</b> Missing <b>laterals</b> were not noted in any of the individuals investigated. Conclusions: Isolated cleft lips were in most cases associated with: (1) lowering of the nasal floor on the cleft side and (2) supernumerary primary or permanent lateral incisors on the cleft side. Panoramic radiographs can be used to detect differences in the vertical position of the floor of the nasal cavity in patients with isolated cleft lips and to diagnose supernumerary laterals...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the skeletal changes associated with maxillary advancement using the external rigid distractor in cleft lip and palate patients after distraction {{and to assess}} the stability of these changes. Patients and Methods: Eight cleft lip and palate patients with maxillary hypoplasia underwent maxillary distraction osteogenesis using external rigid devise. <b>Lateral</b> cephalometric <b>records</b> were obtained before distraction T 1 and after completing active distraction T 2. After a three month follow up period a final <b>lateral</b> cephalometric <b>record</b> was evaluated T 3. Results: The maxilla was significantly advanced {{as indicated by the}} increase in maxillary depth angle and effective maxillary length (median difference, 10 mm). The palatal plane angle showed a significant increase (median difference, 5 º), showing clockwise rotation. At T 3 there was a slight decrease in maxillary depth angle (median difference, 3 º). Effective maxillary length decreased significantly at T 3 (median difference, 2 mm). The palatal plane angle decreased (median difference, 3 º) and almost returned to its original position, showing a counterclockwise rotation. Conclusion: Maxillary advancement using external rigid distractor resulted in clockwise rotation of maxilla with increase in palatal plane angle and slight increase in mandibular plane angle. The amount of maxillary advancement was slightly reduced during follow up and the palatal plane almost returned to its original position. These changes showed good stable clinical results...|$|R
