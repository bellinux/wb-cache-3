40|$|The <b>Levelling</b> <b>Table</b> is an {{electromechanical}} device used inside the Large Space Simulator (one {{of the most}} important facilities at the ESTEC Test Centre) in order to allow a correct supply for the specimen under test. The thesis shows the realization of a Matlab/Simulink model of the control system of the <b>Levelling</b> <b>Table</b> and its simulations. Each part of the system has been studied and simulated {{in order to have a}} model of the complete system. The thesis has been carried out during a stage of six months at ESTEC (European Space Research and Technology Centre) of the ESA (European Space Agency) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands...|$|E
