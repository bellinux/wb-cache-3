40|$|Abstract Background Specialised leaf-eating {{is almost}} universally {{regarded}} as the ancestral state of all ruminants, yet little evidence can be cited {{in support of this}} assumption, apart from the fact that all early ruminants had low crowned cheek teeth. Instead, recent years have seen the emergence evidence contradicting the conventional view that <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> crowns always indicate leaf-eating and high tooth crowns grass-eating. Results Here we report the results of two independent palaeodietary reconstructions for one of the earliest deer, Procervulus ginsburgi from the Early Miocene of Spain, suggesting that despite having lower tooth crowns than any living ruminant, this species included a significant proportion of grass in its diet. Conclusion The phylogenetic distribution of feeding styles strongly supports that leaf-grass mixed feeding was the original feeding style of deer, and that later dietary specialization on leaves or grass occurred independently in several lineages. Evidence for other ruminant clades suggests that facultative mixed feeding may in fact have been the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia, which would have been morphologically expressed only under specific environmental factors. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{analysing}} {{the influence of}} profile errors upon load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness of spur gears is proposed. The analysis is based upon a static, two-dimensional finite element approach.

In addition, artificial neural networks are employed for system identification in order to calculate load-sharing capabilities and mesh stiffness trends for <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> load levels. The effect of tip relief on load-sharing properties is discussed. The contact force and the transmission error are simulated for two medium-quality spur gears where the profile and pitch errors are known.

The discussion is focused upon the size of the area where the relation between torque and angular displacement is highly non-linear, i. e. load depending.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: In this {{retrospective}} study, {{the efficacy}} of periodontal therapy and maintenance in preventing tooth loss was evaluated. METHODS: The study included 92 patients with 2310 teeth diagnosed with chronic adult periodontitis and observed over a mean period of 6. 7 years, with each patient receiving surgical therapy in two or more quadrants. The group was divided into two subgroups: those who complied with the recommended maintenance schedule and those whose compliance was erratic. Individual tooth prognosis was assigned according to radiographic parameters. RESULTS: At the completion of active periodontal therapy, 2184 teeth were present. During the maintenance period, 44 teeth were lost due to periodontal reasons. Tooth mortality revealed a mean annual adjusted tooth loss rate of 0. 07 /year. Molars were the teeth most frequently lost; canines the least. The number of teeth lost in the three prognostic categories was: one (0. 07 %) for teeth with good prognoses, 21 (3. 63 %) for questionable prognoses and 22 (11. 34 %) for hopeless prognoses. Patients complying erratically with supportive periodontal therapy were at a 5. 6 times greater risk for tooth loss following active therapy than regularly compliant patients. Conclusions: The results demonstrated a <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> mortality rate in periodontal patients following active treatment combined with a strict maintenance program...|$|E

The color of the teeth was measured with a spectrophotometer (L*; a*; b*) before treatment (control) and after the above mentioned two stages. The subjects were also instructed to note tooth and gingival sensitivity. Results: For the L * component a statis-tically significant difference (p 0. 05) found throughout the study (Wilcox on Signed Rank Sum Test). A major color change of 1. 8 units (Eab) was found after the LED treatment stage with only a further small 0. 2 unit improvement after the 14 day at-home treatment stage. Tooth and gingival sensitivity scores were low (below mild) throughout the treatment stages. Conclusion: A major tooth color increase was found after the in-office LED/gel treatment stage and only an insignificant further improvement was noted after the additional 14 day at-home treatment period. Only <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> and gingival sensitivity scores were found. A slight increase in both the sensitivity and gingival scores after the LED/gel activated stage could be observed.

40|$|Metriorhynchidae was a {{peculiar}} but long-lived group of marine Mesozoic crocodylomorphs adapted to a pelagic lifestyle. Recent discoveries show that metriorhynchids evolved {{a wide range}} of craniodental morphotypes and inferred feeding strategies. One genus, Dakosaurus, is arguably the most aberrant marine crocodylomorph due to its large, robust, ziphodont teeth; very <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> count; and brevirostrine/oreinirostral snout. We here report an additional unusual feature of Dakosaurus that is unique among marine crocodylomorphs: tightly fitting tooth-to-tooth occlusion, whose inference is supported by reception pits along the upper and lower tooth rows, indicative of vertically orientated crowns that were in close contact during occlusion, and three distinct types of dental wear. These include irregular spalled surfaces near the apex (probably caused by tooth-food contact), semi-circular wear near the base, and elongate surfaces extending along the mesial and distal margins of the teeth, obliterating the carinae (including the denticles). Scanning electron micrographs show that these latter surfaces are marked by parallel apicobasal striations, which in extant mammals reflect toothtooth contact. As such, we interpret the carinal wear facets in Dakosaurus as being formed by repeated toothtooth contact between the mesial and distal margins of the teeth of the upper and lower jaw. We posit that this increased the available shearing surface on their high crowns. Together, these wear patterns suggest that occlusion in Dakosaurus was specialized for cutting large and abrasive prey items into portions small enough to swallow, making it a prime example of an aquatic reptile with macrophagous feeding habits...|$|E
40|$|Leaf {{size and}} shape are {{selected}} by climate and are strongly correlated with climatic variables. Accordingly, fossil dicotyledonous leaves {{are considered to be}} among the most reliable indicators of terrestrial paleoclimates. However, the methods used have much potential for improvement. All currently rely on discrete, usually binary characters, but leaf morphology is better evaluated and more reproducibly measured using continuous variables. Digital leaf measurement offers the possibility of continuous, reproducible variables, with the potential to improve paleoclimate estimates as well as the ecological and evolutionary understanding of leaf form. Results are reported for five variables measured on 238 leaves representing the woody species from three living test floras—two temperate and one humid tropical. The variables are: shape factor (an area:perimeter ratio standardized to a circle); the ratio of feret diameter (diameter if leaf’s area is contained in a circle) to major axis length; the ratio of tooth area to leaf area; tooth count; and tooth count standardized to leaf perimeter. It is well known that increased mean annual temperature is correlated with a high percentage of untoothed species. By extension, increasing temperature is expected to be associated with relatively undissected, more circular leaves (i. e., with high shape factor, low tooth-area:leaf-area ratio, and <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> count). These trends were observed in the test floras, both between the tropical and the temperate sites and between the two temperate sites. Shape factor was the variable that resolved the three sites most significantly.

30|$|Many {{epidemiological}} {{studies have found}} that tooth loss is associated with susceptibility to oesophageal cancer. However, a definitive answer is yet to be discovered, and the findings are inconclusive. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between tooth loss and oesophageal cancer risk.

Nine observational studies (eight articles) involving 2604 patients and 113, 995 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The combined odds ratio for tooth loss and oesophageal cancer was 1.53 (95  % CI 1.02 – 2.29) for the high versus <b>lowest</b> <b>teeth</b> loss categories. However, inconsistent results were detected in the stratified and sensitivity analysis. In dose–response analysis, the summary odds ratio for each one tooth loss increment was 1.01 (95  % CI 1.00 – 1.02). The current evidence, based solely on six case–control studies and three cohort studies, suggests that tooth loss is a potential marker of oesophageal cancer. However, no firm conclusion can be drawn at this time that tooth loss may play a causal role in development of oesophageal cancer. Additional large-scale and high-quality prospective studies are required to evaluate the association between tooth loss and risk of oesophageal cancer.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Currently, New Guinea Stegonotus with 17 scales at midbody {{and divided}} subcaudals are {{identified}} as S. modestus. But this will {{not account for the}} disparity in dentition within "S. modestus", nor the colour differences even at one locality, nor that in East and West Sepik Districts there are three quite distinct "S. modestus": (1) a large form with high ventral count and high tooth count; (2) a small form with low ventral count but high tooth count; and (3) a medium-sized form with high ventral count but <b>low</b> <b>tooth</b> count (fig. 1). The material in the British Museum and American Museum of Natural History indicates that scale count does not correctly identify the species, and that such features as dentition, form of the palatine bone, scale pits, size, and coloration are more reliable. GENERAL FEATURES OF NEW GUINEA STEGONOTUS New Guinea Stegonotus are very closely related to the Oriental genus Dinodon; the supposed dental differences between these genera do not hold and the maxillary dentition of (for example) Stegonotus diehli more closely resembles that of Dinodon orientale than it does that of Stegonotus cucullatus. I find only one character that will separate New Guinea Stegonotus from Dinodon: in Dinodon, the membranous dorsal wall of the trachea is expanded as a large and simple sac continuous with the lung 1); but in all New Guinea Stegonotus, dorsal tracheal perforations lead into a series of separate membranous sacs, as described by Brongersma (1957). Stegonotus and Dinodon show a general similarity in form and a sexual dimorphism in ventral count with males exceeding females (the reverse of the usual dimorphism).

The two groups showed geographical, racial, cultural, socioeconomic and educational differences, and they represented extremes as to perceived severity of periodontal disease, general health care delivery systems and to dental care. The Sri Lanka population had never been exposed to any program of oral professional or self care.

Initial loss of attachment was seen already at 16 years of age. Mean individual loss of attachment increased steadily during the thirties and forties and reached a maximum of 2. 44 mm at age 59 years. Sites that never showed any inflammation sings experienced the least mean cumulative loss of attachment (1. 86 mm) followed by sites with slight inflammation signs (2. 25 mm) over the 26 -year observation period. In sites that consistently bled on probing over 26 years, the mean loss of attachment was 3. 23 mm.

30|$|A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} attachment technique {{has been developed}} to reduce the bond failure rates and discomfort to the patient during orthodontic tooth movement of an impacted <b>teeth.</b> <b>Low</b> profile of the attachment and its excellent adaptability to tooth surface is advantageous specially during tunnel traction technique [3, 4] wherein impacted teeth has to pass between two normally placed cortical plates towards {{the center of the}} alveolar ridge [5].|$|R
40|$|Spur gear {{endurance}} {{tests were}} conducted to investigate the surface pitting fatigue life of noninvolute gears with <b>low</b> numbers of <b>teeth</b> and <b>low</b> contact ratios for use in advanced applications. The results were compared with those for a standard involute design with a <b>low</b> number of <b>teeth.</b> The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 50 in.) with 12 teeth on both gear designs. Test conditions were an oil inlet temperature of 320 K (116 F), an oil outlet temperature of 350 K (170 F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 49 GPa (216 ksi), and a speed of 10 000 rpm. The following results were obtained: the noninvolute gear had a surface pitting fatigue life approximately 1. 6 {{times that of the}} standard involute gear of a similar design; and the surface pitting fatigue life of the 3. 43 -pitch AISI 8620 noninvolute gear was approximately equal to the surface pitting fatigue life of an 8 -pitch, 28 -tooth AISI 9310 gear at the same load but at a considerably higher maximum Hertz stress...|$|R
