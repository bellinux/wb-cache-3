40|$|The use of {{silicone}} {{or similar}} material with distal attachment as a suspension system has gained great acceptance and usage for lower limb amputees. Since its introduction {{in the mid}} 1980 ’s by Kristinsson, the silicone suction socket (3 S) has undergone extensive development and the options available have proliferated due to its popularity. Benefits for the lower limb include: reduced shear forces on the skin, better pressure distribution especially when a gel type liner is employed, and excellent suspension. Shortly after its introduction, 3 S technology was applied to upper <b>limb</b> <b>fittings.</b> [2] Some early success was achieved and results were promising. Problems existed related to inappropriate sizing of liners and locking system for utilization in upper limb applications and difficulty interfacing myoelectric control in combination with 3 S suspension...|$|R
40|$|Technological advancements {{in lower}} limb {{prostheses}} {{have resulted in}} actuated motors in both knees and ankles. Currently, these components are controlled by information measured from various electromechanical sensors attached to the prosthesis. Our aim is to enhance the control information provided to powered prosthetic components by including input from the user via interpreted myoelectric signals (MESs). To extract useful control information, {{it is imperative that}} consistent, high-quality MESs be collected from patients each time they don the socket. In this work, we present approaches to maintaining consistent electrode placements on individuals with transfemoral and transtibial amputations during static non-weight-bearing conditions and dynamic weight-bearing activities. Our results show that a variety of methods, similar to those used in upper <b>limb</b> <b>fittings,</b> may be used to collect high-quality MESs during static non-weight-bearing conditions. MES collection during dynamic weight-bearing activities is more challenging.

40|$|Previous in-vivo {{investigations}} on the stabilizing {{efficacy of}} knee bracing for ACL reconstructed patients have been often limited to 20 - 30 degrees of knee flexion. In this study, {{the effectiveness of}} a uniaxial hinged functional brace to improve the knee stability was assessed at 30, 60 and 90 degrees of knee flexion. Arthrometry tests were conducted on 15 healthy subjects before and following wearing the brace and the tibial displacements were measured at up to 150 N anterior forces. Results indicated that functional bracing has a significant stabilizing effect throughout the range of knee flexion examined (p < 0. 05). The rate of effectiveness, however, was not consistent across the flexion range, e. g., 50 % at 30 degrees and only 4 % at 90 degrees. It was suggested that accurate sizing and fitting as well as attention to correct hinge placement relative to the femoral condyles can limit brace migration and improve its effectiveness in mid and deep knee flexion. With using adaptive <b>limb</b> <b>fittings,</b> through flexible pads, and a polycentric joint a more significant improvement of the overall brace performance and efficacy might be obtaine...|$|R

40|$|An {{artificial}} limb control (ALC) {{system is a}} tool for helping patients to control their prosthetic <b>limb.</b> For <b>fitting,</b> training, and monitoring purposes, such system must be equipped with a wireless interface between the prosthesis and PC {{in order to bring}} the most safety and the most convenience to the patients.

30|$|A {{number of}} factors, such as thermal {{distortion}} of the spacecraft and the instrument, cause the image navigation data to deviate from the ideal values. Therefore, correction becomes necessary to enable accurate geographical mapping of the image data. In the data products from the Akatsuki project, “Level- 2 ” does not incorporate this correction, whereas “Level- 3 ” does. The correction in the Level- 3 product is achieved by fitting the planetary disk limb to each image, as described by Ogohara (2017). The <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> {{is found to be}} quite successful for the dayside images (manuscript in preparation). However, it continues to remain challenging for the IR 2 night-side data, because the night-side limb is often obscure and demands careful parameter tuning. The <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> is available only when the image captures a sufficient fraction the planetary limb. Therefore, the users of the IR 2 data products are advised {{to be aware of the}} possible large navigation error when the fitting is unavailable, which is found by a flag.|$|E
40|$|AIM: Only half {{of those}} {{patients}} undergoing major lower limb amputations for peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are likely to mobilise on a prosthesis. This study aimed {{to determine whether a}} surgeon's experience influenced the quality of the residual limb and thus the likelihood of the stump being suitable for a prosthesis. METHODS: All patients undergoing major lower limb amputations for PVD were recruited prospectively, between August 1992 and July 1996. Following surgery, patients were categorised, by a consultant in rehabilitation medicine, as potentially suitable (group 1) or unsuitable (group II) for rehabilitation. Patients in group I were further assessed by prosthetists for <b>limb</b> <b>fitting.</b> RESULTS: A total of 217 patients underwent 260 amputations for PVD between 1992 and 1996 : transfemoral (TFA) 131, trans-tibial (TTA) 127, and through-knee (TKA) in 2. The 30 -day mortality was 12 % (n = 27). Following surgery, 109 patients were assigned to group I (51 %), and 81 patients to group II (37 %). The proportion of junior surgeons performing surgery was similar for patients in both groups. Twenty-three amputation stumps (9 %) required revision or conversion to a higher level within 30 days. Revisions or conversions were significantly more frequent where the original operation had been performed by an unsupervised junior surgeon rather than a senior surgeon (P = 0. 009). The rate of defective amputations compromising <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> also reached significance when unsupervised junior and senior surgeons were compared (P = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation of the relatively few amputees who reach the stage of <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> is hindered by poor surgical technique in a large proportion of cases. Patients operated on by a more experienced surgeon had a better chance of mobilising without revision or conversion surgery...|$|E
40|$|Since surface electromyograghic (sEMG) {{signals are}} {{non-invasive}} {{and capable of}} reflecting humans’ motion intention, they {{have been widely used}} for the motion recognition of upper limbs. However, limited research has been conducted for lower limbs, because the sEMGs of lower limbs are easily affected by body gravity and muscle jitter. In this paper, sEMG signals and accelerometer signals are acquired and fused to recognize the motion patterns of lower <b>limbs.</b> A curve <b>fitting</b> method based on median filtering is proposed to remove accelerometer noise. As for movement onset detection, an sEMG power spectral correlation coefficient method is used to detect the start and end points of active signals. Then, the time-domain features and wavelet coefficients of sEMG signals are extracted, and a dynamic time warping (DTW) distance is used for feature extraction of acceleration signals. At last, five lower limbs’ motions are classified and recognized by using Gaussian kernel-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) respectively. The results prove that the fused feature-based classification outperforms the classification with only sEMG signals or accelerometer signals, and the fused feature can achieve 95 % or higher recognition accuracy, demonstrating the validity of the proposed method...|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of orientation correction {{is estimated to}} be better than 0.1 pixels (Ogohara et al. 2017; the simulated error is ~  0.04 pix for UVI). The green dots in Fig.  1 indicate the <b>limbs</b> obtained by <b>fitting</b> where the gradients of radiance are greatest. The fitting results are used to adjust the camera’s boresight orientation, and geographic mapping is conducted by assuming that the observed altitude is 70  km above the mean surface. The cloud-top altitude is known to vary (e.g., Lee et al. 2012), but the current assumption has little impact on mapping except near the limb. The yellow dots in the figure indicate the mapped limbs, which are supposed to be at 70  km. The mapped limbs in the figure are slightly smaller than the fitted limbs by ~  1 pixel, corresponding to ~  30  km; thus, brightness exists outside the mapped limbs. This discrepancy is presumably caused by instrumental point spread (Yamazaki et al. 2017) and the effect of upper haze. The upper haze exists above the cloud top with smoothly decreasing vertical number density up to ~  90  km (Wilquet et al. 2009, 2012; Luginin et al. 2016). Quantitatively, some error still may exist in the calibration of image scales, but we assume that it should be smaller than a couple tens of kilometers in terms of the radius of Venus.|$|R
50|$|In 1953, {{with what}} he had learned at Sunnybrook Hospital, {{opportunity}} drew James to the University of California,Berkeley, where, working with C.W. Radcliff, he helped to develop the quadrilateral socket by developing a jig fitting system for amputations above the knee. Unlike previous technology, these jigs held the correct position of the residual <b>limb,</b> therefore making <b>fitting</b> of the socket for the residual limb easier and more comfortable for amputees to walk. As Kevin Carroll, James C. Baird, and Katherine Binder relate in their book, Prosthetics and Patient Management: A Comprehensive Clinical Approach, the work that James Foort did at Berkeley and subsequently with the “exploration of the biomechanics of alignment during ambulation remains the basis of contemporary prosthetic alignment.” In addition to developing the quadrilateral socket, the team at Berkeley systematized the prosthesis developed by Colin MacLaurin and Fred Hampton for total absence of the limb. The Berkeley team developed the PTB Below knee prosthesis for amputations below the knee, completely new technologies, The PTB prosthesis enabled the amputee to walk around with no corset or side joints. Not only did these new adaptations {{solve the problem of}} constriction of circulation and ease restriction on the thigh, but it allowed people to be amputated below the knee twice as was usual for amputations related to circulatory problems, thereby increasing their function.|$|R

40|$|NoRobust {{techniques}} are developed {{to put the}} H and Ca K line full-disk images taken at the Meudon Observatory into a standardised form of a `virtual solar image'. The techniques include <b>limb</b> <b>fitting,</b> removal of geometrical distortion, centre position and size standardisation and intensity normalisation. The <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> starts with an initial estimate of the solar centre using raw 12 -bit image data and then applies a Canny edge-detection routine. Candidate edge points for the limb are selected using a histogram based method and the chosen points fitted to a quadratic function by minimising the algebraic distance using SVD. The five parameters of the ellipse fitting the limb are extracted from the quadratic function. These parameters are used to define an affine transformation that transforms the image shape into a circle. Transformed images are generated using the nearest neighbour, bilinear or bicubic interpolation. Intensity renormalisation is also required because of a limb darkening and other non-radial intensity variations. It is achieved by fitting a background function in polar coordinates {{to a set of}} sample points having the median intensities and by standardising the average brightness. Representative examples of intermediate and final processed results are presented in addition to the algorithms developed.

The modular approach enables each prosthesis to be easily modified, programmed or extended according to each individual’s needs thus making it possible to try out different control schemes and mechanical realizations building on a small set of modules. Four experimental hands and two arm systems have had limited clinical use at two centres in the UK and Sweden, in addition advanced arm control could be easily implemented with few changes to the system.

30|$|It is {{not clear}} what gives rise to the 3 -shape and the ε-shape, and their reasons are {{beyond the scope of this}} study. However, we can {{determine}} the sub-spacecraft point and L_V at the accuracies listed in Table  5, if the limb points follow such radial-residual distributions for any reason. Accuracies Δ x_SSC, Δ y_SSC and Δ x_SSC, Δ y_SSC listed in Table  5 range from O(10 − 3) to O(10 − 1) at most wavelengths. They are the accuracies of an algorithm that derives an optimal ellipse approximating the distribution of given points. In this study, we detect <b>limb</b> points by <b>fitting</b> a tanh function to the radiance distributions in the X- or Y-directions and assume that these limb points are located at a cloud altitude that depends upon wavelength. However, it {{is not clear}} whether one-dimensional distributions of radiance can be expressed by a tanh function, or whether it would be reasonable (or acceptable) to assume constant cloud-top altitudes along local times and latitudes. It remains unclear how the cloud altitudes depend upon latitude and local time at each wavelength. At present, we do not know the typical profile of radiance around the limb or where the profile of the limb should be defined. The positional accuracy of the limb points is reasonably lower than that listed in Table  5. Therefore, the pointing-correction accuracies listed in Table  5 should be understood to be the most optimistic values.|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{assess the}} short and {{long-term}} outcomes of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) in intravenous drug users (IVDU) in a regional vascular centre. MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of all IVDUs with NSTI admitted to the regional vascular surgical unit between January 2009 and July 2014. Clinical outcome measures were interval between admission and surgery, length of ITU/HDU and hospital stays, post-operative complications, in hospital and one year mortality. Results 25 patients were admitted. The median age was 39 years (range 30 – 53 years) with a female to male ratio of 1 : 3. 3. The median interval between admission and surgery was 23 hours (range 2 – 195 hours), however, this was significantly less when the admitting specialty was directly to vascular surgery (median 4 hours, range 2 – 7) compared with other specialties (median 38 hours, range 7 – 195 hours). Ten patients required HDU/ITU care with a median duration of 4 days (range 1 – 12 days). Five patients (20 %) required amputation, of whom two (40 %) had a prosthetic limb fitted. There was one in hospital death (4 %). Another patient died while awaiting <b>limb</b> <b>fitting</b> 4 months post discharge, giving a 1 year mortality of 8 %. ConclusionsNSTI in IVDUs carries high risk of amputation with a very low rate of <b>limb</b> <b>fitting.</b> Intervention is significantly delayed when the admitting specialty is not vascular surgery, and half of these patients require HDU/ITU care, with significant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and referral to vascular surgery is crucial in management of these patients...|$|E
