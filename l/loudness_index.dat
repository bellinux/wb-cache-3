40|$|Objective: This paper {{presents}} automatic {{method of}} segmentation of heart sound using {{the occurrence of}} the cardiac rhythmic events. Methods: Noisy heart sound is filtered using the 6 th order Chebyshev type I low pass filter to remove the redundant noise. Bark Spectrogram is calculated from the cardiac signal by converting spectrogram to the bark scale. The bark spectrogram is smoothened and the <b>loudness</b> <b>index</b> is calculated by averaging the amplitude across all frequency bands. The <b>loudness</b> <b>index</b> is smoothened and differentiated to obtain the event detection function. The smoothened event detection function gives the occurrence of the cardiac events namely {{the first and the}} second heart sounds. Conclusion: This method is highly effective in identifying peaks S 1 and S 2 with the segmentation accuracy of 96. 98 % giving an F 1 measure of 97. 09 %. Significance: This method does not require the setting up of any type of threshold. So it is a highly effective type of segmentation under noisy conditions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} noise measuring. There are {{described}} methods of measurement {{and evaluation of}} noise, focusing on Steven’s loudness calculation method. Basic concepts of acoustics are provided in the first part. There are also mentions measurement of noise using microphones and sound level meter. The second part {{is focused on the}} practical solution of thesis. In which it is made measurement of noise using sound level meter NTi Acoustilizer and implementation of the graphical user interface for calculation of the Steven’s <b>loudness</b> <b>index</b> in Matlab...|$|E
40|$|Objective: In {{an earlier}} study (), {{detailed}} noise exposure measurements were obtained through individual dosimetry. In this further {{analysis of the data}} we ask the question “Can the effort required to converse in noise be used to estimate the experienced A-weighted noise level?” Design: The noise levels experienced during specific activities were obtained from the analysis of dosimetry results from personal noise exposure meters worn by study participants. The measured noise levels from particular events were compared to a subjectively judged ‘loudness rating’ reported by the person wearing the dosimeter during the measured event. Study sample: Volunteers (females = 20, males = 22) between 18 and 35 years (average age = 26. 8) willing to wear dosimeters and keep a simple activity log. Results: The relation between the objectively measured and the subjectively judged levels was consistent for the group over a large number of events. Conclusions: The subjective <b>loudness</b> rating <b>index</b> was shown to be a convenient tool that can be utilized for the retrospective estimation of noise levels from individual activities. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{practical}} and repeatable method of assessing acoustic performance of vehicle carpet systems {{was developed and}} tested. The method was employed during in-situ tests to evaluate the vehicle carpet&# 039;s sound absorption performance and transmission loss capability under stationary conditions. The acoustic performance of vehicle carpet systems was evaluated by introduction of floor mats. The resulting acoustic measurements were then compared and analysed. The various vehicle carpet systems are rated {{in terms of their}} effectiveness. Psychoacoustic analysis, using the Artemis software, was undertaken to evaluate the characteristics of interior cabin noise. The evaluation parameters include sound pressure level (SPL) in the entire frequency range, articulation <b>index,</b> <b>loudness,</b> fluctuation strength, roughness, sharpness, and tonality. Results indicate that loudness have the largest influence on sound quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} noise {{on human health}} (both mental and physical) are well known, and {{motivation}} to decrease noise in daily life is prevalent. Wind noise within automotive interior cabins could be detrimental to human health and comfort because of the negative impact on speech intelligibility and fatigue overall. There is little information on human perception of wind noise in automobile interiors though <b>Loudness</b> and Articulation <b>Index</b> have been examined as predictors of human response. They {{have been found to}} predict well in some circumstances, but not in others. In this research, a variety of sound quality metrics are being examined to better define how people perceive wind noise. Ford collected sounds in cars in a wind tunnel using four artificial Aachen heads, varying wind speed and direction. A variety of cars were tested, including midsize and compact SUVs. A database was created in order to easily compare a variety of characteristics for each sound and test configurations. Metrics for the front passenger and driver measurements were compared for symmetry and several unexpected asymmetries were found. High correlation (R 2 3 ̆e 0. 9) was found between several metrics: roughness, Articulation Index, A-weighted sound pressure level, and Zwicker Loudness. Subjective testing is still needed to be done to confirm which metrics provide the best predictions of people 2 ̆ 7 s responses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to assess long-term changes in tinnitus severity exhibited by patients who completed a comprehensive tinnitus management program; to identify factors {{that contributed to}} changes in tinnitus severity within this population; {{to contribute to the}} development and refinement of effective assessment and management procedures for tinnitus. Methods Detailed questionnaires were mailed to 300 consecutive patients prior to their initial appointment at the Oregon Health & Science University Tinnitus Clinic. All patients were then evaluated and treated within a comprehensive tinnitus management program. Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to the same 300 patients 6 to 36 months after their initial tinnitus clinic appointment. Results One hundred ninety patients (133 males, 57 females; mean age 57 years) returned follow-up questionnaires 6 to 36 months (mean = 22 months) after their initial tinnitus clinic appointment. This group of patients exhibited significant long-term reductions in self-rated tinnitus <b>loudness,</b> Tinnitus Severity <b>Index</b> scores, tinnitus-related anxiety and prevalence of current depression. Patients who improved their sleep patterns or Beck Depression Inventory scores exhibited greater reductions of tinnitus severity scores than patients who continued to experience insomnia and depression at follow-up. Conclusions Individualized tinnitus management programs that were designed for each patient contributed to overall reductions in tinnitus severity exhibited on follow-up questionnaires. Identification and treatment of patients experiencing anxiety, insomnia or depression are vital components of an effective tinnitus management program. Utilization of acoustic therapy also contributed to improvements exhibited by these patients. </p...|$|R
