40|$|Instead of {{defining}} {{goodness of fit}} (GOF) tests {{in terms of their}} test statistics, we present an alternative method by introducing the concept of <b>local</b> <b>levels,</b> which indicate high or low local sensitivity of a test. <b>Local</b> <b>levels</b> can act {{as a starting point for}} the construction of new GOF tests. We study the behavior of <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> when applied to some well-known GOF tests such as Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests, higher criticism (HC) tests and tests based on phi-divergences. The main focus is on a rigorous characterization of the asymptotic behavior of <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of the original HC tests which leads to several further asymptotic results for <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of other GOF tests including GOF tests with equal <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b> While <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of KS tests, which are related to the central range, are asymptotically strictly larger than zero, all <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> of HC tests converge to zero as the sample size increases. Consequently, there exists no asymptotic level α GOF test such that all <b>local</b> <b>levels</b> are asymptotically bounded away from zero. Finally, by means of numerical computations we compare classical KS and HC tests to a GOF test with equal <b>local</b> <b>levels.</b> Comment: Published at [URL] in the Bernoulli ([URL] by the International Statistical Institute/Bernoulli Society ([URL]...|$|R

Community participation and partnership along with the decentralisation of government power to local communities are important aspects of environmental governance at the <b>local</b> <b>level.</b> Initiatives such as these are integral divergence from earlier environmental governance approaches which was “driven by state agendas and resource control” and followed a top-down or trickle down approach rather than the bottom up approach that <b>local</b> <b>level</b> governance encompasses. <b>Local</b> <b>level</b> governance shifts decision making power away from the state and/or governments to the grassroots. <b>Local</b> <b>level</b> governance is extremely important even on a global scale.
