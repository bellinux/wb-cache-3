5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to <b>lubricate</b> {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was {{inspired}} by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to the complexities of overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

Research {{has shown that the}} <b>lubricating</b> materials are actively absorbed by PA and POM-H polymers (0. 6 [...] . 0. 9 mg/cm 2). <b>Lubricating</b> with SAE 10 oil the coefficient of friction of tested polymers is 0. 08 … 0. 10, while <b>lubricating</b> with rapeseed oil it is 0. 03 (PA), 0. 10 (POM-H). <b>Lubricating</b> with rapeseed oil PETF wear intensity is the lowest and slightly influenced by the load, whereas PA and POM-H wear intensity is directly influenced by the load – the greater the load, the more intensive the wear. Wear {{intensity of}} POM-H polymer <b>lubricated</b> with rapeseed oil is 3 times more intensive than <b>lubricated</b> with mineral oil. For this reason the combination of rapeseed oil and POM-H polymer in friction couples is inapplicable. PA is recommended for rapeseed oil <b>lubricated</b> friction couples because of its low wear (0. 01 … 0. 03 μm/m) and low coefficient of friction (0. 03) ...|$|R

30|$|<b>Lubricating</b> oil, {{the second}} largest {{petroleum}} product, is widely used in machinery, electric power, transportation, and chemical industry [1]. <b>Lubricating</b> oil is prone to pollution during storage, transportation, filling and usage, and is then converted into emulsified oil [2].

The dehydration and purification treatment of emulsified <b>lubricating</b> oil is important in prolonging the service life, recovering the usability of the oil, reducing the generation of waste oil and ensuring the safe operation of the equipment [4]. In addition, the annual quantity of waste <b>lubricating</b> oil is high, of which 40 – 45  % can be reused through regeneration treatment [5].
