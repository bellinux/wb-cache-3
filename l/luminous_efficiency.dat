The tabulated sensitivity curves have {{a certain amount of}} arbitrariness in them. The shapes of the individual X, Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy. However, the overall luminosity curve (which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves) is subjective, since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness, even if they are in completely different colors. Along the same lines, the relative magnitudes of the X, Y, and Z curves are arbitrary. Furthermore, one could define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude.

Compared to a planar green OLED, the <b>luminous</b> current <b>efficiencies</b> of the OLED with an attached diffuser film or BEF increase by 29 % and 23 %, respectively. The overall <b>luminous</b> power <b>efficiencies</b> are enhanced by 28 % and 7 %. Compared to the planar green device, we observe blue shifts at different viewing angles when microstructured films are attached, {{which is the}} evidence that the waveguiding modes are being extracted. In our planar OLED, the peak wavelength blue shifts and the full width at the half maximum (FWHM) decrease with increasing viewing angles due to the microcavity effect. When the diffuser is attached, the spectral peak has a constant blue shift (6 nm) compared to that of the planar OLED. On the other hand, in the BEF case, the spectral shift depends on the viewing angle (2 - 12 nm blue shifts from 0 to 80 degrees). This is due to the different operating principles (scattering and redirected light) of the diffuser and BEF. Since the transmittance spectra of both the diffuser film and the BEF are flat over the visible range, it is suitable for lighting applications by using white OLED. When attaching the films on a commercial white OILED, the <b>luminous</b> current <b>efficiencies</b> of the OLED with an attached diffuser film or BEF increase by 34 % and 31 %, respectively.

The conductivity of all the OLEDs studied appeared {{to be dominated by}} space-charge injection effects, exhibiting a current I versus voltage V dependence of the form I alpha V-n, with n approximate to 7 at applied voltages at which electroluminescence was observed. Systematic studies of the current versus voltage and light-emitting behavior of the OLEDs have identified different excitation processes for the two dyes. It is suggested that electroluminescence from the FIrpic molecules originates by direct transfer of the exciton energy from the PVK to the dye molecules, while the process of light emission from the Ir(piq) (2) (acac) molecules involves carrier trapping. The efficiency of the devices can be tuned, to some extent, by varying the thickness of the organic film. <b>Luminous</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and <b>luminous</b> power <b>efficiencies</b> of 8 cd A(- 1) and 3 lm W- 1 were measured for these blended-layer OLEDs, with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates of 0. 35, 0. 35. ...|$|R

In this context, the data treated were mainly concerned with volumes (zones), surfaces and thicknesses (walls and windows), materials, and systems, with the aim to determine temperatures, heat fluxes, energy consumed, air transfers, and so on. The question thus arose as to the integration of indoor lighting conditions into the simulation. Hence, previous data structures had to be amended to incorporate the spatial positioning of entities (walls, windows, and artificial lighting sources) through vertexes. A set of procedures was also developed for polygons as well as calculating natural and artificial lighting.

Theelectromodulation (EM) technique particularly provides a straightforward means ofdetermining the electric field strength inside operational devices, and is used here toinvestigate the improved device performance due to the insertion of an interlayerbetween the anode and the emissive layer. The effects of different interlayer materials(hole-transporting polymeric materials and one crosslinkable material) are studied in red,green and blue PLEDs. Interlayer devices yield better efficiencies and longer lifetimes,which can be attributed to charge accumulation near the anode/interlayer and (or) interlayer/emissive layer interfaces indicated by EM measurements.
