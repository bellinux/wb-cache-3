40|$|We {{present results}} from two {{experiments}} designed to explore temporal properties of human color vision relevant to dynamic lighting applications. Sensitivity for smoothness perception of <b>linear</b> temporal <b>transitions</b> and flicker visibility was tested. Stimuli {{in the first}} experiment were <b>linear</b> color <b>transitions,</b> varying in either lightness, chroma or hue, around a base color represented in CIE LCh. Results show a significantly lower smoothness threshold for lightness changes than for chroma and hue changes. Moreover, the thresholds for lightness change show independence from the chroma and hue of the base color in contrast to thresholds for chroma and hue changes. A difference between the sensitivity for chroma and hue changes was also demonstrated. In the second experiment, the sensitivity for <b>linear</b> <b>transitions</b> is compared to flicker sensitivity for the same base colors. Results show that visibility thresholds for flicker are {{significantly lower than the}} thresholds smoothness of linear changes, demonstrating an influence of the type of change to the temporal sensitivity. The results from the flicker experiment show the same tendencies as the linear changes. The results from these experiments show a need for a model of perceived smoothness to control temporal changes in dynamic lighting systems and give the first steps towards building such a model...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} quantal model for {{studying}} four-center reactions, A 2 +B 2 → 2 AB, and collision induced dissociation A 2 +B 2 →A+B 2 +A. The method involves using hyperspherical coordinates to describe vibrations of the A 2 and B 2 bonds and a global vibration and {{rotation of the}} exchange products. Application to the H 4 system is presented, using a realistic potential energy surface. The reaction goes through a four-center <b>linear</b> <b>transition</b> state located just above the dissociation threshold. In the energy range studied (5 - 5. 5 eV), collision induced dissociation competes with the four-center reaction and is the dominant process. It is found that vibrational energy, originally deposited {{in one of the}} diatomic partners, is much more efficient than translational energy in promoting reaction. Vibrational and rotational final distributions show that the products are internally hot. This simple quantal model, yet very demanding computationally, illustrates in detail many features of the H 4 dynamics above the dissociation threshold, and could serve to study other four center reactions with trapezoidal or <b>linear</b> <b>transition</b> states. © 1996 American Institute of Physics.

The reflection/transmission coefficients are obtained for the limit of the parameter κ 2 ≪ 1, which corresponds to a wavelength shorter than the characteristic horizontal length of the harbor. The asymptotic formulas consider those cases when the geometry of the harbor can be variable in width and depth: linear or parabolic among other transitions {{or a combination of}} these geometries. For harbors with nonlinear transitions, the parabolic geometry is less reflective than the other cases.

Field {{observations}} {{were made in}} 3 - 4 m water depth of <b>linear</b> <b>transition</b> ripple geometry and migration using a high-resolution laser-video bed profiling system and acoustic scanning sensors during both the growth and decay phases of an autumn storm event. <b>Linear</b> <b>transition</b> ripples are long-crested, low-steepness bedforms of the anorbital ripple type and were observed to occur here at relatively high wave energies just below the fiatbed threshold, with wavelengths of 8. 5 4 - 0. 5 cm and heights of 0. 3 + 0. 1 cm. The maximum observed migration rate was 0. 7 cm/min. Migration was offshore during storm growth and onshore during storm decay. The observed ripple migration velocities were highly correlated (r 2 > 0. 7) with nearbed wave orbital velocity skewhess in both cross [...] shore directions. During storm growth the incident wave spectrum was bimodal and the orbital velocity skewhess was negative. During storm decay the xvave spectrum was unimodal and the velocity skewhess was positive. Bispectral analysis shows that the main contribution to negative velocity ske•vness during storm growth was due to a difference interaction between the two principal (sea and swell) components of the bimodal velocity spectrum. Positive skewhess during storm decay was due to self-self interaction of the narrowband residual swell. The negative velocity skewhess observed during storm growth is consistent with prediction by a two-frequency second-order wave theory. 1...|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{species have}} been {{classified}} into the binary categories of vocal learner or vocal non-learner based {{on their ability to}} produce novel vocalizations or imitate other species, with evidence from social isolation, deafening studies, and cross-fostering experiments. However, vocal learners exhibit a great deal of plasticity or variation between species, resulting in a spectrum of ability. The vocalizations of songbirds and whales have a syntactic-like organization similar to that of humans but are limited to Finite-State Grammars (FSGs), where they can generate strings of sequences with limited structural complexity. Humans, on the other hand, show deeper hierarchical relationships, such as the nesting of phrases within others, and demonstrate compositional syntax, where changes in syntactic organization generate new meanings, both of which are beyond the capabilities of other vocal learning groups [...] Vocal learning phenotype also differ within groups and closely related species will not display the same abilities. Within avian vocal learners, for example, zebra finch songs only contain strictly <b>linear</b> <b>transitions</b> that go through different syllables in a motif from beginning to end, yet mockingbird and nightingale songs show element repetition within a range of legal repetitions, non-adjacent relationships between distant song elements, and forward and backward branching in song element transitions.
