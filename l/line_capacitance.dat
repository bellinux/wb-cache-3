5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the <b>line</b> <b>capacitance</b> forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{important}} results of the work on loading coils was that the loading caused a cut-off at a definite frequency in the line response, whose value could be predicted with {{a knowledge of the}} <b>line</b> <b>capacitance</b> and coil inductance and the spacing between coils. An unloaded continuous line has no such behavior, the attenuation simply steadily increased with frequency. This behavior, and the lumped element networks being used to create artificial lines for test purposes, suggested to Campbell a possible topology for a filter with similar characteristics.|$|E

50|$|The {{capacitive}} effect of long underground or undersea cables in AC transmission applications {{also applies to}} AC overhead lines, although to a much lesser extent. Nevertheless, for a long AC overhead transmission line, the current flowing just to charge the <b>line</b> <b>capacitance</b> can be significant, and this reduces the capability of the line to carry useful current to the load at the remote end. Another factor that reduces the useful current carrying ability of AC lines is the skin effect, which causes a non-uniform distribution of current over the cross-sectional area of the conductor. Transmission line conductors operating with direct current do not suffer from either of these constraints. Therefore, for the same conductor losses (or heating effect), a given conductor can carry more current to the load when operating with HVDC than AC.|$|E

40|$|Coding was {{proposed}} {{as a general}} method of decreasing power dissipation for the I/O [4, 5]. Lower power dissipation {{can be obtained by}} using extra bus lines for coding the data. This paper presents an application of the general theory of limited-weight codes for a class of parallel terminated buses with pull-up terminators (e. g. Rambus). Power dissipation on such a bus-line is larger for a logical 1 and it follows that patterns with few 1 s should be chosen. A perfect k 2 -limited weight code equivalent to the previously proposed BusInvert method and a novel non-perfect 3 -limited weight code are described. Both codes can be algorithmically generated and practical issues related to their implementation on the Rambus are discussed. 1 Introduction Coding buses for low-power and low-noise was independently proposed in [1, 4, 5, 6].
