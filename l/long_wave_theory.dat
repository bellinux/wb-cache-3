40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a more general theory of spatio-temporal development that encompasses the prominent features of the growth pole paradigm, but has a broader scope, more fundamental structure, and more powerful explanatory capability. The enhanced nature of this theory is possible by synthesizing the spatial features of the growth pole paradigm, with temporal features of a similar, but distinct, theory of endogenous economic cycles. This objective is pursued in three steps. First, the key components of the growth pole and <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theories</b> are highlighted, with pre-acknowledgement that neither contain the formal details of other discussions. Second, a preliminary synthesis of the growth pole and <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theories</b> is examined, providing an improved, but also incomplete, theory of spatio-temporal development. Third, a general theory of socio-economic development is presented by integrating the growth pole paradigm with a utility-based behavioral explanation of <b>long</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we argue that}} <b>Long</b> <b>Wave</b> <b>Theory</b> {{provides}} a useful conceptual tool for understanding {{the transition from the}} industrial to the, post-industrial economy.

However, a central aspect of long wave theory-the key factor-is still ambiguously dealt with in the theory and in need of further refinement.

30|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} delayed rupture of the Nankai and Tokai segments, based on a seismological model by assuming that the rupture initiates at the Tonankai (N 2) segment off Kii Peninsula. We first search for the worst case of rupture delay in terms of coastal tsunami heights based on the superposition principle for the linear <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theory.</b> We then make tsunami simulation of nonlinear <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theory</b> for the worst case scenario, to examine the amplification of tsunami heights relative to the simultaneous rupture on the coasts from Sagami Bay through Kyushu.|$|E

We therefore calculate the coastal tsunami heights for the above scenario by using nonlinear <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theory.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{main issue}} of this report is {{comparison}} and verification of <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> models with emphasis on variable depth effects. A selection of dispersive <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theories</b> are reviewed. Included are the so-called standard Boussinesq equations and the much celebrated counterpart where the velocities are prescribed at an optimal vertical position, namely at 0. 531 times the depth down from the equilibrium surface. The latter option, referred to as improved Boussinesq equations, displays substantially improved dispersion properties on constant depth. We also address formulations with the velocity potential as primary unknown and where approximations linked to a mild bottom slope have been invoked. One of the potential formulations are modified in a very simple way to yield dispersion properties equal to the "improved Boussinesq equations". First the different Boussinesq models are assessed for constant depth propagation. Then testing is extended to wave motion in an idealized bathymetry with two horizontal planes joined by a smooth slope. The length of the waves incident on the slope {{as well as the}} slope steepness are systematically varied. It turns out that the new potential formulation, with improved dispersion properties, performs well even in presence of steep bottom gradients...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of waves on the dynamic properties of bending moments {{at the root}} of blades of tidal stream vertical-axis rotors is reported.

It can be concluded that, in steep <b>waves,</b> linear <b>theory</b> underestimates the dynamic behaviour of bending moments. However, in <b>long</b> <b>waves,</b> linear <b>theory</b> works well. Bending moments at roots of rotor blades fluctuate with significant amplitudes (as much as 50 per cent of mean value for out-of-plane bending moment and 100 per cent of mean value for in-plane bending moment), which will be important for design of tidal stream rotors...|$|R
40|$|The {{various aspects}} of the {{propagation}} of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> onto a shelf (i. e., reflection, transmission and propagation on the shelf) are examined experimentally and theoretically. The results are applied to tsunamis propagating onto the continental shelf. A numerical method of solving the one-dimensional Boussinesq equations for constant depth using finite element techniques is presented. The method is extended to the case of an arbitrary variation in depth (i. e., gradually to abruptly varying depth) in the dirlection of wave propagation. The scheme is applied to the propagation of solitary waves over a slope onto a shelf and is confirmed by experiments. A theory is developed for the generation in the laboratory of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> of permanent form, i. e., solitary and cnoidal <b>waves.</b> The <b>theory,</b> which incorporates the nonlinear aspects of the problem, applies to wave generators which consist of a vertical plate which moves horizontally. Experiments have been conducted and the results agree well with the generation theory. In addition, these results are used to compare the shape, celerity and damping characteristics of the generated <b>waves</b> with the <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theories.</b> The solution of the linear nondispersive <b>theory</b> for harmonic <b>waves</b> of a single frequency propagating over a slope onto a shelf is extended to the case of solitary waves. Comparisons of this analysis with the nonlinear dispersive theory and experiments are presented. Comparisons of experiments with solitary and cnoidal waves with the predictions of the various theories indicate that, apart from propagation, the reflection of waves from a change in depth is a linear process except in extreme cases. However, the transmission and the propagation of both the transmitted and the reflected waves in general are nonlinear processes. Exceptions are waves with heights which are very small compared to the depth. For these waves, the entire process of propagation onto a shelf {{in the vicinity of the}} shelf is linear. Tsunamis propagating from the deep ocean onto the continental shelf probably fall in this class...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{economic}} {{events have}} revived {{interest in the}} economic <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> or Kondratiev cycle, a cycle of economic expansion and depression lasting about fifty years. Since 1975 the System Dynamics National Model has provided an increasingly rich <b>theory</b> of the <b>long</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>theory</b> revolves around "self-ordering" of capital, the dependence of the capital-producing sectors of the economy, in the aggregate, on their own output.

The central focus of this dissertation is on the world economy. Consequently, it is argued that recent economic instability cannot be properly understood except from global perspective. The structure of the world economy, in particular its division into a developed center and a less-developed periphery, is considered to be {{an essential part of the}} long-term dynamics of the world system, here considered in the context of <b>long</b> <b>waves</b> or Kondratieff cycles. The author reviews, synthesizes and reformulates some of the recent <b>long</b> <b>wave</b> <b>theories.</b> The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of a conceptual framework and the theoretical links between long-term oscillations inherent in the industrial economies and the periodic surges in the industrialization of peripheral areas. The essence of the author's hypothesis is that late in a <b>long</b> <b>wave's</b> expansion phase, factors that other authors have suggested would cause a tendency towards rationalizing, labor-saving innovations also tend to cause an increase in center-to-periphery capital flows and a surge in industrialization in the periphery areas. The recent surges in industrialization in some undeveloped countries that coincide with a slower economic growth in many developed countries confirms this. Factors that contribute to this development are, for instance, congestion in the labor market of the center, diffusion of key technologies of the preceding Kondratieff upswing and saturation of center markets. In addition, various other factors that influence the center-periphery relationship are discussed. The author sees the center-periphery structure of the world economy as inherently unstable, and his analysis is a step towards the ultimate goal of developing an evolutionary model capable of describing the periodic transformations of this structure as an endogenous process. The theoretical analysis is followed by discussions of some statistical and descriptive evidence. While the evidence does not allow for strong conclusions, it shows interesting patterns that might be worth further exploration. The author emphasizes a historical, rather than purely empirical, approach to the Kondratieff cycle. Primarily, however, the acceptability of the hypothesis will depend on the identification of a convincing mechanism that can explain the phenomenon...|$|R

The analytical properties of the model are studied through the use of simulation techniques, and they are then empirically investigated for the case of 21 oecd economies in the period 1890 - 1990. The econometric results indicate that the process of catching up, forging ahead and falling behind is the complex outcome of the adaptation of each country to the emerging technological paradigm. Countries differ in their timing of entry into the new long wave (dependent on their technological congruence), and in the speed at which the new paradigm diffuses and becomes dominant (dependent on their social capability, and on their facility for structural change). The earlier the entry and the faster the diffusion, the better will be the economic performance of the country relative to the others over the long wave growth process. ...|$|E
