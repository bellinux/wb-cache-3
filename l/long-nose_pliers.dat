Their namesake long nose gives excellent control while {{the cutting edge}} near the pliers' joint provides [...] "one-tool" [...] convenience. Because of their long shape they are useful for reaching into small areas where cables or other materials have become stuck or unreachable with fingers or other means.|$|E
