500|$|As {{well as her}} 1992 {{autobiography}} I Put a Spell on You (1992), {{written with}} Stephen Cleary, Simone {{has been the subject}} of several books. [...] They include Nina Simone: Don't Let Me Be Understood (2002) by Richard Williams; Nina Simone: Break Down and <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Out (2004) by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan; Princess Noire (2010) by Nadine Cohodas; Nina Simone (2004) by Kerry Acker; Nina Simone, Black is the Color (2005) by Andy Stroud; and What Happened, Miss Simone?

500|$|In an {{interview}} about the [...] "rebirthing" [...] scene, Kit Harington {{said that it}} intended to mirror the Daenerys Targaryen scene {{at the end of}} the third-season episode [...] "Mhysa" [...] when Daenerys is held up by freed Yunkai slaves; in [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Jon Snow emerges from the crushing crowd of the battle: [...] "When the crush starts happening, he slows down, and there's that thing of peace where he thinks: 'I could just stay here and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> end.' And then something drives him to fight up, and that moment when he comes up and grasps for breath, he is reborn again, which I found weirdly reflective of the scene where Dany is held aloft at the end of season three." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the Jamie Isaac remix, Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{stated that}} Jamie Isaac [...] "strips the song {{back to its}} bare bones while is augmenting the central beat by simple handclaps, adds in his own backing vocals, tweaks {{everything}} {{to make it seem}} oddly sinister and just <b>lets</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> simmer gently." ...|$|R
500|$|While Confessions {{was still}} in production, Usher promised [...] "real talk" [...] in it. He decided [...] "to <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> hang out by singing about {{some of his own}} little secrets, as well as a few bones from his homies' skeleton-filled closets." [...] He explained: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal". Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E
500|$|Simone {{was known}} for her temper and {{frequent}} outbursts. In 1985, she fired a gun at a record company executive, whom she accused of stealing royalties. Simone said she [...] "tried to kill him" [...] but [...] "missed". In 1995, she shot and wounded her neighbor's son with an air gun after the boy's laughter disturbed her concentration. According to a biographer, Simone took medication for a condition from the mid-1960s on. All this was only known to {{a small group of}} intimates, and kept out of public view for many years, until the biography Break Down and <b>Let</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> Out written by Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan revealed this in 2004, after her death. [...] Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, a one-time friend of Simone's, related in her own autobiography, Society's Child: My Autobiography, two instances to illustrate Simone's volatility: one incident in which she forced a shoe store cashier, at gunpoint, to take back a pair of sandals she'd already worn; and another in which Simone demanded a royalty payment from Ian herself as an exchange for having recorded one of Ian's songs, and then ripped a pay telephone out of its wall when she was refused.|$|E

2500|$|Larry had [...] "1991" [...] and [...] "1994" [...] {{tattooed on}} his arm, as he {{explained}} that he had to go back after his initial treatment. [...] Larry struggled with a familiar cycle for years. [...] As friend and bike building partner Paul Cox explained: [...] "...he would go through periods of time when he didn't think he deserved fame or whatever, and would sabotage himself by doing drugs. Larry would attack himself internally and head down a self-destructive spiral." [...] It was not until the late 1990s that Larry was finally able to free himself and stop using. [...] Mentioning the long journey that it took, Larry expressed that he didn't think that he could do it all over again. [...] "It was too hard," [...] he said. Larry's friend photographer Timothy White expressed, [...] "drugs didn’t belong with Larry and I think Larry knew that and it wasn’t until he got to a point that he really realized that – [...] only at that point could he <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> go. [...] And once he did, his life changed completely. [...] It changed completely, like nobody I've ever seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1999 {{television}} series , Quan Chi guest-starred {{in four of}} the show's 22 episodes, and was played by Adoni Maropis. In the ninth episode ("Quan Chi"), similar to [...] his DotR storyline, he crafts a potion that magnifies the flaws of the lead characters (Kung Lao, Siro and Taja), while subsequent appearances featured Quan Chi joining forces with Shang Tsung to defeat Kung Lao in exchange for Shang Tsung's instruction in stealing souls (episode ten, [...] "Unholy Alliance"); his building an army under the guise of a traveling circus (episode fourteen, [...] "Festival of Death"); and Shang Tsung morphing into Quan Chi in his plot to assassinate Shao Kahn (episode nineteen, [...] "Flawed Victory"). In a 2006 interview with Konquest fan page MKC Site, Maropis explained that he [...] "honestly wasn't into the whole Mortal Kombat video game thing", but he [...] "just felt this character" [...] once his makeup was applied, a process that took two hours. Maropis added that he had to fight to use the vocal tone he had created for the character and had used in his first appearance ("I would begin with a simple 'aaaahhhh… perhaps' [...] ") because the Konquest producers wanted him to lower the character's onscreen intensity, but they eventually relented and allowed Maropis to rerecord his dialogue as he preferred in his second episode appearance: [...] "They let me be and <b>let</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> hang out." ...|$|E

5000|$|A peak of such acrasia {{was perhaps}} {{reached in the}} 1960s cult of <b>letting</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> hang out - of breakdown, acting out and {{emotional}} self-indulgence and drama.
