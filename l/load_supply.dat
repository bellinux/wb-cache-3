5|$|Traditionally the Australian Army had {{relied on}} its major allies to provide {{logistic}} support, primarily raising combat units rather than support arms {{during times of}} conflict. Consequently, these services were relatively underdeveloped, and they remained so during {{the first years of}} the war. While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941, the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war. As a result, the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic, including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining. These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships, food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas. In addition, with Australia's national support base located well to the rear, in the major cities in the south-east of the country, significant expansion of the Army's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea. Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia, while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to <b>load</b> <b>supply</b> aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The Panther Tongue is a fluvio-deltaic parasequence in {{the lower}} part of the Star Point Sandstone {{formation}} in the Wasatch Plateau, central Utah, deposited during the late Cretaceous period. The sedimentology of the Panther Tongue and adjacent beach ridges parasequence has been extensively described by Hwang & Heller (2002) and Hampson et al. (2011). This study aims to produce an estimate of the magnitude of the sediment supply and the sea level fluctuations at the time when the Panther Tongue delta was formed. First, two delta sections and a beach ridges section were constructed by interpreting and correlating available logs, using the Manti geological map (Witkind et al., 1987) and geological interpretations from Hwang & Heller (2002) and Hampson et al. (2011). Next, a numerical delta and beach ridges model ‘ 2 DStratSim’ in MATLAB was used to simulate the delta and beach ridges sections. Forward simulations with different sea level and sediment supply scenarios were run in order to determine a model that best fits the constructed delta and beach ridges sections. The input variables of the best matching simulation are the following. The relative sea level falls 28 meters over 80 000 years. The sea level decreases 4 meters over the first 40 000 years and 24 meters over the next 40 000 years. The average bed sediment <b>load</b> <b>supply</b> is 0, 03 m 3 /s. The average suspended sediment <b>load</b> <b>supply</b> is 0, 04 m 3 /s. The bed sediment <b>load</b> <b>supply</b> varies between 0, 15 m 3 /s and 0, 005 m 3 /s. The suspended sediment <b>load</b> <b>supply</b> varies between 0, 1 m 3 /s and 0, 005 m 3 /s. The total bed sediment volume was 1, 92 ?? 10 ?^ 11 m 3.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for the injection to the grid of renewable energy; therefore, to evaluate the optimal location of new renewable generation is an important task. The primary purpose of this work {{is to develop a}} multiobjective optimization model that permits finding multiple trade-off solutions for the location of new wind power resources. It is based on the augmented ε-constrained methodology. Two competitive objectives are considered: maximization of preexisting energy injection and maximization of new wind energy injection, both embedded, in the maximization of <b>load</b> <b>supply.</b> The results show that the location of new renewable generation units affects considerably the transmission network flows, the <b>load</b> <b>supply,</b> and the preexisting energy injection. Moreover, there are diverse opportunities to benefit the preexisting generation, contrarily to the expected effect where renewable generation displaces conventional power. The proposed methodology produces a diverse range of equivalent solutions, expanding and enriching the horizon of options and giving flexibility to the decision-making process...|$|E
