50|$|Comb printers, {{also called}} line matrix printers, {{represent}} the fifth major design. These printers are {{a hybrid of}} dot matrix printing and <b>line</b> <b>printing.</b> In these printers, a comb of hammers prints {{a portion of a}} row of pixels at one time, such as every eighth pixel. By shifting the comb back and forth slightly, the entire pixel row can be printed, continuing the example, in just eight cycles. The paper then advances and the next pixel row is printed. Because far less motion is involved than in a conventional dot matrix printer, these printers are very fast compared to dot matrix printers and are competitive in speed with formed-character line printers while also being able to print dot matrix graphics. The Printronix P7000 series of line matrix printers are still manufactured as of 2013.|$|E

Commands in the sed script may take an optional address, in terms of line numbers or regular expressions. The address determines when the command is run.

A separate special buffer, the hold space, may be used by a few sed commands to hold and accumulate text between cycles. sed's command language has only two variables (the [...] "hold space" [...] and the [...] "pattern space") and GOTO-like branching functionality; nevertheless, the language is Turing-complete, and esoteric sed scripts exist for games such as sokoban, arkanoid, chess, and tetris.|$|E

40|$|Screen {{printing}} {{has been}} the dominant method of thick film deposition because of its low cost. Many experiments in industry have been done and many models of the printing process have been developed since the 1960 ’s. With a growing need for denser packaging and a drive for higher pin count, screen printing has been refined to yield high resolution prints. However, fine <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> is still considered by industry to be difficult. In order to yield high resolution prints with high first pass yields and manufacturing throughput, the printing process must be controlled stringently. This paper focuses on investigating the effect of manufacturing process parameters on fine <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> {{through the use of}} statistical design of experiments (DOE). The process parameters include print speed, squeegee hardness, squeegee pressure, and snap-off distance. Response variables are mean width and standard deviation of 10 mil, 8 mil, and 5 mil lines in both parallel and perpendicular directions relative to the squeegee travel direction. It is concluded that the squeegee hardness has a statistically significant effect on both directions, while the squeegee speed has an effect only on the parallel direction. The implementation procedures of the experimental design are presented. The analysis of a 2 k factorial design with center points pertaining to the fine <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> experiment is discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented {{for determining the}} propagation modes in a microstrip <b>line</b> <b>printed</b> on a substrate having both electric- and magnetic-type general anisotropies. An integral equation is derived for the unknown current distribution on the microstrip line. The kernel of this equation is a complicated 2 multiplied by 2 matrix function of the substrate anisotropy and of the substrate thickness. In {{order to determine the}} dispersion relations for the propagating waves, this integral equation is reduced into a finite system of linear equations by using Galerkin's technique. Numerical results are given for several cases, and the effect of rotating the anisotropy axis in anisotropic substrates is investigated. The proposed method can be used to compute the propagation characteristics of microstrip <b>lines</b> <b>printed</b> on anisotropic substrates...|$|R

Efficiencies up to 18 % with fill factors of 79. 5 % on large area industrially pre- processed monocrystalline wafers were achieved. In order to further increase the efficiency, Voc and jsc need to be improved, by e. g. reducing the doping level of the emitter. Solar cells with an average emitter sheet resistance up to 75 Î/sq could be successfully contacted with hotmelt ink achieving fill factors up to 78 %. These cells clearly showed an improvement in the short circuit current density compared to solar cells with a higher doped emitter.

40|$|Transfer pad {{printing}} is a promising technique that allows to overcome restrictions of conventional screen printing regarding front side metallisation of c-Si solar cells. Within this work a pad printed front grid {{in an industrial}} process scenario is evaluated. Technological {{as well as economical}} aspects are addressed. Regarding technological evaluation, contact lines of 45 #mu#m printed on 10 x 10 cm" 2 wafers demonstrate the fine <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> ability of {{pad printing}} on large areas. The ability to print on uneven and fragile substrates like EFG material is proven. However, low paste transfer limits the line resistance and, thus, fill factor. Nevertheless, based on an extensive optimization of printing parameters including different pad types, values > 75 % are achieved for double printing. Economical analysis reveals above 3 % cost reduction per watt peak compared to state-of-the-art screen printing, taking into account the benefits of pad printing. (orig.)

40|$|In IC manufacturing, the {{performance}} of standard cells often varies due to process non-idealities. Some research work on 2 -D cell characterization shows that the timing variations can be characterized by the timing model. However, as regular design rules become necessary in sub- 45 nm node circuit design, 1 -D design has shown its advantages and has drawn intensive research interest. The circuit performance of a 1 -D standard cell can be more accurately predicted {{than that of a}} 2 -D standard cell as it is insensitive to layout context. This thesis presents a characterization methodology to predict the delay and power performance of 1 -D standard cells. We perform lithography simulation on the poly gate array generated by dense <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> technology, which constructs the poly gates of inverters, and do statistical analysis on the data simulated within the process window. After that, circuit simulation is performed on the printed cell to obtain its delay and power performance, and the delay and power distribution curves are generated, which accurately predict the circuit performance of standard cells.

40|$|To achieve higher {{efficiencies}} without extra-cost is {{the major}} goal {{of research and development}} in crystalline silicon solar cell production technology. This goal can be addressed by fine <b>line</b> <b>printing.</b> Therefore, the focus of this work will be the combination of fine line printed front contacts and high emitter sheet resistances. A detailed study of fine line front contacts is presented. Therefore, an electrical analysis based on solar cell results as well as an optical analysis based on microscope pictures are carried out. Furthermore, the contact characteristic of different silver pastes {{as a function of the}} emitter sheet resistance is analyzed. As additional approach fine line printed front contacts as seed layer for a two-step metallization are discussed within this work. Both concepts, the one- and two-step metallization, will be compared with each other. Moreover, the use of MWT (metal wrap through) solar cells [1] allows a further efficiency increase [2]. Hence, MWT solar cells with fine line screen printed front contacts are developed and characterized in this paper. Efficiencies up to 16. 8 % are realized with mc-Si MWT solar cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} and compare three different fine <b>line</b> <b>printing</b> techniques for the silver front side metallization of industrial-type silicon solar cells: single print, dual print and print-on-print. We obtain finger heights of 5. 6 μm for single print, 9. 5 μm for dual print and 15. 1 μm for print-on-print {{as well as}} finger width between 46. 2 μm and 61. 3 μm. We process PERC solar cells with dual print and print-on-print. For the dual print, we test two different bus bar designs, a standard rectangular shaped bus bar and a segmented bus bar. The resulting PERC solar cells achieve conversion efficiencies of 19. 8 % for dual print and print-on-print. The dual print with segmented bus bar design reduces the Ag paste consumption to 67. 7 mg, measured after printing prior to drying. To our knowledge, this is the lowest front side Ag paste consumption that has been reported so far. Additionally, we model optimum Ag finger width in dependence of electrical and geometrical parameters. We find that even when assuming very optimistic parameters, the optimum finger width of 26 μm is just a factor of two lower compared {{to the state of}} the art technology today...|$|E
