5000|$|However, as {{the vehicle}} moves another loss {{mechanism}} comes into play. This {{is due to the}} skin friction between the lift air and the ground below it. Some of the lift air [...] "sticks" [...] to the running surface, and is dragged out from under the pad as it moves. The amount of air that is lost though this mechanism is dependent on vehicle speed, surface roughness and the total area of the <b>lift</b> <b>pads.</b> The vehicle air pumps must supply new pressurized air to make up for these losses. As the vehicle weight and <b>lift</b> <b>pad</b> area is fixed, for a given vehicle design the volume of air that needs to be ingested by the pumps increases with speed.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a 50 -mm diameter floating-ring helium buffer seal are described.

Maximum surface speed is 183 m/s (600 fps) and maximum buffer gas pressure is 1389 kPa (200 psia). An operating range map was computed {{as a function of}} speed and pressure. Contradictory problems arise due to excessive friction preventing ring tracking at low-speed, high-pressure conditions and insufficent friction to retard inertia driven motions at high-speed, low-pressure conditions.

5000|$|As {{the various}} {{hovertrain}} systems were developing, a major energy use issue cropped up.

The pressure of the air required {{is a function of}} the vehicle weight and the size of the <b>lift</b> <b>pad,</b> essentially a measure of overall vehicle density. A non-moving vehicle only loses this air due to leakage around the pads, which can be very low depending on the relative pressure between the pad and the outside atmosphere, and further reduced by introducing a [...] "skirt" [...] to close the gap between the pad and running surface as much as possible.|$|R
