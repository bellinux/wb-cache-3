40|$|During {{the past}} decade, new sensing technologies, such as {{inductive}} loops, laser range scanners, radar detectors and computer vision sensors have been greatly enhanced {{and applied to}} the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) area. Among all these <b>sensor</b> <b>systems,</b> computer vision-based approaches {{are one of the}} most popular and promising techniques used in ITS for traffic evaluation and management, driver assistance, as well as other safety related research. This is primarily due to the advantages of easy maintenance, high flexibility, and low cost for traffic scene monitoring and analysis. Many stationary vision sensors have been already installed near the roadway, particularly at intersections. In addition, more and more vision sensors are now being installed on mobile vehicles, in order to have real time surrounding traffic information. This dissertation focuses on both mobile and stationary computer vision based traffic surveillance techniques, including the development of a new vision sensor, a survey and development of vision algorithms, as well as their applications in three different aspects of ITS areas with high quantitative requirements. These areas are outlined in further detail below. Portable Loop Fault Detection For many years, it has been difficult to quantitatively measure real-time freeway traffic conditions. Numerous research projects have been carried out in traffic surveillance; for example, the Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS) operated by Caltrans and UC Berkeley collects, processes, aggregates, and examines traffic data primarily through loop detectors buried beneath the freeway. This type of stationary embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>system</b> provides a point measurement for the traffic flow, roadway occupancy and average speed. By aggregating these directly measured traffic data, they can be used to estimate and provide a larger picture of the traffic conditions in certain area. However, the results obtained from embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensors</b> are not entirely reliable. The embedded loop data delivered to a Traffic Management Center (TMC) may contain errors at one or more sensors, and between the loop detector and the TMC database. As a result, loop fault detection is important. In this dissertation, a stationary-vision based technique has been developed as part of a Portable Loop Fault Detection Tool (PLFDT). This work is complementary to recent research focusing on aggregated faulty loop data at a macroscopic level (the macroscopic level generally considers a large roadway network as consisting of links (roadways) and nodes (e. g., intersections)). The objectives of the PLFDT is to develop a real time, multi-lane, multi-vehicle tracking system for freeways using video cameras as the baseline measurement technique to compare the loop detection signal for direct fault detection for inductive loop system. Localized Traffic Density Measurement The embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>system</b> provides a direct measurement to traffic flow, roadway occupancy and average speed (only for double-loop detector). This type of sensor network does not directly measure traffic density; instead it can only be estimated. In this dissertation, we have developed systematic techniques to measure traffic conditions by utilizing both on- and off-board computer vision systems. A unique development technique is a combined computer vision and Global Positioning System (GPS) equipped mobile traffic surveillance system to measure localized traffic density. In addition, we correlate the localized density measurement with estimates from embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> <b>system</b> using a space-time diagram. Experiments have shown the complementary nature of these sensing techniques. Further, most traffic surveillance computer vision algorithms and techniques are typically based on observing vehicles from stationary rectilinear cameras mounted near roadways. For many applications, some of the key tasks include extracting traffic information such as average traffic speed, flow, and density. However, less research has been carried out in observing and generating the localized traffic map around specific vehicles in the traffic stream. In this dissertation, we have developed a vision-equipped vehicle test bed for traffic surveillance purposes and have experimentally demonstrated the generation of localized traffic density from video processing and synthesizing. In contrast to the off-board surveillance systems (e. g. embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> networks and stationary vision monitoring system), this type of on-board surveillance system provides a temporal- and spatial- continuous measurement of the localized traffic density. One of the key components developed is an Orthogonal Omni-directional Vision (OODV) System that has been developed to observe lane-level activity surrounding a vehicle, as well as the ability to observe the surrounding roadway geometry. This vision system uses a special catadioptric mirror providing a 360 degree orthogonal view of the environment. It is different from other catadioptric mirror-based Omni-directional vision systems in that it directly provides an orthogonal image without the need of warping a polar-coordinate based image to a perspective view. Based on this unique OODV, a roadway traffic surveillance system was designed and implemented. It consists of three major components: *	A GPS stamped roadway traffic data collection technique; *	Post video processing that includes automatic vehicle detection/tracking with the ability to correct using interactive tools;*	A traffic parameter (localized density) estimation process. Combined with a GPS receiver that provides approximately 2 - 3 meters spatial resolution, this traffic surveillance system can be applied not only in several traffic applications which require localized traffic density/flow/average speed measurements, but also in some other applications that require detailed roadway geometry acquisition, and vehicle activity analysis. Based on experimentation, it has been shown that the designed mobile surveillance system reports a high detection rate under the dynamic freeway environment in the experiments, with assistance from a human interactive detection module. In order to have a better understanding of dynamic traffic conditions, we have incorporated this localized traffic density measurements into a Dynamic Roadway Network Database (DRND), which has been developed to fuse the roadway traffic data and the probe vehicle data. We believe that with the increasing use of on-board vision sensors, more and more localized traffic information samples can be reported to this type of database. The combinational analysis of temporal-spatial variable density and the embedded <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> data will provide a better and more reliable method for traffic condition estimation and prediction. Bicycle Safety Support System In addition to these new traffic data collection/analysis techniques and verification process, computer vision techniques are being applied in safety studies as well. In the third part of this dissertation, stationary vision based observations have been made of the timing of bicyclists' intersection crossing maneuvers, to support of efforts in improving traffic signal timing to accommodate the needs of bicyclists. Video recordings were made of bicyclists' crossings and the video images were processed to extract the bicyclists' trajectories. These were synchronized with video images of the traffic signals so that the timing of the bicyclists' maneuvers could be determined relative to the signal phases. The processed data have yielded cumulative distributions of the crossing speeds of bicyclists who did not have to stop at the intersection and the start-up times and final crossing speeds of the bicyclists who had to cross from a standing start. This study provides a foundation in recommendation of minimal green signal time in terms of safety purpose. The key contributions of this dissertation are:*	A unique OODV System has been designed and developed;*	A vision based systematic approach for developing a mobile traffic surveillance system has been proposed and implemented;*	A time-space diagram based flow calculation method from localized density has been proposed and experimentally verified; *	A stationary-vision based technique has been developed as part of a Portable Loop Fault Detection Tool (PLFDT) to provide baseline data; and*	A stationary vision-based intersection monitoring system has been developed for the quantitative study of bicyclist crossings at signalized intersections...|$|R

40|$|The Advanced Traffic Management System of San Antonio, Texas, called TransGuide <b>System</b> uses a <b>sensor</b> <b>system</b> {{installed}} in 26 miles of highway to feed data {{to a high}} speed computer network for analysis. The portions of interstates involved were generally confined to central city areas and did not reach the first outer loop that surrounds the inner city. The objective {{of this paper is}} to build a real-time travel time prediction model for the freeway network of San Antonio based on the information collected by the <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> and GPS <b>systems.</b> The travel time prediction of the model could be the basis of later traffic management systems and also used by the traveler information systems. The robustness and accuracy of the model is a very important feature because traffic management systems depend on driver acceptance and compliance to be effective. This paper examines first the use of Modular Neural Networks (MNN) to forecast multipleperiods of traffic engineering features, such as speed, occupancy and volume, and then determines the expected travel times based on these predicted values, using currently applied methods. Secondly, the multiple-periods travel times are predicted directly from the loop data with an MNN. The models are tested and trained on actual travel times from San Antonio, collected by GPS data system. Then the results of the two models are compared to each other and to the results of standard travel time prediction models...|$|R

We introduce a dynamic map that operates in a closed <b>loop</b> with various <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> improving their performance by filtering and contributing certain knowledge. The filtering relies on the capability of a mobile robot to gather sensor readings from different positions.

40|$|To improve cow {{management}} in large dairy herds, sensors {{have been developed}} that can measure physiological, behavioral, and production indicators on individual cows. Recently, the number of dairy farms using <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> has increased. It is not known, however, to what extent <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are used on dairy farms, and the reasons why farmers invest or not in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are unclear. The first objective {{of this study was}} to give an overview of the <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> currently used in the Netherlands. The second objective was to investigate the reasons for investing or not investing in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> The third objective was to characterize farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> A survey was developed to investigate first, the reasons for investing or not in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> and, then, how the <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are used in daily cow management. The survey was sent to 1, 672 Dutch dairy farmers. The final data set consisted of 512 dairy farms (response rate of 30. 6 %); 202 farms indicated that they had <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> and 310 farms indicated that they did not have <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> A wide variety of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was used on Dutch dairy farms; those for mastitis detection and estrus detection were the most-used <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> The use of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was different for farms using an automatic milking system (AMS) and a conventional milking system (CMS). Reasons for investing were different for different <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> For <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> attached to the AMS, the farmers made no conscious decision to invest: they answered that the sensors were standard in the AMS or were bought for reduced cost with the AMS. The main reasons for investing in estrus detection <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> were improving detection rates, gaining insights into the fertility level of the herd, improving profitability of the farm, and reducing labor. Main reasons for not investing in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> were economically related. It was very difficult to characterize farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Farms with CMS and <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> had more cows than CMS farms without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Furthermore, farms with <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> had fewer labor hours per cow compared with farms without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Other farm characteristics (age of the farmer, availability of a successor, growth in herd size, milk production per cow, number of cows per hectare, and milk production per hectare) did not differ for farms with and without <b>sensor</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Traffic {{detectors}} support most {{traffic management}} applications, {{so it is}} important that a detector performs as expected. This study evaluates the performance of four <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models and the Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS), adding to the body of sensor performance knowledge through the use of new analytical techniques. The study collected contact closure data from all five of the detectors and concurrent video data. Each <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> was deployed following Caltrans guidelines for at least 24 hours across dual loop detectors in each lane of I- 80, north of Oakland, CA. The research examined various distributions of the individual vehicle actuations from each of the detectors. This exercise found two <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> models locked up and not provide any data to the controller although they appeared fully functional from the front panel. The median on-time varied between the RTMS and the <b>loop</b> <b>sensors,</b> as well as from one <b>loop</b> <b>sensor</b> model to the next, which means the occupancy measurements will also change. The video was used to manually validate each vehicle passage over extended periods, preselected at random, with the errors classified by type (e. g., non-detected vehicle) and source (e. g., due to a lane change maneuver). The RTMS exhibited problems due to occlusion and reflections, while two of the <b>loop</b> <b>sensors</b> exhibited non-negligible problems. Then, the detector data are aggregated and used to evaluate the performance of each sensor under standard operation. Next, the results of two earlier evaluations of the RTMS are presented. The reports have not been formally published and to address the omission, this section recaps the relevant portions of those two studies {{in the context of the}} results presented above. This first effort considered the aggregated data reported by the RTMS using its internal controller emulation in comparison to dual loop detectors. The RTMS occupancy and flow measures are shown to be noisier than loops, though the velocity estimates are almost as good as those from single loops. The second study considers aggregate measurements from the contact closure data, comparing the RTMS against the dual loop detectors. For reference, the work also compared one loop against another in a dual loop detector, with the spacing between loops being greater than the spacing between the reference loops and the RTMS detection zone. As is illustrated in this study, the RTMS shows lane dependent results. ...|$|R

40|$|In smart {{structure}} applications where fiber sensors {{are embedded}} within structural materials, multiple lead in/out fibers are preferred for redundancy and improving reliability. The use {{of only one}} lead/out fiber is not optimal because the breakage of a fiber at one location due to, for example, local structural damage, would cause {{the failure of the}} whole sensing system. The multiplexing and networking techniques suitable for such applications have attracted considerable research recently. In this article, based on the bidirectional interrogation technique for white light interferometric sensors arrays, a multiplexed fiber optic deformation <b>sensor</b> <b>loop</b> network suitable for smart structure applications has been designed and demonstrated. Loop-network <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> are based on the white light interferometric technique. Michelson and Mach–Zehnder optical path interrogators have been developed and demonstrated, respectively. For the usually used one direction interrogate sensing system, it is clear that multiplexed sensor arrays suffer from relatively large fiber segment-induced optical reflective and excess insertion loss that generally limit the total number of sensors that can be accommodated in this configuration. This loop-network bidirection interrogating technique greatly extended the multiplexing capacity of fiber optic white light interferometric <b>sensors</b> <b>system.</b> A practical implementation of this technique is presented which makes use of a popular light emitting diode, superluminescent diode, or amplified spontaneous emission optical light source and standard single mode fiber, which are commonly used in the communication industry. The <b>sensor</b> <b>loop</b> topology is completely passive and absolute length measurements can be obtained for each sensing fiber segment {{so that it can be}} used to measure quasidistribution strain or temperature. For large-scale smart structures, this technique not only extends the multiplexing potential, but also provides a redundancy for the sensing system. It means that the <b>sensor</b> <b>loop</b> permits one point breakdown, because the sensing system will still work whenever the embedded <b>sensor</b> <b>loop</b> breaks somewhere.

It is not known whether using <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> also improves measures of health and production in dairy herds. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of using <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> on measures of health and production in dairy herds. Data of 414 Dutch dairy farms with (n =  152) and without (n =  262) <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> were available. For these herds, information on milk production per cow, days to first service, first calving age, and somatic cell count (SCC) was provided for the years 2003 to 2013. Moreover, year of investment in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was available. For every farm year, we determined whether that year was before or after the year of investment in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> on farms with an automatic milking system (AMS) or a conventional milking system (CMS), or whether it was a year on a farm that never invested in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Separate statistical analyses were performed to determine the effect of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> for mastitis detection (color, SCC, electrical conductivity, and lactate dehydrogenase sensors), estrus detection for dairy cows, estrus detection for young stock, and other <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> (weighing platform, rumination time sensor, fat and protein sensor, temperature sensor, milk temperature sensor, urea sensor, β-hydroxybutyrate sensor, and other <b>sensor</b> <b>systems).</b> The AMS farms had a higher average SCC (by 12, 000  cells/mL) after sensor investment, and CMS farms with a mastitis detection system had a lower average SCC (by 10, 000  cells/mL) in the years after sensor investment. Having <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> was associated with a higher average production per cow on AMS farms, and with a lower average production per cow on CMS farms in the years after investment. The most likely reason for this lower milk production after investment was that on 96 % of CMS farms, the <b>sensor</b> <b>system</b> investment occurred together with another major change at the farm, such as a new barn or a new milking system. Most likely, these other changes had led to a decrease in milk production that could not be compensated for by the use of <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Having estrus detection <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> did not improve reproduction performance. Labor reduction was an important reason for investing in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, economic benefits from investments in <b>sensor</b> <b>systems</b> can be expected more from the reduction in labor costs than from improvements in measures of health and production in dairy herds...|$|R
