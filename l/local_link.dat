40|$|On the {{background}} of Zhang's local Gross-Zagier formulae for GL(2), we study some p-adic problems. The local Gross-Zagier formulae give identities of very special local geometric data (<b>local</b> <b>linking</b> numbers) with certain local Fourier coefficients of a Rankin L-function. The <b>local</b> <b>linking</b> numbers are <b>local</b> coefficients of a geometric (height) pairing. The Fourier coefficients are products of the local Whittaker functions of two automorphic representations of GL(2). We establish a matching of the space of <b>local</b> <b>linking</b> numbers with the space of all those Whittaker products. Further, we construct a universally defined operator on the <b>local</b> <b>linking</b> numbers which reflects {{the behavior of the}} analytic Hecke operator. Its suitability is shown by recovering from it an equivalent of the local Gross-Zagier formulae. Our methods are throughout constructive and computational. Comment: 49 page...|$|R
