To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, though I knew that, <b>like</b> <b>anyone,</b> he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being <b>like</b> <b>anyone</b> else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's not that good. As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E

Thompson said that looking after Sol has [...] "taken a toll on [...] ". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed this out of character for Asher, as he loves his brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: [...] "At heart, he's <b>like</b> <b>anyone</b> trying to do well.

500|$|In {{the primary}} {{continuity}} of the comic books comprising the Marvel Universe, college-student Gwen Stacy was the girlfriend of Peter Parker, whom she was unaware was also Spider-Man. This primary version of Gwen Stacy was killed in The Amazing Spider-Man #121 (June 1973). The concept of an alternate-universe, spider-powered Gwen Stacy was first conceptualized by longtime Spider-Man writer Dan Slott for the [...] "Spider-Verse" [...] story arc across multiple series. Slott had suggested [...] "Gwen Stacy as a Spider-Woman" [...] to Spider-Man editor Nick Lowe, who then approached Jason Latour to write a series based on that character. Latour was concerned about restoring Gwen Stacy to life in even an alternate-universe form, given the canonical consequences of her death more than 40 years earlier, but eventually conceded, and approached Robbi Rodriguez to design the character. Latour prompted Rodriguez to keep her mysterious and to avoid anything that would prematurely reveal her identity, saying that she [...] "should feel <b>like</b> <b>anyone</b> could be under that mask." [...] Slott previously had envisioned a costume based on her clothing in the two-part death story, [...] "The Night Gwen Stacy Died" [...] (1973), except red and blue with web patterns and a half mask. She would also have had a trench coat {{that would have been}} red with webs. Slott ultimately approved of Rodriquez' design. The character debuted in Edge of Spider-Verse #2 on September 17, 2014 and is commonly referred to as Spider-Gwen.|$|E
500|$|Matangi {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be glad it exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound <b>like</b> <b>anyone</b> else." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, {{the singer}} {{was interviewed by}} Nobel Literature Prize-winning Colombian novelist and {{journalist}} Gabriel García Márquez, who was [...] "astonished by her fantastical work-rate" [...] and said that [...] "Shakira's music has a personal stamp that doesn't look <b>like</b> <b>anyone</b> else's {{and no one can}} sing or dance like her, at whatever age, with such an innocent sensuality, one that seems to be of her own invention." [...] In the United States and the United Kingdom, Shakira drew comparisons to American pop singer Britney Spears as they looked similar in appearance and sported [...] "bleached blonde curls and butter-wouldn't-melt smiles for the kids down the front." [...] However, critics argued that the Shakira's vocal style was very different from Spears', with Ted Kessler from The Observer calling the former an [...] "operatic diva" [...] and writing that [...] "as soon as she opens her mouth, she slips into gear and motors powerfully past Britney's breathy bump'n'grind." [...] In 2009, Julia Llewellyn Smith from The Daily Telegraph commented that [...] "Shakira makes comparable Spanish-English 'crossover' acts such as Jennifer Lopez and Enrique Iglesias seem like minnows." [...] In an interview with Latina magazine in 2011, Gloria Estefan was asked whether she felt another crossover artist like Shakira could emerge in her lifetime, to which she responded, [...] "I'm always hopeful that somebody, any Latino, is going to succeed in what they do. And of course in music, undoubtedly." [...] Shakira's crossover success also inspired other Latin artists to foray into the English language market and many compared Mexican singer Paulina Rubio's attempt to crossover with her English-language debut album Border Girl to that by Shakira.|$|E
