This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring.

Later in the campaign, he was fined $3,500 by the NHL for his actions during a game against Atlanta on December 23. After Lucic was hit by opposing defenceman Freddy Meyer, teammate Andrew Ference engaged Meyer in a fight. In the ensuing scrum, Lucic punched Meyer as the two were being restrained by referees, resulting in a match penalty. Three days following the game, Lucic received a $2,500 fine for his punch and an additional $1,000 for an obscene gesture he had made to players on the Thrashers' bench immediately afterwards. In January 2011, he missed three games with a shoulder injury. Lucic completed {{the season with a}} career-high 30 goals, 32 assists and 62 points in 79 games. He led the Bruins in goal-scoring while tying for the points lead with centre David Krejčí. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the third seed in the East, the Bruins eliminated the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning in the first three rounds, en route to the Stanley Cup Finals against Vancouver. Although Lucic scored below his regular-season pace during the post-season with 12 points (five goals and seven assists) in 25 games, he helped the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup since 1972, as the team defeated the Canucks in Game 7 of the Finals. It was later reported that Lucic was playing through a couple of injuries during the playoffs. During the Eastern Conference Finals, he suffered a broken toe after blocking a shot from teammate Tyler Seguin during practice. He also struggled with a sinus infection, which was part of a <b>larger</b> <b>problem</b> in his right nostril that traced back {{to the end of the}} 2009–10 season and caused improper breathing. Lucic underwent surgery in the off-season to repair the sinus.|$|E

The location of the redeposition will not exactly coincide with {{the location of the}} sputtering, so one is still left with erosion rates that may be prohibitive.

The tritium inventory in graphite layers and dust in a reactor could quickly build up to many kilograms, representing a waste of resources and a serious radiological hazard in case of an accident. The consensus of the fusion community seems to be that graphite, although a very attractive material for fusion experiments, cannot be the primary plasma-facing material (PFM) in a commercial reactor.|$|E

500|$|The Peace Association was {{dominated}} by Liberal Party politicians—from a Marxist perspective, [...] "bourgeois" [...] people. Historian Nils Ivar Agøy had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement—the most prominent being Koht, Adam Egede-Nissen and Carl Bonnevie—were [...] "radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie". This meant that they were [...] "capable of asserting themselves among the ship-owners and county governors in the board" [...] of the Norwegian Peace Association. Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman. He wanted to tie the [...] "apolitical" [...] peace movement closer to the labour movement, to create [...] "economic justice" [...] and to employ the use of arbitration in labour conflicts. These goals were not embraced {{by all of the}} members, particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral. A <b>larger</b> <b>problem,</b> however, was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism. He had thus carried out his compulsory military service [...] "with fervor", notes Agøy. Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the [...] "fatherland". The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle, and Koht therefore resigned his membership. He was followed by others, {{as a result of a}} schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists. Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader. The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish-Norwegian union was peacefully dissolved in 1905. Koht later returned to the Peace Association to serve as a board member from 1910 to 1912.|$|E

[...] A batterer’s unwillingness to allow the victim to leave the relationship substantiates the idea that violence is being used to force the victim to continue to fulfill the batterer’s wishes that she obey him.

40|$|The {{most popular}} methods for solving the shortest-path problem in Artificial Intelligence are {{heuristic}} search algorithms. The main contributions {{of this research}} are new heuristic search algorithms that are either faster or scale up to <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> than existing algorithms. Our contributions apply to both online and offline tasks. For online tasks, existing real-time heuristic search algorithms learn better informed heuristic values {{and in some cases}} eventually converge to a shortest path by repeatedly executing the action leading to a successor state with a minimum cost-to-goal estimate. In contrast, we claim that real-time heuristic search converges faster to a shortest path when it always selects an action leading to a state with a minimum f-value, where the f-value of a state is an estimate of the cost of a shortest path from start to goal via the state, just like in the offline A* search algorithm. We support this claim by implementing this new non-trivial action-selection rule in FALCONS and by showing empirically that FALCONS significantly reduces the number of actions to convergence of a state-of-the-art real-time search algorithm. For offline tasks, we improve on two existing ways of scaling up best-first search to <b>larger</b> <b>problems.</b> First, it is known that the WA* algorithm (a greedy variant of A*) solves <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> when it is either diversified (i. e., when it performs expansions in parallel) or committed (i. e., when it chooses the state to expand next among a fixed-size subset of the set of generated but unexpanded states). We claim that WA* solves even <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> when it is enhanced with both diversity and commitment. We support this claim with our MSC-KWA* algorithm. Second, it is known that breadth-first search solves <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> when it prunes unpromising states, resulting in the beam search algorithm. We claim that beam search quickly solves even <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> when it is enhanced with backtracking based on limited discrepancy search. We support this claim with our BULB algorithm. We show that both MSC-KWA* and BULB scale up to <b>larger</b> <b>problems</b> than several state-of-the-art offline search algorithms in three standard benchmark domains. Finally, we present an anytime variant of BULB and apply it to the multiple sequence alignment problem in biology. Ph. D.
