It is required that localization {{is one of the}} most important functionality of mobile sensor nodes. In this paper, we present a technique which improves the relative location of the MSN with a computer vision technology. This technique effects only in short distance but only with low price sensors, we achieved precise localization in the resolution of 10 centimeters. The well known perspective- 3 -point problem have been exploited for the precise short distance localization. By experiment we present an interrelation between angle of camera view and a <b>LED</b> <b>pattern</b> interval. We measures the distance of the counterpart vehicle and vehicles shares distance information of obstacle and the relative vehicles with possible cooperation of vehicles. The angle of a vehicle can be identified by digital compass. Finally, with a share of location information we can achieve localization of mobile sensor nodes with high accuracy. I...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{in the field of}} vehicle {{positioning}} technology for the Intelligent Transportation Systems. The ideas of an innovative light-emitting diode (LED) -based location beacon system are developed and verified. The system developed is a combination of several latest technologies which include a CMOS vision sensor, high brightness LEDs, and digital image processing techniques. It belongs to a new kind of simplex communication link. A digital camera is used to capture images contained in the LED beacon signal. The captured digital images are processed by the algorithms developed and a location code is extracted. The location code can be used for calibration of a vehicle positioning system which may consist of a GPS, Inertial Navigation System (INS) and other sensors. The issues examined include the structure of the transmitter and the receiver, the signaling method, the transmission protocol of the LED panel, the relationship between the camera capturing rate and the <b>LED</b> <b>pattern</b> update rate, the digital camera exposure technology, and the efficiency of the image processing algorithms. Experiments using a prototype transmitter and a receiver were performed.

40|$|The paper {{surveys the}} main {{findings}} of research about {{the specificity of}} the Japanese "régulation" mode and growth pattern, with a special emphasis upon the wage labor nexus, compares the recession which began in 1991 with the previous ones and finally analyses the institutional transformations taking place during the 90 's. Even if mass production and consumption do characterize the Japanese economy, the wage labor nexus is built upon an implicit compromise about employment stability, at odds with a typical Fordist one. The contemporary stagnation and uncertainty do not originate from this wage labor nexus being different from the American one, but from the de-synchronization the whole institutional architecture built after WW II and reformed after the first oil shock, under the pressures of a changing international environment and financial liberalization. The Japanese wage labor nexus allows a lot of flexibility and has been adapting all over the 90 's and {{is far from being}} the weakest institutional form. Clearly, the growth pattern itself is challenged by its very success in catching up and is destabilized by a partial financial liberalization.

Compared with GaN grown on sapphire without any pattern, the NPSS-GaN film is of much better quality as observed by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron-microscopy, X-ray diffraction, cathodoluminescence, and photoluminescence. This is because GaN is initiated from the c-plane {{instead of the}} LPD-silica surface.

Previous studies have shown that this type of social support improves elderly people’s well-being significantly. But it is still far from clear what underlying causes drive people’s judgment of entertainment value. Showing emotionally expressive behaviors seems to raise entertainment value, but what if these behaviors are not truly embodied, i. e., tied to processes in the environment? It would seem that it is important that expressive behaviors are tied to the proper events. In this study, we investigated whether multimodal behavioral patterns (i. e., combinations of gestures, eye <b>LED</b> <b>patterns,</b> and verbal expressions) based on the developments within a game aids the entertainment value. We chose a gaming situation where the robot plays Mastermind with a human, in which the robot could show no behavioral patterns, behavioral patterns tied to game progress, or randomly selected behavioral patterns from the same set. The behavioral patterns were designed to imitate four basic emotions (neutral, happy, angry, sad) in combination with five levels of surprise and five levels of confidence.
