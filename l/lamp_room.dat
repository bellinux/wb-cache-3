25|$|The ship got {{underway}} at 9:30am. As it {{was passing}} East 90th Street, a fire {{started in the}} <b>Lamp</b> <b>Room</b> in the forward section, possibly caused by a discarded cigarette or match. It was fueled by the straw, oily rags, and lamp oil strewn around the room. The first notice of a fire was at 10:00am; eyewitnesses claimed the initial blaze began in various locations, including a paint locker filled with flammable liquids and a cabin filled with gasoline. Captain Van Schaick was not notified until 10 minutes after the fire was discovered. A 12-year-old boy had tried to warn him earlier, but was not believed.|$|E

2500|$|Plans for a {{lighthouse}} and cottages were prepared in early 1874 {{by the office}} of F. D. G. Stanley, Queensland Colonial Architect, with an estimated cost of £1460 for the lighthouse and cottages. The lighthouse, a typical Queensland timber framed and iron clad structure, was to be prefabricated and built in Brisbane. However, the only response to the first tender was an overpriced offer of £2850. The second tender was more successful, the winning offer being by James Midson for £1046/10/-. The construction was completed some time in October 1874, and an additional contract was granted to Midson for the erection of the structures on the site for the sum of £753. Quite remarkably, a last minute change in the order of the lantern from England meant that no <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> was ordered. An urgent request for an additional £180 was made by Stanley for construction of a <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> from timber framing with iron plating, instead of the planned cast iron one. The lighthouse was operational around late July 1875. The original light source was an oil wick burner. [...] An 1895 survey also reports two additional auxiliary lights on Cape Capricorn, to the north and southeast of the main lighthouse.|$|E
2500|$|A 1910 report had {{recommended}} a new station building at Kuranda {{on an island}} platform {{that could be made}} ornamental by planting trees. Vincent Price {{was in charge of the}} architectural section of the Railway Department's Chief Engineer's Office when the passenger station block, described by the Chief Engineer as [...] "after the style of a Swiss Chalet, the idea being to make Kuranda a show station", was designed in 1911. Modified plans were drawn in 1913-14, and included the main station building (with booking lobby, booking office, waiting shed, ladies' toilets, passage, refreshment room, kitchen, pantry, scullery and kitchen yard); a signal cabin; and a utilities block (with men's toilet, porter's room, store room, and <b>lamp</b> <b>room).</b> Each of these three buildings was constructed of precast concrete units, in a Federation style with a Marseilles terracotta tile roof.|$|E

5000|$|The station {{opened with}} the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859. A {{newspaper}} {{reported at the}} time that it [...] "is situated on the western side of Par bay, about a mile from the pier head, close to the road to Fowey and Tywardreath, the traffic of which places as well as St Blazey and the neighbourhoods intended to receive here. The departure and arrival stations are spacious edifices, both having verandahs projecting over the platforms, with convenient waiting rooms, ticket office, porter and <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms,</b> and other necessary conveniences. A goods station has not yet been erected, but considering the amount of business likely to be transacted here it is more than probable that a goods shed will be required before long." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the time, Calvert {{was a very}} rural {{settlement}} with the few houses making up the village being situated close to the station and nearby brickworks which was the largest employer in the area. In true Great Central style, the station had a single island platform located below a road overbridge from the centre of which a staircase led down to the platform; the centre piers of the bridge were left hollow to provide <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms.</b> The design was chosen as it would allow the track to be quadrupled if ever required. About 2.5 mi south of Calvert was Grendon Underwood Junction where [...] "Calvert Cabin" [...] signal box controlled the line as it split into two: one line branching out towards Princes Risborough, the other towards Amersham.|$|R
2500|$|With several {{alterations}} and additions, {{this station}} served Lyttelton for 90 years until {{replaced by a}} modern structure in 1963. The station offices were placed {{at right angles to}} the passenger platforms, originally on the western side of Oxford Street, but later being moved {{to the other side of}} the same street in about 1882. The platform was lengthened in 1903 to accommodate an additional two carriages, necessitating the relocation of the <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> to a position near the engine shed. The railway stores shed was destroyed by fire, presumed to be arson, on 6 November 1937. Following the removal of a siding to Kinsey & Company's store near the station, a [...] extension of the platform at the west end was authorised in 1950, after difficulties were experienced in placing mixed consists (a common practice at the time) at the platform.|$|E
60|$|The {{railway station}} at Detton Magna presented, if possible, {{an even more}} dreary {{appearance}} than earlier in the day, as the time drew near that night for {{the departure of the}} last train northwards. Its long strip of flinty platform was utterly deserted. Around the three flickering gas-lamps the drizzling rain fell continuously. The weary porter came yawning out of his <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> into the booking office, where the station master sat alone, his chair turned away from the open wicket window to the smouldering embers of the smoky fire.|$|E
60|$|With a {{somewhat}} prolonged grinding of {{the brakes and}} an unnecessary amount of fuss in the way of letting off steam, the afternoon train from London came to a standstill in the station at Detton Magna. An elderly porter, putting on his coat as he came, issued, with the dogged aid of one bound by custom to perform a hopeless mission, from the small, redbrick <b>lamp</b> <b>room.</b> The station master, occupying a position of vantage in front of the shed which enclosed the booking office, {{looked up and down the}} lifeless row of closed and streaming windows, with an expectancy dulled by daily disappointment, for the passengers who seldom alighted. On this occasion no records were broken. A solitary young man stepped out on to the wet and flinty platform, handed over the half of a third-class return ticket from London, passed through the two open doors and commenced to climb the long ascent which led into the town.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{departure}} station is an ornamental wooden structure, having projecting verandahs at each side, waiting room, ticket office, &c., {{similar to the}} corresponding building at Lostwithiel. Nearly opposite is the arrival station, which is built of stone, with projecting verandah over the platform and having convenient waiting, porters', and <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms.</b> To the south {{of this is the}} goods shed, a stone building of the same dimensions as the goods shed at Lostwithiel, and the provision has been made here, for the accommodation of the heavy goods traffic that is anticipated from the district. Amongst other arrangements adopted, with the view of preventing collisions and inconvenience, it has been determined that the passenger traffic shall pass to the station through a street in front of the post office, and the goods traffic by Menacuddle Hill, in front of the Town Hall.|$|R
5000|$|An {{edition of}} Prime Time, RTÉ's current affairs programme, {{broadcast}} on 14 February 2006, cast doubts {{on some of}} the findings of the original tribunal. The programme produced witnesses who were outside the building on the night. Some outside saw fire coming from the roof up to eight minutes before those inside did. New evidence concerning the building's contents and layout was also presented. Important details were also shown regarding the actual location of a store room containing flammable materials and cleaning agents. The document plan of the building which the tribunal used, and which was critical to its findings, was shown to be confusingly flawed by locating the store room on the wrong level. It showed the store room to be [...] "over the basement", but there was no basement in the building, and the store and <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms</b> were located in the roof space on the first floor.|$|R

50|$|Prior to modernisation, these forts {{were built}} entirely of masonry, using large {{quantities}} of shaped stone. The forts were provided with a ditch, six to twelve meters wide and bounded by the main wall of the fort {{on one side and}} a counterscarp on the opposing side. Moats were unusual features at Séré de Rivières; most ditches were dry. Some walls were crenelated for defence and many had caponiers at angles to fire along the length of the ditch. Entries were typically by drawbridges. Inside the fort's perimeter were multi-story barracks with facades facing interior courtyards. Barracks were typically semi-recessed into the walls and included mess halls, kitchens and cisterns. Powder magazines were buried for protection from artillery, located behind triple-locked double doors and illuminated indirectly from <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms</b> to prevent accidental explosion. The artillery was laid out in the open air on top of the ramparts. Shelters were provided for ready ammunition. In some cases, artillery was located in armoured casemates or Mougin turrets. Special infantry positions were provided for defence of the ditch.|$|R

5000|$|The station {{opened with}} the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859. A report {{at the time}} claimed that it [...] "is {{generally}} admitted to be the handsomest station on the line, and looks as gay and bright as fresh paint can make it. It consists, first, of a departure station, a wooden building covered by rusticated boarding, having a projecting verandah, extending eight feet {{on each side of}} the carriage approaches, and extending over the railway platform. This contains a spacious first class waiting room, second class ditto, ticket, and other necessary offices, and conveniences. Immediately opposite to this, is the arrival station, which is also of wooden erection, having spacious waiting rooms, and porter and <b>lamp</b> <b>rooms.</b> The roof also projects over the platform in a similar way to that of the departure station. A short distance lower down the line is a convenient goods shed, 75 feet long by 42 feet span of roof. Near to the departure station is the train shed, 100 feet long, in which, in addition to the engines employed on the line, it is intended to contain first, second, and third class carriages, in order to meet any extra requirements that may at any time arise." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the building is divided into four rooms, roughly equal in size: <b>lamp</b> <b>room,</b> drying room, shower room and change room. All have concrete floors.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{in style}} {{to the other}} Imperial Towers {{lighthouse}}s on Chantry Island, at Point Clark and on Griffith Island, the Cove Island lighthouse has 5 sets of stairs with 15 steps each, one set with 11 steps and the final curved iron stairway to the <b>lamp</b> <b>room</b> has 9 steps (total: 95 steps). An iron door leads into the <b>lamp</b> <b>room.</b> The stone lightkeeper's cottage adjacent to the tower was built at the same time. The [...] "new" [...] lightkeepers house was built in 1970 {{a short distance from}} the tower.|$|E
