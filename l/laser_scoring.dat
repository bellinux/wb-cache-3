40|$|The Lam Assessment on Stages of Employment Readiness (LASER) was {{developed}} to assess welfare recipients' employment readiness. The LASER consists of 14 items corresponding to Prochaska's stages of change model (Prochaska, DiClemente and Norcross, 1992). A sample of 149 welfare recipients from a work training program participated in the study. The Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) supported the three factors structure corresponding to Prochaska's Pre-Contemplation, Contemplation, and Action stages. A cluster analysis classified the sample into three groups according to their <b>LASER</b> <b>scores.</b> A six months follow-up on employment outcomes showed that those who were in Pre-contemplation stage had the poorest employment outcome (25 %), those {{who were in the}} Action stage had the best outcome (56 %) and those in the Contemplation stage were in between (38 %).

40|$|AbstractDelamination is a {{major problem}} in contour milling of fiber {{reinforced}} plastics (FRP) causing scrap or rework. Today, delamination avoidance limits overall productivity and tool life. Damage of the top layer of a composite structure is initiated if fibers are not cut during first engagement of the cutting edge, but deflected. Generated cracks propagate due to recurrent contact of fibers with the rotating tool. In contrast, when laser cutting FRP, the heat input often leads to an extensive heat-affected zone (HAZ), particularly in case of large laminate thickness and high energy input. Combination of both processes is a promising approach to overcome the mentioned disadvantages. Experiments indicate that pre-scoring of the top layer is possible with negligible HAZ for FRP materials using proper laser parameters, especially low energy input per unit length. Positioning of the <b>laser</b> <b>scored</b> kerf along the contour to be manufactured by the subsequent milling tool prevents crack propagation along the fiber direction even with a heavily worn milling tool at increased feed rate. Furthermore, laser pre-scoring eliminates protruding fibers and allows for edge chamfering. The process understanding is enhanced using simulation of the laser pre-scoring, particularly considering heat conduction and forced convection, as well as by presenting a model for the mechanism of delamination prevention...|$|R
40|$|Lasers {{have arrived}} {{in a big way}} for the {{management}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The most common ones in use are holmium, potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and thulium. They remove the prostatic adenoma either by way of enucleation or ablation. Backed by numerous studies that prove their safety, efficacy and durability, <b>lasers</b> <b>score</b> over TURP in several ways. Their use is associated with less blood loss, shorter catheter time and decreased hospital stay. The fluid absorption during laser prostatectomy is negligible and thus makes it safer for use in cardiac patients. Also there is no chance of a transurethral resection syndrome, the incidence of which is approximately 2 % with TURP. Due to superior hemostatic capabilities and non interference lasers can be used in patients on anti coagulants, cardiac pacemaker. Another advantage of laser over TURP is its ability to deal with prostates that are larger in size especially holmium laser which has been used to enucleate glands more than 300 g in size thus completely avoiding the need for open prostatectomy. The amount of tissue removed with enucleation is more thus retreatment rates are less than that of TURP. The initial cost of laser is higher but its capability to treat stones, its use in high risk situations, less morbidity, short hospital stay, and durable results make it an attractive option to treat BPH even in the developing world...|$|R

The mean calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser T-score of postmenopausal subjects who were smokers with a positive history of fracture, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), covered dressing style, lower educational level, no regular exercise habits, and low tea consumption was significantly lower than that obtained for the other group (p< 0. 05). A significant correlation was observed between the calcaneal dual energy X-ray laser T-score and age (r=- 0. 465, p= 0. 001), body mass index (BMI) (r= 0. 223, p= 0. 001), number of live births (r=- 0. 229, p= 0. 001), breast feeding time (r=- 0. 064, p= 0. 001), and age at menarche (r=- 0. 050, p= 0. 008). The correlations between calcaneal DXL and DXA T-scores (r= 0. 340, p= 0. 001) and calcaneal DXL and DXA Z-scores (r= 0. 360, p= 0. 001) at the spine, and calcaneal DXL and DXA T- scores (r= 0. 28, p= 0. 001) and calcaneal DXL and DXA Z-scores (r= 0. 33, p= 0. 001) at the femoral neck were statistically significant.

40|$|Objective: This study {{assessed}} the reproducibility {{of a red}} diode laser device, and its capability to detect dental calculus in vitro on human tooth root surfaces. Material and methods: On each of 50 extracted teeth, a calculus-positive and calculus-free root surface was evaluated by two independent examiners with a low-power indium gallium arsenide phosphide diode laser (DIAGNOdent) fitted with a periodontal probe-like sapphire tip and emitting visible red light at 655  nm wavelength. Laser autofluorescence intensity readings of examined root surfaces were scored on a 0 – 99 scale, with duplicate assessments performed using the laser probe tip directed both perpendicular and parallel to evaluated tooth root surfaces. Pearson correlation coefficients of untransformed measurements, and kappa analysis of data dichotomized with a > 40 autofluorescence intensity threshold, were calculated to assess intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of the laser device. Mean autofluorescence intensity scores of calculus-positive and calculus-free root surfaces were evaluated with the Student’s t-test. Results: Excellent intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility was found for DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence intensity measurements, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 94 %, and kappa values ranging between 0. 96 and 1. 0, for duplicate readings taken with both laser probe tip orientations. Significantly higher autofluorescence intensity values were measured when the laser probe tip was directed perpendicular, rather than parallel, to tooth root surfaces. However, calculus-positive roots, particularly with calculus in markedly-raised ledges, yielded significantly greater mean DIAGNOdent <b>laser</b> autofluorescence intensity <b>scores</b> than calculus-free surfaces, regardless of probe tip orientation. DIAGNOdent autofluorescence intensity values > 40 exhibited a stronger association with calculus (36. 6 odds ratio) then measurements of ≥ 5 (20. 1 odds ratio) when the laser probe tip was advanced parallel to root surfaces. Conclusions: Excellent intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of autofluorescence intensity measurements was obtained with the DIAGNOdent laser fluorescence device on human tooth roots. Calculus-positive root surfaces exhibited significantly greater DIAGNOdent laser autofluorescence than calculus-free tooth roots, even with the laser probe tip directed parallel to root surfaces. These findings provide further in vitro validation of the potential utility of a DIAGNOdent laser fluorescence device for identifying dental calculus on human tooth root surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Background: Laser therapy, for its {{established}} analgesic properties {{with minimal}} side effects, {{has been used}} for the treatment of chronic pain. However, it has not been used for the treatment of acute postoperative pain. This pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility and efficacy of Class IV laser on postoperative pain relief following off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery, as a component of multimodal analgesia (MMA) technique. Methods: This open observational prospective study comprised of 100 adult patients (84 male, 16 female) who underwent OPCABG through sternotomy. For postoperative analgesia, they were subjected to laser therapy subjected to laser therapy in addition to the standard institutional pain management protocol comprising of IV infusion/bolus of tramadol and paracetamol and fentanyl bolus as rescue analgesic. Pain intensity was measured by Verbal Rating Scale (VRS). The laser therapy was scheduled as once a day regime for three consecutive postoperative days (PODs) starting on POD 1, 30 min following tracheal extubation. The subsequent laser applications were also scheduled at the same time of the day as on day 1 if VRS was ≥ 5. 10 W Class IV laser was applied over 150 cm 2 sternal wound area for 150 s. VRS was used to assess pain severity and was recorded for statistical analysis using Friedman Test. Results: The mean (standard deviation [SD]) VRS of all the 100 patients just before application of the first dose of laser was 7. 31 (0. 94) while on MMT; the same fell to 4. 0 (1. 279) and 3. 40 (2. 697) at 1 h and 24 h respectively following first dose of laser. The change of VRS over first 24 h among all the 100 patients was statistically significant (P = 0. 000). Laser was re-applied in 40 patients whose VRS was ≥ 5 (mean [SD] - 6. 38 [0. 868]) at 24 th h. After receiving the 2 nd dose of <b>laser</b> the VRS <b>scores</b> fell significantly (P = 0. 000) and became 0 at 54 th h. No patients required 3 rd dose of the laser. No patient required rescue analgesic while on laser therapy.
