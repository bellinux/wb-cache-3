2500|$|Another related use of {{the complex}} plane is with the Nyquist {{stability}} criterion.

50|$|In {{the area}} of robust control theory, Jakob Stoustrup has in {{particular}} contributed {{to the development of}} <b>loop</b> <b>transfer</b> recovery methods for the design of H∞ controllers and to the development of robust design methods for systems having parametric uncertainty descriptions. <b>Loop</b> <b>transfer</b> recovery methods have been among the most popular model based design methods used in industry for decades, due to their intuitive relationships between full state feedback designs and observer based designs. <b>Loop</b> <b>transfer</b> recovery methods were originally designed as an extension to the LQG design methodology, but Jakob Stoustrup and his co-workers advanced the recovery methods to {{the area of}} H∞ control, thereby admitting robustness aspects to be included directly in the design paradigm.|$|E

40|$|The Fission Surface Power (FSP) Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is a {{system-level}} {{demonstration of}} fission power technology {{intended for use}} on manned missions to Mars. The Baseline FSP systems consists of a 190 kWt UO 2 fast-spectrum reactor cooled by a primary pumped liquid metal loop. This liquid metal <b>loop</b> <b>transfers</b> heat to two intermediate liquid metal loops designed to isolate fission products in the primary loop from the balance of plant. The intermediate liquid metal <b>loops</b> <b>transfer</b> heat to four Stirling Power Conversion Units (PCU), each of which produce 12 kWe (48 kW total) and reject waste heat to two pumped water <b>loops,</b> which <b>transfer</b> the waste heat to titanium-water heat pipe radiators. The FSP TDU simulates a single leg of the baseline FSP system using an electrically heater core simulator, a single liquid metal loop, a single PCU, and a pumped water loop which rejects the waste heat to a Facility Cooling System (FCS). When operated at the nominal operating conditions (modified for low liquid metal flow) during TDU testing the PCU produced 8. 9 kW of power at an efficiency of 21. 7 % resulting in a net system power of 8. 1 kW and a system level efficiency of 17. 2 %. The reduction in PCU power from levels seen during electrically heated testing {{is the result of}} insufficient heat transfer from the NaK heater head to the Stirling acceptor, which could not be tested at Sunpower prior to delivery to GRC. The maximum PCU power of 10. 4 kW was achieved at the maximum liquid metal temperature of 875 K, minimum water temperature of 350 K, 1. 1 kg/s liquid metal flow, 0. 39 kg/s water flow, and 15. 0 mm amplitude at an efficiency of 23. 3 %.

40|$|An {{extended}} model-following control-synthesis method, including loop-transfer recovery, {{is presented}} {{and applied to}} synthesize control laws for integrated flight and propulsion control (IFPC). The vehicle considered is representative of an unstable modern fighter aircraft; with a two-dimensional thrust-vectoring and thrust-reversing nozzle. The linearized design model includes both airframe and engine dynamics. A model-following formulation of the LQR problem is extended to handle this hybrid problem. Compensators are then obtained to realize an output-feedback control law, by using a loop-transfer-recovery procedure. The airframe and engine responses are decoupled, and perfect airframe response following is obtained. The <b>loop</b> <b>transfers</b> also reveal good stability robustness and reasonable loop cross-over frequencies that would not lead to excessive actuation requirements...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} for stability analysis of high order Sigma-Delta modulators. The approach {{is based on}} a parallel decomposition of the modulator. In this representation, the general N-th order modulator is transformed into decomposition of low order modulators, which interact only through the quantizer function. In the simplest case of the <b>loop</b> filter <b>transfer</b> function with real distinct poles, the low order modulators are N first order ones. The decomposition considered helps to extract the sufficient conditions for stability of the N-th order modulator. They are determined by the stability conditions of each of the low order modulators but shifted with respect to the origin of the quantizer function, because of the influence of all other low order modulators.
