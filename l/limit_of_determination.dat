50|$|The MRL {{is usually}} {{determined}} by repeated (on {{the order of}} 10) field trials, where the crop has been treated according to good agricultural practice (GAP) and an appropriate pre harvest interval or withholding period has elapsed. For many pesticides this is set at the <b>Limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Determination</b> (LOD) - since only major pesticides have been evaluated and understanding of Acceptable daily intake (ADI) is incomplete (i.e. producers or public bodies have not submitted MRL data - often because these were not required in the past). LOD {{can be considered a}} measure of presence/absence, but certain residues may not be quantifiable at very low levels. For this reason the limit of quantification (LOQ) is often used instead of the LOD. As a rule of thumb the LOQ is approximately two times the LOD. For substances that are not included in any of the annexes in EU regulations, a default MRL of 0.01 mg/kg normally applies.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} whether single-dose intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and ranibizumab transfer into milk. METHODS: This study included lactating 12 sheep {{and a single}} 3 -month old suckling lamb of each sheep. Two groups consisting of 6 sheep and their lambs were constituted; the ranibizumab group and the bevacizumab group before the administration of intravitreal injections, blood and milk samples were obtained from all sheep and, following the injections, blood and milk samples of all sheep and blood samples of all lambs were collected at regular time points. Serum and milk concentrations of bevacizumab and ranibizumab were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> was 0. 9 ng/mL for bevacizumab and 0. 62 ng/mL for ranibizumab. RESULTS: At 6 h after intravitreal injections, bevacizumab concentration was above the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> {{in the blood of}} all sheep. At 3 wk, when the study was terminated, bevacizumab concentrations were high in 4 sheep.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development of}} an analytical method for the determination of phenol and methylphenols (cresols) in water, especially in leachates. This experimental research was necessary because a standardized method was not available for these compounds in water. A special concept was developed whereby the free phenols were extracted from the water using SPE-columns, followed by on-column derivatisation of the free phenols with acetylchoride in hexane (5 % v/v) using sodiumhydroxide powder and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen stofsulfaat as fase-transfer-catalist, and desorption of the phenylacetates with hexane. Analysis of the phenylacetates was preformed with GC-FID of GC-MS. Advantages are the fast and easy to automate method with an unique combination of on-column extraction and derivatisation, which avoids the need of a solvent phase switch. The method validation showed the following characteristics: no concentration dependence was found over a concentration range of 25 ug/l to 25 mg/l with a limited breakthroug, only 12 % for phenol at a level of 25 mg/l.

In 2002 / 2003 the range of PCB congeners and OCPs was from below the <b>limit</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> to 332 ng g(- 1) milk fat. PCDD/PCDF concentrations in human milk samples collected in 1981 - 2000 ranged between 5. 2 and 26. 7 pg I-TEQ g(- 1) milk fat and showed a decreasing trend...|$|E
40|$|This work {{shows the}} {{analytical}} possibilities of an electrothermal atomizer for the direct <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> trace metals in sea-water. The high background signals {{generated by the}} matrix perturb in particular volatile elements because of the low decomposition temperature allowed. In the case of cadmium, addition of ascorbic acid to the sample permits the modification of the atomization mechanism and {{the reduction of the}} optimum temperature. Under these conditions, absorption peak of the cadmium precedes the background absorption and consequently the analysis is no longer limited by the magnitude of the matrix signal: the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> cadmium concentrations far below the μg- 1 level is easily possible. Although the direct <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the other elements should be in principle less disturbed by the background, the analytical performance is poorer than for cadmium. <b>Limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the order from 0. 1 to 1 μg- 1 can be reached for chromium, copper and manganese. Lead and nickel appeared to be the most difficult elements; their direct determination is only possible in polluted coastal or estuarine waters. The injection of the sample as an aerosol into hot graphite tube showed to be well adapted to this kind of investigations. The simultaneous visualization of specific and background signals allows interpretations which until now were impossible with commercially available apparatus. © 1982.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on gas chromatographic {{analysis}} of target compounds found in illicit amphetamine synthesised by the Leuckart reaction, reductive amination of benzyl methyl ketone, and the nitrostyrene route. The analytical method was investigated and optimised with respect to introduction of amphetamine samples into the gas chromatograph and separation and detection of the target substances. Sample introduction using split and splitless injection was tested at different injector temperatures, {{and their ability to}} transfer the target compounds to the GC column was evaluated using cold on column injection as a reference. Taking the results from both techniques into consideration a temperature of 250 °C was considered to be the best compromise. The most efficient separation was achieved with a DB- 35 MS capillary column (35 % diphenyl 65 % dimethyl silicone; 30 m × 0. 25 mm, df 0. 25 μm) and an oven temperature program that started at 90 °C (1 min) and was increased by 8 °C/min to 300 °C (10 min). Reproducibility, repeatability, linearity, and <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> for the flame ionisation detector (FID), nitrogen phosphorous detector (NPD), and mass spectrometry (MS) in scan mode and selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode were evaluated. In addition, selectivity was studied applying FID and MS in both scan and SIM mode. It was found that reproducibility, repeatability, and <b>limits</b> <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> were similar for FID, NPD, and MS in scan mode. Moreover, the linearity was better when applying FID or NPD whereas the selectivity was better when utilising the MS. Finally, the introduction of target compounds to the GC column when applying injection volumes of 0. 2 μl, 1 μl, 2 μl, and 4 μl with splitless injection respectively 1 μl with split injection (split ratio, 1 : 40) were compared. It was demonstrated that splitless injections of 1 μl, 2 μl, and 4 μl could be employed in the developed method, while split injection and splitless injections of 0. 2 μl should be avoided...|$|R
