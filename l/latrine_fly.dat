25|$|Chrysomya megacephala, more {{commonly}} known as the oriental <b>latrine</b> <b>fly,</b> {{is a member of the}} family Calliphoridae (blowflies). It is a warm-weather fly with a greenish-blue metallic box-like body. The fly infests corpses soon after death, making it important to forensic science. This fly is implicated in some public health issues; it can cause accidental myiasis, and also infects fish and livestock.|$|E
25|$|Fannia scalaris, {{also known}} as the <b>latrine</b> <b>fly,</b> is a fly species in the Fanniidae family. This species is smaller and more slender than the house fly, Musca domestica, and is similar in {{appearance}} to the lesser house fly, Fannia canicularis. The life cycle of this species can be as long as one month. These flies are globally distributed in urban areas as they are drawn to unsanitary environments. F. scalaris is a major cause of myiasis, the infestation of a body cavity by fly maggots. The adults infest bodies that have decomposed, making the species an important part of forensic entomology. The larvae of this fly have adapted protuberances, or feathered appendages, that allow them to survive in such a moist environment. Entomologists continue to research the effects that F. scalaris may have medically, forensically, and on the environment around them.|$|E
25|$|The female can lay 100 to 150 {{eggs in a}} batch, usually {{directly}} on human or animal dung. The common name for this species, the <b>Latrine</b> <b>Fly,</b> comes from the environment it prefers, a very unsanitary, filthy environment, exemplified in the location that they lay their eggs. Their eggs {{can also be found}} in decaying vegetable matter, carrion, nests of birds or other insects, or human cadavers. The eggs are laid in such material because they prefer to feed on high nitrogenous material when they hatch. The eggs hatch in as little as 8 hours, but can take up to 48 hours. It takes 5 days for the larvae to pass through all 3 instars, while the pupal stage takes from 7 to 10 days. The life cycle can last from 15 to 30 days depending on the temperature, as the colder the temperature, the longer the lifecycle will last.|$|E

25|$|The {{ventilated}} improved {{pit latrine}} (VIP) is a pit latrine {{with a black}} pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit <b>latrines,</b> e.g. <b>fly</b> and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.|$|R
40|$|Muscoidea is a {{significant}} dipteran clade that includes house <b>flies</b> (Family Muscidae), <b>latrine</b> <b>flies</b> (F. Fannidae), dung flies (F. Scathophagidae) and root maggot flies (F. Anthomyiidae). It is comprised of approximately 7000 described species. The monophyly of the Muscoidea and the precise relationships of muscoids to the closest superfamily the Oestroidea (blow flies, flesh flies etc) are both unresolved. Until now mitochondrial (mt) genomes were available for {{only two of the}} four muscoid families precluding a thorough test of phylogenetic relationships using this data source. Here we present the first two mt genomes for the families Fanniidae (Euryomma sp.) (family Fanniidae) and Anthomyiidae (Delia platura (Meigen, 1826)). We also conducted phylogenetic analyses containing of these newly sequenced mt genomes plus 15 other species representative of dipteran diversity to address the internal relationship of Muscoidea and its systematic position. Both maximum-likelihood and Bayesian analyses suggested that Muscoidea was not a monophyletic group with the relationship: (Fanniidae + Muscidae) + ((Anthomyiidae + Scathophagidae) + (Calliphoridae + Sarcophagidae)), supported by the majority of analysed datasets. This also infers that Oestroidea was paraphyletic in the majority of analyses. Divergence time estimation suggested that the earliest split within the Calyptratae, separating (Tachinidae + Oestridae) from the remaining families, occurred in the Early Eocene. The main divergence within the paraphyletic muscoidea grade was between Fanniidae + Muscidae and the lineage ((Anthomyiidae + Scathophagidae) + (Calliphoridae + Sarcophagidae)) which occurred in the Late Eocen...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of human excreta in latrines {{is an important}} step in reducing the transmission of diarrhoeal diseases. However, in <b>latrines,</b> <b>flies</b> can access the latrine contents and serve as a mechanical transmitter of diarrhoeal pathogens. Furthermore, the latrine contents {{can be used as a}} breeding site for flies, which may further contribute to disease transmission. Latrines do not all produce flies, and there are some which produce only a few, while others can produce thousands. In order to understand the role of the latrine in determining this productivity, a pilot study was conducted, in which fifty latrines were observed in and around Ifakara, Tanzania. The characteristics of the latrine superstructure, use of the latrine, and chemical characteristics of pit latrine contents were compared to the numbers of flies collected in an exit trap placed over the drop hole in the latrine. Absence of a roof was found to have a significant positive association (t= 3. 17, p= 0. 003) with the total number of flies collected, and temporary superstructures, particularly as opposed to brick superstructures (z= 4. 26, p< 0. 001), and increased total solids in pit latrines (z= 2. 57, p= 0. 01) were significantly associated with increased numbers of blowflies leaving the latrine. The number of larvae per gram was significantly associated with the village from which samples were taken, with the largest difference between two villages outside Ifakara (z= 2. 12, p= 0. 03). The effect of latrine superstructure (roof, walls) on fly production may indicate that improvements in latrine construction could result in decreases in fl...|$|R

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} ecological activities of necrophagous Diptera on a highrise building in Malaysia was conducted from April to August 2010. Fresh chicken livers (approximately 500 g) serving as bait {{were placed on the}} rooftop (101. 6 m from the ground). Three replicates were carried out, each replicate lasting 30 days with daily observations and fly sampling. Maggots found in the bait were collected at random: some were preserved in 70 % ethanol while the others were reared to the adult stage. Results showed that the flies arrived on the bait between 8 hours and 3 days after placement. The oriental <b>latrine</b> blow <b>fly</b> Chrysomya megacephala (Diptera: Calliphoridae) was the first to reach this altitude, followed by the scuttle fly Megaselia scalaris (Diptera: Phoridae) and the flesh fly Liopygia ruficornis (Diptera: Sarcophagidae). The larvae of Chrysomya megacephala were first recovered from the bait. However, they were succeeded by sarcophagid larvae. The predominant sarcophagid larvae were then raised to the adult stage and the resulting adults were identified as Parasarcophaga dux. The other sarcophagid pupae were either parasitized by hymenopteran parasitoids or dead. We recorded two species of parasitoids emerging from Liopygia ruficornis pupae: Exoristobia philippinensis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) and Dirhinus himalayanus (Hymenoptera: Chalcididae).

40|$|The Oriental <b>latrine</b> <b>fly</b> (Chrysomya megacephala) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) is {{distributed}} worldwide and known for producing myiasis in humans {{and other animals}} and transmitting pathogens mechanically. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the development performance of this fly on various diets. Larvae of the Oriental <b>latrine</b> <b>fly</b> were reared on two kinds of artificial diets and one natural food. One of the artificial diets is called the milky artificial diets, and the ingredients include whole dried milk, yeast powder, and agar. The other artificial diet is called the fish meal diet, and composed of fish meal powder, yeast powder, and agar. The natural food: flesh pork liver. The results indicated that no significant difference was observed in weight of pupa between two artificial diets and flesh pork liver. Fly reared on artificial diets had better pupating rate and emergence rate than those reared on flesh pork liver. The milky artificial diet seems to be a suitable diet for use in laboratory experiment. 大頭金蠅 (Chrysomya megacephala) (Diptera, Callophoridae) 屬世界廣泛分布的衛生害蟲，造成人畜蠅蛆症，為細菌、病原菌之機械攜帶者，亦為傳染病之病媒，在人類居家環境上則屬於騷擾性害蟲。在法醫昆蟲方面，大頭金蠅為屍食性蠅種之ㄧ，故其在各溫度下的生長發育資料及型態特徵做為屍體死亡時間判定的鑑定工具。另外在南台灣利用大頭金蠅作為芒果授粉媒介，為農民帶來一定的經濟利益。故大頭金蠅之人工飼料開發與大量飼養流程之建立，可提供生長條件一致，數量穩定的大頭金蠅，對於日後進一步的學術研究與授粉媒介之應用等皆有很大的幫助。本實驗利用兩種人工飼料配方與天然食物來源，個別大量飼養大頭金蠅，試驗其各生長時期之表現。發現兩種人工飼料皆可提供大頭金蠅完成完整的生長發育階段，兩種人工飼料在生長表現上並無差異，且在幼蟲化蛹率及成蟲羽化率上比天然食物來源 (新鮮豬肝) 具較好之生長表現，顯示本實驗改良之人工飼料配方可利用於實驗室內之大量飼育。另外試驗不同幼蟲密度飼養，選擇五種幼蟲密度處理，即 25 克乾飼料分別接入 50 、 100 、 200 、 300 及 400 隻幼蟲，結果發現最佳的幼蟲飼養密度為 200 隻幼蟲/ 25 克乾飼料，此接入密度下幼蟲的生長表現良好，並可得到最佳的成蟲數量，即每克乾飼料可獲得 7. 44 之成蟲。總結上述，本試驗改良之飼料配方具有大量飼養之應用價值。中文摘要	 [...] - 1 英文摘要	 [...] 2 壹、	前言	 [...] 3 貳、	前人研究	 [...] 5 参、	材料與方法	 [...] 11 肆、	結果	 [...] 14 伍、	討論	 [...] 16 陸、	結論	 [...] 19 柒、	參考文獻	 [...] 20 捌、	圖表	 [...] 2...|$|E

40|$|Chrysomya megacephala, {{also known}} as the Oriental <b>latrine</b> <b>fly,</b> is {{indigenous}} to south-east Asia. During the 1970 's it successfully invaded Africa and South America, and more recently during the 1980 's also established itself in the United States of America. Although the first specimens from South Arica were collected from the south-western Cape Province in 1978, no published data appears to exist on its subsequent spread or status in southern Africa. During May 1991 a specimen of C. megacephala was incidentally captured near Beaufort West, Cape Province, South Africa, which prompted re-examination of blow-flies captured in the Kruger National Park during 1984. In this way it was found that C. megacephala was already well established in the south-eastern Transvaal by mid- 1984.

40|$|The overall aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the digestibility of maggots by modifying diet replacement method, checking if fermentation activity occurs in mid to last part of intestine in Nile tilapia, and to evaluate the maggots potential as source of protein and lipid by conducting a growth trial. An eight day digestibility and 56 day growth trial was conducted to evaluate the digestibility of Asian <b>latrine</b> <b>fly,</b> Cryosoma megacephala maggots and, the growth performance parameters of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus fed with maggots as the only source of protein and lipid. For digestibility trial, basal diet was replaced with one third and two third maggots. Feces were collected by dissecting the fish. Apparent digestibility coefficient for mid and distal parts of intestine were evaluated separately for energy, nitrogen and minerals, Ca, k, Mg, P and Zn. ADC of energy for two third maggot diet was significantly (P< 0. 05) high than one third replaced maggot diet and basal diet made of all plant protein sources. ADC of minerals showed high variations because of water borne mineral uptake by the fish. Cumulative feed intake (g), weight gain (g), final weight (g) and feed conversion ratio did not shown any significant differences for the fish fed with the maggot diet and the fish fed with the plant diet. High inclusion level of maggots in the maggot feed altered the growth performance negatively in the 2 nd month of growth trial. So it is suggested that inclusion of maggots in the diet should be done preferably with less inclusion level and after having complete knowledge of the adverse effects of them.  M-F...|$|E

As pit latrines {{are a major}} source of these flies, eliminating these important breeding sites is likely to reduce village fly populations, and may reduce the spread of diarrhoeal pathogens. methods We treated 24 latrines in a Gambian village: six each with (i) pyriproxyfen, an insect juvenile hormone mimic formulated as Sumilarv ® 0. 5 G, a 0. 5 % pyriproxyfen granule, (ii) expanded polystyrene beads (EPB), (iii) local soap or (iv) no treatment as controls. Flies were collected using exit traps placed over the drop holes, weekly for five weeks. In a separate study, we tested whether latrines also function as efficient flytraps using the faecal odours as attractants. We constructed six pit latrines each with a built-in flytrap and tested their catching efficiency compared to six fish-baited box traps positioned 10 m from the latrine. Focus group discussions conducted afterwards assessed the acceptability of the flytrap latrines. results Numbers of emerging C. putoria were reduced by 96. 0 % (95 % CIs: 94. 5 – 97. 2 %) 4 – 5 weeks after treatment with pyriproxyfen; by 64. 2 % (95 % CIs: 51. 8 – 73. 5 %) after treatment with local soap; by 41. 3 % (95 % CIs = 24. 0 – 54. 7 %) after treatment with EPB 3 – 5 weeks after treatment. Flytraps placed on latrines collected C. putoria and were deemed acceptable to local communities. conclusions Sumilarv 0. 5 G shows promise as a chemical control agent, whilst odour-baited latrine traps may prove a useful method of non-chemical fly control. Both methods warrant further development to reduce fly production from pit latrines.

We set out to develop a simple, low-cost odour-baited trap for collecting C. putoria in the field. A series of field experiments {{was carried out in}} The Gambia to assess the catching-efficiency of different trap designs. The basic trap was a transparent 3 L polypropylene box baited with 50 g of fish, with a white opaque lid with circular entrance holes. We tested variations of the number, diameter, position and shape of the entrance holes, the height of the trap above ground, degree of transparency of the box, its shape, volume, colour, and the attractiveness of gridded surfaces on or under the trap. Traps were rotated between positions on different sampling occasions using a Latin Square design. The optimal trapping features were incorporated into a final trap that was tested against commercially available traps. Features of the trap that increased the number of flies caught included: larger entrance holes (compared with smaller ones, p, 0. 001), using conical collars inside the holes (compared with without collars, p = 0. 01), entrance holes {{on the top of the}} trap (compared with the side or bottom, p, 0. 001), traps placed on the ground (compared with above ground, p, 0. 001), the box having transparent sides (compared with being opaque, p, 0. 001), and with no wire grids nearby (compared with those with grids, p = 0. 03).
