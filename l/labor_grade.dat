40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{objective}} {{of our work}} {{was to determine the}} effects of co-interventions used during labor with oxytocin or for labor dystocia. Methods: We searched for reports of the interventions we sought to study published between 1987 and 2015, looking especially for meta-analyses and randomized trials via the Medline database and the Cochrane Library. We limited our research to studies of spontaneous labor in singleton pregnancies at term. Results: In the absence of labor dystocia, active management of labor is not recommended (Grade B). It is recommended that amniotomy should not be performed routinely during the first stage of <b>labor</b> (<b>Grade</b> B). In cases of labor dystocia during the active phase, an amniotomy is recommended before the administration of oxytocin (professional consensus). The encouragement of continuous support during labor is recommended (Grade B). No scientific evidence justifies the recommendation of any of the following methods for the sole purpose of limiting oxytocin use during labor: maternal position during the first or second stages of <b>labor</b> (<b>grade</b> C), immersion in a water during the first stage (grade B), intravenous infusion, oral hydration, or solid food (grade B), antenatal preparation with hypnosis sessions (grade C), use of relaxation techniques (grade C), acupuncture or acupressure (Grade B), or the use of muscle-relaxant agents (professional consensus). Conclusions: Few of the co-interventions studied appear to modulate recourse to oxytocin...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the preferred {{grade point average}} (GPA) that employers are looking for when hiring a college graduate. A survey was emailed to employers who recruit students from the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources at Oklahoma State University. Previous research shows that employers primarily seek soft skills in college graduates, which are difficult to assess. Studies also show that GPA scores, which are easy to assess, are correlated with soft skills, which helps employers make an estimated guess as to whom the company would desire. The survey asks employers to undergo a simulated hiring decision where they must choose between different candidates with different GPA scores and salaries. Their simulated hiring decisions provide unique insights into employers’ preferences for grades among college graduates. Surprisingly, the results show a possible, but mild preference for 3. 0 over 2. 5 GPA scores, and that employers prefer a 2. 5 GPA over a 3. 5 GPA and higher.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} a decade since the year 2007 was {{dedicated}} towards painless motherhood. However the use and acceptance of labor analgesia is still very rare in developing countries. Objective: The present study was aimed to assess the knowledge, acceptance and reasons for rejection of labor analgesia among the expectant mothers. Methods: The present observational study was conducted after approval from the institute. All antenatal women who attended antenatal clinic were approached during January to March 2017. Data was collected from the consented women using a pretested questionnaire. Data were expressed in absolute numbers and percentage scale. Measures of central tendencies were calculated for quantitative data using INSTAT software and p < 0. 05 was considered significant for comparison. Results: Response from 280 women with mean ± SD age and gestational age of 25. 49 ± 4. 89 years and 28. 25 ± 8. 75 weeks respectively were analyzed. 126 were primi or multiparous; 56 <b>graded</b> <b>labor</b> pain as unbearable yet only 30 (23. 81 %) wanted labor analgesia. Only 20 (7. 14 %) prospective mothers were having knowledge of labor analgesia. The nulliparous wanted significantly less labor analgesia compared to primi and multiparous (p 0. 003). Desire to bear natural birth was the commonest reason to refuse painless labor. One quarter of the participants believed that labor analgesia was bad for child and against the will of God. Conclusion: Knowledge and acceptance of labor analgesia is poor although women who had previous experience were significantly more inclined towards it. Misinformation and myths is also a major contributor for non acceptance of labor analgesia...|$|R

This investigation is primarily concerned with the stabilization of sands for military purposes. Actual tests were made with amphibious operations in mind, and, for this reason, beach sands were used in the experimentation. during wartime landing operations, many rubber-tired vehicles must be run ashore from amphibious craft. Sand, in itself, will not support these vehicles unless it happens to contain a certain critical amount of moisture. This condition will normally prevail on little, if any, of the shore area. In order that the vehicles be able to move at all under their own power, the sand must be made to afford some support in addition to that supplied in its natural state. The following investigation presents one method of accomplishing this aim. Inasmuch as this type of work will normally be applied only to wartime use, certain factors are taken into account. First it is recognized that this process may frequently be carried out under combat conditions and under enemy fire. For this reason, considerable attention has been given to devising methods and designing equipment for simplicity and speed. Second, the roads provided will probably be needed only for a comparatively short period of time. Therefore, the permanence of the finished product need not be a prime consideration. Third, it is realized that this process is a wartime expedient and will not have extensive application to peacetime use. In its present form, it will not be economically feasible for commercial application because of the prohibitive cost of material and <b>labor.</b> [URL] Junior <b>Grade,</b> United States Navy.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that {{using the same}} grading standard for agricultural products from the places of shipment to the consumers is hard to be realized. The grading standard which adopted by producers is not understood by consumers. General consumers have usually doubted and distrusted the present grading method. On the other hand, producers spent considerable time and <b>labor</b> on <b>grading</b> and sorting method of the mandarin oranges. Viewing the importance of grading standard for agricultural products, this study intended to reassess the grading method that currently used in the marketing process by basing on the data analysis. It is expected that {{the result of this}} study will lead to the clarification of the grading standard used by the people concerned and simplify it. The empirical study was carried out by using the data of tracing survey of the mandarin orange in which the technique of quantification theory to be tried. The following approaches were considered for grading system: (1) Deviation of the assessment values of grading standard (classified by quality and size) among different wholesale markets, (2) The transitional change of grading assessment at the different points of the marketing channel, (3) Method of simplification of the grading system. 1. The assessment values of 2 ̆ 2 grade 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by quality) and 2 ̆ 2 class 2 ̆ 2 (categorized by size) were often different at different markets even for the same product. The price quoted by Fukuoka market was higher for the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality than other markets. The price difference arisen from market assessment was likely to be wider for the grade than the class. 2. How to retain the grading standard which was classified by producer was considered. The grading, though to be done by producers, was performed {{in such a way that}} suited the interests and convenience of middlemen, and it was altered at the retail level so that the early grading was not carried to the consumers. As a result the high quality of orange from the famous producing area and the ordinary quality from the other areas became indiscriminately at the retailer 2 ̆ 7 s shop. It was a common practice that only the name of famous producing area was retained but that of other areas were dropped out. This fact brought about the feeling of distrust from consumers against pricing. Then, there was no difference for the rate of market margin of orange of different quality for the middlemen, there was no difference in profit rate for high quality orange among different retailers but for the low quality one it had a great variation in profit rate. 3. The method of simplification of the grading sys t e m was considered. As mentioned above that grading was done to suit the interests and convenience of middlemen. Therefore, the analysis should be focused on market performance of these middlemen to simplify the grading. It should have two grades that were the 2 ̆ 2 excellent 2 ̆ 2 quality grade and the other, and had 3 sizes, namely, large (those of size 2 L and above), middle (size L, M), and small (size S and below) for assessing the present grading of the middlemen. 現在施行されている青果物の規格について検討した. 農産物は一貫した規格基準で出荷段階から最終消費段階まで流通するのが困難である,それ故,一般消費者は流通業者の経済活動に対し不信の念をいだく. 一方,生産者段階では規格区分のために多くの投下労働を必要とする. 以上のように規格を中心とする問題は多面的であり,かつ重要である. 本稿は以下の目的に沿って分析したものである. 第 1 の目的は,規格に関する実態を明確にすることである. 第 2 の目的は規格簡素化の方向性を示すことである. 温州みかんの追跡調査により得たデータを基礎にして,実態分析および計量分析(数量化理論による分析) を行う. 分析のプロセスは以下の通りである.

40|$|AbstractImproved {{equipment}} and husbandry practices {{are required to}} effectively grade and harvest fish in large land-based culture tanks. The objective of our work was to develop and evaluate several types of relatively inexpensive, portable, and efficient fish handling equipment to reduce the <b>labor</b> requirement for <b>grading</b> and harvesting fish from large circular culture tanks. This {{equipment and}} husbandry practices also had to provide for worker safety and minimize the stress or damage to the fish. Two techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the entire population from a large and deep circular tank, i. e. (a) purse seine and (b) carbon dioxide avoidance response. Two other techniques were developed and evaluated to remove the fish from a large (150 m 3) and deep (2. 44 m) circular culture tank after they had been top-graded in situ using a 3 -panel clam-shell grader: (c) an airlift fish pump and hand sorting/dewatering box and (d) a sidewall drain box for hand sorting/dewatering. Some of these technologies are new, while others (such as the purse seine) {{have been used in}} other applications. Our commercial-scale evaluation of these technologies provided insight into {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each option. With use of the clam-shell grader, the majority of the fish in the culture tank were never lifted from the water during the self-sorting process, which minimized stress, perhaps enhancing final product quality. In contrast, harvesting the tank using the purse seine and hand brailing was much more labor intensive and increased the stress on the fish, as indicated by a nearly 10 -fold increase in fish mortality compared to the mortality observed when the clam-shell type crowder/grader system and an airlift fish pump or sidewall drain box were used during fish harvest. The combination of the clam-shell crowder/grader with the sidewall drain harvest box was our preferred harvest method, because of its low labor requirement, relatively low fish mortality, and rapid harvest rate. We also think that the carbon dioxide avoidance harvest technique can be used effectively, with little labor input and practically zero mortality when the entire fish population must be removed from a fish culture tank, but not during a selective harvest using in situ grading. Ultimately, the more effective technologies and practices should help fish farmers overcome scale-up issues and improve land-based fish farm profitability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{primary cause}} of uterine scars is a {{previous}} cesarean. In women with a previous cesarean, the risks of maternal complications are rare and similar after a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) and after an elective repeat cesarean delivery (ERCD), but the risk of uterine rupture is higher with TOLAC (level of evidence [LE] 2). Maternal morbidity in women with previous cesareans is higher when TOLAC fails than when it leads to successful vaginal delivery (LE 2). Although maternal morbidity increases progressively {{with the number of}} ERCD, maternal morbidity of TOLAC decreases with the number of successful previous TOLAC (LE 2). The risk-benefit ratio considering the risks of short- and long-term maternal complications is favorable to TOLAC in most cases (LE 3). Globally, neonatal complications are rare regardless of the mode of delivery for women with previous cesareans. The risks of fetal, perinatal, and neonatal mortality during TOLAC are low. Nonetheless, these risks are significantly higher than those associated with ERCD (LE 2). The risks of mask ventilation, intubation for meconium-stained amniotic fluid, and neonatal sepsis all increase in TOLAC (LE 2). The risk of transient respiratory distress increases in ERCD (LE 2). To reduce this risk, and except in particular situations, ERCD must not be performed before 39 weeks (grade B). TOLAC is possible for women with a previous cesarean before 37 weeks, with 2 previous cesareans, with a uterine malformation, a low vertical incision or an unknown incision, with a myomectomy, postpartum fever, an interval of less than 6 months between the last cesarean delivery and the conception of the following pregnancy, if the obstetric conditions are favorable (professional consensus). ERCD is recommended in women with a scar in the uterine body (grade B) and a history of 3 or more cesareans (professional consensus). Ultrasound assessment of the risk of uterine rupture in women with uterine scars has not been shown to have any clinical utility and is therefore not recommended during pregnancy to help decide the mode of delivery (professional consensus). Use of X-ray pelvimetry to decide about TOLAC is associated with an increase in the repeat cesarean rate without any reduction in the rate of uterine rupture (LE 2). It is unnecessary for deciding mode of delivery and for managing <b>labor</b> during TOLAC (<b>grade</b> C). TOLAC should be encouraged for women with a previous vaginal delivery either before or after the cesarean, a favorable Bishop score or spontaneous labor, and for preterm births (grade C). For women with a fetus with an estimated weight of more than 4500 g, especially {{in the absence of a}} previous vaginal delivery and those with supermorbid obesity (BMI> 50), ERCD must be planned from the outset (grade C). For all of the other clinical situations envisioned (maternal age> 35 years, diabetes, morbid obesity, prolonged pregnancy, breech presentation and twin pregnancy), TOLAC is possible but the available data do not allow specific guidelines about the choice of mode of delivery, in view of the low levels of proof (grade C). The decision about planned mode of delivery must be shared by the patient and her physician and made by the 8 th month, taking into account the individual risk factors for TOLAC failure and uterine rupture (professional consensus). TOLAC is the preferred choice for women who do not have several risk factors (professional consensus). The availability onsite of an obstetrician and anesthetist must be pointed out to the patient. If the woman continues to prefer a repeat cesarean after adequate information and time to think about it, her preference should be honored (professional consensus). Labor should be induced in woman with a previous cesarean only for medical indications (professional consensus). Induction of labor increases the risk of uterine rupture, which can be estimated at 1 % if oxytocin is used and 2 % with vaginal prostaglandins (LE 2). Mechanical methods of induction have not been studied sufficiently. Misoprostol appears to increase the risk of uterine rupture strongly (LE 4). Based on the information now available, its use is not recommended (professional consensus). Routine use of internal tocodynamometry does not prevent uterine rupture (professional consensus). The increased risk of uterine rupture associated with oxytocin use is dose-dependent (LE 3). In the active phase, it is recommended that the total duration of failure to progress should not exceed 3 h; at that point, a cesarean should be performed (professional consensus). Epidural analgesia must be encouraged. The simple existence of a uterine scar is not an indication for a routine manual uterine examination after VBAC (grade C) ...|$|R
