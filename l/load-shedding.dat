50|$|<b>Load-shedding</b> (interruption {{of power}} supply due to {{shortage}} of electricity) was common in Kolkata during the 1970s and 1980s. Recently the Calcutta power grid has seen progressively better performance and fewer outages.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{a chronic}} {{shortage}} of electricity, power-cuts are common throughout India, adversely affecting the country's potential for economic growth. Even in the country's capital of New Delhi, rolling blackouts are common, {{especially during the}} hot summer season when demand far outstrips supply capacity.

50|$|Large-scale <b>load-shedding</b> {{events and}} {{nationwide}} blackouts have sparked controversy in 2014 and 2015 after government ministers gave conflicting {{reasons for the}} blackouts. While Public Enterprise Minister Malusi Gigaba gave vague reasons which included low water levels at dams, Minister Edna Molewa claimed that wet coal at mines in Mpumalanga were to blame. There has also been public concern over the government’s failure to address investment in energy production which has caused energy companies to struggle to meet demand. Scheduled maintenance on power stations have exacerbated problems with a vulnerable and constrained power grid.|$|E
5000|$|While {{describing}} key {{challenges faced}} by power sector, State Bank of Pakistan notes: [...] "… Leakages in terms of theft and inefficiencies at the generation and transmission stage must be seriously addressed. In this regard, {{the example of a}} privatized KE is insightful: this utility has shed surplus staff (despite stiff union opposition); has cut power supply of unpaid bills (even for high-profile government agencies); has invested in more efficient generation units; and has formulated a commercially driven <b>load-shedding</b> schedule. As a result, the situation is quite different in Karachi compared {{to the rest of the}} country.|$|E
50|$|Government {{officials}} {{in support of}} the scheme said that it was easier to save power than to generate more, but ultimately the scheme proved a failure. The change was criticised as early as days after the adoption of the scheme. People had not become accustomed to the change and businesses and shop owners had not followed the government's directives properly. Citizens also complained that the <b>load-shedding</b> situation hadn't improved. Power savings were nulled by increased consumption in the days following the change because of hot weather, as well as any residual savings being consumed by people who previously had less access to electricity. The country went back to its original (UTC+06:00) time offset on the midnight of 31 December 2009, months later than the scheduled end and through the winter. Students and teachers were the first to be adversely affected as many had to leave for their institutions before sunrise. In December, the problem became worse, and the cabinet lifted the scheme.|$|E
5000|$|A {{boarding}} {{facility was}} envisaged from the start, {{but it has}} suffered the vicissitudes of a strained economy and changing perceptions of the need. It opened with [...] "30 pupils, of which the majority were from the capital Harare". But it had been conceived as offering temporary shelter to local pupils {{during the rainy season}} only, when the rivers flooded. It grew to accommodate 160 pupils, both local and from a distance, developing into a formal boarding school. The Jesuit ethos of preferential option for the poor and faith that does justice has been instrumental behind the development, which saw Rupert High transformed from a backward rural school into a typical, developing Mission school. The impact of this transformation is evident within the local community and local pupils whose value system in regard to education has greatly improved. A growing number of day scholars are joining the rest of the boarding students in evening studies. These evening studies also make use of solar energy during <b>load-shedding,</b> and they have significantly developed the study culture at the school.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} a Master’s Thesis {{performed}} by Andreas Adolfsson and David Jacobsson at Chalmers University of Technology. The {{purpose of this}} master’s thesis is to evaluate a new method for <b>load-shedding,</b> the voltage controlled underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> developed by ABB. This report {{presents a comparison between}} conventional underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> and this new method for <b>load-shedding.</b> This master’s thesis also aims to present a detailed description of how the frequency regulation is performed in the Nordic power system. The simulations are performed using the analysis program Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E). The Nordic 32 power system is used for the simulations, this is a system with 32 buses based on the Nordic power system and developed by CIGRÉ. A PSS/E user model for the voltage controlled underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> has been developed in this master’s thesis which is used for the simulations on this new method of <b>load-shedding.</b> A study of the voltage controlled underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> shows that this method has important advantages compared to the conventional <b>load-shedding</b> when used in a power system with evenly distributed production and load. This method is not suitable for power systems where load and production is not evenly distributed, {{in a case like this}} the conventional <b>load-shedding</b> performs better. The results show that the use of voltage controlled underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> achieves less constraint on transmission lines in the power system after a production loss. The voltage in vicinity of the production loss is improved when the voltage controlled underfrequency <b>load-shedding</b> is used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a <b>load-shedding</b> scheme using the Talmud rule in islanded microgrid operation {{based on a}} multiagent system. Load shedding is an intentional load reduction to meet a power balance between supply and demand when supply shortages occur. The Talmud rule originating from the Talmud literature {{has been used in}} bankruptcy problems of finance, economics, and commu-nications. This paper approaches the <b>load-shedding</b> problem as a bankruptcy problem. A <b>load-shedding</b> scheme is mathematically expressed based on the Talmud rule. For experiment of this approach, a mul-tiagent system is constructed to operate test islanded microgrids autonomously. The suggested <b>load-shedding</b> scheme is tested on the test islanded microgrids based on the multiagent system. Results of the tests are discussed...|$|E
30|$|Real {{power load}} {{shedding}} {{has been used}} in most conventional reliability techniques to maintain real power balance caused by the real power shortage for a system contingency. The proportional <b>load-shedding</b> scheme is usually used to cut the load at each bus based on its percentage of the total system load. The priority load shedding and reliability cost/worth-based <b>load-shedding</b> [22] techniques are used to curtail the real power load based on customer’s willingness to pay for their reliability. Those <b>load-shedding</b> techniques and the resulting indices are usually used in generation planning.|$|E
40|$|A {{microgrid}} {{is composed}} of distributed power generation systems (DGs), distributed energy storage devices (DSs), and loads. To maintain a specific frequency in the islanded mode as an important requirement,  the control of DGs’ output and charge action of DSs are used in supply surplus conditions and <b>load-shedding</b> and discharge action of DSs are used in supply shortage conditions. Recently, multiagent systems for autonomous microgrid operation have been studied. Especially, <b>load-shedding,</b> which is intentional reduction of electricity use, is a critical problem in islanded microgrid operation based on the multiagent system. Therefore, effective schemes for <b>load-shedding</b> are required. Meanwhile, the bankruptcy problem deals with dividing short resources among multiple agents. In order to solve the bankruptcy problem, division rules, such as the constrained equal awards rule (CEA), the constrained equal losses rule (CEL), and the random arrival rule (RA), have been used. In this paper, we approach <b>load-shedding</b> as a bankruptcy problem. We compare <b>load-shedding</b> results by above-mentioned rules in islanded microgrid operation based on wireless sensor network (WSN) as the communication link for an agent’s interactions...|$|E

40|$|Crack opening loads were {{determined}} in <b>load-shedding</b> fatigue crack growth threshold tests on 2024 -T 3 aluminum alloy at stress ratios R of - 2, - 1, 0, 0. 33, 0. 5, and 0. 7. The effects of <b>load-shedding</b> procedure and rate were investigated. Values of threshold Delta-K {{were found to}} vary significantly with R, whereas values of threshold effective Delta-K did not. That is, the variation of threshold Delta-K with R was almost completely explained by accounting for the measured variation in crack opening load behavior with R. The <b>load-shedding</b> guidelines of ASTM Test Method for Measurement of Fatigue Crack Growth (E 647) produced a threshold Delta-K value for R = 0. 7 that was {{in agreement with the}} value determined using a procedure that should minimize closure effects. At both R = 0 and R = 0. 7, high <b>load-shedding</b> rates produced high values of threshold Delta-K caused by large closure effects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvidence {{shows that}} {{a small number of}} line {{contingencies}} in power systems may cause a large-scale blackout due to the effects of cascading failures. With the development of new technologies and the growing number of heterogeneous participants, a modern/smart grid should be able to self-heal its internal disturbances by continually performing self-assessment to deter, detect, respond to and restore from unpredictable contingencies. Along this line, this research focuses on {{the problem of how to}} prevent the occurrence of cascading failures through load shedding by considering heterogeneous shedding costs of grid participants. A fair <b>load-shedding</b> algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in a decentralized manner, where a <b>load-shedding</b> participant need only monitor its own operational status and interact with its neighboring participants. Using an embedded feedback mechanism, the fair <b>load-shedding</b> algorithm can determine a marginal compensation price for each <b>load-shedding</b> participant in real time based on the proportional fairness criterion, without knowing the shedding costs of the participants. Such fairly determined compensations can help motivate loaders/generators to actively participate in the load shedding in the face of internal disturbances. Finally, the properties of the <b>load-shedding</b> algorithm are evaluated by carrying out an experimental study on the standard IEEE 30 bus system. The study will offer new insights into emergency planning and design improvement of self-healing smart grids...|$|E
30|$|Quality of Service (QoS) is {{used for}} <b>load-shedding</b> in [33] while noting that {{conflicting}} objectives are common, and is also presented {{in the context of}} operator scheduling in [34]. The work in [35] presents <b>load-shedding</b> for spatio-temporal data streams, but does not specifically address quality control measures. Other relevant work regarding <b>load-shedding</b> for data streams can be found in [36 – 41]. Of these [38], from Nehme, et al. appears most relevant due to its spatio-temporal setting, presenting a clustering approach to <b>load-shedding</b> in which moving objects that are similar in terms of location, time, direction and speed are clustered, and data from individual members of the cluster can be dropped with the representatives of the cluster summarizing them. Our applications do not directly involve moving objects. The added complexity necessary for clustering does not benefit us as a data consumer since {{we do not have the}} opportunity select individual data elements for download. Our choices are all-or-nothing relative to providers and their feeds at given publication times.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} {{of renewable energy}} resources, such as solar and wind power, into the electric grid presents challengs {{partly due to the}} intermittency in the power output.

We consider, as a case study, the {{integration of}} renewable resources into the electric power generation portfolio of an island off the coast of Southern California, Santa Catalina Island, and investigate the feasibility of replacing diesel generation entirely with solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind turbines, supplemented with energy storage. We use a simple storage model alongside a combination of renewables and varying <b>load-shedding</b> characterizations to determine the appropriate area of PV cells, number of wind turbines, and energy storage capacity needed to stay below a certain threshold probability for <b>load-shedding</b> over a pre-specified period of time and long-term expected fraction of time at <b>load-shedding...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} approximate join processing over data streams when memory limitations cause incoming tuples {{to overflow}} the available space, precluding exact processing. Selective eviction of tuples (loadshedding) is needed, but is challenging since data distributions and arrival rates are unknown a priori. Also, in many real-world {{applications such as}} {{for the stock market}} and sensor-data, different items may have different importance levels. Current methods pay little attention to <b>load-shedding</b> when tuples bear such importance semantics, and perform poorly due to premature tuple drops and unproductive tuple retention. We propose a novel framework, called iJoin, which overcomes these drawbacks, and also provides tuples a fair chance in being part of the join result. Our <b>load-shedding</b> scheme for iJoin maximizes the total importance of join results, and allows reconfiguration of tuple-importance. We also show how to trade off <b>load-shedding</b> overhead and approximation-error. Our experiments show that iJoin has the best performance, and is practical. ...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} paper, we {{postulate}} {{that the same}} principle can be applied more generally to generate potentially optimal solutions to (1). We define partial security configurations as solutions that are guaranteed to prevent load shedding for one or more scenarios q = (c,o). A partial security configuration for the set Q={q_ 1,q_ 2,...,q_k} {{is defined as a}} solution that has no post-contingency constraint violations and thereby necessarily prevents <b>load-shedding</b> for all scenarios in Q. This is enforced by a set of constraints h_Q(D,S, C, O)< 0, g_Q(D,S, C, O) = 0. Simultaneously we remove the <b>load-shedding</b> risk X from the objective function.|$|E
40|$|Power {{deficiency}} {{management is}} an important factor in the operation of remote microgrids (MG). <b>Load-shedding</b> is traditionally considered as the main mechanism to manage the network under power deficiency conditions. To minimize <b>load-shedding,</b> islanded neighboring MGs can be connected to each other in remote areas to provide a self-healing capability. For this, extra generation capacity needs to be available in the distributed energy resources (DER) of one of the MGs to supply the extra demand in the other MG. In this way, the total load in the system of interconnected MGs will be shared by all the DERs within those MGs. This paper presents a strategy which aims to interconnect two neighboring microgrids in remote areas to minimize the necessity of <b>load-shedding.</b> This strategy also needs to decide when two interconnected MGs should be isolated. This paper focuses on the self-healing strategy, its criteria and features. The presented algorithm in this paper does not need any data communication system for its operation. The performance of the developed technique is validated by PSCAD/EMTDC simulations...|$|E
30|$|This article investigates both {{real and}} {{reactive}} power shortages {{and the associated}} voltage violations due to system failures on reliability evaluation. The load point indices related to real and reactive power shortages are defined. The real power shortage and the network violations of a contingency are released using a three-stage <b>load-shedding</b> process instead of the two-stage process in [19]. The proposed <b>load-shedding</b> technique during post contingencies is implemented to illustrate {{the importance of the}} reactive power on system reliability and to find the most economical way to release network violation. The contributions of real and reactive power to the load point and system reliability are clearly decoupled using the proposed technique.|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} {{penetration of}} volatile and intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} challenges existing power-distribution methods as current dispatch methods were not designed to consider high levels of volatility. We suggest a principled algorithm called message passing, which complements existing techniques. It is based on statistical physics methodology and passes probabilistic messages locally to find the approximate global optimal solution for a given objective function. The computational complexity of the algorithm increases linearly with the system size, allowing one to solve large-scale problems. We show how message passing considers fluctuations effectively and prioritise consumers {{in the event of}} insufficient resource. We demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm in managing <b>load-shedding</b> and power-distribution on synthetic benchmark IEEE data and discuss the role of weights in the trade-off between minimising <b>load-shedding</b> and transmission costs...|$|E
