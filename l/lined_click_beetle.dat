40|$|The {{study of}} pheromones of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> was {{started with the}} {{objective}} of applying similar methods in IPM strategies for the control of wireworms, based on the similar experience gained from the widely used moth pheromones. A brief overview is presented on the identification of <b>click</b> <b>beetle</b> pheromones, new questions arising in the categorization of these pheromones into sex or aggregation pheromones, options for the development of female-targeted lures, and application perspectives. The implementation of IPM strategies against wireworms, the larvae of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> (Coleoptera, Elateridae), has been very difficult because of the time- and energyconsuming detection and development of monitoring methods. It was reasonable to believe that—similar to Lepidoptera—if pheromones of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> became known, they could assist in the development of simple and easy-to-use tools and methods for this purpose. The present article reviews the results of research on pheromones and other attractants of <b>click</b> <b>beetles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wireworms, {{the larvae}} of Agriotes spp., are an {{increasing}} problem on many organically managed farms with potato or vegetable production. The {{damage caused by}} wireworms is economically significant. With the use of pheromone traps {{it is possible to}} get more information about the habitat requirements of <b>click</b> <b>beetles.</b> In 2005 and 2006 <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> were monitored at different locations in northern Germany. Because of the warmer springtime in 2005, the first peak of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> was about two weeks earlier than in 2006. The second peak was found one month later. The presented data show the highest occurrence of <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in ryegrass-clover mixtures in both years. The catches in cereals were much lower than in ryegrass-clover. The reasons for the differences of the trapped <b>click</b> <b>beetles</b> in the different cereal fields cannot been explained so far. In the majority of cases the trapped number of Agriotes lineatus was higher than for A. obscurus...|$|R
