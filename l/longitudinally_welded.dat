5000|$|In modern {{expansion}} joints, {{the metal}} bellows are often produced with a so-called multi-ply design. To increase both flexibility and stability, multiple thin plies of metal are layered {{to form the}} bellows walls. There are two basic design types: The multi-ply and the multi-walled bellows structure. The multi-ply structure consists of a pressure-tight, <b>longitudinally</b> <b>welded</b> outer and inner cylinder of stainless steel. In between these cylinders is an open, spiral cylinder which forms multiple plies depending on the design. The multi-walled structure consists of several concentric, <b>longitudinally</b> <b>welded</b> cylinders. Each cylinder forms a pressure-tight and closed [...] "wall".|$|E

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is a welding {{technology}} used to join materials considered {{difficult to be}} welded. Mechanical properties of FSW joints are generally evaluated by means of tensile tests that might provide insufficient information because maximum strain obtained before necking is small and that cannot be used when the joint path is not linear or when the welds are executed on curved surfaces. The present work investigates the mechanical properties of FSW tubes by means of tube bulge tests.

In order to guarantee the safe operation of line pipes, therefore, it is significant to investigate the electrochemical corrosion behaviors of pipe steel in a simulated soil environment.

40|$|Abstract. The main aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the residual stress field in friction stir welded joints of 2024 -T 3 aluminium alloy using the crack (or cut) compliance method. It is based on the fact that when a cut, simulating a growing crack, is incrementally introduced into a part, residual stresses are relieved on the slot surfaces created, causing the part to deform. Such deformation can be measured by strain gauges attached to specific regions of the part and the residual stress profile that originally existed can be evaluated. Cuts were introduced by wire electro discharge machining (WEDM), in finishing mode, either perpendicularly or <b>longitudinally</b> to the <b>weld</b> nugget, in a 3. 2 x 60 x 120 mm 3 rectangular testpieces. For the longitudinal cut testpieces, the slot was introduced in two different positions: on the centre of the weld nugget and 5 mm distant from the weld centre line, representing the thermomechanically/heat affected zone. The residual stress intensity factor, Kr, was calculated using a fracture mechanics approach and the inverse weight function method was employed to obtain the initial residual stress profile. Additionally, the residual stress redistribution profiles ahead of the slot were determined for several slot lengths, simulating the growth of a crack into the residua...|$|R

40|$|Welded joints are an {{essential}} part of pressure vessels such as the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) Turbopumps. Defects produced in the welding process can be detrimental to weld performance. Recently, review of the SSME high pressure fuel turbopump (HPFTP) titanium inlet x rays revealed several weld discrepancies such as penetrameter density issues, film processing discrepancies, weld width discrepancies, porosity, lack of fusion, and weld offsets. Currently, the sensitivity of welded structures to defects is of concern. From a fatigue standpoint, weld offset may have a serious effect since local yielding, in general, aggravates cyclic stress effects. Therefore, the weld offset issue is considered. Using the finite element method and mathematical formulations, parametric studies were conducted to determine the influence of weld offsets and a variation of weld widths in <b>longitudinally</b> <b>welded</b> cylindrical structures with equal wall thickness {{on both sides of the}} joint.

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, {{the authors}} employ tailor welded {{aluminum}} alloy pipes for lateral extrusion process with a lost core {{to perform a}} hollow light-weight-part. Design/methodology/approach: The pipe is <b>welded</b> <b>longitudinally</b> by YAG-laser. “The lateral extrusion process with a lost core (LELC) ” consists of lateral extrusion of pipes with a soluble solid core, called the “lost core”, {{which serves as a}} plastic mandrel. The process proceeds as follows. First, the pipe cavity is filled with the liquid low temperature melting material composing the lost core. The liquid is then solidified to form the soluble core of the pipe. The material is compressed longitudinally as a composite billet as well as forging, and extruded in the lateral direction. After the pipe is deformed, the lost core is melted and removed. s. The bulge by the LELC is carried out by extruding the material for the lateral direction, however the simple bulge by hydro-forming is done by internal pressure. Findings: The LELC process can make a hollow product having uneven wall thickness without the deformation concentrating on a thinner part of the material, because the circumferential deformation of the material will be performed by its meridian strain. Practical implications: The authors have developed LELC process in which the lost core consists of low-temperature melting alloys and have tried to apply the process to perform bulge process with a tailor-welded pipe having two different wall thickness. Originality/value: Optimum volume distribution is important for light-weight-parts, and employment of tailor-welded blanks is effective technique in sheet metal forming. Combination of employment of hollow shape and tailor-welded blanks seems to be hopeful...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{friction}} stir welds of the Al-alloy AA 5454 are investigated. The examined micrographs show {{the mixture of}} Al-hydroxides and Al-oxy-hydroxides arranged along characteristic lines. Moreover the present work suggests an approach how to avoid this conglomeration of oxide fragments in the weld zone {{in order to improve}} the mechanical properties especially the fatigue properties of FSW-joints. The aim of this work is to determine the characteristics and influences of embedded oxide particles as well as to evaluate possibilities to reduce the oxide fragments in the welding zone. In the cross section these particles seem to be arranged in a continuous line and were identified by as a mixture of aluminum hydroxides and oxy-hydroxide. It is assumed that such particles reduce the mechanical strength because of their considerable higher Young's modulus and the resulting strain incompatibility to the surrounding Al-matrix. The oxide particles, often referred to as 'Root Flaw', 'Kissing Bond' or 'Joint Line Remnant', are arranged along a characteristic pattern transversely and <b>longitudinally</b> to the <b>weld.</b> The formation of the pattern is influenced by the welding parameters welding force {{as well as by the}} design of the FSW-tool. In order to reduce or even to avoid the presence of such oxide fragments in the welding zone, first investigations concerning the surface finish of the samples were carried out. In order to investigate the influence of the oxide fragments on crack initiation the face and root of the weld were removed before tensile tests were performed to avoid cracks caused by the surface structure of the FSW-seam. In particular the ratio of the feed and rotational speed was correlated with the periodical length of the measured forces and the distribution of the oxide bands within the seam. Furthermore the detrimental effect of the oxide particles within the welding zone could be shown. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R

40|$|AN ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS OF Saurav Shrestha, for the Masters of Science {{degree in}} CIVIL ENGINEERING, {{presented}} on November 22, 2016, at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. TITLE: VERIFICATION OF SHEAR LAG IN <b>LONGITUDINALLY</b> <b>WELDED</b> TENSION MEMBERS. MAJOR PROFESSOR: Dr. J. Kent Hsiao, Ph. D., P. E. (CA), S. E. (UT) Tension members are used broadly as bracing members in buildings and truss. When double channels or double tees are welded to a gusset plate, stresses are distributed non-uniformly in connected members since {{only a part}} of its cross-section is connected. Shear lag factor describes this phenomenon. The main objective {{of this study is to}} verify shear lag factor of tension steel members with welded connections using the finite element computer analysis and the current design Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (AISC 2010). The provision for calculating shear lag factor, U, is given by AISC Specification as 1 -x ̅/L for angles, tees, channels and wide flange tension members. Weld size and length of the weld are the main parameters studied here. The current AISC design provision over-estimates the design tensile strength of double channel shapes. While, for WT Shapes it under-estimates one. The increase in weld size and decrease in weld length shows slight change in shear lag factor. Comparison is also made with the equation proposed by Fortney and Thornton (2012). The equation under-estimates the design tensile strength of both sections...|$|E

The use {{of random}} co-polymer polypropylene (PP-R) {{in hot water}} sanitary systems has grown substantially in Europe {{over the last five}} years. It is expected that the numerous benefits of PP-r over other materials will help this trend continue, and expand beyond Europe. Ongoing work on standards and specifications promises to further strengthen PP-r pipes' competitiveness. Therefore, the performance of such a new product is worth investigation. Apart from the PP pipe industry, analyzing the overall performance of the whole sanitary pipe sector (Steel and PP pipe) is as important in order to understand major differences.

40|$|A European {{research}} project (RFCS) {{has started to}} provide economic and safe guidance {{for the design of}} spirally welded tubes in combined walls. The main motivation for this project called COMBITUBE is that the current Eurocode 3 regulations for tubes in quay walls lead to uneconomic designs, because of poor local buckling design rules for these tubes. Because the most important load in quay walls is bending due to earth load, economic design implies a high diameter to wall thickness ratio. For relatively thin walled shells, the Eurocode 3 rules provide good results for the local buckling stress. For thicker walled shells where local buckling occurs when a part of the cross section has yielded, rather poor and uneconomic estimates of the local buckling bending moment are obtained. Also, no information on the deformation capacity is given. A solution for this problem is the application of strain based design methods, where the strain at local buckling is determined, from which the curvature (deformation capacity) and via the stress strain relationship, the bending moment can be obtained. The advantages of strain based design are explained. In comparison with <b>longitudinally</b> <b>welded</b> tubes and seamless tubes not much bending test results are available for spirally welded tubes. Therefore in the project full scale four point bending tests on spirally welded tubes with diameters up to 1060 mm are performed. Test results obtained so far are presented. The test results are used for the validation of FEA models for parameter studies where the effect of geometrical conditions (spiral welds and girth welds, geometrical imperfections), material properties and loading (mainly combinations of bending moment, normal force and earth loads) on the local buckling curvature and bending moment capacity are determined. Therefore, in the test program accurate measurements are performed of these conditions. Moment - curvature and curvature - ovalisation relationships are presented and compared with theoretical prediction...|$|E
