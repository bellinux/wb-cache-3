25|$|As {{with other}} councils still without a budget, the auditor had ordered Islington {{to set a}} <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> {{by the end of}} May or face an {{extraordinary}} audit. On 30 May, the Local Government committee of the Islington Labour Party narrowly voted to support a <b>legal</b> <b>rate,</b> and the following day Margaret Hodge proposed a legal budget to the council. The galleries were crowded with people urging the council to continue the fight and an amendment to continue to defer setting a rate was moved by Chris Calnan, but the amendment was lost by 34 votes to 10 with six abstentions and Islington duly set a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> a few hours before the deadline.|$|E
25|$|While the {{leadership}} {{was determined not}} to set a rate, there were moderate Labour councillors who were willing to defy the whip to vote for a legal budget. Supporters sought to prevent them from being put in such a position. On 16 April, council leader Tony Ritchie prevented a meeting called to set a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> from continuing by using powers under the council's standing orders to adjourn pending new advice; the meeting lasted only two minutes. A further meeting on 24 April was also swiftly adjourned, although on this occasion it was because Ritchie collapsed and had to be taken to hospital. When the council finally met on 26 April, the chamber was invaded by members of tenants groups and council staff with the result that the meeting broke up and was cancelled by the Mayor.|$|E
25|$|From the start, Lambeth {{had been}} in the {{forefront}} of the campaign. Despite rumours that three might break ranks, all 34 Labour councillors present voted on 7 March 1985 not to set a rate. As the new financial year approached, Labour councillor Stewart Cakebread dissented, saying that a budget set at the cap limit would not require cuts. The Conservative group summoned an emergency meeting on 10 April 1985 but their proposal for a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> was defeated by 34 to 30. A second Labour councillor, Janet Boston, rebelled at a special policy committee meeting on 30 April, supporting a Conservative motion to call a special council meeting on Sunday 5 May; both Boston and Cakebread were barristers. Meanwhile, council officials estimated that the failure to set a rate by 1 May had already cost the council Â£170,000 in lost interest.|$|E

50|$|The star {{systems of}} Override are {{controlled}} by various governments, each with a different disposition towards the player. Most start off as neutral with the player, though some may restrict access to their planets and stations and still others may be openly hostile and attack the player on sight. The player, however, can change their status with various governments. Taking missions for a government, attacking their enemies, and destroying pirates ("renegades") boosts status, whereas helping opposing governments, attacking a government's and their allies' ships, and pirating civilians will lower their <b>legal</b> <b>rating.</b> Also, affecting {{the legal status of}} one government will directly affect those of its allies and inversely affect its enemies. Having a high <b>legal</b> <b>rating</b> will give the player access to missions for that government (which, in turn, can unlock that government's ships and outfits). On the other hand, a low legal status will cause the government to restrict access to their ports and even cause them to attack the player on sight.|$|R
25|$|The {{leader of}} Islington borough council, Margaret Hodge, had chaired {{the meeting of}} the Labour london boroughs in June 1984 at which the {{strategy}} of setting no rate had been decided upon, and according to Ken Livingstone, claimed to have come up with the idea. Hodge was one of the public leaders of the campaign and on the evening of Thursday 7 March the council organised a people's festival in the civic auditorium while the council formally voted not to set a rate. On 22 April the council published the results of an opinion poll it had commissioned which showed that 57% of people in Islington supported the council in the struggle, with 20% supporting the Government. Asked what the council should do, the poll found 37% wanted the council to continue not to set a rate, 27% wanted the council to resign and force an election on the issue, and 21% wanted the council to set a <b>legal</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 20 March, council leader Hilda Kean {{declared}} that the council would be bankrupt {{by the middle of}} April if unable to set a rate and abjured the use of creative accounting to evade the cap. The council slightly softened its policy on 28 March, declaring that it was only deferring making a rate and committing to making a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> in due course; a motion to stick to the previous formula was defeated by 32 to 24. The council having ignored the High Court's interlocutory declaration, Mourad Fleming's judicial review application proceeded to trial on 1 April; Fleming agreed to vary an order and let the council use borrowing powers in the 1985/86 financial year, but said that he would ask the court to appoint a receiver to run the council if no rate was set. At the end of the hearing, Mr Justice Woolf found both Hackney's resolutions of 7 and 28 March unlawful and quashed them but refused to immediately order the council to set a rate. Instead he adjourned the case to 16 April.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March, Thamesdown {{passed a}} motion declaring its {{inability}} to set a rate. The council's chief executive, David Kent, wrote to all councillors after the meeting telling them that a rate had to be set {{by the end of}} March, and pressure appeared also from the Department of Health and Social Security which warned on 21 March {{that there would be a}} problem paying Housing Benefit to the council if no rate was made. The council felt sufficiently concerned to avoid budget chaos that it set up a special resources sub-committee to agree emergency measures for ordering supplies. On 25 March the Mayor summoned a special council meeting for 28 March, while senior councillors discussed options with the borough solicitor. The meeting on 28 March saw prolonged disruption from the public gallery by those who supported continued defiance, and Mayor Harry Garrett called on the police to keep order. Among the councillors the decision was taken to approve a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> of 196.65p; a council spokesman claimed that the council would be going ahead with what it was going to do anyway.|$|E

Despite the objection of the RIAA, the judge ruled that the rates should be produced, citing the legal precedent that [...] "a party cannot litigate tenaciously and then be heard to complain about the time necessarily spent by his opponent in response".|$|R
25|$|With no {{alteration}} in the government's stance, {{there was}} already talk of the council adopting illegal tactics in its 1984 budgeting, and on 19 March the District Auditor Les Stanford wrote to every councillor warning that the consequences of not setting a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> was a budget crisis, with surcharge and disqualification for councillors. A group of six Labour councillors {{under the leadership of}} Eddie Roderick declared they would not approve an illegal budget, but the majority of the Labour group thought the letter was a tactic to scare them into backing down. The council leadership put forward an illegal budget on 29 March; after an eight-hour meeting, Roderick put forward an amendment to delay setting a budget until 11 April to let officers prepare a legal one. A suggestion that council leader John Hamilton and chair of Finance Tony Byrne form an emergency committee to control finances in the interim was accepted but the delaying amendment fell: it had the support of the Conservatives and six councillors in Roderick's group but the Liberal councillors opposed it and supporters of the council leadership abstained. Instead the six Labour rebels, 30 Liberals and 18 Conservatives voted to postpone consideration.|$|E

At the council meeting Meehan formally proposed the <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> and then joined with 12 other Labour councillors and the opposition Conservative group to pass it; the majority of the Labour group voted in favour of delay until 29 April.

When Conservative {{councillor}} Tony Green tore the banner down, Labour councillor Terry Rich rushed across to confront him and was only held back in a headlock by another councillor. The meeting was adjourned for 20 minutes. When it resumed, Janet Boston and Stuart Cakebread moved a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> which was passed by 32 to 31.

2500|$|However, {{there are}} {{separate}} rules applied to most banks. The U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously in the 1978 Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v.

In 1980, Congress passed the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act. [...] Among the Act's provisions, it exempted federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies from state usury limits. Combined with the Marquette decision that applied to National Banks, this effectively overrode all state and local usury laws. The 1968 Truth in Lending Act does not regulate rates, except for some mortgages, but requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges.|$|E

2500|$|The appeal {{trial was}} held on 13 January 1931 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, in London, and, it was hoped at the time, would settle the status of Lundy once and for all. It didn't â but it did show how utterly {{confused}} the situation was. In his defence, Mr Harman said he {{had every right to}} mint money, for Lundy, in his words, was [...] "a vest-pocket-size, self-governing dominion," [...] out of the realm for every practical purpose. The Lundy residents, he pointed out, never had paid any taxes to England and were liable to customs when they went there, for Lundy itself was a free port. The Attorney General, who was prosecuting Mr Harman, said that Lundy was surely a Utopia but that its inhabitants would be just as happy if the face of King George V, rather than of Mr Harman, were depicted on the place's currency. (Mr Harman's face was {{on the front of the}} coins, and that of a puffin on the back.

6000|$|The pernicious and hurtful custom {{exists in}} various States in this [...] country of making any {{interest}} beyond a certain rate illegal. When [...] it is remembered that legitimate business is often largely done on [...] creditâuntil {{the proceeds of}} goods sold on credit are [...] collectedâthe rate of interest {{from day to day}} is very important [...] to trade. So, when there is a sudden demand for loans, a rate [...] higher than the legal one will certainly be paid, and the law [...] violated, if the getting of a loan is absolutely necessary to save [...] the borrower from commercial ruin. The effect of a <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> is [...] to stop loans at the very time when loans are most essential to [...] the business public. It would be far better to adopt such a [...] sliding scale as exists at great European banks, which allows the [...] rate of interest to rise with the demand.

While not agreeing with the French school that agriculture is [...] the only industry producing more than it consumes, and so land pays [...] rent, yet he thinks that it produces more in proportion to the labor [...] than other industries; that manufactures came next; and exportation [...] and commerce after them.

60|$|To his {{superior}} enlightenment {{in another part}} of the commercial field we owe one of the most excellent of Turgot's pieces, his Memorial on Loans of Money. This plea for free trade in money has all the sense and liberality of the brightest side of the eighteenth century illumination. It was suggested by the following circumstance. At AngoulÃªme four or five rogues associated together, and drew bills on one another. On these bills they borrowed money, the average rate of interest being from eight to ten per cent. When the bills fell due, instead of paying them, they laid informations against the lenders for taking more than the <b>legal</b> <b>rate</b> of interest. The lenders were ruined, persons who had money were afraid to make advances, bills were protested, commercial credit was broken, and the trade of the district was paralysed. Turgot prevailed upon the Council of State to withdraw the cases from the local jurisdiction; the proceedings against the lenders were annulled, and the institution of similar proceedings forbidden. This was a characteristic course. The royal government was generally willing in the latter half of the eighteenth century to redress a given case of abuse, but it never felt itself strong enough, or had leisure enough, to deal with the general source from which the particular grievance sprang. Turgot's Memorial is as cogent an exposure of the mischief of Usury Laws to the public prosperity, as the more renowned pages either of Bentham or J. B. Say on the same subject, and it has the merit of containing an explanation at once singularly patient and singularly intelligent, of the origin of the popular feeling about usury and its adoption by the legislator.|$|E

Christian merchants in Europe used gold as a currency, which created {{a demand for}} gold, too. Initially, Portugal was struck in 1383 when it minted its last gold coin until 1435. The production of gold in the northwestern part of Europe greatly declined from 1414 to 1454. Flanders (modern-day Belgium) was one of Europe's major producers of gold, but in 1454, its gold mints were closed. Nearby Brabant also stopped minting gold from 1439 to 1453 due to insufficient supply. Similarly, mints in other places such as Amiens, Saint-Quentin, Tournai, and the Rhineland were also short on gold.
