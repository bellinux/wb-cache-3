50|$|Many power {{processing}} {{systems can be}} improved by the application of resistive elements. Resistors may be applied for waveshaping, damping of oscillatory waveforms, stabilization of nonstable systems, and power flow balancing. The losses involved by the application of conventional resistors may be eliminated by the synthesis of artificial, <b>loss-free</b> resistive elements which replace the conventional ones. The conventional resistor converts the electrical energy absorbed at its terminals into heat; however, {{it has been found}} that creation of a resistive characteristic is not necessarily followed by such energy conversion. It is possible to synthesize a <b>Loss-Free</b> Resistor (LFR) by the combination of a switched mode converter and a suitable control circuit. The LFR is a two-port element that has a resistive i-v curve at the input terminals. The power absorbed at the input is transferred to the source that powers the total system, so in principle no losses occur.|$|E

In those circuits, there is not continuous control of the coupling networks that transfer the recovered energy to the source. In our method, the required resistive characteristic is obtained by the continuous control of the <b>loss-free,</b> storage-less two ports.|$|E
50|$|Like any fast reactor, by {{changing}} the material used in the blankets, the IFR can be operated over a spectrum from breeder to self-sufficient to burner. In breeder mode (using U-238 blankets) it will produce more fissile material than it consumes. This is useful for providing fissile material for starting up other plants. Using steel reflectors instead of U-238 blankets, the reactor operates in pure burner mode {{and is not a}} net creator of fissile material; on balance it will consume fissile and fertile material and, assuming <b>loss-free</b> reprocessing, output no actinides but only fission products and activation products. Amount of fissile material needed could be a limiting factor to very widespread deployment of fast reactors, if stocks of surplus weapons plutonium and LWR spent fuel plutonium are not sufficient. To maximize the rate at which fast reactors can be deployed, they can be operated in maximum breeding mode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Handover {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} factors that may degrade the performance of TCP connections and real-time applications in wireless data networks. We developed a <b>loss-free</b> handover scheme called LPM (Last Packet Marking) for IEEE 802. 16 e-based broadband wireless access networks. By integrating MAC and network layer handovers efficiently, LPM minimizes the handover delay and eliminates packet losses during handover. Our performance study shows that LPM achieves <b>loss-free</b> packet delivery without packet duplication and increases TCP throughput significantly. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Loss-Free</b> handoff in Mobile Networks is an {{extensive}} research area. Mobile IP (MIP) provided {{a solution to}} enable a mobile node to roam from one location to another while maintaining its network level connectivity. However, handoff latencies and longer triangular routing paths in MIP can severely degrade communication performance and in particular cripple connection oriented protocols like TCP. In this paper we propose an alternate approach for robust mobility. The scheme {{is based on the}} principle of 'Interactive Transparent Networking' where all networking layers remain lightweight but are engineered for interactivity. This would allow principle intelligent actions to be performed at the application layer. With protocol interactivity we demonstrate a novel scheme that switches IP address in the TCP/IP stack on both end-points and perform <b>loss-free</b> rapid handoff. The scheme offers not only <b>loss-free</b> handoff, but also offers several fundamental system advantages; (i) it does not impose any changes on original network protocols or their dynamics, and (ii) it fully adheres to the end-to-end principle and do not require intermediary nodes as in MIP. We have achieved a real implementation of the scheme on FreeBSD and tested the real system over Internet with voice traffic. We show that this scheme can dramatically reduce handoff latency and improve TCP performance by offering shorter routes with <b>loss-free</b> handoffs and smooth, low-jitter voice stream...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the quality of}} {{wireless}} data transmission. We are primarily interested {{in the importance of}} the distance between sender and receiver when measuring data loss rate and the length of lossy and <b>loss-free</b> periods. The ultimate purpose of this type of study is to quantify the effects of mobility. We have sampled data and find that distance certainly is an important indicator but the loss rate of packets is also determined by other factors and does not always monotonically increase with the distance. We further find that while the distribution of the length of lossy periods mostly shows an exponential decay the distribution of the length of <b>loss-free</b> periods does not even always monotonically decrease. Both, the packet loss probability and the distribution of the length of <b>loss-free</b> periods can be well represented using probabilistic models. We fit simple Gilbert-Elliot models as well as phase-type distributions to the data using different fitting tools and provide loss models that can easily be used in simulation and testbed studies. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for congestion management in integrated services packet networks {{based on a}} particular service discipline, called stop-and-go queueing, is proposed.

Both the admission policy and the stop-and-go queueing are based on a time framing concept, addressed in a previous paper.

40|$|Abstract – Proportional {{fairness}} criterion, {{first proposed}} by Kelly, has outstanding properties in allocating fair rates to network users. For example, it resembles the Jacobson’s AIMD method in rate allocation to users, and {{there exists a}} well-established stability analysis relating to {{the stability of the}} rate allocation algorithm. Kelly’s algorithm uses a form of the scaled gradient ascent projection method for converging to the equilibrium point. The structure of Kelly’s algorithm is such that in some instants of time, the aggregate flow which is passing through a link may exceed the link capacity. In other words, the algorithm is not <b>loss-free.</b> In this paper, we have proposed a novel time-varying scaled gradient ascent projection method that, under some assumptions about the link penalty function, the rate allocation algorithm is <b>loss-free</b> in some network topologies.
