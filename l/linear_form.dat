40|$|The {{densities of}} small linear {{structures}} (such as arithmetic progressions) in subsets of Abelian groups {{can be expressed}} as certain analytic averages involving <b>linear</b> <b>forms.</b> Higher-order Fourier analysis examines such averages by approximating the indicator function of a subset by a function of bounded number of polynomials.

25|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{floaters}} is shrinkage of the vitreous humour. This gel-like substance consists of 99% water and 1% solid elements. The solid portion consists of a network of collagen and hyaluronic acid, with the latter retaining water molecules. Depolymerization of this network makes the hyaluronic acid release its trapped water, thereby liquefying the gel. The collagen breaks down into fibrils, which ultimately are the floaters that plague the patient. Floaters caused in this way tend to be few in number and of a <b>linear</b> <b>form.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>linear</b> <b>form</b> of African {{sculpture}} and the depictive humanism of the figurative Renaissance painters informed his work. Working during that fertile period of “isms,” Cubism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Modigliani {{did not choose}} to be categorized within any of these prevailing, defining confines. He was unclassifiable, stubbornly insisting on his difference. He was an artist putting down paint on canvas creating works not to shock and outrage, but to say, “This is what I see.” More appreciated {{over the years by}} collectors than academicians and critics, Modigliani was indifferent to staking a claim for himself in the intellectual avant-garde of the art world. One can say he recognized the merit of Jean Cocteau’s proclamation: “Ne t'attardes pas avec l'avant-garde” (“Don’t wait for the avant-garde”). Pseudo-goitre, a medical condition is also known as Modigliani syndrome. This name was derived from the curved neck of women in Modigliani's paintings which appeared like pseudogoitre.|$|E
