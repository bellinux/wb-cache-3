5|$|In the Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga {{role-playing}} games, players {{take control}} of the characters Serph, Heat, Argilla, Gale and Cielo, with the characters Sera and Roland becoming playable in Digital Devil Saga 2. These characters are able to transform into a demon form, which is their main form in battle. Characters navigate to-scale environments, fighting enemies in both random encounters and story-focused boss battles. After each battle, experience points are awarded to characters. Character abilities are governed by Mantra Grids, a system where Mantras are bought using the in-game currency Macca, then mastering them using Atma Points gained from defeated enemies. The maximum number of abilities that a character can <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> eight. If two or more characters equip a certain ability, they can perform a stronger version of it through a combo. Each character can learn abilities from one of four categories: Physical, Magic, Shield and Auto.|$|E

At home, parents can help prevent their children from becoming overweight by changing the way the family eats and exercises together.

25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training is using a spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement.

500|$|According to Joe Romersa, an engineer/drummer in Los Angeles, whom ahbez bequeathed {{with master}} tapes, photos, and final works, ahbez wanted a {{correction}} {{made to the}} lyrics saying [...] "To be loved in return, is {{too much of a}} deal, and there's no deal in love.", and that instead it should read [...] "The greatest thing you'll ever <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> to love and be loved, just to love, and be loved." [...] Romersa has stated that because these lyrics did not fit with the original ending melody, ahbez re-wrote it.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the song relate to a 1940s Los Angeles-based group called [...] "Nature Boys", a {{subculture}} of proto-hippies of which ahbez was a member. Instrumentalist Chris Tyle noted that the lyrics are a musical self-portrait of ahbez, with the lines like [...] "There was a boy, A very strange, enchanted boy, They say he wandered very far, Very far, over land and sea". But he {{believed that it was}} the song's last line that made it the most poignant: [...] "The greatest thing you'll ever <b>learn,</b> <b>Is</b> just to love and be loved in return". Various interpretations of the line are given by academics, with the eponymous nature boy being a child, advising on love and relationship, or an adult hippie talking about his journey and inner-love. According to author Jeffrey P. Dennis, the song presented a homo-romantic theme, with the eponymous nature boy visiting Cole on a [...] "magic day" [...] and explaining that [...] "the greatest thing you'll ever <b>learn,</b> <b>is</b> just to love and be loved in return". Author Raymond Knapp described the track as a [...] "mystically charged vagabond song" [...] whose lyrics evoked an intense sense of loss and haplessness, with the final line delivering a universal truth, described by Knapp as [...] "indestructible" [...] and [...] "salvaged somehow from the perilous journey of life".|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} a central theme in Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was {{initially}} arranged as a techno song with singer David Bowie's vocals, before {{being sent to the}} group Massive Attack, whose remix was used in the film's closing credits. Bowie described the rendition as [...] "slinky and mysterious", adding that Robert '3D' Del Naja from the group had [...] "put together a riveting piece of work," [...] and that Bowie was [...] "totally pleased with the end result." [...] Both Bowie's version and Massive Attack's remix appeared on the soundtrack. The version used in Moulin Rouge! was sung by John Leguizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, during the introductory scenes, as well as by Ewan McGregor's character, Christian. Some of the film's premise was based on the lyrics, in particular the opening lines. The closing lyric, [...] "The greatest thing you'll ever <b>learn</b> <b>is</b> just to love and be loved in return" [...] is used throughout the film.

He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song, to capture the [...] "enchanting" [...] vibe of the track. The lyrics are a self-portrait of ahbez and his life. The final line—"The greatest thing you'll ever <b>learn,</b> <b>Is</b> just to love and be loved in return"—is considered a poignant moment in the song, with multiple interpretations of it. [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was released amidst the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) ban of 1948, but became commercially successful, reaching {{the top of the}} Billboard music charts and selling over a million copies. Receiving critical acclaim also, [...] "Nature Boy" [...] helped to introduce Cole to a wider audience, especially the white music market, and generated royalties for ahbez. In 1999, the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. However, [...] "Nature Boy" [...] was also the subject of lawsuits, with Yiddish composer Herman Yablokoff claiming that it was plagiarized from his song [...] "Shvayg mayn harts" [...] ("Hush My Heart"), which he wrote for his play Papirosn (1935). In the end, ahbez and Yablokoff settled out of court.|$|E

Inspiration for the story came from a short fictional document written by James Goss for the in-universe Torchwood Institute website created by BBC Online for the first series. The document detailed a man whom Torchwood would defrost [...] "once a year, give him a day out, and then pop him back in the freezer". Series creator Russell T Davies described the episode as a [...] "love story" [...] but felt it inevitable that the story would end in tears. In creating the character of Tommy Brockless, Raynor felt that he was [...] "the perfect boyfriend" [...] for Toshiko. However, she stated that their brief relationship was not a [...] "mature relationship" [...] but [...] "a pretend relationship" [...] as Toshiko only [...] "gets him out of the box once a year".
