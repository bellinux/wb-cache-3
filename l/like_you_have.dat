Seyfried {{said it was a}} relief to play the nerdy character opposite Fox. [...] "Being a lead (like Megan), you have that weird pressure of feeling <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to look attractive," [...] she stated. [...] "In this movie, I didn't worry about any of that [...] I don't want to play the one that everybody is supposed to want to have sex with." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|Co-writer James Wong {{felt that}} the changes {{he was asked to}} make to the script led to [...] "Shadows" [...] turning out to be [...] "an average episode", {{although}} he felt [...] "the director did a good job with it". His partner Glen Morgan had a similar opinion, calling it [...] "a little too ordinary, <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen it before, which is exactly what the network wanted at the time. Chris Carter had a more positive view of the episode, calling it [...] "very well done, really great effects, and more of a meat-and-potatoes kind of story. An FBI sting and a good mystery that Mulder and Scully investigate. Overall, a really solid episode." [...] The plot for [...] "Shadows" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 2000 by Ellen Steiber, under the title Haunted.|$|E

500|$|In a February 21, 2015 {{interview}} with Billboard, Violent J stated that Mike E. Clark {{will not be}} producing either album due to prior engagements, which include working with Kid Rock, so they will have other people do the production. He also said that [...] "LOST" [...] will have darker beats, and no comedy on it. The album is like {{looking at the world}} through negative lenses. He said that [...] "FOUND" [...] is <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been found, and has songs about the good times, and songs with comedy. Also in the interview it was announced that the [...] "20th Anniversary Riddle Box Tour" [...] has been temporarily sidelined. They plan to tour in early spring into most of the summer, ending at the GOTJ 2015, then tour again ending at the annual Hallowicked concert.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner {{said that}} the game's {{interactive}} storytelling encourages replay and that its detailed story [...] "makes the relationships feel real—you care about your crew, and you really feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a voice that resonates throughout the galaxy." [...] Alex Dale of CVG stated similar pros, stating that [...] "never before has storytelling been so competently ingrained into a videogame, and never before has a player had so much freedom to dictate {{the course of a}} linear storyline." [...] Similar praise was given to the game's detailed character models, facial animations, and voice acting. Jennifer Tsao of 1UP.com felt the digital actors evoked real-life expressions, but admitted that the lip sync had some issues. Although the visuals were credited for their dramatic set pieces and evocative soundtrack, critics noted the game's inconsistent frame rate and long loading times.|$|E
500|$|The cover art by Hugh Syme {{features}} {{an elderly woman}} hanging babies by their feet on a seemingly endless clothesline. According to bassist David Ellefson, the artwork concept was directly inspired from a line of the title track, [...] "We've been hung out to dry". He explained that the title track [...] "was probably the strongest representation of how we feel about {{the young people who}} listen to our music and what their future holds for them. It's <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a choice, you can become proactive or you can choose 'Youthanasia'." [...] The title is a combination [...] of the words [...] "youth" [...] and [...] "euthanasia". Mustaine has stated that the idea for the title stems from hearing about Jack Kevorkian, as well as the declining state of well-being of young people, specifically referring to issues like drugs, crime and violence, and a lack of parenting.|$|E
6000|$|He forgot {{himself in}} a return of his admiration of her. [...] "Oh, <b>you</b> don't <b>have</b> to seek. A girl <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>has</b> her career all cut out for her." ...|$|R

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m glad he gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
500|$|Growing up {{a fan of}} Disney films, Murphy {{had never}} wanted to play a princess, preferring {{characters}} who were adventurous and [...] "drove the action" [...] instead. In the actress' opinion, villains {{continue to be the}} most dynamic characters in Disney films. Describing the opportunity to voice a Disney villain as a [...] "juicy" [...] experience, Murphy explained that this is because these characters are [...] "not bound by ethics or moral codes or concern for what someone thinks or how it might hurt someone else", providing actors with more freedom. Upon her first session, Murphy appreciated the directors for exposing her to early concepts and ideas about Gothel. However, Murphy was not provided with a complete script because [...] "They’re very protective about that." [...] Murphy was directed to lower the pitch of her voice in favor of demonstrating a rather [...] "flat" [...] sound. Although Murphy did not base her own performance on any one individual in particular, she admitted to Babble that she was somewhat inspired by Betty Lou Gerson's performance as Cruella de Vil in Disney's One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961). Comparing voice acting to Broadway, Murphy commented that, in animation, [...] "You’re recording and you’re discovering it and giving the performance all at the same time. It’s not <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> three weeks rehearsal." [...] Additionally, Murphy never worked with co-star Mandy Moore, voice of Rapunzel; instead, Murphy revealed that scenes with Gothel and Rapunzel were actually recorded opposite one of the directors impersonating Moore, who also explained to Murphy that Gothel's design will continue to evolve as the character begins to adapt the actress' mannerisms. Howard enthused that Murphy [...] "nailed" [...] Gothel, admitting to ultimately using 90% of the actress' original material and takes because [...] "The character just came right to life when she came in." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was trying}} to keep it close to the vest {{throughout}} the release. Paul Walker used to say that [...] was guaranteed.

2500|$|According to Ed Belt, retired {{professor}} of geology at Amherst College, the Medicine Rocks sandstone is almost unique. [...] "You {{have to go}} a long way to find a sand deposit of a similar age.

[...] It is also possible that the state park lies atop an unexposed fault.|$|E

2500|$|Philadelphia {{was able}} to extend its win streak to four games the next week, before losing to Dallas and Minnesota.

2500|$|Harris {{has criticized}} common {{usage of the}} term [...] "Islamophobia". [...] "My {{criticism}} of Islam is a criticism of beliefs and their consequences," [...] he wrote following a controversial clash with Ben Affleck in October 2014 on the show Real Time with Bill Maher, [...] "but my fellow liberals reflexively view it {{as an expression of}} intolerance toward people." [...] During an email exchange with Glenn Greenwald, a critic of the New Atheists, Harris argued that [...] "Islamophobia is a term of propaganda designed to protect Islam from the forces of secularism by conflating all criticism of it with racism and xenophobia. And it is doing its job, because people <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been taken in by it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a tribute}} to our forebears and {{in keeping with the}} work ethic {{embedded}} from our agricultural heritage, this Museum has won acclaim from visitors all over the United States, and most foreign countries.

2500|$|Williams stated {{his love}} for Toronto and {{mentioned}} the possibility of returning to the Canadian game during his professional career.

[...] "Because I really like Toronto, I really like this organization … you can live here, you know? You feel <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a life. I come to work, I go home, play with my kid, walk to the store. It's really nice. I get to teach. It's wonderful here." [...] In another interview, he expressed further desire to remain in the CFL, [...] "If I came back here, you can put me anywhere", he says. [...] "Up here, I can play offense, defense, special teams. I can do everything. I can block, play tight end, running back, receiver— even play the line. The NFL is so structured— 'You do this.' Here I can do so much." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2015, FEMM {{confirmed}} {{in a press}} release through Avex Group Inc. that they would release their debut physical album, which was revealed to be entitled Pow!/L.C.S.. FEMM confirmed the EP would include two new tracks; the studio version of [...] "Pow!", and [...] "L.C.S.", alongside old remixes of their previous singles; they commented that they would add new re-edited versions of different tracks that didn't appear on their debut studio. In late January 2016, FEMM announced through a press release with Avex Group Inc. that they would release a double album in late February 2016 that included a physical copy of Femm-Isation. Regarding the material, FEMM agent Honey-B stated [...] "The original order of the songs was already carefully mapped out, but this time round we got to put in segues in between songs which made a big difference.

2500|$|Initially {{there existed}} a {{fluidity}} between all three national orientations, with people changing their allegiance throughout their lives, and until approximately {{the turn of}} the 20th century members of all three groups frequently identified themselves by the ethnonym Ruthenians (Rusyny). Initially the most prominent ideology was Ruthenianism, or Rutenstvo. Its proponents, referred to as [...] "Old Ruthenians", were mainly wealthier or more influential priests and the remnants of the nobility who had not been Polonized, and were quite loyal to the Habsburgs to whom they owed their higher social standing. While emphasizing their separateness from the Poles in terms of religion and background, these people nevertheless maintained an elitist attitude towards the peasantry. They frequently spoke the Polish language among themselves, and tried to promote a version of Church Slavonic with elements of the local Ukrainian vernacular as well as the Russian language as a literary language for western Ukraine [...] This language was never standardized, however. The language actually spoken by the common people was viewed with contempt. Old Ruthenians rejected both Ukrainophilism and Russophilism. [...] The Ukrainian thinker Mykhailo Drahomanov wrote [...] ironically of them, that [...] "you Galician intellectuals really do think of creating some kind of Uniate Paraguay, with some kind of hierarchical bureaucratic aristocracy, just <b>like</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> created an Austro-Ruthenian literary language!" [...] Old Ruthenianism dominated Galicia's cultural scene until the mid-19th century, when it was supplanted by Russophilia (many of the proponents of old Ruthenianism eventually became Russophiles).|$|E
