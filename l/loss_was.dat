5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> merely a bump in the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
50|$|Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{related to}} both {{standing}} wave ratio (SWR) and reflection coefficient (Γ). Increasing return loss corresponds to lower SWR. Return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{a measure of how}} well devices or lines are matched. A match is good if the return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> high. A high return <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> desirable and results in a lower insertion loss.|$|R

5|$|The 1927 {{season was}} one of underachievement and {{ultimate}} success. Stanford lost its third game to non-conference St. Mary's College. Stanford's next <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> against non-conference Santa Clara. The game against USC was a 13-to-13 tie.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this case}} the maximum <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> from 100 to 20 = 80, so the {{discounted}} maximum <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> simply ...|$|R

5|$|The Red Sox {{had lost}} in the {{previous}} season's American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> mainly blamed on the decision by then-manager Grady Little to keep starting pitcher Pedro Martínez in {{the game in the}} 8th inning of Game 7, and Little was fired two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The club's largest wins {{have been}} a 15–0 victory over Great Yarmouth Town on 21 November 1914 in the FA Cup and a 12–0 win over Bristol Rovers in the Third Division South on 13 April 1936.

5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the opposing forces were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E
5|$|After five {{straight}} championship wins in the AAFC and NFL, the Browns appeared poised to bring another trophy home in 1951. The team finished {{the regular season}} with 11 wins and a single loss {{in the first game}} of the season. Cleveland faced the Rams on December 23 in a rematch of the previous year's title game. The score was deadlocked 17–17 in the final period, but a 73-yard touchdown pass by Rams quarterback Norm van Brocklin to wide receiver Tom Fears broke the tie and gave Los Angeles the lead for good. The 24–17 <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> the Browns' first in a championship game.|$|E
5|$|Andorra's first {{match in}} a FIFA-sanctioned {{competition}} was a 3–1 loss to Armenia on 5 September 1998 in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 2000. Andorra lost all ten qualifiers for the tournament.

Andorra scored only three goals, two of which were penalties, and two of which were in the away matches. Andorra conceded 28 goals, and their biggest defeat of the qualifiers was a 6–1 away loss to Russia.|$|E

Trinidad's first professional <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> against Bernard Hopkins later in 2001, and following this he retired from boxing for the first time. Trinidad made his ring return by defeating Ricardo Mayorga in 2004 and, after a losing effort against Winky Wright in 2005, retired for a second time. In 2008 he returned once more and lost to Roy Jones Jr. Subsequently, Trinidad entered a five-year hiatus without clarifying the status of his career.|$|E

5|$|Brown's {{first year}} at Ohio State was a success. The Buckeyes won {{all but one of}} eight games in 1941; the only <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> to Northwestern University and its star tailback, Otto Graham. The final game of the season was a 20–20 tie with Michigan, which the school's {{supporters}} saw as a good outcome given that Ohio State was a heavy underdog. The Buckeyes tied for second place in the Western Conference, a grouping of college teams from the Midwestern United States (now known as the Big Ten), and finished 13th in the AP Poll.

5|$|Following {{a disappointing}} 4–7–2 season the next year, Potteiger was {{replaced}} by LeRoy Andrews. Before the 1929 season, Mara purchased the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, including star quarterback Benny Friedman. The Wolverines had finished in third place the year before. Led by Friedman, New York's record soared to 13–1–1. However, their lone <b>loss</b> <b>was</b> a 20–6 setback in November to the Green Bay Packers, and by virtue of this win, and their 12–0–1 record, won the NFL title. Following the season, Mara transferred ownership over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors. At the time, Jack was just 22, and Wellington only 14.|$|E

50|$|Hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> {{classified}} as mild, moderate, severe or profound. Pure-tone audiometry for air conduction thresholds at 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz is traditionally used to classify {{the degree of}} hearing loss in each ear. Normal hearing thresholds {{are considered to be}} 25 dB sensitivity, though it has been proposed that this threshold is too high, and that 15 dB (about half as loud) is more typical. Mild hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 25-45 dB; moderate hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 45-65 dB; severe hearing <b>loss</b> <b>is</b> thresholds of 65-85 dB; and profound hearing <b>loss</b> thresholds <b>are</b> greater than 85 dB.|$|R
50|$|Since it was expendable, DASH used {{off-the-shelf}} industrial electronics with no back-ups. The {{controls were}} multi-channel analog FM.
