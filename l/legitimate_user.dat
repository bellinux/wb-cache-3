25|$|A {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) is a cyber-attack {{where the}} perpetrator uses {{more than one}} unique IP address, often thousands of them. The incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively {{makes it impossible to}} stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it very difficult to distinguish <b>legitimate</b> <b>user</b> traffic from attack traffic when spread across so many points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, many attacks involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) also so that the location of the attacking machines cannot easily be identified and defeated.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{security}} risk of intrusion through an {{access control system}} is by simply following a <b>legitimate</b> <b>user</b> through a door, and this {{is referred to as}} tailgating. Often the <b>legitimate</b> <b>user</b> will hold the door for the intruder. This risk can be minimized through security awareness training of the user population, or more active means such as turnstiles. In very high security applications this risk is minimized by using a sally port, sometimes called a security vestibule or mantrap, where operator intervention is required presumably to assure valid identification.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of Souche, a system that recognizes <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> early in online services. This early recognition contributes to both usability and security. Souche leverages social connections established over time. <b>Legitimate</b> <b>users</b> help identify other <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> through an implicit vouching process, strategically controlled within vouching trees. Souche is lightweight and fully transparent to users. In our evaluation on a real dataset of several hundred million users, Souche can efficiently identify 85 % of <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> early, while reducing the percentage of falsely admitted malicious users from 44 % to 2. 4 %. Our evaluation further indicates that Souche is robust {{in the presence of}} compromised accounts. It is generally applicable to enhance usability and security for a wide class of online services...|$|R

For instance, if {{the total number of}} answer choices is 15 for a given question and 5 out of the 15 are correct, the “number of correct answers” is 5. In our study, the performance and number of correct answers was found to be negatively correlated for <b>legitimate</b> <b>users.</b> In other words, questions with more correct answers were answered less correctly by <b>legitimate</b> <b>users.</b> Interestingly, while increasing the “number of correct answers” negatively affects accuracy score of <b>legitimate</b> <b>users,</b> there is no significant effect on accuracy score of adversaries.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, an {{extended}} large wireless network under the secrecy constraint is considered. In contrast to works which use idealized assumptions, {{a more realistic}} network situation with unknown eavesdroppers locations is investigated: the <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> only know their own Channel State Information (CSI), not the eavesdroppers CSI. Also, the network is analyzed by taking in to account the effects of both fading and path loss. Under these assumptions, a power efficient cooperative scheme, named stochastic virtual beamforming, is proposed. Applying this scheme, an unbounded secure rate with any desired outage level is achieved, provided that {{the density of the}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> tends to infinity. In addition, by tending the <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> density to the infinity, the tolerable density of eavesdroppers will become unbounded too...|$|R

30|$|One of the {{differences}} between conventional DDoS and App-DDoS attacks is that App-DDoS attacks utilize only legitimate methods instead of vulnerabilities of protocols. App-DDoS attacks usually send small packets via successful TCP connections, and real IP addresses thus are used to launch attacks. In particular, App-DDoS attacks send packets through standard services such as HTTP and HTTPS. Moreover, these packets are generated with various sending rates to mimic <b>legitimate</b> <b>users.</b> Thus, these application-layer requests are indistinguishable from those generated by <b>legitimate</b> <b>users.</b>|$|R

This complements the recent interest in multi-photon quantum communication protocols that require a pre-shared key between the <b>legitimate</b> <b>users...</b>|$|R

40|$|We discuss {{distributed}} {{denial of}} service attacks in the Internet. We were motivated by the widely known February 2000 distributed attacks on Yahoo!, Amazon. com, CNN. com, and other major Web sites.

An attacker may attempt to: "flood" a network and thus reduce a <b>legitimate</b> <b>user's</b> bandwidth, prevent access to a service, or disrupt service to a specific system or a user. We describe methods and techniques used in denial of service attacks, and we list possible defenses. In our study, we simulate a distributed denial of service attack using ns- 2 network simulator. We examine how various queuing algorithms implemented in a network router perform during an attack, and whether <b>legitimate</b> <b>users</b> can obtain desired bandwidth. We find that under persistent denial of service attacks, class based queuing algorithms can guarantee bandwidth for certain classes of input flows. [...] ...|$|R
