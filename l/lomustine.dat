40|$|BACKGROUND: Treatment {{options for}} {{recurrent}} glioblastoma are scarce, with second-line chemotherapy showing only modest activity against the tumour. Despite {{the absence of}} well controlled trials, bevacizumab is widely used {{in the treatment of}} recurrent glioblastoma. Nonetheless, whether the high response rates reported after treatment with this drug translate into an overall survival benefit remains unclear. We report the results of the first randomised controlled phase 2 trial of bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma. METHODS: The BELOB trial was an open-label, three-group, multicentre phase 2 study undertaken in 14 hospitals in the Netherlands. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with a first recurrence of a glioblastoma after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy were randomly allocated by a web-based program to treatment with oral <b>lomustine</b> 110 mg/m(2) once every 6 weeks, intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg once every 2 weeks, or combination treatment with <b>lomustine</b> 110 mg/m(2) every 6 weeks and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Randomisation of patients was stratified with a minimisation procedure, in which the stratification factors were centre, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and age. The primary outcome was overall survival at 9 months, analysed by intention to treat. A safety analysis was planned after the first ten patients completed two cycles of 6 weeks in the combination treatment group. This trial is registered with the Nederlands Trial Register (www. trialregister. nl, number NTR 1929). FINDINGS: Between Dec 11, 2009, and Nov 10, 2011, 153 patients were enrolled. The preplanned safety analysis was done after eight patients had been treated, because of haematological adverse events (three patients had grade 3 thrombocytopenia and two had grade 4 thrombocytopenia) which reduced bevacizumab dose intensity; the <b>lomustine</b> dose in the combination treatment group was thereafter reduced to 90 mg/m(2). Thus, in addition to the eight patients who were randomly assigned to receive bevacizumab plus <b>lomustine</b> 110 mg/m(2), 51 patients were assigned to receive bevacizumab alone, 47 to receive <b>lomustine</b> alone, and 47 to receive bevacizumab plus <b>lomustine</b> 90 mg/m(2). Of these patients, 50 in the bevacizumab alone group, 46 in the <b>lomustine</b> alone group, and 44 in the bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> 90 mg/m(2) group were eligible for analyses. 9 -month overall survival was 43 % (95 % CI 29 - 57) in the <b>lomustine</b> group, 38 % (25 - 51) in the bevacizumab group, 59 % (43 - 72) in the bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> 90 mg/m(2) group, 87 % (39 - 98) in the bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> 110 mg/m(2) group, and 63 % (49 - 75) for the combined bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> groups. After the reduction in <b>lomustine</b> dose in the combination group, the combined treatment was well tolerated. The most frequent grade 3 or worse toxicities were hypertension (13 [26 %] of 50 patients in the bevacizumab group, three [7 %] of 46 in the <b>lomustine</b> group, and 11 [25 %] of 44 in the bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> 90 mg/m(2) group), fatigue (two [4 %], four [9 %], and eight [18 %]), and infections (three [6 %], two [4 %], and five [11 %]). At the time of this analysis, 144 / 148 (97 %) of patients had died and three (2 %) were still on treatment. INTERPRETATION: The combination of bevacizumab and <b>lomustine</b> met prespecified criteria for assessment of this treatment in further phase 3 studies. However, the results in the bevacizumab alone group do not justify further studies of this treatment. FUNDING: Roche Nederland and KWF Kankerbestrijding...|$|E

40|$|Background: Angiogenesis {{is crucial}} for {{glioblastoma}} growth, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents are widely used in recurrent glioblastoma patients. The number of circulating endothelial cells (CECs) is a surrogate marker for endothelial damage. We assessed their kinetics and explored their prognostic value in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Methods: In this side study of the BELOB trial, 141 patients with recurrent glioblastoma were randomised to receive single-agent bevacizumab or <b>lomustine,</b> or bevacizumab plus <b>lomustine.</b> Before treatment, after 4 weeks and after 6 weeks of treatment, CECs were enumerated. Results: The number of CECs increased during treatment with bevacizumab plus <b>lomustine,</b> but not during treatment in the single-agent arms. In patients treated with <b>lomustine</b> single agent, higher absolute CEC numbers after 4 weeks (log(10) CEC hazard ratio (HR) 0. 41, 95 % CI 0. 18 - 0. 91) and 6 weeks (log(10) CEC HR 0. 16, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 0. 56) of treatment were associated with improved overall survival (OS). Absolute CEC numbers in patients receiving bevacizumab plus <b>lomustine</b> or bevacizumab single agent were not associated with OS.

30|$|High dose {{chemotherapy}} and ASCT for lymphomas utilizes several drug combinations {{and in the}} absence of randomized comparative data, BEAM is the regimen most widely used because of its apparent tolerability and established efficacy. Shortage of old drugs is a worldwide problem, and while alternative regimens do follow the principles of combination chemotherapy, this requires attention and action by our health authorities. BCNU needs an alcoholic solvent for intravenous infusion and lately its availability world over was stalled by technical problems in its production (Leslie 2009). CCNU (<b>lomustine)</b> another nitrosurea, available for oral administration seemed the most logical substitute, and the modified regimen (LEAM) use was reported by some authors (Perfetti et al. 2009; Ramzi et al. 2012). Moreover, investigators have used other <b>lomustine</b> based regimens for high dose chemotherapy conditioning for lymphomas; partly in view of the concern for higher rates of pulmonary toxicity associated with BCNU compared to CCNU. LACE (<b>lomustine,</b> cytarabine (Ara-C), cyclophosphamide, etoposide) (Perz et al. 2007) and CCNU substitution for BCNU in the CBV (cyclophosphamide, BCNU, etoposide) regimen (Stuart et al. 2001), are some other <b>lomustine</b> based regimens that has shown comparable results. However, randomized studies are absent and direct comparative studies are lacking. In this single centre study, we examined the toxicities and efficacy of the recently used LEAM regimen and compared it with standard BEAM.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: No {{significant}} improvement in treatment outcome has been seen in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) over the past 20 years. This retrospective analysis investigated the prognostic factors for complete remission (CR) and survival in older patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 847 patients older than 60 years enrolled onto three trials carried out in France between 1995 and 2005. Induction therapy consisted of idarubicin (8 mg/m(2), days 1 through 5) and cytarabine (100 mg/m(2), days 1 through 7; group I, 339 patients) or the same drugs plus <b>lomustine</b> (200 mg/m(2) orally on day 1; group II, 508 patients). Consolidation therapy consisted of anthracycline and cytarabine courses at lower doses, preceded or not by a first course of intermediate-dose cytarabine. RESULTS: The rate of CR was significantly higher in patients in group II compared with group I (68 % v 58 %; P =. 002). The rate of toxic death was similar in the two groups. In multivariate analysis, two prognostic factors were linked to CR: nonadverse cytogenetic (P <. 003) and addition of <b>lomustine</b> to induction chemotherapy (P =. 002). Median overall survival was significantly improved in patients treated with <b>lomustine</b> (median and SE, 12. 7 +/- 2. 2 months v 8. 7 +/- 2. 7 months; P =. 004). In multivariate analysis, five prognostic factors positively affected overall survival: addition of <b>lomustine</b> (P =. 002), age < or = 69 years (P <. 001), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status lower than 2 (P =. 002), French-American-British subgroup 1 / 2 (P =. 02), and nonadverse cytogenetic (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: <b>Lomustine</b> improves the rate of CR and survival in elderly patients with de novo AML when added to standard induction therapy...|$|E
