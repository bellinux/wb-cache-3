Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, nowadays often supplemented, inhibit oleic acid synthesis.

Levels of lipid content probably could be considered insufficient for economic industrialexploitation except for medical usages and specific consumption. The pre-dominant fatty acid was linolenicacid (C 18 : 3) and its content was about 31. 8 - 86. 6 %, followed by linoleic acid (0. 7 - 24. 4 %), oleic acid (0. 4 - 17. 4 %), stearic acid (2. 8 - 16. 7 %) and palmitic acid (0. 3 - 9. 9 %).

40|$|The {{deficient}} oxidation and {{accumulation of}} very-long-chain fatty acids in the Zellweger cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome (CHRS) and X chromosome-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), {{coupled with the}} observation that peroxisomes are lacking in CHRS, prompted us to investigate the subcellular localization of the catabolism of <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> (C 24 : 0). Peroxisomal and mitochondrial-rich fractions were separated from rat liver crude mitochondria by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Enzyme activity for the oxidation of [1 - 14 C]palmitic acid to water-soluble acetate was 2 - to 3 -fold higher in the mitochondrial than in the peroxisomal-rich fraction whereas [1 - 14 C]lignoceric acid was oxidized at a 2 - to 3 -fold higher rate in the peroxisomal than in the mitochondrial fraction. Moreover, unlike palmitic acid oxidation, <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation was not inhibited by potassium cyanide in either rat liver fractions or human skin cultured fibroblasts, showing that <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> is mainly and possibly exclusively oxidized in peroxisomes. We also conducted studies to clarify the striking phenotypic differences between CHRS and the childhood form of ALD. In contrast to CHRS, we found normal hepatocellular peroxisomes in the liver biopsy of a childhood ALD patient. In addition, {{in the presence of}} potassium cyanide, the oxidation of palmitic acid in cultured skin fibroblasts was inhibited by 62 % in control and X chromosome-linked ALD patients compared with 88 % in CHRS and neonatal ALD.

Fenoprofen was found to inhibit the formation of palmitoyl-CoA in both microsomal and peroxisomal fractions whereas the formation of lignoceroyl-CoA and cerotoyl-CoA was not inhibited at all. In freshly isolated rat hepatocytes palmitic acid beta-oxidation was progressively inhibited at increasing concentrations of fenoprofen, most probably due to its inhibitory effect on palmitoyl-CoA synthetase activity. On the other hand, fenoprofen was also found to inhibit the beta-oxidation of <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> and cerotic acid in rat hepatocytes. It is shown that the acyl-CoA oxidase activity with lignoceroyl-CoA as substrate was inhibited by fenoprofen whereas the palmitoyl-CoA and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase activities were not inhibited by fenoprofen.

40|$|Brain tissue, both {{grey and}} white matter from the {{cerebral}} parietal {{region and the}} cerebellum, was obtained from 66 infants dying of sudden infant death syndrome. The fatty acid composition was analysed in these tissues by gas liquid chromatography after extraction and derivatisation. The subjects were divided according to their dietary history, either breast or formula feeding. Formula-fed infants were further subdivided according {{to the content of}} -linolenic acid in the formula milk. At the time of this study no formula milks analysed contained long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Dietary related differences were found in the accretion of polyunsaturated fatty acids into neural membranes. Docosahexaenoic acid concentrations were higher and conversely n- 6 series fatty acids lower in breast-fed than formula-fed infants. In cerebral white matter, nervonic acid, the long-chain fatty acid associated with myelination, appeared in breast-fed in advance of formula-fed infants. Similar dietary related differences in polyunsaturated fatty acid compositions were found in the cerebella cortex and the cerebellar white matter was associated with an earlier accretion of nervonic and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids</b> when compared to the cerebrum. Analysis of the phospholipid and glycolipid composition of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter tissues was achieved by means of separation by high performance thin layer chromatography followed by scanning densitometry.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the fatty acid profiles in 18 soybean cultivars grown in Korea.

Based on their color, yellow-, black-, brown-, and green-colored cultivars were denoted. Correlation coefficients (r) between the nine major fatty acids identified (two trace fatty acids, myristic and palmitoleic, were not included in the study) were generated and revealed an inverse association between oleic and linoleic acids (r=- 0. 94, p 1), which together account for 81. 49 % of the total variance in the data set; with PC 1 contributing 28. 16 % of the total. Eigen analysis of the correlation matrix loadings of the four significant PCs revealed that PC 1 was mainly contributed to by oleic, linoleic, and gondoic acids, PC 2 by stearic, linolenic and arachidic acids, PC 3 by behenic and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids,</b> and PC 4 by palmitic acid.

Radiolabelled {{products of the}} fatty acids included carbon dioxide. C 14 - 24 saturated and mono-unsaturated fatty acids formed from released acetate either by synthesis de novo or by elongation of endogenous fatty acids, fatty acids formed by 2 - 6 -carbon elongation of added substrates, {{and a number of}} water-soluble compounds, some of which were tentatively identified as the amino acids glutamine, glutamic acid and asparagine. The labelled amino acids were found predominantly in the culture medium. Zellweger's syndrome fibroblasts showed a marked decrease in radiolabelled carbon dioxide and water-soluble-product formation from (I- 14 C) -labelled arachidonic, tetracosatetraenoic and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids</b> but not from [I- 14 C]palmitic acid, and the production of radiolabelled C 14 - 18 fatty acids was also diminished. However, the elongation of individual fatty acids was either normal or above normal. Our data support the view that the oxidation of 20 : 4, 24 : 4 and 24 : 0 fatty acids in cultured skin fibroblasts takes place largely in peroxisomes, and further that the acetyl-CoA released by the beta-oxidation process is available for the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids.

40|$|We {{previously}} {{reported that in}} childhood adrenoleukodystrophy (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the peroxisomal beta-oxidation system for very long chain (greater than C 22) fatty acids is defective. To further define the defect in these two forms of X chromosome-linked ALD, we examined the oxidation of [1 - 14 C]lignoceric acid (n-tetracosanoic acid, C 24 : 0) and [1 - 14 C]lignoceroyl-CoA (substrates {{for the first and}} second steps of beta-oxidation, respectively). The oxidation rates of <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> in C-ALD and AMN were 43 % and 36 % of control values, respectively, whereas the oxidation rate of lignoceroyl-CoA was 109 % (C-ALD) and 106 % (AMN) of control values, respectively. On the other hand, the oxidation rates of palmitic acid (n-hexadecanoic acid) and palmitoyl-CoA in C-ALD and AMN were similar to the control values. These results suggest that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase activity may be impaired in C-ALD and AMN. To identify the specific enzymatic deficiency and its subcellular localization in C-ALD and AMN, we established a modified procedure for the subcellular fractionation of cultured skin fibroblasts. Determination of acyl-CoA ligase activities provided direct evidence that lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is deficient in peroxisomes while it is normal in mitochondrial and microsomes. Moreover, the normal oxidation of lignoceroyl-CoA as compared with the deficient oxidation of <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> in isolated peroxisomes also supports the conclusion that peroxisomal lignoceroyl-CoA ligase is impaired in both C-ALD and AMN. Palmitoyl-Coa ligase activity was found to be normal in peroxisomes as well as in mitochondria and microsomes. This normal peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA ligase activity as compared with the deficient activity of lignoceroyl-CoA ligase in C-ALD and AMN suggests the presence of two separate acyl-CoA ligases for palmitic and lignoceric acids in peroxisomes. These data clearly demonstrate that the pathognomonic accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in C-ALD and AMN is due to a deficiency of peroxisomal very long chain (<b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid)</b> acyl-CoA ligase...|$|E

Among 14 fatty acids detected in broccoli, linolenic, palmitic and linoleic acids were major fatty acids comprising more than 80 % of total fatty acids in both the seasons and all the parts. Likewise, stearic and oleic acids were also present in considerable amount while remaining fatty acids; caproic, lauric, myristic, pentadecanoic, palmitoleic, heptadecanoic, arachidic, behenic and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids</b> showed their minor compositional ratio. Among the three parts, stem exhibited highest SFAs (49. 681 % in spring and 50. 717 % in fall season) compared to MUFA and PUFA, while highest compositional ratio of PUFAs were observed in leaves (62. 588 % in spring and 68. 931 % in fall season), which indicates leaves as a good source of health beneficial fatty acids. In contrast, floret part exhibited highest SFA (48. 786 %) and PUFA (57. 518 %) in spring and fall seasons, respectively. Major fatty acids; palmitic, linoleic and linolenic acid showed lowest cultivar dependent variation (below 10 %) and leaf showed least variation in both the seasons compared to floret and stem.

To define the subcellular organelle with deficient enzyme activity in the catabolism of phytanic acid, we measured the oxidation of [l- 14 C] phytanic acid to 14 C 02 and pristanic acid in different subcellular organelles isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts from control and Refsum patients. The rates of oxidation of phytanic acid in peroxisomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum were 37. 1 * 2. 65, 1. 9 * 0. 3, and 0. 4 * 0. 07 pmol/h per mg protein, respectively, from control fibroblasts. The phytanic acid oxidation activity in mitochondria (2. 04 0. 7 pmol/h per mg protein) and endoplasmic reticulum (0. 43 * 0. 2 pmol/h per mg protein) from Refsum fibroblasts was similar to control fibroblasts. However, phytanic acid oxidation in peroxisomes from Refsum fibroblasts was not detected at all the protein concentrations tested. On the other hand, the peroxisomes from Refsum fibroblasts had normal rates of activation and oxidation of palmitic and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids,</b> suggesting that the peroxisomes isolated from Refsum fibroblasts were metabolically active. The phytanoyl-CoA ligase, the first enzyme in the a-oxidation pathway, had activity {{similar to that in}} peroxisomes from control (9. 86 * 0. 09 nmol/h per mg protein) and Refsum (10. 25 f 0. 31 nmol/h per mg protein) fibroblasts. 819 The data described here clearly demonstrate that pathognomonic accumulation of phytanic acid in patients with Refsum disease is due to the deficient activity of peroxisomal a-oxidation enzym...|$|R
40|$|Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is a {{potential}} cash crop for the southeastern United States for production of cooking oil or biodiesel. Two years (2006 and 2007) of experiments were conducted at each of five locations in Mississippi to evaluate the effect of planting date (April 20, May 20, and June 20), and hybrid (DKF 3875, DKF 2990, DKF 3510, DKF 3901, PR 63 M 80, PR 62 A 91, PR 63 A 21, PR 63 M 91, and PR 64 H 41) on seed yield, oil content, and oil composition of sunflower. Seed oil concentration varied from 25 to 47 %. The oleic acid concentration in the oil was greater than 85 % for DKF 3510 and PR 64 H 41, above 65 % for PR 63 M 80 and PR 63 M 91, and intermediate for the other hybrids. Total saturated fatty acids (TSFA) concentration in the oil (the sum of palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids)</b> ranged from 6. 3 to 13. 0 %, with DKF 3510, PR 63 M 91, and PR 64 H 41 having lower concentration of TSFA than the other hybrids. Mean seed yields ranged from 997 to 2096 kg ha− 1 depending on location. Mean oil yields at the five locations ranged from 380 to 687 kg ha− 1, and calculated biodiesel production ranged from 304 to 550 kg ha− 1. Seed and oil yields in this study suggest sunflower in Mississippi should be planted by {{the last week of}} May. Later planting (20 June) may significantly decrease both seed and oil yields in the non-irrigated system in Mississippi and {{in other areas of the}} southeastern United States with similar environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|The total mycelial lipid of Aspergillus fumigatus was {{analysed}} {{and over}} half of its hexahydropolyprenol was shown to be esterified with fatty acids. Comparison of the fatty acid content of the prenyl esters with the sterol ester and the total lipid indicated a marked predominance of saturated fatty acids in the polyprenyl esters. The predominant acids esterified to the prenols were palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acid,</b> stearic acid and palmitoleic acid.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{synchrotron}} radiation to study organic monolayers on water ("Langmuir films"). At high monolayer pressures, lead stearate [Pb(C 17 H 35 COO) 2] shows a powder peak at 1. 60 - 1, implying an area per unit cell of 17. 8 2 if the lattice is triangular. The correlation length is about 250. <b>Lignoceric</b> <b>acid</b> (C 23 H 47 COOH) shows a similar peak {{even though no}} heavy ions are attached. When the pressure is reduced, the peak in lead stearate does not observably move or broaden; below the "knee" in the isotherm, however, the peak height decreases slowly with increasing area, implying a first-order melting transition. © 1987 The American Physical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The structure of Buddlejol (1) was established as (24 S) -stigmast- 5, 22 -diene- 7 beta-ethoxy- 3 beta-ol by spectral analysis and comparison with closely related structures. Buddlejol revealed to be a competitive inhibitor of chymotrypsin with the Ki value of 10. 60 A mu M as indicated by Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots and their re-plots against its chymotrypsin inhibition assay, while the other compounds showed less inhibitory potential. The bioassay-guided isolation was stimulated by the preliminary cytotoxic screening of various fractions of B. asiatica...|$|E
40|$|Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) has the {{potential}} to become a major source of biodiesel but for market viability, peanut oil yields must increase and specific quality requirements must be met. Oil yield in peanut is influenced by many components, including oil concentration, seed mass, and mean oil produced per seed. All of these traits can be improved through selection {{as long as there is}} sufficient genetic variation. Thus, elucidating the genetics of oil concentration, seed mass, and mean oil produced per seed in peanut is essential to advancing the development of genotypes with high oil yields. Additive genetic effects were predominant for oil concentration in two generation means analyses involving a proprietary high oil breeding line and additive genetic variance was highly significant in a complete four-parent diallel analysis. Genetic variance for weight of 50 sound mature kernels (50 SMK) and mean oil produced per SMK (OPS) was additive the diallel analysis. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were high for oil concentration in both the diallel and generation means analyses. Narrow-sense heritability was also high for 50 SMK, but was low for OPS. The low OPS heritability estimate was caused by the negative correlation between oil concentration and seed mass. Consequently, oil concentration and seed mass can be improved through early-generation selection, but large segregating populations from high oil crosses will be needed to identify progeny with elevated oil concentrations that maintain acceptable seed sizes. Increasing the ratio of oleic to linoleic acid (O/L) in peanut oil and reducing the long chain saturated fatty acid concentration (which includes arachidic, behenic, and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids)</b> produces high quality, stable methyl esters for biodiesel. Therefore, elucidating the inheritance of these factors and their relationships in peanut populations segregating for high oil is critical. The results from generation means analysis confirm that the high-oleic trait is under simple genetic control and can be manipulated through selection. Oil concentration was negatively correlated with oleic acid concentration in the F 2 generations of both crosses and positively correlated with arachidic acid in most of the segregating generations that were evaluated. Therefore, developing a peanut genotype high in oil and oleic acid concentration that has reduced long chain saturates will require the evaluation of large numbers of segregating progeny...|$|R
40|$|Horse gram [Macrotyloma uniflorum (Lam.) Verdc. ] seeds {{containing}} {{high concentrations}} of fatty acids, flavonols and minerals should provide government, public and private organizations with a nutritious and healthy food for use by malnourished and food deprived people worldwide. Seeds from seven horse gram accessions, geographically adapted to Griffin, GA, USA were analyzed for fatty acid, flavonol, and mineral concentrations using gas chromatography, reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, respectively. Significant year effects occurred for stearic, oleic, linoleic, arachidic, gadoleic, and <b>lignoceric</b> <b>acids.</b> Oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid ranged from 8. 9 %– 16. 8 %, 40. 3 %– 45. 6 %, and 11. 6 %– 14. 3 %, respectively, as percent of total fatty acids measured (total oil ranged from 2. 32 % to 2. 87 %). Seed concentrations of myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol ranged from 0 – 36 μg/g DW, 0 – 27 μg/g DW, and 240 – 316 μg/g DW, respectively and the only year effect was observed for kaempferol among the horse gram accessions. Year effects were found for Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, and S. Mean concentrations of macrominerals (Ca, K, Mg, P, and S) and microminerals (Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn) ranged from 1. 3 – 14 mg/g DW, and 1. 0 – 95. 0 μg/g DW, respectively. Several correlations were observed among several fatty acids, flavonols, and minerals. The mono-unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid correlated significantly with linoleic acid (r = − 0. 64), arachidic acid (r = − 0. 61), Ca (r = 0. 50) and Zn (r = 0. 51, all at P < 0. 01). The flavonol, myricetin correlated significantly with quercetin (r = 0. 92, P < 0. 0001), while quercetin correlated with Ca (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 0001) and kaempferol correlated with Mg (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 01). Several mineral correlations were found including Fe with K (r = 0. 66) and Mg (r = 0. 56, both at P < 0. 01).
