In this article we focus on the administrative and political contingencies of the introduction of the two charters in Belgium.

40|$|One simple {{phenomenon}} of electricity {{was known to}} the ancients: that when a piece of amber was rubbed, it acquired the property of attracting small pieces of paper and other light particles. Records show that Thales of Miletus (circa sixth century B. C.) knew of this property of amber; the Greek word for amber is elektron, hence the name electricity. There was practically no further development of this subject until about the seventeenth century.

In the eighteenth century {{it was found that}} there were two kinds of electricity, one similar to the kind acquired by amber when rubbed with wool, and the other similar to that acquired by glass when rubbed with silk, called resinous and vitreous electricity, respectively.

The {{concept of}} {{grounding}} {{refers to the}} intentional electrical connection with the earth, either from {{a part of the}} circuit (system grounding) or from metal parts that do not belong directly to it (equipment grounding). These ground connections must be sufficiently low impedance and ampacity to prevent the formation of dangerous voltages for people or connected equipment and to provide a path for the earth fault current to flow, Facilitate the operation of the protection devices to release the fault. On the other hand, lightning arrester systems must be capable of safely conducting ground current from lightning. The objective of the present work was to design the grounding system and <b>lightning</b> <b>rods</b> <b>for</b> a 500 kW solar complex located at the headquarters of the Technological Institute of Costa Rica. In addition, the development of a grounding guide for photovoltaic systems in the country. To achieve this, the design was based and adapted from the IEEE 80 standard, which corresponds to the design of grounding for alternating current substations. The fundamental parameters for obtaining ground designs are the ground resistivity and the maximum fault current. The first was measured with the Wenner method with a value of 98. 65 Ωm and the second was determined for the system as the short-circuit current for the PV array that was larger, in this case 103 A.

Each random walker moves from team to team by selecting a game and "voting" for its winner with probability p, tracing out a never-ending path motivated by the "my team beat your team" argument. We study the statistical properties of a collection of such walkers, relate the rankings to the community structure of the underlying network, and demonstrate the results for recent NCAA Division I-A seasons.

They stayed in position until nearly midnight when the order to retreat came. During the march over the Boston Mountains many of the men deserted to their homes. In April 1862, Colonel King wrote home to his mother and had this to say about the regiment, [...] "The fight at Prairie Grove notwithstanding. We whipped it proved to be a very disastrous one to us. My loss in the fight was a very heavy one. I lost one hundred and thirty two men, killed and wounded out of less than five hundred men. I still have a fine Regt. and am ready for another fight. We have a very fine army here and will move in a few days but where to I can’t tell." ...|$|E
40|$|Throughout their history, {{historically}} Black {{colleges and}} universities (HBCUs) have had to satisfy the aspirations of their students {{and the demands of}} a society that offers only limited support for HBCUs and limited opportunities for their graduates. In many ways, these institutions have done quite well. From the late nineteenth century through the mid twentieth century, historically Black {{colleges and universities}} enrolled more than 90 percent of African American postsecondary students educated in this country. From their humble origins through the 1950 s and 1960 s following the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision, HBCUs served as a key access point for African Americans who sought to achieve political and social mobility through educational attainment. Created as a byproduct of systemic social discrimination, historically Black colleges and universities prepared African American students for leadership positions, primarily within the African American community. Since {{the last part of the}} twentieth century, however, in the aftermath of desegregation, many HBCUs have suffered stagnant or declining enrollments. Reductions in the purchasing power of federal aid have been a major factor in this, as have reductions in the level of state support on a per-pupil basis. Faced with numerous obstacles, HBCUs have often been <b>lightning</b> <b>rods</b> <b>for</b> criticism. Opponents of the Black college model criticize the integrity of its academic programs, particularly in light of the challenges of a new millennium. The recurring question remains: is the need for historically Black colleges and universities as pressing today as was the case a century prior? If so, how might these institutions be adequately supported in their mission to educate African American students in the twenty-first century? This article argues that, despite the impediments they face, HBCUs continue to play a critical role today. They enroll 13 percent of Black undergraduate student...|$|R
40|$|Despite having {{undergone}} {{similar experiences}} of warfare and facing similar anxieties about the future, Germany and Japan evolved divergent responses to commemorating the Second World War {{over the course}} of the postwar period. This dissertation explores how different cultures and generational cohorts respond to the challenges of commemorating violent and traumatic pasts in response to shifting domestic concerns and to post-Cold War international geopolitical transformations. Four recently completed or revamped memorial sites form the backdrop of the discussion and provide insights into the politics of memory in postwar Germany and Japan: the Topography of Terror (2010) and the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (2005) in Berlin; and the Yûshûkan (2002) and the Shôwakan (1999) in Tokyo. Over the course of the 'memory boom' of the 1980 s and 1990 s, debates about both the architectural expression of a museum or monument and the contents to be exhibited within the confines of the museum became <b>lightning</b> <b>rods</b> <b>for</b> public perceptions about the past in the present. As an affectively-charged place within the urban fabric, the memorial site, consisting of its intermingling of image and text installed in a visual narrative unfolding in space, offers a unique perspective from which to explore the performative dimensions of national identity formation. A key question this dissertation seeks to answer is how individuals are affected by their encounters with images, captions, and media that constitute museal representations of past events - in short, how affective dynamics undergird and influence the visitor's aesthetic experience of memorial sites. Central to this relationship between aesthetics, affect, and experience manifested in museal display is authenticity. Through the lens of comparison, this dissertation contributes an understanding of how the curators, activists, trustees, and politicians involved with the fashioning of memorial sites use (and sometimes abuse) the discourse of authenticity to produce an experience of the past in line with a particular conception of national identity, and how visiting publics respond to these representations of the past...|$|R
