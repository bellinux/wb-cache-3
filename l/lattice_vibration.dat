2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Franck-Condon assumption, three other approximations are commonly assumed and are implicit in the figures. The first is that each lattice vibrational mode is well described by a quantum harmonic oscillator. This approximation is implied in the parabolic shape of the potential wells of Figure 2, and in the equal energy spacing between phonon energy levels. The second approximation is that only the lowest (zero-point) <b>lattice</b> <b>vibration</b> is excited. This is called the low temperature approximation and means that electronic transitions do not originate {{from any of the}} higher phonon levels. The third approximation is that the interaction between the chromophore and the lattice is the same in both the ground and the excited state. Specifically, the harmonic oscillator potential is equal in both states. This approximation, called linear coupling, is represented in Figure 2 by two equally shaped parabolic potentials and by equally spaced phonon energy levels in both the ground and excited states.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transition}} between {{the ground and}} the excited state is based on the Franck–Condon principle, that the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion in the lattice. The energy transitions can then be symbolized by vertical arrows between the ground and excited state, that is, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates during the transition. Figure 2 is an energy diagram for interpreting absorption and emission with and without phonons in terms of the configurational coordinate qi. The energy transitions originate at the lowest phonon energy level of the electronic states. As represented in the figure, the largest wavefunction overlap (and therefore largest transition probability) occurs when the photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the two electronic states (E1 – E0) plus three quanta of lattice mode i vibrational energy (...) [...] This three-phonon transition is mirrored in emission when the excited state quickly decays to its zero-point <b>lattice</b> <b>vibration</b> level by means of a radiationless process, and from there to the ground state via photon emission. The zero-phonon transition is depicted as having a lower wavefunction overlap and therefore a lower transition probability.|$|E

40|$|Photoexcited {{states are}} relaxed by {{transferring}} {{energy to the}} environments. In order to study which coupling allows fast energy transfer to <b>lattice</b> <b>vibrations</b> in correlated electron systems, we calculate the time evolutions of the kinetic energies of different types and frequencies of <b>lattice</b> <b>vibrations.</b> The one-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model is augmented with electron-lattice couplings that modulate transfer integrals, site energies, and Coulomb repulsion strengths. The time-dependent Schrödinger equation is solved for exact many-electron wave functions, and the classical equation of motion for the lattice displacements. In order to transfer energy to classical <b>lattice</b> <b>vibrations</b> that modulate transfer integrals or site energies, the translational invariance must be broken to give optical activity to an electronic excitation with wave number π and to these <b>lattice</b> <b>vibrations.</b> On the other hand, {{a certain amount of}} energy is always transferred to <b>lattice</b> <b>vibrations</b> that modulate Coulomb repulsion strengths, irrespective of the symmetry of the ground state, as long as the corresponding electron-lattice couplings are present. In strongly correlated electron systems, these couplings can be strong, although they are usually insignificant because their effects on the equilibrium properties can be absorbed into redefinition of Coulomb repulsion strengths. We will discuss competition or collaboration between energy transfer pathways through different types of electron-lattice couplings. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.
