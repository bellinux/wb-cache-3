50|$|The take-down lever {{is used to}} {{lock the}} slide back (as the Browning Hi-Power safety is used) during {{disassembly}} to allow removal of the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> In later variants, this lever is omitted and the slide must be manually aligned to remove the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> Once the slide and frame are aligned (by the disassembly lever or manually), the recoil guide is pulled forward to release the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{and allow it to}} drop free. The slide will then be free to run forward and be removed from the frame.|$|R

50|$|Below the cam in {{this photo}} (hidden) is a {{spring-loaded}} lever that pushes against a pin on the cam. On the upper {{edge of the}} cam, as shown, is a little projection that engages the <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> {{which is at the}} lowest part of the image; it's an irregular shape.|$|R
50|$|The FE's auto-exposure lock {{mechanism}} is activated by pushing {{and holding the}} timer shutter <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> toward the <b>lens</b> mount; even though the exposure is fixed {{to the state of}} the instant the lever is pushed, the black shutter speed needle in the viewfinder does not reflect this and moves freely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bottom of}} the camera {{contains}} the rewind knob <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> the rewind <b>release</b> button [...] and the rewind knob, which {{is also used to}} open the back. Printing on the bottom includes loading instructions, daylight exposure table, flash exposure table, (both based on ASA 10 film) and suggestions for common focus settings.|$|R
50|$|Empty {{magazines}} are released by depressing ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> {{incorporated into the}} trigger guard in all non M2 PPQ variants or by depressing a reversible thumb release push-button located behind {{the bottom of the}} trigger guard in the PPQ M2 variant. Additionally, the PPQ M2 {{magazines are}} not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, the A8 L {{received}} standard xenon high-intensity {{discharge lamp}} (HID) headlights, and a heated steering wheel. A tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS), an updated Symphony II stereo, and new exterior colours were also added. For 2002, all A8 variants received a trunk/boot interior <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> to facilitate escape {{in the event}} an individual became trapped within.|$|R
50|$|When a key {{is pressed}} down, it moves the <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> and unlatches the cam for that letter; the {{spring-loaded}} lever pressing on the pin rotates the cam until it engages the power roll. As the cam continues to turn, increasing radius rotates the cam's frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) {{to operate the}} typing linkage for that character.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to {{a wide selection of}} trigger/firing modes, the USP has an ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> that is shielded by the trigger guard from inadvertent actuation. The rear of the USP grip is stepped, and combines well with the tapered magazine to allow for rapid reloading. Finger recesses in the grip frame also aid in magazine removal. On 9 mm and [...]40 caliber USPs, magazines are constructed of polymer reinforced with stainless steel. Magazines on the USP [...]45 are all-metal. All USP magazines will drop free of the pistol frame when the magazine release is depressed. Also, the USP does not have a magazine lockout feature (also known as a magazine disconnector). Thus, it is possible to fire a chambered round even with the magazine removed. An extended slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> is positioned to allow easy operation without changing the grip of the shooting hand.|$|R
5000|$|As the cam {{continues}} to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushes on the pin {{to move it}} toward home position, but if the key is still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalls because the projection on the cam catches on {{another part of the}} <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> The cam stalls until the key is released. When <b>released,</b> the <b>lever</b> catches the projection so the cam is now in home position. This is like a simple clock escapement, and prevents repeated typing. (The [...] "key-down" [...] anti-repeat stop can be removed, so that fast repetitive typing can be done, but this change is difficult to undo.) ...|$|R
2500|$|The seat [...] tube {{contains}} the seatpost of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted into the seat tube. On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick <b>release</b> <b>lever.</b> The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|R
5000|$|... 4 - Minolta-35 (Model D)In 1949 {{at about}} serial no.10,000, a recess was {{introduced}} under the lens-mount to improve operating the lens focusing lever, and the rewind <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> was moved, {{placed under the}} frame counter. By now the film frame length has been increased to 34mm, and carrying strap eyelets has been added {{at either end of}} the camera body.|$|R

5000|$|The 300mm 4L IS USM <b>lens,</b> <b>released</b> in 1997, adds IS Mode 2, which detects whether panning {{is taking}} place {{horizontally}} or vertically, and only compensates for vibration in the plane perpendicular to the plane of panning.|$|R
50|$|The M1951 {{is fed from}} an 8-round {{detachable}} box magazine. A hold open device {{will keep}} the slide locked open after discharging the last cartridge from the magazine. The slide can then be released by depressing the slide <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> located {{on the left side}} of the frame. The pistol uses fixed iron sights set for engaging targets at 50 m. These consist of a forward blade and rear notch.|$|R
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers,</b> and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|R
50|$|There {{were several}} add-on <b>lenses</b> <b>released</b> for the Kodak DC20. These {{included}} a macro adapter, a telephoto converter, and a wide-angle converter from Tiffen. These were clip-on lenses since the original lens had no thread. There {{was also an}} add-on photo flash unit made by Kodak.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{generation of}} FD lenses featured a silver colored locking ring at the base. Only the locking ring turns {{to lock the}} lens to the camera body; the lens body remains stationary. The later New FD lenses have a black mount which includes a <b>lens</b> <b>release</b> button.|$|R
5000|$|... 4L IS USM <b>lens</b> was <b>released</b> in September 1999 (1,290,000 yen).|$|R
50|$|Age {{and size}} {{restrictions}} were often enforced. Children under 6 years old were refused entry, and children over 6 years old were refused entry without an accompanying adult. Pregnant women, and the infirm were also discouraged from boarding this ride. Hats and wigs were also prohibited, {{and due to}} an incident where a woman actually lost her wig on the ride, it became a long-standing custom for the operator to keep a woman's wig on the ride's main <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> as a humorous reminder.|$|R
50|$|The CPW {{is fully}} ambidextrous; {{it can be}} used with equal {{ergonomic}} ease by both right and left-handed shooters. Every single lever, control or toggle has been mirrored {{on the opposite side of}} the receiver - this includes the cocking handle, the fire control selector/manual safety switch (installed above the pistol grip) as well as the bolt <b>release</b> <b>lever,</b> which is used to slam the bolt closed after inserting a new magazine. The ejection port is located on the right side of the weapon.|$|R
50|$|The PPQ M2 is {{a variant}} {{introduced}} at the 2013 Shot Show by {{the newly formed}} Walther Arms Inc. It has the same features as the standard PPQ with the sole exception that the ambidextrous magazine <b>release</b> <b>levers</b> incorporated {{into the bottom of}} the trigger guard have been omitted and replaced by a thumb release push-button located behind the bottom of the trigger guard. For left-handed use the magazine release push-button is reversible.Additionally, the PPQ M2 magazines are not compatible with the original PPQ magazines.|$|R
50|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AK safety selector, some Vepr-12 shotguns have an ambidextrous safety that can be manipulated from {{either side of the}} receiver.An unusual feature among firearms in the Kalashnikov family, the Vepr-12 sports a last round bolt hold-open mechanism. That is, the bolt locks {{to the rear of the}} receiver after the last round has been ejected. To facilitate rapid reloading of the shotgun, a bolt <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> is located inside the trigger guard, allowing the user to release the bolt without breaking grip.|$|R
50|$|The slide stop <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> {{is located}} {{on the left side of}} the frame {{directly}} beneath the slide and can be manipulated by the thumb of the shooting hand for right handed shooters. When a cartridge is present in the chamber the pistol can be fired without the need of having a magazine inserted in the weapon. Walther does however offer a magazine disconnect as an optional safety on some PPS pistols that will prevent discharging the pistol without a magazine present in the pistol.|$|R
50|$|On the ILCE-QX1 itself {{there are}} buttons for on/off, flash pop-up, <b>lens</b> <b>release</b> and shutter. The camera module can be {{remote-controlled}} through an iOS or Android device, {{to which it}} connects through Wi-Fi. The ILCE-QX1 allows capture in RAW format, but RAW files can only be directly wirelessly transferred to Android devices, not, as of September 2014, to iOS.|$|R
25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine <b>release</b> <b>lever</b> (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. The firing pin and its bushing were also changed.|$|R
