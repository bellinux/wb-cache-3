Twenty HIV- 1 infected children with chronic pulmonary disease underwent open lung biopsy to define the diagnosis. Histological section of this material was submitted to nonisotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) using EBV-encoded RNA (EBER) 1 / 2 probes and TCD 4 +, TCD 8 +, and CD 20 + B-cell counts by immunohistochemistry. the histology of 16 out of the 20 children (median age 53. 5 months) proved to be examples of pulmonary <b>lymphoid</b> hyperplasia/lymphoid <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> (PLH/LIP) complex, 13 of which were EBER positive, but no significant association was found (Fisher exact test P = 0. 439). Four patients had non-LIP diseases (3, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; 1, diffuse advanced alveolar damage), two being EBER negative. Nineteen children showed a predominant T-CD 8 + cell response (CD 4 +/CD 8 + < 1) in lung tissue. the mean TCD 4 + and theTCD 4 /TCD 8 ratio in lung tissue were significantly higher in the sections with PLH/LIP complex, but without significant difference between EBER positive and EBER negative samples. EBV gene expression was detected {{in the majority of}} the lung samples but without significant association with PLH/LIP complex or with TCD 4 +, TCD 8 +, B cells and the TCD 4 +/TCD 8 + ratio. Regarding the pattern of lung disease in HIV- 1 infected children, associated or not to EBV, the findings are of importance concerning the possible role of EBV in the pathogenesis of PLH/LIP.

In most HIV-infected children the infection is acquired perinatally and the course of infection is more accelerated than in adults.

40|$|The main {{differences}} {{of the impact}} of HIV on childhood respiratory illness between developed and developing countries, and particularly some countries in Africa, are the scale of the problem and the lack of resources to address problems of prevention, diagnosis, and management. Recent data from HIV-infected African children are reviewed and show that the pattern of respiratory disease in these children is not markedly different to the pattern that was reported from the USA and Europe prior to the use of antiretroviral therapy and routine Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis for HIV-exposed infants. Bacterial pneumonia is very common in all age groups. PCP and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are especially common in infants, and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> (LIP) is common in older children. One difference is that pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is relatively more common in HIV-infected African children.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: As {{a result}} of the HIV {{epidemic}} in Africa, much debate exists on whether institutionalized compared with community-based care provides optimum management of infected children. Previous reports calculated 89 % mortality by age 3 years among outpatients in Malawi. No similar data are available for infected children in institutionalized care. We characterized patterns of morbidity and mortality among HIV- 1 -infected children residing at an orphanage in Nairobi. METHODS: Medical records for 174 children followed over 5 years were reviewed. Mortality was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier methods with adjustment to account for survival in the community before admission. Anthropometric indices were calculated to include mean z scores for weight for length and length for age. Low indices reflected wasting and stunting. Opportunistic infections were documented. RESULTS: Of 174 children, 64 had died. Survival was 70 % at age 3 years. Morbidity included recurrent respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, parotitis, and <b>lymphoid</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis.</b> No new cases of tuberculosis disease were noted after admission. Mean z scores for length for age suggested overall stunting (z = - 1. 65). Wasting was not observed (z = - 0. 39). CONCLUSION: The optimal form of care for HIV-infected children in resource-poor settings may be the development of similar homes. Absence of tuberculosis disease in long-standing residents may have contributed to improved survival.

40|$|Sixteen human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) —seropositive children aged 5 to 12 years (nine girls and seven boys), born to HIV- 1 —infected mothers, were diagnosed between 1984 and 1987 in Kigali, Rwanda. They were compared {{with a group of}} age- and sex-matched HIV- 1 —sero-negative children consecutively selected from the outpatient department. Two subjects were asymptomatic. Chronic cough was the most frequent symptom (seven of 16 patients). The most common signs were short stature (12 of 16 patients), low weight for age (seven of 16 patients), chronic parotitis (eight of 16 patients), persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (seven of 16 patients), and pulmonary tuberculosis (four of 16 patients). <b>Lymphoid</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> was diagnosed on radiologic grounds in five of 16 patients. Evidence of perivasculitis in the fundus was noted in three of 16 patients. Two children died during the study period (mean duration of follow-up, 40 months; range, 27 to 62 months); none of the other children had life-threatening infection or loss of developmental milestones. Immunologic assessment in the 16 children revealed high levels of IgG, decreased CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio, and skin test anergy. Endocrinologic investigations revealed normal thyroid function and normal basal human growth hormone levels but low basal insulinlike growth factor I levels (0. 21 ± 0. 07 vs 0. 44 ± 0. 20 U/mL for controls). In Kigali, perinatally HIV- 1 —infected children surviving beyond 5 years of age often present with moderate signs and symptoms, principally pulmonary involvement, chronic parotitis, and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy.

We studied 1887 children born to HIV- 1 -seropositive mothers. 1045 were identified at birth and the others were registered later (median age 4. 8 [range 0. 4 - 72] months). HIV- 1 -associated signs developed in 433 (81. 8 %) of 529 seropositive infected children at a median age of 5 (0. 03 - 84) months. These signs appeared significantly earlier in the 102 children who died of HIV- 1 -related illness than in those who are still alive (median 3 [0. 03 - 55] vs 6 [0. 03 - 84] months; p less than 0. 001). The cumulative proportion surviving at age 9 years was 49. 5 % (95 % confidence interval 27 - 65 %) and the median survival time was 96. 2 months. Separate analysis of the 112 seropositive infected children followed from birth and older than 15 months gave similar results.

At presentation 49 patients (group 1) were thought to have a history, findings at clinical examination, chest radiograph, and arterial blood gas tensions typical of pneumocystis pneumonia, and empirical treatment was begun immediately. Twenty four patients (group 2) were thought to have features not typical of pneumocystis pneumonia. All patients were subsequently referred for bronchoscopy to determine the diagnosis. In group 1 four patients {{were excluded from the}} analysis because bronchoscopy was not possible. Of the remaining 45, 42 had pneumocystis pneumonia, which was diagnosed at bronchoscopy in 40, and {{on the basis of the}} clinical response to co-trimoxazole in two who had negative results from investigations. Of the three patients without pneumocystis pneumonia, one patient with <b>lymphoid</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> and Branhamella catarrhalis infection would have failed to respond to empirical treatment.

In group 2 a specific diagnosis was made at bronchoscopy in 21 cases, including pneumocystis pneumonia in seven (all had atypical chest radiographs). In three cases no diagnosis was made and spontaneous recovery occurred. Adopting an empirical approach to treatment for typical pneumocystis pneumonia (group 1) led to the correct treatment in 43 of 45 cases (95 %) and would have saved 44 of the 45 of bronchoscopies in this group. Adopting an empirical approach would have caused one patient to be misdiagnosed as having AIDS.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Respiratory {{diseases}} minimize {{gas exchange}} at the alveoli and complicate {{the mechanics of}} breathing. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is capable of sampling {{the components of the}} alveolar epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and determining the composition of the pulmonary airways. Comprehensively profiling the proteomic landscape of BALF provides a means to understanding basic pathogenic mechanisms with the potential to develop techniques for early diagnosis in diseases concerned with lung function. Combining shotgun proteomic analysis with computational methods is a powerful approach to generate large and integrated sets of data independent of investigator's biases. This integrative methodology identifies distinct protein signatures that could be utilized as diagnostic classifiers, provide insights into the pathogenesis of lung disorder, and elucidate unsuspected mediators or pathways indicative of lung diseases. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is defined as pneumonia occurring after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. VAP affects 8 - 28 % of patients receiving mechanical ventilation and has a mortality rate ranging from 24 % to as high as 76 % in certain settings. Clinical diagnosis of VAP is challenging since the classic symptoms of pneumonia, i. e., fever, abnormal radiographs, and elevated blood cell counts are not specific for VAP among ventilated patients. Inaccurate diagnosis of VAP leads to incorrect treatment and subsequent complications related to therapy. Additionally, the lung is an important reservoir of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and site of HIV replication. HIV is uniformly detected in alveolar macrophages of pediatric patients and in the majority of adult patients. In addition to the numerous opportunistic infections that affect the lung, HIV directly causes significant pulmonary pathology, including <b>lymphoid</b> <b>interstitial</b> <b>pneumonitis</b> (LIP), nonspecific pneumonitis (NSIP), or lymphocytic alveolitis. LIP occurs in up to 75 % of the pediatric population. Most HIV-infected adults develop an asymptomatic lymphocytic alveolitis, which can progress to NSIP or LIP. There is strong evidence that HIV itself evokes a local immune response that facilitates lymphocytic migration and infiltration in the lung. The pathogenesis of non-infectious pulmonary complications, following HIV infection is not fully understood. Protein profiles of BALF were determined in populations of normal, HIV and ALI (VAP+/-) volunteers. Comparative analysis identified a set of protein signatures specific to disease states. A limited protein classifier was identified and validated in the VAP study which may aid in future diagnostic endeavors. In addition, the protein profiles distinctive to HIV suggest a role that HIV-induced immunosuppression plays in the development of lung complications...|$|E
