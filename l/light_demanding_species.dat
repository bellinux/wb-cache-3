Tree height determines the position in the forest canopy and access to light, while the amount and spatial distribution of the foliage depend on the depth and {{the width of the}} crown. The aim {{of this study is to}} understand how tree architecture varies across coexisting tropical tree species and relates to ecological strategies. Forty five coexisting tree species were sampled in the semi-deciduous forests of Northern Congo. Species were classified according to ecological strategies, specifically regeneration guilds: shade bearers (27 <b>species),</b> non-pioneers <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> (14 <b>species)</b> and pioneers (4 species). For each species, 14 – 72 trees (968 trees in total) were measured over a large range of diameter (10 – 162 cm). At the tree level, we measured the diameter (D in cm), height (H in m), crown radius (Cr in m) and crown depth (Cd in m) and crown exposure index (CEI) was visually estimated. At species level, architectural traits were estimated at juvenile tree with diameter of 10 cm (H 10, Cr 10 and Cd 10) and at adult stature with maximum diameter (Hmax, Crmax and Cdmax), life history traits (dispersal mode, phenology and regeneration guild) and functional traits (wood density and light requirement) were obtained. Our results showed a significant variation in tree allometry between coexisting species.

30|$|In forest communities, the {{invasion}} levels by exotic species {{depend on the}} integrity of the canopy cover whereby forests with many and relatively large canopy gaps are readily invaded. This is because invasive species establish and grow rapidly in large canopy gaps and along forest margins (Geldenhuys 2004). Some forest sites experiencing branch or tree falls that are small in nature have shown to be sufficient to allow low <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> tree invasive <b>species</b> to grow to the canopy (van Wyk et al. 1996). Canopy gaps facilitate the coexistence of large numbers of species because they remove barriers of dispersal and recruitment while advancing the growth of early-successional species which are suppressed under the forest canopy (Lawes et al. 2004). Forest edges that are dense and forest canopies that are closed often create physical barriers for <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> IAPs and limit their dispersal pathways (Hansen and Clevenger 2005). Late-successional species are lost through disturbance regimes that cause canopy gaps, leading to the establishment of light-demanding pioneer species which are adapted to colonising new disturbed sites (Lawes et al. 2004). Furthermore, IAPs are likely to become dominant near forest paths because of the physical disturbance of the soil and vegetation which increases light conditions and this favours the growth of IAPs (Hansen and Clevenger 2005).|$|R
40|$|Plantations {{of exotic}} {{conifers}} on ancient woodland sites retain many features of high conservation value {{and in many}} countries such sites are being actively restored. Clear-felling of the conifer trees is often a straight-forward first step, but recent guidance on restoration advocates gradual removal of the plantation crop to protect vulnerable woodland specialist plants. To date {{there has been little}} empirical evidence to support this policy. One hundred and four stands in 39 woodland sites in the UK owned by the Woodland Trust from Cornwall to Invernesshire were surveyed in 2001 and again in 2009 to assess the survival of woodland flora following restoration by both clear-felling and gradual removal of the plantation crop. On average, there were over seven woodland specialist and ancient woodland indicator species in each of the stands surveyed. Loss of specialist woodland species â the most shade adapted component of the flora â over this time period was strongly correlated with the degree of canopy opening. In contrast, the loss of more <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> plant <b>species</b> was not related to the intensity of tree removals. This study suggests that a careful assessment and prioritisation of conservation values is needed before restoration.

This paper investigates the current tree composition of natural regeneration after repeated forest fires, regeneration process after repeated fires, and strategy of secondary growth related to ecological restoration issues. Re-observation of the 1. 8 hectares permanent plot in Samboja Research Forest was conducted in 2011. All trees with diameters above 10 cm at breast height (DBH) were re-numbered and mapped. Herbarium specimen was collected for species identification. Number of taxon was determined, Important Value Index was calculated, species trait of light response was identified based on the references and dispersion index species was calculated. Results show after twenty eight years initial forest fire, 191 species naturally regenerated in the burnt area. Macaranga gigantea, a <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> pioneer <b>species</b> of Euphorbiaceae was the most dominant species, followed by Vernonia arborea belonging to Asteraceae.

It was analyzed {{the structure of the}} stratum and natural regeneration under canopy and in open area surrounding a water spring under process of recovery, located in Nazareno, Minas Gerais. The tree stratum was assessed in 4 permanent plots (10 × 50 m), sampling, identifying and measuring height of trees with DBH  5 cm diameter. For assessing the natural regeneration, 16 plots (10 × 2 m) were set. Trees with height> 10 cm and DBH < 5 cm were identified and measured. The samples were established at 7 and 51 months after the isolation of the area. Phytosociological parameters of the tree and regenerative strata were calculated for each species, classifying them by the type of dispersal and ecological group. Shannon diversity index and evenness were calculated for each community which were also compared by Sorensen index. The results showed that the areas are dissimilar, with most species found at the regeneration under canopy, showing a intake in the system. The communities had a high proportion of zoochoric species and pattern of higher <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> climax <b>species</b> and a decrease in the proportion of pioneer species from one inventory to another, indicating progress in natural succession.

At species level, architectural traits (Dmax, Hmax, Crmax and Cdmax), life history traits (dispersal mode, phenology and guild) and functional traits (wood density and light requirement) were obtained. We investigates the H-D, Cr-D and Cd-D allometric relationships at the tree level using linear mixed models on log-transformed data with species as a random effect on both slope and intercept. We used the multivariate analysis to quantify the relationship between architectural, functional traits and life history traits. Based on AIC, we found that the best linear mixed model was the one with two species random parameters (intercept and slope) for H-D and Cr-D allometries, while the best model for Cd-D allometry was the one with only a random intercept. Thus, our results showed a significant variation in tree allometry between coexisting species. The interspecific variation in H-D allometry was related to light requirement while Cr-D and Cd-D allometries were more related to dispersal mode and wood density, respectively.

The aim was to examine to which extent shade-tolerant species variate in their crown architecture. Tree saplings (265) between 50 and 300 cm height, and distributed from understorey to variously-sized canopy gaps, were measured for 13 architectural traits in the lowland rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, México. The analysis showed that the three species changed their architecture as light increased but in a different way. No species conformed to the typical wide-crown type expected for shade-tolerant species, and in contrast they presented some traits of <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species.</b> The two sub-canopy species tended to adopt a crown form between a narrow- and wide-crown type, and the mid-canopy species showed more traits of a narrow-crown type.

This study evaluates the three premises underlying the light partitioning hypothesis; 1) there is a gradient in light availability at the forest floor, 2) tree species show a differential distribution with respect to light, and 3) there is a trade-off in species performance that explains their different positions along the light gradient. To address these premises, we studied the light environment, growth, and survival of saplings of ten non-pioneer tree species in a Bolivian moist forest. Light availability in the understorey was relatively high, with a mean canopy openness of 3. 5 % and a mean direct site factor of 6. 8 %. Saplings of two <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species</b> occurred at significantly higher light levels than the shade tolerant species. The proportion of saplings in low-light conditions was negatively correlated with the successional position of the species. Light-demanding species were characterised by a low share of their saplings in low-light conditions, a high sapling mortality, a fast height growth and a strong growth response to light. These data show that all three premises for light partitioning are met.

40|$|In {{this opinion}} paper we {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} forest management on animal and plant biodiversity by comparing protected areas with intensively and extensively managed forests in Germany and in Romania. We {{want to know the}} extent to which differences in diversity of Romanian compared to German forests are based on management. The number of tree species was not different in protected and managed forests ranging between 1. 8 and 2. 6 species per plot in Germany and 1. 3 and 4. 0 in Romania. Also herbaceous species were independent of management, ranging between 13 species per plot in protected forests of Romania and 38 species per plot in German coniferous forest. Coarse woody debris was generally low, also in protected forests (14 to 39 m 3 ha − 1). The main difference between Romania and Germany was the volume of standing dead trees (9 to 28 m 3 ha − 1 for Romania), which resulted in larger numbers of forest relict saproxylic beetles independent of management. Large predators (wolves, bears and lynxes) are only found in regions with low human intervention. Thus, we identified a "cut and leave" type of management in Romania, in which clear-felling of forest are followed by long periods of no human intervention. Forests managed in the "cut and leave" mode contained the highest diversity, due to a natural succession of plant species and due to habitat continuity for animals. In Germany intensive management eliminates poorly formed tree individual and species of low market value during stand development. Forest protection does not ensure the maintenance of more <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> key <b>species</b> of earlier stages of succession unless competition by shade-tolerant competitors is reduced through disturbances. We compare the economics of intensive and extensive management. The "cut and leave" mode delivers less wood to the wood market, but saves expenses of tending, thinning and administration. Thus the net income could be quite similar to intensive management at a higher level of biodiversity. Our analysis suggests that forest protection per se does not yet ensure the maintenance of species. Clear-felling followed by natural succession may even be superior to the protection of old growth forests, regarding biodiversity. Further research is needed to substantiate this hypothesis...|$|R

The species occurs mainly on well-drained calcareous soils (rendzina type) and on clayey soils (marl) with or without periodically stagnant water. Climate change scenarios indicate that in the future the climatic requirements of wild service tree can be expected to match essentially all of Germany (Figure 2). Already now, Denmark is located within the potential climatic range of wild service tree.

40|$|Structural {{diversity}} {{is one of}} the most interesting phenomena that have been studied by forest ecologists and practitioners. Amongst the different characteristics of forest structure, spatial diversity of trees and their attributes seem to be very important The more spatially structured a population is, the higher its diversity in terms of size and species richness. Because most forests in Europe are managed and were artificially established, they are subjected to conversion processes turning them into more complex systems. The approach presented here aims at elucidating whether natural processes, such as self-thinning, can cause the self-differentiation of spatial structure in artificially planted stands. Our analyses focused on untended Scots pine and pedunculate oak stands in the juvenile phase of development and were based on spatially explicit structural indices for positioning and size differentiation (diameter, total height and crown length). The obtained results indicate that live trees were dispersed more or less regularly. Unlike the anglebased index, which mostly indicated randomness in tree location, a distance-based index showed clear regularity. We also found that the distribution of tree attributes auto-correlates to tree location as indicated by significantly tower index values compared to values resulting from random reassignment of the examined attributes. This low degree of spatial differentiation is further confirmed by the distribution of indices in differentiation classes. Our results allow us to conclude that, in the case of <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species</b> (pine and oak.), natural processes do not increase spatial diversity of the stand, although, both species showed a certain degree of deviation in this respect...|$|E
40|$|Within highly {{fragmented}} forest landscapes, the flux of matter, energy and species from the landscape matrix {{into the forest}} fragment interior is an important ecological phenomenon. We studied the invasion of ancient forest edges by weedy plant species, which are normally confined to the agricultural landscape matrix. We related this to edge orientation and to the occurrence of natural and anthropogenical environmental edge gradients like microclimate and soil chemistry. The plant community composition of the forest edge zone differed significantly from the community composition of the forest core area, and {{is characterized by a}} relatively high number of competitive and <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species.</b> The maximal width of this edge zone is more extensive at south facing (maximum ca. 20 - 23 in) than at north facing edges (ca. 0 - 3 in). However, most of the weedy plant species were unable to penetrate the forest and were confined to the boundary between forest and arable land. We found no negative edge effects on the more stress tolerant 'true' forest species going further than 0 - 3 m (only at south facing edges). The invasion pattern generally fitted the edge gradient for photo synthetic ally active radiation (PAR). The negative effects of fertilizer misplacement from adjacent arable land on forest soil chemistry (and community composition) are also restricted to the boundary of the forest edge zone. Based on the derived penetration distances of the edge effects and on the shape index of a forest patch it is possible to derive the minimal required forest patch area for forest plant species conservation.

We focused on the colonization ability of forest plant species and particularly on so-called ancient forest plant species. Major constraints for ecological forest restoration are the spatial characteristics of the target site (isolation, shape and area), imposing dispersal limitations, and in the duration and intensity of the historical land use, leading to changes in habitat characteristics influencing recruitment probability. We reviewed the ecological literature with respect to these constraints and conclude that it takes at least a century to restore the understorey layer of recent forests, even when the target stand is adjacent to a well-developed ancient forest. Both recruitment and dispersal limitation of the target species are responsible for this. Newly established forests should therefore be situated at a minimal distance of the ancient forest source. In other cases, forest plant species {{will not be able to}} colonize the newly established forest on a measurable time scale and artificial introduction of forest plant species can be taken into consideration. The negative effects of habitat characteristics, and mainly high soil nutrient values in the recent forest stand can be mitigated by soil nutrient lowering measures. Disturbances in the recent forest should be minimized to maintain a high canopy closure level, preventing <b>light</b> <b>demanding,</b> high competitive <b>species</b> from establishing a stable population. An additional negative consequence of soil disturbances is that it stimulates germination of species from the soil seed bank, which is mainly composed of highly competitive or ruderal species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Leaf {{developmental}} {{patterns were}} characterized for three tropical tree species with delayed greening. Changes in the pigment contents, photosynthetic capacity, stomata development, photosystem 2 efficiency, rate of energy dissipation, and {{the activity of}} partial protective enzymes were followed in developing leaves {{in an attempt to}} elucidate the relative importance of various photoprotective mechanisms during leaf ontogeny. Big leaves of Anthocephalus chinensis, a fast-growing <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species,</b> expanded following an exponential pattern, while relatively small leaves of two shade-tolerant species Litsea pierrei and Litsea dilleniifolia followed a sigmoidal pattern. The juvenile leaves of A. chinensis and L. pierrei contained anthocyanin located below the upper epidermis, while L. dilleniifolia did not contain anthocyanin. Leaves of A. chinensis required about 12 d for full leaf expansion (FLE) and photosynthetic development was delayed 4 d, while L. pierrei and L. dilleniifolia required 18 or 25 d for FLE and photosynthetic development was delayed 10 or 15 d, respectively. During the leaf development the increase in maximum net photosynthetic rate was significantly related to changes in stomatal conductance and the leaf maturation period was positively related to the steady-state leaf dry mass per area for the three studied species. Dark respiration rate of leaves at developing stages was greater, and pre-dawn initial photochemical efficiency was lower than that of mature leaves. Young leaves displayed greater energy dissipation than mature leaves, but nevertheless, the diurnal photoinhibition of young L. dilleniifolia leaves was higher than that of mature leaves. The young red leaves of A. chinensis and L. pierrei with high anthocyanin contents and similar diurnal photoinhibition contained more protective enzymes (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase) than mature leaves. Consequently, red leaves may have higher antioxidant ability...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} for combining timber and {{non-timber forest product}} extraction has been examined {{in the context of}} diversified forest management. Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation. Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species</b> that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the {{potential for}} enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests...|$|E
40|$|The Caledonian pinewoods of {{northern}} Scotland are a priority conservation habitat in Europe which {{are dominated by}} Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), but varying proportions {{of a number of}} broadleaved species such as silver birch (Betula pendula) can occur in these forests. Better understanding of the dynamics of mixed Scots pine-birch stands would be helpful in informing current initiatives to restore and increase the area of the pinewood ecosystem. Some evidence is provided by two experiments established in the 1960 s which compared plots of pure Scots pine and pure birch with two treatments where the two species were mixed in 3 : 1 and 1 : 1 ratios. Some fifty years later, Scots pine was the more vigorous of the two species in these experiments, being both taller and significantly larger in diameter. The highest basal area was generally found in the pure Scots pine plots and the values in the mixed plots tended to be intermediate between those of the two component species. Examination of the growth in the mixed plots showed a slight, but non-significant, tendency towards overyielding. This appeared to be due to Scots pine growth being better than predicted, while that of birch was slightly less than predicted. These results suggest that in these mixtures, which are composed of two <b>light</b> <b>demanding</b> <b>species,</b> the main mechanism driving long-term performance is competition for light and there is little evidence of any complementary effect. These results suggest that any strategy seeking to increase the long-term representation of broadleaves such as birch in the Caledonian pinewoods will need to create discrete blocks that are large enough to withstand the competitive pressures exerted by the pine...|$|E
