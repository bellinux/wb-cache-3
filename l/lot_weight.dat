They were costly because of the widespread trade in them, including to Turkey and India. The next most important mount, when traveling through Persia, was the mule.

40|$|Troncoso, JL (reprint author), Univ Talca, Fac Ciencias Agr, Dept Agr Econ, Casilla 747, Talca, Chile. Factors that {{influence}} the price of cattle in livestock auctions: {{the case of the}} stockyard of Melipilla (Chile). Cien. Inv. Agr. 39 (1) : 37 - 45. This study aims to weigh the influence of observable traits on live cattle prices, i. e., the percent impact on the final price of various physical characteristics. These characteristics are those that commonly are published in auction catalogues, as is the case of average <b>lot</b> <b>weight,</b> lot size, age, breed and corporal condition. In addition, the influence of seasonality and business cycles were also explored. Using the data collected from the records of El Tattersall S. A., a hedonic price function was fitted. The results showed that the most influential variables with respect to the price of beef cattle, in decreasing order, are as follows: 'condition', 'breed', 'quarter of sale' and 'year', which are followed far behind by 'lot size' and 'average weight'. The market pays a premium for Red Friesians, Crossbreds and Herefords and punishes the price of Holstein Friesians. Additionally, higher prices are paid in the last two quarters of the year than in the first two, and the third quarter is preferable to the fourth. Finally, the average <b>lot</b> <b>weight</b> and lot size are variables that have a positive, but small, influence on the price of cattle...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. wool {{industry}} has long received lower prices for comparable wool types {{than those of}} Australia. In order to better understand such price differences, economic evaluations of both the U. S. and Australian wool markets were conducted. This research focused on two primary objectives. The first objective was to determine what price differences existed between the Australian and U. S. wool markets and measure that difference. The second objective was to calculate price differences attributable to wool characteristics, {{as well as those}} resulting from regional, seasonal, and yearly differences. In order to accomplish the objectives, the study was set up into three different hedonic pricing models: U. S., Australian, and combined. In the U. S. model, there were significant price differences in season, year, region, level of preparation, and wool description. In addition, average fiber diameter (AFD) had a negative nonlinear relationship with price and <b>lot</b> <b>weight</b> had a positive linear relationship with price. The Australian model was notably different than the U. S. model in that there were only three variables. The yearly variable follows the same general pattern as the U. S. data but with a smaller span of difference. The seasonal price differences were distinctly different than the U. S. because of the difference in seasonal patterns. In addition, the AFD had a similar negative nonlinear relationship with price. The final model combines both the U. S. data and the Australian data. The combined model had only three variables: season, year, AFD and country. As {{in the case of the}} previous two models, AFD had the same negative nonlinear relationship and similar price elasticity. Overall, there was a - 30. 5 percent discount for U. S. wool when compared to Australian wool. This can be attributed to several different factors. One of which is that the Australian {{wool industry}} has a more extensive marketing scheme when compared to the U. S wool market as a whole. However, this is only a beginning to future research that needs to be conducted. Continuing this study for future years, having more descriptive categories, and additional countries would further add explanation to wool prices...|$|E

40|$|Selection {{objectives}} and criteria were defined and appraised {{for a simple}} production system involving a New Zealand Romney breeding flock under North Island hill country conditions, in which all surplus offspring are sold as lambs. Through the availability of New Zealand Wool Board auction data for the seasons 1976 / 77 to 1980 / 81, the influence of wool quality traits on price was analysed by regression techniques. Traits examined included mean fibre diameter (MFD), style(S), mean length (ML) and yield (Y). For the 1980 / 81 season only, further data from the Coded Sales Assistance Report (C. S. A. R.) was available for scouring indicator (SI), colour indicator (CI), felted (F), pen stain (P), cotted (Co), tender (T), mixed length (LV) and mixed quality (QV). In addition, the effects on price of three non-fleece variables, <b>lot</b> <b>weight</b> (LW), mode of offering (MO) and New Zealand Wool Board market intervention policies (Int), were considered. Y was shown {{to have a major}} influence over greasy price. The relationship between price and ML was confirmed as being non-linear, with ML having a greater effect on the price of shorter wools. S and MFD were less influential. The control these four traits jointly exerted over greasy price ranged up to 74. 0 %, which was further enhanced by the introduction of quadratic terms. ML 2 was the most important quadratic term. The inclusion of the C. S. A. R. and non-fleece related traits, failed to provide any further control over price. CI proved to be an effective substitute for S. Selection objectives were defined for greasy and clean wool, combined with short, long and mixed length categories. Economic weights for wool quality traits were directly calculated from the regression of auction price on the level of the traits. Economic weights for number of lambs weaned (NLW), weaning weight (WW), ewe body weight (EBW), greasy fleece weight (GFW) and clean fleece weight (CFW) were calculated using the marginal profit method. The relativities between the calculated economic weights were generally in good agreement with those of previously published estimates. For the selection objectives defined, various selection criteria were appraised. These included the traits in the selection objective, or their respective criteria, as well as hogget body weight (HBW), quality number (QN) and fleece character grade (CHG). NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW were of major importance in the selection index. The remaining traits were of only minimal value. On the basis of cost of measurement and value within the index, the full index was converted to a reduced index of NLW (dam), HBW and HGFW. In terms of accuracy of prediction and economy, this index was considered suitable for most commercial conditions. Further reduced indices were computed which generated less overall genetic gain, but which individual breeders may consider more appropriate to their particular requirements. Sensitivity analyses for HBW, NLW, GFW (CFW) and SC generally produced few changes of any consequence to the selection indices. Restriction of all genetic change in EBW significantly reduced the expected overall genetic gain...|$|E
