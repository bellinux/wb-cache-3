50|$|Out of the commission's various proposals, the Red Line {{was taken}} up with the most enthusiasm by area officials. Progress was slowed by a debate between state Secretary of Transportation Robert Flanagan on one side, and the Baltimore City {{government}} and Congressional delegation on the other over the mode: Flanagan favored a bus rapid transit (BRT) solution with separate right-of-way components like Boston's Silver Line, while the other officials favored a <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line or heavy rail and insisted that both modes of rail transit be included in studies.|$|E

50|$|The Rochester Industrial and Rapid Transit Railway , more {{commonly}} known as the Rochester Subway was a <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> line in the city of Rochester, New York from 1927 to 1956. The subway was constructed in the bed of the old Erie Canal, which allowed the route to be grade-separated for its entire length. Two miles (3.2 km) of the route through downtown were constructed in a cut-and-cover tunnel that became Broad Street, and the only underground portion of the subway. The Rochester Subway was designed to funnel interurban traffic off of city streets, and to facilitate freight interchange between the railroads. The line was operated on a contract basis by New York State Railways until Rochester Transit Corporation (RTC) took over in 1938. The last day of passenger service was June 30, 1956. Portions of the right-of-way were used for expressway construction, while the rest was abandoned and filled in over the years. The largest remaining section is a stretch of underground tunnel under Broad Street from Exchange Street to the intersection of Court Street and South Avenue.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} heavy rail and three <b>light</b> <b>rail</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> systems {{operating}} in Canada. The Toronto subway {{was the first}} rapid transit system in Canada when it opened a 12-station line in 1954. It has since grown to encompass three heavy rail lines and one intermediate rail line and has the most number of stations of any system in Canada with 69. Construction has begun on the Eglinton Crosstown Line and the Toronto-York Spadina Subway Extension, which will add 28 new stations {{and a total of}} 27.6 km of new track. Montreal introduced the Montreal Metro in 1966 and has now become the most popular rapid transit system in the country with 1,263,800 daily riders. The Vancouver SkyTrain, an automated guided line, was opened in January 1986 for the Expo 86 world fair and is the longest rapid transit system in Canada with a system length of 79.6 km. There are three light rail systems operating in Canada including systems in Calgary (the CTrain), Edmonton (the Edmonton LRT), and Ottawa (the O-train). There is one light rail system under construction in Kitchener-Waterloo named Ion rapid transit.|$|E
30|$|Transportation {{influences}} {{the form of}} cities and their livability, their economic, social, and environmental characteristics. The increasing transportation demand creates more and more mobility-related problems. Most of the big cities are facing the problem of traffic congestion [1, 2, 3, 4]. As urban transit has great possibilities for reducing traffic congestion, offering alternative transportation modes, and contributing greatly {{to the quality of}} urban life, urban transit system (bus system, rail transit system, and mass transit system) has begun to grow [5, 6]. The set of urban rail systems can be roughly subdivided into the tram, <b>light</b> <b>rail,</b> <b>rapid</b> <b>transit</b> (underground, subway, metro), monorail, commuter rail, and other types such as rail-guided buses in Nancy, France [7].|$|E
