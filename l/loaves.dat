5|$|Angel's {{developed}} the only production line in Israel {{with the capacity}} to produce 3,300 <b>loaves</b> of bread per hour. Thirteen other bread production lines in its various plants each yield over 2,000 <b>loaves</b> per hour. One production line in Jerusalem {{has the capacity to}} turn out 10,000 pitas in three hours. On each day of the eight-day Hanukkah festival, the Jerusalem plant also fries up 250,000 sufganiyot, the jelly-filled doughnut favored by Israelis at this season.|$|E
5|$|Expert bakers {{who arrived}} among the {{immigrants}} from Eastern and Central Europe in the 1920s and 30s introduced handmade sourdough breads. From the 1950s, mass-produced bread replaced these <b>loaves</b> and standard, government subsidized <b>loaves</b> known as leḥem aḥid became mostly available until the 1980s, when specialized bakeries again began producing rich sourdough breads in the European tradition, and breads in a Mediterranean style with accents such as olives, cheese, herbs or sun-dried tomatoes. A large variety of breads {{is now available}} from bakeries and cafes.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{improved}} the bread-making operation by introducing Israel's first automated weighing machines and investing in new production lines. He often slept overnight at the bakery {{during the week}} {{and returned to his}} home in Talpiot when the bakery was closed on Shabbat. Later he built an apartment over the bakery to house his family. In the 1930s, the bakery employed 25 workers and had one production line that turned out 8,500 <b>loaves</b> per day. It delivered bread to stores in two trucks and a horse and wagon. During World War II, the bakery contracted to supply bread to the British army, necessitating the purchase of large American-made ovens that could turn out 540 <b>loaves</b> per hour.|$|E
50|$|Pimiento <b>loaf,</b> also {{commonly}} spelled pimento <b>loaf,</b> {{also called}} pickle and pimiento <b>loaf</b> or P&P <b>loaf,</b> is a loaf-type luncheon meat containing finely chopped beef and pork, {{as well as}} chopped pickles and pimientos. After being formed into a <b>loaf</b> and cooked, the <b>loaf</b> is kept whole {{so it can be}} sliced and served cold as deli meat. Pimento <b>loaf</b> is closely related to olive <b>loaf</b> (the primary difference being pimentos and pickles replacing pimento-stuffed olives) and spiced luncheon <b>loaf.</b> It is distantly related to ham and cheese <b>loaf.</b>|$|R

5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 <b>loaves</b> of bread a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils {{used in the}} orphanage, and a tree and plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into <b>loaves</b> or balls and cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
50|$|Nutraloaf (also {{known as}} prison <b>loaf,</b> {{disciplinary}} <b>loaf,</b> food <b>loaf,</b> lockup <b>loaf,</b> confinement <b>loaf,</b> seg <b>loaf,</b> grue or special management meal) is a food served in prisons in the United States and Canada to inmates who have misbehaved; for example, assaulting prison guards or fellow prisoners. It {{is similar to}} meatloaf in texture, but has {{a wider variety of}} ingredients. Prison <b>loaf</b> is usually bland, perhaps even unpleasant, but prison wardens argue that nutraloaf provides enough nutrition to keep prisoners healthy without requiring utensils to be issued.|$|R

5|$|To {{enter the}} whole wheat bread market, the bakery {{imported}} its own wheat-cleaning machine from Hungary; the machine {{actually had to}} be smuggled out since Hungary did not have diplomatic relations with Israel at the time. However, health-food consumers were wary of the first whole-wheat <b>loaves</b> because they were white, not brown. Working with the Health Food Association, Angel's {{came up with the}} solution of adding all-natural molasses to the bread to give it a brown color.|$|E
5|$|What {{is utterly}} dismaying is the mess our milling and baking {{concerns}} succeed in making with the dearly bought grain {{that goes into}} their grist.

5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the <b>loaves</b> used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|The term olive <b>loaf</b> {{can refer}} to two {{different}} food products. Primarily, it {{is a type of}} meatloaf or cold cut embedded with pimento-stuffed green olives. A secondary meaning is that of olive bread, a bread where the <b>loaf</b> of bread is laced with whole olives.The luncheon meat often also contains garlic, basil or sweet peppers for additional flavor. Olive <b>loaf</b> is a loaf-type luncheon meat, traditionally cooked in a <b>loaf</b> pan as opposed to a sausage cooked in a casing. Higher quality olive <b>loaf</b> is primarily beef and pork while less expensive olive <b>loaf</b> contains mostly chicken or turkey. Since most less expensive bologna is made from similar meats, and since many companies now cook olive <b>loaf</b> in sleeves to give it a round appearance, it is a common misconception that olive <b>loaf</b> is a sausage like bologna.|$|R

5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in <b>loaves,</b> {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, granulated sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.|$|E
5|$|Sausages are {{commonly}} eaten, either as bangers and mash or toad in the hole. Lancashire hotpot {{is a well}} known stew in the northwest. Some {{of the more popular}} cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue Stilton. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti. Traditional English dessert dishes include apple pie or other fruit pies; spotted dick – all generally served with custard; and, more recently, sticky toffee pudding. Sweet pastries include scones (either plain or containing dried fruit) served with jam and/or cream, dried fruit <b>loaves,</b> Eccles cakes and mince pies as well as a wide range of sweet or spiced biscuits. Common drinks include tea, whose popularity was increased by Catherine of Braganza, whilst frequently consumed alcoholic drinks include wines, ciders and English beers, such as bitter, mild, stout, and brown ale.|$|E

5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold <b>Loaves</b> for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing them down with Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of {{contributors to the}} Mishnah state that the table was of the same dimensions as the <b>loaves</b> - 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, but Rabbi Akiva contributed a dissenting view, according to which there was {{a gap between the}} piles of shewbread, with the table being 12 Etzba long, and 6 Etzba wide; Abba Saul argued that the cups of incense were placed within the gap. These dimensions clearly are too small for the <b>loaves</b> to rest on the table lengthways, and clearly some support would have been needed for them to be piled high upon the table in two distinct piles, which is difficult to reconcile with the apparent biblical implication that the <b>loaves</b> were free standing on the table.|$|E
25|$|The {{somewhat}} scanty biblical details {{concerning the}} shewbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, the cakes were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work {{of any kind}} during the Sabbath. The Mishnah argues that the <b>loaves</b> were kneaded separately, but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that the <b>loaves</b> were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived {{more than a thousand}} years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while the <b>loaves</b> were just dough, another while the bread was being baked in the oven, and a third after baking, to protect the shape. The Mishnah describes the <b>loaves</b> as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long; Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.|$|E
