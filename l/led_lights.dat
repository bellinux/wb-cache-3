5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the gondola structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the gondola makes its way up the tower, the <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> on the gondola remains lit. When the gondola comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E

40|$|The {{brown seaweed}} Sargassum horneri (Sargassaceae) is {{important}} for marine environment conservation. It {{could be used for}} a food material, medical applications, and future biofuel production. We compared the growth of S. horneri cultures under single wavelength blue and red light during the germling and immature stages. The growth rate based on the thallus area of S. horneri during the germling stage was faster under blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> than under red <b>LED</b> <b>light.</b> Furthermore, based on the wet weight of S. horneri, during the immature stage, blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> resulted in a faster growth rate than red <b>LED</b> <b>light.</b> Moreover, during the immature stage, compared with red <b>LED</b> <b>light,</b> blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> tended to increase the content of photosynthetic pigments. We conclude that use of blue <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> in indoor tanks during the germling and immature stages will improve the efficiency of S. horneri culture. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtIn Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> {{products}} play a {{very important}} role in energy conservation and environmental protection. For the multidisciplinary design problem of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products, we establish the information model of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products based on the object tree, that is, a process and two trees. First we build a multidisciplinary design process of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products, clearing tasks and indicators of product design. Then we discuss the LED product modeling which is based on the design object tree and construct two trees of LED products, providing a necessary theoretical support for the design of <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> products. Finally, through the example of application, verify the feasibility of multidisciplinary design modeling...|$|R
40|$|A current {{demonstration}} in the greenhouses of Wageningen UR in Bleiswijk (the Netherlands) shows positive results of <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> {{on the quality}} and production of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa). In this demonstration two strawberry cultivars, Elsanta and Sonata, are exposed to three different light treatments. The first treatment consists of top <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> only (90 μmol m- 2 s- 1), the second of top <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> with additional <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> on the leaves (200 μmol m- 2 s- 1) and the last of top <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> with additional <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> on the fruits (90 μmol m- 2 s- 1). Strawberries were harvested two times per week from October till December and each time total production was determined. Repeated measurements on refraction, titratable acid and vitamin C content were conducted in addition to flavour testing by a consumer panel and a sensory expert panel. Results point out that treatment with additional <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> on leaves and the treatment with <b>LED</b> <b>light</b> on fruits results in {{a significant increase in}} production, flavour, refraction, titratable acid and vitamin C content. Lighting on fruits causes an even higher increase in vitamin C content than lighting on leaves. The observed effect of additional <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> on the fruits is surprising, since only 90 μmol m- 2 s- 1 was available to the plant compared to 200 μmol m- 2 s- 1 in the other treatment. Our findings indicate that <b>LED</b> <b>lighting</b> is a promising technique in greenhouse horticulture to optimize flavour, nutritional value and production of strawberries...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for use when the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{effects were}} {{supervised}} by Tim Webber at the London-based VFX company Framestore, which {{was responsible for}} creating most of the film's visual effectsexcept for 17 shots. Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the authenticity and reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled <b>LED</b> <b>lights</b> was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E
