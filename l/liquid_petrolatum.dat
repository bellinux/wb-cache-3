40|$|Collecting {{blood for}} {{haematological}} and biochemical analysis {{is not as}} simple a task {{as it may seem}} to be. It must be carefully conducted, and the handling of blood after collection must be reduced to a minimum to avoid changes in its composition. Glass syringes used for this purpose are now largely replaced by disposable plastic syringes. Since the plunger provides a good seal it excels the glass syringe, especially when one needs 'anaerobic ' whole blood, plasma or serum. Because there is no leakage between the barrel and the plunger, it is no longer necessary to use <b>liquid</b> <b>petrolatum.</b> Unfortunately, like the glass syringe, it has an inherent handicap in that it does not allow the centrifugation of blood. It is apparent that if blood could be centrifuged in th...|$|E
40|$|Disseminated {{encephalomyelitis}} was readily induced in mice of the Swiss strain {{by means}} of repeated intramuscular and subcutaneous injections of apparently normal mouse brain mixed with an adjuvant. The latter consisted of autoclaved virulent tubercle bacilli and heavy <b>liquid</b> <b>petrolatum,</b> a modification of the Freund adjuvant. The syndrome and the histopathological picture of the induced malady were essentially {{similar to those in}} monkeys, rabbits, and guinea pigs, previously reported by others. Certain exceptional characteristics of the affection, as occurring in mice, suggest that they may be the animals of choice for its study as well as for that of other encephalitides. Not only were the signs indicative of marked involvement of the central nervous system but also of the respiratory mechanism, and only a few injections of mouse brain-adjuvant mixture were required to evoke the neurological symptom complex in almost every animal...|$|E
40|$|The {{coagulation}} time {{of blood}} is lengthened, or blood may be rendered incoagulable, by addition to it, in vitro or in vivo, {{of one of}} the arsphenamines (1, 2, 3). The effect is due to a change in the fibrinogen (1, 3). The effect in vâ€™ivo passes off rapidly (1, 4). In the course of a general experimental inquiry into the factors concerned with the production of clinical reactions by the arsenicals many determinations of coagulation time were made on the tail blood of rats after intravenous injection of various samples of neoarsphenamine. The method used was that of Van Allen (5), in which coagulation is evidenced by a sudden change in the appearance of a drop of blood when kept below the surface of <b>liquid</b> <b>petrolatum.</b> It was observed that an increase in coagulation time after an injection of neoarsphen-amine resulted in a clot that was much more friable than one of normal blood. The possibility that a study of clot strength might prove of value in the analysis of clinical reactions to the arsenicals {{led to the development of}} a method for the measure-ment of the elastic limits of various gels. I. METHOD The force required to pull a strip of metallic gauze out of a plasma gel measures its shearing or tensile strength. Since, however, the strength of a blood clot is due to a meshwork of elastic fibrin threads, and since the technic of the present test conforms more nearly to the definition of elastic limit than t...|$|E
