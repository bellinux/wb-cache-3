25|$|In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927 (1995), a {{unanimous}} Court {{held that the}} Fourth Amendment normally requires law enforcement officers to knock and announce their presence before entering a dwelling. Today’s opinion holds that evidence seized from a home following a violation of this requirement need not be suppressed. As a result, the Court destroys the strongest legal incentive {{to comply with the}} Constitution’s knock-and-announce requirement. And the Court does so without significant support in precedent. At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find no such support in the many Fourth Amendment cases the Court has decided in the near century since it first set forth the exclusionary principle in Weeks v. United States.|$|E
500|$|Speculation {{surfaced}} that Coolio {{had actually}} given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic's record label {{had lied to}} Yankovic {{in the hopes that}} the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1's Behind the Music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and a post on the [...] "Ask Al" [...] feature on Yankovic's website suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was very surprised when Coolio came over to chat. He later joked on his site's Q feature that, [...] "I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party but at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall." ...|$|E

2500|$|Starting with Josiah Gilbert Holland's 1866 Life of Abraham Lincoln, {{a number}} of sources recount an anecdote about Douglas at Lincoln's first inauguration. Lincoln took the oath of office, then took off his [...] "stovepipe" [...] hat in {{preparation}} for giving his inaugural address. But he had nowhere to set down the hat. Douglas, who was on the platform, stepped forward and took the hat from Lincoln's hands. Moving back, he remarked [...] "If I can't be the President, at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hold his hat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2001, Markhasev sent {{a letter}} to California Deputy Attorney General Kyle Brodie asking that all appeals in his case stop. Markhasev wrote to Brodie that he had killed Cosby and that he wanted {{to do the right thing}} by confessing. [...] "Although my appeal is in its {{beginning}} stages, I don't want to continue with it because it's based on falsehood and deceit," [...] wrote Markhasev, who is incarcerated at California State Prison, Corcoran. [...] "I am guilty, and I want to do the right thing ... More than anything, I want to apologize to the victim's family. It is my duty as a Christian, and it's the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do, after the great wickedness for which I am responsible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1966, Katzenbach told Johnson {{regarding}} Alabama, that [...] "I am {{attempting to}} do the <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do safely without upsetting the civil rights groups." [...] Katzenbach did concentrate examiners and observers in Selma for the [...] "high-visibility" [...] election between incumbent County Sheriff Jim Clark and Wilson Baker, who had earned the grudging respect of many local residents and activists. With 11,000 blacks added to the voting rolls in Selma by March 1966, they voted for Baker in 1966, turning Clark out of office. Clark later was prosecuted and convicted of drug smuggling and served a prison sentence. The US Civil Rights Commission said that the murders of activists, such as Jonathan Daniels in 1965, had been a major impediment to voter registration.|$|E

2500|$|... "Out of Step", A Minor Threat {{song from}} their second EP, further {{demonstrates}} the said belief: [...] "Don't smoke/Don't drink/Don't fuck/At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> fucking think/I can't keep up/I'm {{out of step}} with the world." [...] The [...] "I" [...] in the lyrics was usually only implied, mainly because it did not quite fit the rhythm of the song, like the updated version on the 1983 album Out of Step, which is slower, allotting a bridge where MacKaye explains his philosophy of straight edge, explaining that straight edge [...] "is not a set of rules; I'm not telling you what to do. All I'm saying is there are three things, that are like so important to the whole world that I don't happen to find much importance in, whether it's fucking, or whether it's playing golf, because of that, I feel...

2500|$|Tragedy! A Musical Comedy, {{written by}} Michael Johnson and Mary Davenport was {{performed}} at the 2007 New York International Fringe Festival in the Lucille Lortel Theatre. Directed by Johnson, the piece starred Francis Van Wetering as Titus, Alexandra Cirves as Tamora, Roger Casey as Aaron (aka The Evil Black Guy) and Lauren Huyett as Lavinia. Staged as a farce, the production included moments such as Lavinia singing a song entitled [...] "At <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> still sing" [...] after having her hands cut off, but as she reaches the finale, Chiron and Demetrius return and cut out her tongue; Lucius is portrayed as a homosexual in love with Saturninus, and everyone knows except Titus; Titus kills Mutius not because he defies him, but because he discovers that Mutius {{wants to be a}} tap dancer instead of a soldier; Bassianus is a transvestite; Saturninus is addicted to prescription medication; and Tamora is a nymphomaniac.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I want everyone to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, but at <b>least</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hear and understand." ...|$|E
