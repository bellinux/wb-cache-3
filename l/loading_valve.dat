40|$|On December 12, 2007, {{the second}} largest oil spill {{in the history of}} Norwegian oil {{exploration}} occurred on StatoilHydro's Statfjord Alpha platform. The spill was caused by a snapped 20 ″ oil off-loading hose. Thorough investigations by StatoilHydro [1] and by the Norwegian authorities [2] revealed the chain of events that led to this incident. One of the links in this chain was the unintended fast closure of the shuttle tanker's bow <b>loading</b> <b>valve</b> during off-loading. This closure initiated a pressure surge in the oil off-loading system. As part of the internal investigation by StatoilHydro, TNO carried out a water hammer analysis of the entire oil off-loading system, including the off-loading hoses to the seabed and further subsea piping up to the platform. These simulations revealed that high pressures could occur in the oil off-loading system due to fast closure of the bow <b>loading</b> <b>valve</b> followed by multiple reflections at diameter changes. The maximum pressures were more than 100 bar above the normal operating pressure of 10 bar. The diameter changes were introduced into the oil off-loading system to maximize the off-loading capacity. The results of the water hammer analysis provided the missing link between the fast closure of the valve and the damaged hose and also showed that this damage most likely occurred within 0. 5 second after the closure of the valve. Based on the results of this analysis, also other oil off-loading systems are being reinvestigated to prevent a similar incident to occur in the future. Copyright © 2009 by ASME...|$|E

A set of lumped parameter mathematical models are developed which are based on conservation of mass and energy for the system. The theoretical basis and modelling strategy are discussed for an open circuit containing a hydraulic pump, <b>loading</b> <b>valve,</b> heat exchanger and reservoir. Simulation results are presented which show a comparison of modellrig perfomnce, and the agreement obtained demonstrates the validity of the modelling approach.

40|$|Some {{years ago}} a root cause {{analysis}} was made of a large oil spill caused by a leak in an oil offloading system. It appeared that the leak {{was caused by a}} large pressure pulse initiated by the sudden closure of the bow <b>loading</b> <b>valve</b> at the tanker, called water hammer. The magnitude of the initial pulse was largely amplified by reflections at several diameter changes. Similar phenomena can occur in (offshore) LNG transfer systems with even more serious consequences. In addition to the water hammer "column separation" may cause even larger pressure pulses. This occurs when, due to a passing water hammer wave, the pressure locally drops to the vapor pressure and the liquid starts to boil. As the LNG in a transfer system is close to its boiling conditions, this phenomenon is likely to occur. In order to evaluate to what extent water hammer and column separation can endanger the integrity of the system a computer model has been made of three generic ship-to-ship transfer systems. The peak pressures during an emergency release of the flexible transfer hose at full flow have been calculated. The sensitivity for length of the hose, closure time and wave propagation speed has been evaluated. In spite of the modeling uncertainties the results show that water hammer and column separation can cause shock loads that are an order of magnitude larger than the static loads. Therefore it is recommended to perform an analysis as part of the design and to optimize the layout of the system. It is suggested to include this as a requirement in the applicable design codes. Also it is recommended to test components such as flexible hoses on dynamic loads caused by water hammer...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> with <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> control <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> to achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time. Static modeling method based on force balance and Bernoulli orifice pressure-flow equation is used to design the load velocity control ability of the valve. Dynamic modeling method based on Newton’s second law and fluid continuity equation is used to optimize the parameters to give the proposed <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> a fast opening feature. An actual <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

40|$|The binlifts of refuse {{collectors}} have {{a problem}} with binlift oscillations when the binlift is lowered slowly. The problem escalates with hot oil that has lower viscosity. Most problematic the oscillations are with an accessory scale on the binlift as it does not tolerate oscillations in the position where it takes measurements. These oscillations are caused by <b>load</b> control <b>valves</b> and wrong directional control valve spools make these oscillations worse. To figure out possible solutions for the oscillations the thesis has comprehensive <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> theory part which summarizes all the traditional and latest inventions related to <b>load</b> control <b>valves.</b> This information is used in selecting valves for measurements. In this thesis there are measurements with different <b>load</b> control <b>valves,</b> directional control valve spools, restrictors, hoses and sequence valves. Measurements are done with a rear loader and they include flow and pressure measuring. These measurements are done to figure out which combination is the best compromise between energy consumption, oscillations and cost. This compromise should also fill all standardization requirements. Several solutions are found that are not ideal, one solution which is recommended and a couple of which are recommended in case oscillations are still needed to be degreased. Future solutions are also discussed but they require many changes to the hydraulic fundamentals of the refuse collectors. These solutions are likely to be possible for the coming generations of refuse collectors...|$|R

The most important parameters of the counterbalance valve that influence the stability are pilot gain and relief gain. The factors describe how pilot pressure and load pressure affect the flow across the counterbalance valve. A new counterbalance valve (patent pending) has the pilot gain and relief gain required for stability only in operating ranges that require the parameters for stability. When the load is not moving or the counterbalance valve is not required for positive (non overrunning) <b>loads,</b> the new <b>valve</b> has a higher pilot ratio, which means that the valve opens further at lower inlet pressures.

40|$|Pumps are {{critical}} components of many industrial processes. Although they vary in size, {{depending on the}} application, their operating principles and performance parameters are similar across generic families. Large industrial positive displacement (P. D.) pumps, primarily used in mining, oil and gas industries, deliver significant amounts of flow coupled with very high pressures. However, increasing energy costs and sustainability concerns demand systems re-design to improve their efficiency. Most established forms of PD pumps have duty cycles fixed by the movement of spring <b>loaded</b> <b>valves.</b> One approach to increase their energy efficiency could be to dynamically vary the movement of these valves. To test this hypothesis and quantify any potential benefits a computational model is required. This paper introduces modelling technique used to analytically describe a multi-cylinder positive displacement pump.

Results show how different valve actuation responses affect the overall flow rate of the pump.

50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under <b>load</b> the <b>valve</b> heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
500|$|Until the 1970s, when {{submersible}} {{pressure gauges}} on regulators came into common use, diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty. The gas supply was automatically cut-off by a spring <b>loaded</b> <b>valve</b> when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure. To release the reserve, the diver pulled {{down on a}} rod that ran {{along the side of}} the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve. The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve (typically [...] ) was consumed. On occasion, divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and, not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed, could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever. These valves became known as [...] "J-valves" [...] from being item [...] "J" [...] in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs. The standard non-reserve yoke valve at the time was item [...] "K", and is often still referred to as a [...] "K-valve". J-valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility, where the submersible pressure gauge (SPG) can not be read. While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J-valve, the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NOAA (the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and OSHA (the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration) all still allow or recommend the use of J-valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge. They are generally not available through recreational dive shops, but are still available from some manufacturers. They can be significantly more expensive than K-valves from the same manufacturer.|$|R
