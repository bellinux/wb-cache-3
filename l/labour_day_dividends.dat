50|$|A <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> {{tradition}} in Atlantic Canada is the Wharf Rat Rally in Digby, Nova Scotia, {{while the rest}} of Canada watches the <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> Classic, a Canadian Football League event where rivals like Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Eskimos, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and Toronto Argonauts (except in 2011 and 2013, due to scheduling conflicts), and Saskatchewan Roughriders and Winnipeg Blue Bombers play on <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> weekend. Before the demise of the Ottawa Renegades after the 2005 season, that team played the nearby Montreal Alouettes on <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> weekend. Since the 2014 CFL season, when the Ottawa Redblacks began play, the Montreal-Ottawa <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> tradition has once again been observed. Likewise, Ontario University Athletics has a long-established tradition to play university football on <b>Labour</b> <b>Day.</b>|$|R
50|$|For most countries, <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> {{is synonymous}} with, or linked with, International Workers' Day, which occurs on 1 May.

Since the new school year generally starts right after <b>Labour</b> <b>Day,</b> families with school-age children take it as the last chance to travel {{before the end of}} summer.|$|R

50|$|<b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> {{is one of}} {{the public}} {{holidays}} in Bulgaria, where it is known as <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> and International Workers' Solidarity Day (Ден на труда и на международната работническа солидарност).

It is celebrated annually on 1 May.|$|R

50|$|Although not {{directly}} {{associated with the}} <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> Classic, the week after <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> often has a repeat match-up of the Bombers vs Roughriders (see Banjo Bowl), Stampeders vs Eskimos (see Battle of Alberta), and Tiger-Cats vs Argonauts, (a rivalry which began in 1873) with home field advantage now to the team {{that did not have}} it during the <b>Labour</b> <b>Day</b> weekend.
