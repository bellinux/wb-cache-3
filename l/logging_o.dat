We present a natural quantum version of this algorithm based on repeated measurements of the quantum walk Ut = e −iPt. We show that it samples almost uniformly from S with logarithmic dependence on ǫ − 1 just as the classical walk P does; previously, no such quantum walk algorithm was known. We then outline a framework for analyzing its running time and formulate two plausible conjectures which together would imply that it runs in time O(δ − 1 / 2 <b>log</b> N <b>log</b> <b>ǫ</b> − 1) when P is the standard transition matrix of a constant-degree graph.
