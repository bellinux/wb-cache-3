50|$|For 1974, North American models {{received}} newly required 5 mph impact bumpers {{mounted on}} self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately 25 mm to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment {{point of the}} strut, was redesigned to improve handling {{and stability in the}} event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel 5.5 in wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded <b>loop-pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel 4.5 in-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, <b>loop-pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof.|$|E
50|$|Instruments were {{confined}} to a single large speedometer with fuel gauge in the saloon (a temperature gauge was available as an option) on a dashboard of grey pressed fibreboard. The coupé dashboard was equipped with speedometer, fuel and temperature gauges, together with a lockable glovebox. The car had <b>loop-pile</b> <b>carpeting</b> and heater as standard. A number of extras were available including twin SU carburettors, leather seats, a wood-veneered dashboard, Telaflo shock absorbers and paint options.|$|R
2500|$|Later when bladed wires were {{developed}} the pile loops were severed on {{withdrawal of the}} blade wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton. after this development the loom {{became known as the}} Wilton loom, and in modern usage the designation wilton applies to both cut-pile and <b>loop-pile</b> <b>carpets</b> made in this loom. The latter now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired jacquard. the methods of manufacture, including the principles of designing, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 2-shot) the Wilton Wilton cut-pile is sometime woven similarly ( [...] 2-shot) but more often with three picks of weft to each wire ( [...] 3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.|$|R
5000|$|For 1956, the La Femme returned, with no less fanfare; {{letters to}} dealers from Dodge’s {{marketing}} department called the La Femme a [...] "stunning success". For 1956, Dodge replaced the Heather Rose and Sapphire White scheme with a Misty Orchid and Regal Orchid color scheme. The {{interior of the}} car in 1956 did not take its cue from the 1955 model, and instead featured [...] "La Femme"-only seat patterns, headliner, interior paint and carpet. The fabrics used have proven difficult to reproduce. The seat coverings were made of a heavy white cloth with random, organic-seeming patterns of short lavender and purple loops, {{in a manner similar}} to <b>loop-pile</b> <b>carpeting.</b> The headliner cloth was heavy white fabric, with many tiny random splashes of gold paint. The carpeting was loop pile with several shades of lavender and purple. The boxes behind the seats were changed for 1956 to accommodate the rain coat, rain cap and umbrella provided with the model. Both boxes were identical this year, because there was no need to accommodate a purse, which was only offered with the 1955 La Femme.|$|R
