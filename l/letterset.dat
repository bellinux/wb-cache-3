40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) {{have been}} shown to be {{impaired}} on some nondeclarative memory tasks that require cognitive skill learning (perceptual-motor sequence learning, probabilistic classification). To determine what other skill-based tasks are impaired, 13 patients with PD were tested on artificial grammar learning, artificial grammar learning with transfer to novel <b>lettersets,</b> and prototype learning. Patients with PD performed similarly to controls on all 3 tests. The intact learning exhibited by PD patients on these tests suggests that nondeclarative cognitive skill learning is not a single entity supported by the neostriatum. If learning the regularities among visual stimuli is the principal feature of artificial grammar learning and prototype learning, then these forms of skill learning may be examples of perceptual learning, and they may occur in early visual cortical processing areas. A number of cognitive skill learning tasks are known to depend on nondeclarative memory, that is, memory systems outside the medial temporal lobe memory system and diencephalic structures that are important for declarative memory (Squire, Knowlton, & Musen, 1993; Squire & Zola...|$|R

5000|$|The {{works of}} Michal Na'aman from the 1970s used {{photography}} to create collages. In these works Naaman put together various expressions emphasizing {{the limitations of}} the language of description and of vision, as well as the possibilities of imagination and the difference in visual expression. The practice of combining conflicting axioms indicated the failure or distortion of the language of description. Against the background of the visual dimension that reflected the aesthetic principles of “Want of Matter,” there appeared various representations and texts written in <b>letterset</b> printing or in handwriting that reflected the semiotic bankruptcy of the representation of images. Examples of this can be found in works such as “The Fish is the End of the Bird” (1977) and “The Gospel According to the Bird” (1977) in which Na'aman joined reproduced images of a fish and a bird into a kind of hybrid monster. In “Vanya (Vajezath)" [...] (1975) a conflict is created between the textual contents of the work with the visual contents, along with an emphasis on sexual motifs.|$|E
50|$|Henry Schlesnyak, an American-born artist, {{juxtaposed}} collage with American Pop Art, and American symbolism—the {{most significant}} {{of which is}} his portrait of Abraham Lincoln - with scenes from Israeli art as reflected in various newspaper articles. Through this juxtaposition, Schlesnyak pointed out the moral aspect of artistic activity and {{his view of the}} place of Israeli art and the Israeli artist within it. Another layer of his work was composed of the “Tel Aviv” aesthetic, which played the role of critic in his works. For example reproductions of famous works of art were painted over in industrial shellac to give them the feeling of paintings by the European “Old Masters.” The “Hebrew translation” of this feeling included the devaluing of the paintings by “flashes of stains {{on the surface of the}} paintings, dirt, ‘want of matter’, thereby bringing it down to the level of what is appropriate to the experience of being here. “ In a 1980 collage, Schlesnyak glued onto plywood a newspaper picture of the writer Irving Stone, author of popular novels about artists, positioned at the front of the Tel Aviv Museum. Next to him stands Marc Scheps, Director of the museum, with his head enclosed in a circle. Above this Schlesnyak glued an article by Adam Baruch describing an exhibition of the works of Ya’acov Dorchin, a friend of Schlesnyak, with a caption composed of <b>letterset</b> printing.|$|E
