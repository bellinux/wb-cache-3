40|$|Abstract Autumn <b>leaf</b> <b>scars</b> are an {{important}} pathogen infection site for European canker on apples. Trials were undertaken to evaluate the effects of adjuvants on spray coverage of new <b>leaf</b> <b>scars,</b> and determine if adjuvants could (1) impart any significant rainfastness to protectant captan sprays and (2) provide any redistribution of captan during a rain event post-leaf drop. Retention on fresh <b>leaf</b> <b>scars</b> was increased {{with the use of}} organosilicone-latex sticker adjuvants only. Rain had little effect on spray residues but these adjuvants could improve rainfastness of captan due to their effects on spray retention. Retention on stem wood and around leaf nodes was increased by up to seven-fold with the use of superspreader-type adjuvants, due to redistribution of spray runoff from leaves. High initial deposits resulted in post-rain residues on <b>leaf</b> <b>scars</b> three-fold higher than a captan spray alone. Redistribution of captan onto exposed <b>leaf</b> <b>scars</b> in rain appears likely with these adjuvants...|$|R

50|$|Visually, {{black walnut}} {{is similar to}} the {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the leaf scars, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> with no hairy ridge.|$|E
50|$|The thin trunk is solitary, gray to maroon in color, with {{distinct}}, widely spaced <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> rings. The leaf sheaths are extended, {{forming a}} distinct green crownshaft; the small rachis bears widely spaced, acute leaflets, slightly offset and taper to a point. The inflorescence is borne beneath the crownshaft, {{protected by a}} caducous prohyll, once-branched, producing one-seeded fruit with apical remains.|$|E

50|$|These {{dioecious}} palms have green, solitary trunks with widely spaced <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> rings. The trunks grow to 45 cm {{in diameter}} and 35 m in height; the leaf crown is hemispherical, or nearly so, with 6 m pinnate leaves on robust, 2 m petioles. Petioles are armed with 6 cm spines, gold or gray in color. Inflorescences emerge from within the leaf crown, to 2 m in length, and resemble those in Mauritia. The fruit ripens to a yellow-orange drupe, covered in scales and containing one seed.|$|E

5000|$|... === Seasonal leaf loss=== Leaves in temperate, boreal, and {{seasonally}} dry zones may be seasonally deciduous (falling off {{or dying}} for the inclement season). This mechanism to shed leaves is called abscission. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> on the twig. In cold autumns, they sometimes change color, and turn yellow, bright-orange, or red, as various accessory pigments (carotenoids and xanthophylls) are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced sunlight by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red anthocyanin pigments are now {{thought to be}} produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost—yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as aphids. Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.|$|E
30|$|Two {{species of}} Bergeria, B. dilatata and B. worthenii have similar {{morphological}} characters {{with the current}} fossil; but B. dilatata has leaf cushions with small, irregular scars {{at or near the}} top of the cushion, while B. worthenii has the area above and below the <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> ornamented with coarse, transverse, discontinuous wrinkles, which are easily distinguishable from B. wenquanensis.|$|E

40|$|Dicranophyllum gallicum Grand’Eury is {{described}} {{by means of a}} morphometric analysis of eighty two samples from various old and new localities in western and central Europe. Stem, leaf cushions, leaf scars, leaves, axillary structures and potential seeds are described in detail, and discussed in comparison to earlier studies. The encountered variability in size and structure is shown to be higher than what was described earlier. The organisation of the leaf cushion and scar density vary gradually with the stem width, while stratigraphic position and ecology do not relate to it. It is concluded that the described variability represents an ontogenetic feature rather than a phylogenetic or ecologic one. The juvenile plants are characterised by small stems, a high <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> density and elongated leaf cushions with a dominant apical field, while mature specimens are characterized by a wide stem, a relatively low <b>leaf</b> <b>scar</b> density and relatively wide leaf cushions with a pronounced basal field. Axillary shoots and potential seeds of D. gallicum are described and illustrated in detail for the first time. A reconstruction based on the studied material is presented...|$|E

The needles go out and curve up creating a distinctive look that can be identified from afar. The needles are flat and have the same glaucous blue color on both sides. The specific epithet “concolor” meaning “with one color” refers to this feature. The needles reportedly have a citrus odor when bruised. [URL]...|$|E

Leaf cushions have visible ornamentation and fine grooves on the surface; some vertical streaks are also scattered along the leaf cushion on the lower part.|$|E
