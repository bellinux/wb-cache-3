40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. In the nineties, the new {{political}} dispensation in South Africa ushered in an era where power and relationship structures of government would be people centered. Section 23 of the Constitution provides for fair labour practices, and subsequent employment laws gives effect to these constitutional rights. Laws introduced new structures and procedures that required greater cooperation. This required a change in mental models, while transcending past unfair labour practices and moving towards more harmonious relationships. <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> is a relatively closed system, because {{the rule of law}} is specific about the outcome of a particular action. The <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officer is only required to mechanically apply the legislation and policies when providing guidance and support in the organisation. The success of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officer may be measured by {{the degree to which they}} make themselves redundant; that is the extent to which policies, structures, systems and processes instituted and the advice given, allow other managers and supervisors to manage their people on their own. While the transactional role and competencies for Human Resources practice are easy to define, the substantive issues like <b>labour</b> <b>relations</b> are less clear and there is no consistency in the manner in which <b>labour</b> <b>relations</b> is structured, practiced and managed. Prior to the new employment laws, government departments operated on a staff rotation system. Employees were placed in <b>labour</b> <b>relations</b> through the rotation and placement exercise. As a result <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> was staffed with administrators without the appropriate qualifications, skills and experience. <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> is located within the Human Resources Section in the Government Departments in KwaZulu Natal. At the commencement of this study I was employed by the Provincial Department of Housing as an Assistant Manager. The employer and employee relationship was poor, and this was evident by the number of grievances and disputes. Advice was not provided timeously by <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> and advice was also not accepted by management, thereby resulting in disputes. Unions complained that they were not consulted on matters of mutual interest and <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> was accused of being rigid around employment issues. <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officials were also viewed as being "partial" because they actively participated in the discipline and arbitration process. The Department of Housing fell under the jurisdiction of the General Public Service Sectoral Bargaining Council, and even collective bargaining was entrenched in the "us and them " mentality. Issues for negotiation were on the agenda for months as the parties were not willing to compromise. The purpose of this study is to explore the emerging set of competencies for <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officers operating within the General Public Service Sectoral Bargaining Chamber in KwaZulu- Natal. Competencies refer to the set of knowledge, skills, abilities and behavior. This qualitative study was undertaken through conversation interviews with <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officers, employees and unionists that operate within the jurisdiction of the Bargaining Chamber. The intention of this study is to add value to the practice of <b>labour</b> <b>relations,</b> by assisting <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officers to re-invent themselves as the champions of transformation.

40|$|The {{medium term}} outlook for state {{finances}} within Ireland remains difficult (International Monetary Fund, 2013). Within this environment government {{policy is to}} ensure that the provision of state services remains at acceptable levels (Department of An Taoiseach, 2011). To achieve this, it is necessary to extract increased productivity levels from a decreasing pool of state employees (<b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Commission,</b> 2013). As part of this process, it is envisaged that the successful operation of public sector collective agreements will form a key element in achieving this higher productivity. However given the constrained resources available, the operation of these agreements has the potential to generate disputes between employees and management across the range of public sector organisations (Cutcher & Joel, 1991). Included in this is the Defence Forces, which despite its unique industrial relations environment is still subject to the management / employee strains that can arise within traditionally structured organisations. Given this context, it is the intent of this research to explore if the use of mediation as a dispute prevention tool can contribute to the maintenance of a positive relationship between the largest Defence Forces employee representative association ‘PDFORRA’ and management during the operation of public sector collective agreements? In order to address this aim, a detailed literature review was conducted that covered previous academic work in the areas of ‘Industrial Relations within a Military Environment’, ‘Public Sector Collective Agreements’ and ‘Mediation’. The information that was obtained from this review was then complimented by the collection of primary data through a series of semi-structured interviews. These interviews involved the participation of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Commission</b> (LRC) Advisory Service as well as the main actors within the Defence Sector. As a result of this collection of both primary and secondary data, a number of research findings became apparent. These findings would include; The existence of a positive approach to engagement between management and employee representatives; Management concerns over the delays that can be experienced when attempting to resolve disagreements with representative associations; A willingness on the part of all parties to consider the use of mediation as a dispute prevention mechanism; A concern on the part of management over the scope of use that would accompany a mediation process; A desire within the LRC to support the use of dispute prevention mechanisms such as mediation in the public sector; A willingness {{on the part of the}} LRC to support the use of mediation within the Defence Sector. Building on these findings four conclusions were drawn from the research that was conducted. Specifically the research identified that there is significant evidence to support the premise that mediation is a suitable tool for use within the unique internal industrial relations process of the Defence Forces. It is also assessed that mediation can have a positive impact on the operation of public sector collective agreements within the Defence Forces. In addition the conclusions recognise that the research which has been conducted has the capacity to contribute to the level of academic knowledge that is available on the use of mediation as a tool to assist in the operation of public sector collective agreements. Then to conclude, the research supports the conclusion that the use of mediation as a dispute prevention tool can contribute to the maintenance of a positive relationship between PDFORRA and management during the operation of public sector collective agreements within the Defence Forces...|$|E
40|$|Dans cet article, l'auteur analyse les jugements du Tribunal du travail du Québec en matière de congédiement pour activité syndicale. In this article, {{the author}} {{attempts}} a study {{not only of}} legislative texts dealing with dismissal for union activities in Québec labour legislation since 1960, {{but also of the}} jurisprudence related to the numerous decisions handed down on the subject by the Québec <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Commission,</b> and also by the Investigating Commissioners and the Labour Court. Provisions respecting dismissal for union activities were first included in the Labour Relations Act at the end of 1959. Basically, these provisions provided for the rehiring of workers dismissed for union activities, and obliged employers to prove that the worker had been dismissed for some other just and sufficient reason and not for union activities or for the exercice of a legal right. These provisions, with few changes, were included in the Labour Code published September 1, 1964. Since the introduction of these sections into the labour laws, thousands of decisions have been handed down ; decisions which have created many problems and given rise to quite varying interpretations. The author has tried {{to come to grips with}} the underlying reasons for these interpretations and, as far as the « other just and sufficient reason » is concerned, he mentions two schools of thought on the subject. One school holds that the person called upon to hand down a decision should not substitute his judgment for that of the employer, and the second school holds that, on the contrary, this person should carefully assess the nature of the « other just and sufficient reason ». According to the author, the problem is not easily resolved. It is obvious, however, that prevailing ideas in society concerning unions and the behavior of their leaders, does have a certain influence on decisions which are handed down. As for the reasons given by employers for dismissing workers, the author treats those where employers cite : economic and technological causes, the influence of the employee's service record on decisions, ignorance of the employee's union activities, the weight of circumstance related to the dismissal (which causes the author to wonder if, in order to establish presumption, one has only to consider the union activities of the employee or also the propaganda and recruiting going on in the industry at the time of dismissal), delays incurred between the moment the offense was committed and the dismissal, and lack of work and other economic reasons for not recalling a worker who has been laid off...|$|E
40|$|ANTHONY FORSYTH assesses Ireland’s social {{partnership}} WITH {{the federal}} election campaign finally under way, industrial relations {{is one of the}} main issues that separate the major parties. Over the next six weeks, we’re likely to see them hurl claim and counter-claim at each other, with little room for considering alternative policy approaches that emphasise the mutual interests of employers, employees and unions - rather than what separates them. But there is another way I have just returned from Ireland, where I met with key players in that country’s “social partnership” framework for regulating economic, social and labour relations. Since 1987, the social partners in Ireland - including high-level government officials, employer bodies, trade unions, the farming sector, and representatives of community organisations - have negotiated a series of national “social pacts. ” These agreements cover a wide range of economic and social issues - from minimum wage levels to taxation policy, from levels of public sector funding for health and education to employment rights, protections for Ireland’s growing migrant labour force, and so on. It occurred to me that, after all the divisiveness of the Work Choices debate, an industrial relations model like Ireland’s - based on cooperation and social inclusion - could be the way forward for Australia. But I was stopped in my tracks by a comment that was made by almost all of the people I met with - social partnership was (and is) “an Irish solution to an Irish problem. ” It was in fact a response to the severe economic and social crises that Ireland faced in the 1980 s. The situation was so grave that the social partners really had no choice but to “pull together. ” The social partnership system that they created is widely considered to have been a major factor in the subsequent economic success of the “Celtic Tiger. ” Of course, Australia does not currently face anything like that kind of crisis - in fact, quite the opposite, with our minerals boom and generally positive economic outlook. However, in relation to our system of workplace regulation and the policy debate surrounding it, the last three years have been typified by conflict and adversarialism. We have seen this play out in several ways. It’s there in the federal takeover of state IR laws under Work Choices; and in the acrimony of the debate itself, which has intensified as the election approaches. Work Choices has also entrenched the adversarialism that has always been a feature of Australian IR at the workplace level. For example, we are increasingly seeing employers adopting hostile positions, refusing to enter into collective agreement negotiations with unions regardless of the workforce’s wishes. Against this backdrop, it is useful in my view to look at an IR system like Ireland’s, and to ask: “What can we learn about how to shift the focus and underpinning values of our system away from conflict, and towards cooperation and partnership?” There are four main aspects of the Irish system that might be adaptable in some way to Australian circumstances. First, regarding the consensual negotiation of national social pacts, I think it would be difficult to emulate the broad-ranging agenda of Ireland’s national framework agreements given the size of our country and our larger population, and the different responsibilities of our three levels of government. However, the idea of national-level dialogue, drawing in all relevant stakeholders, is worth considering - at least for determining the shape of labour policy and regulation, and facilitating agreement between the Commonwealth and the states over the optimal model for a uniform national IR system. Secondly, the concepts of consensus and cooperation are supported at the highest levels of government in Ireland, right up to the prime minister’s department. These concepts are also deeply institutionally embedded, with a plethora of government agencies charged with overseeing the negotiation, implementation and “troubleshooting” of the national social pacts, and advancing the take-up of partnership at the enterprise level. At the same time, the Irish system is not legally embedded. The national social pacts are binding in honour only, but all the major players observe the terms of those agreements. The social partners are also not obliged to participate in the process - they all do so on a voluntary basis. The system works on the basis of the commitment of those involved to the relationships that it has fostered, and cross-party political support. This is all very hard to imagine in the current Australian context! If we were to adopt some form of social partnership, it would require a firm legislative foundation. Laws would be needed to establish two or three key institutions - perhaps one that would be responsible for national policy formulation, one to drive the enterprise focus for partnership, and there should be a role in the process for our industrial tribunal. This brings me to the third aspect of the Irish model that I think we can learn from. Ireland’s <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Commission</b> has been given an innovative role in dispute prevention, as well as dispute resolution. The LRC’s “advisory division” promotes the principles of workplace partnership, consultation and communication - for example, among employers that are frequent users of its traditional dispute settlement services. This kind of advisory function would be a welcome addition to the roles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, or Fair Work Australia if Labor wins the election. Fourthly, the Irish have been very successful in almost eradicating conflict, in the form of industrial action, from their IR system. The LRC has an over 80 per cent success rate in conciliating collective labour disputes. This is despite the fact that it does not have the legal power to compel parties to attend its proceedings. Parties do so, however, because the LRC has the enormous respect of all participants in the system, deriving from their commitment to social partnership more generally. In contrast, Work Choices has stripped the AIRC of much of its former jurisdiction, thus undermining its standing. We need to restore a commitment to the concept of workplace dispute resolution through an independent public agency. There is one aspect of the Irish system, however, that is not particularly adaptable - that is, the centralisation of pay bargaining through the national social pacts, which determine minimum wage levels for most of the economy. Australia has moved steadily away from centralised wage-fixing over the last twenty years, with the major political parties, employer groups and the ACTU now firmly committed to enterprise bargaining. In summary, the main thing that Australia can borrow from the Irish model is the underlying concept of cooperation - as a basis both for determining workplace relations policy at the national level, and for the management of employer-employee-union relationships at the enterprise level. We are not facing the kind of economic crisis that shaped Ireland’s social partnership system. But Work Choices has caused significant damage to Australia’s social fabric, and the Irish model could be very helpful in showing us how to repair it.

The unionization of francophone journalists began in 1944, shortly after {{the enactment of the}} «Loi des relations ouvrières». By this time, these newspapers already displayed most of the major characteristics that we would recognize today: large-scale circulation, the importance of advertising in the overall composition of their income, etc. The newspapers were, however, still owned by just a few families. With the exception of Le Devoir, it was a period of prosperity for the dailies. The work of journalists involved a little of everything (weather reports, photo captions [...] .). Their conditions of work (low wages, long hours) did not differ significantly from the situation faced by most other non-unionized workers. The first journalists' union was created at La Presse in 1944. It was, in fact, a local of the Syndicat de l'Industrie du Journal (S. I. J.) which brought together several newspaper occupations. This union was affiliated to the Canadian and Catholic Confederation of Labour (C. C. C. L.). Several months later, the S. I. J. founded a journalists' local at the daily Le Devoir which was certified on the 24 th of January 1945. The Syndicat des Journalistes de Quebec was recognized by the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> <b>Commission</b> on the 28 th of June 1950. In the meantime, in 1948, journalists in Montreal decided to form a new union and requested certification as the Syndicat des Journalistes de Montreal. This union established locals at La Presse and Le Devoir. Thus, by 1950, all of the journalists in the francophone dailies considered in this study were organized into unions and affiliated with the Federation de l'Imprimerie which, in turn, was part of the C. C. C. L. It appears that it was the C. C. C. L. that took the initiative in unionizing thèse journalists. Their recruitment {{was part of a larger}} program set out by the Federation de l'Imprimerie. As regards the journalists at Le Soleil in Quebec City, it was the Syndicat des Journalistes de Montreal which initiated their organization. Montreal journalists, in effect, wished to protect themselves from the competition of nonunionized journalists elsewhere in the province. The appearance of unions in the editorial offices of The Montreal Star and The Gazette came only in the 1970 s, some thirty years after the unionization of the francophone dailies. This period was marked by a growing concentration of ownership in the industry, especially by large corporations. It was a more difficult period for all of the dailies and for their journalists. The Montreal Newspaper Guild was certified to represent the journalists working for The Montreal Star on the 8 th of May 1972 and the journalists at The Gazette on the 22 nd of December 1977. Both the relatively recent visible presence of the Guild in Canada and the prevailing labour relations climate in these newspaper explain why unionization came later among anglophone journalists. Among the major reasons leading to their eventual unionization should be noted the move towards greater concentration of ownership, the inflationary climate of the time, the arrival of visual display units in the composing rooms and the influence of the already unionized francophone journalists. That the anglophone journalists gravitated towards the Guild can be explained by its traditional preoccupation with professional matters...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the role of principals in ensuring the implementation of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act at school. It was also to determine if District Officials in Sedibeng West: cluster five are supporting the principals in their efforts to ensure that educators are in line with the expectation of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act. This investigation was prompted by school principals who failed to implement the Act as expected in their respective schools, as well as principals who could manage their schools effectively, but could not sustain the standard for a longer period. To investigate the problem, a literature study and empirical research were undertaken. The literature survey focused on an overview of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act, the importance of <b>labour</b> <b>relations</b> at school level, operational management of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act at school level and the Employment of Educators Amendment Act. The literature study focused on training and development (Labour Issues in Education), a systems approach to training and development, the role of principals in supporting professional development, designing professional development programmes and introducing techniques for professional development on-the-job. The empirical investigation obtained the required information from Principals, Deputy Principals, HODs and educators plus the data. The study revealed that principals, deputy principals, HODs and educators need urgent training in the following aspects of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act i. e. the aims of the Act, strike action, unfair dismissal, dismissal for misconduct, dismissal for incapacity and incompetence and discipline at the workplace. iv The research findings revealed that the District Office (Sedibeng West: <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Unit) should train and develop educators on a regular basis in dealing with the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act, design a database, so that all the cases (especially the core statistics) will be easily accessible, induct newly appointed educators (i. e. principals, deputy principals, HODs, educators:PL 1) properly, monitor principals' work on a regular basis in order to ensure that the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act is fully implemented at school level, and have a programme that will ensure that all educators (especially principals) attend in-service training on an annual basis, because we are living in a dynamic and transformational type of education. Recommendations have therefore been made so that District Officials (<b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Officials) can assist principals in ensuring that the <b>Labour</b> <b>Relations</b> Act is implemented and owned by educators. vMaster...|$|R
