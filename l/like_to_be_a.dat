The tour features a ninety-minute behind-the-scenes look at the props, masks, costumes and sets used in the show, and includes a question-and-answer session with the cast members.

They also advocate the creation of websites which would suggest that the wider community supports organ donation in order to nudge people into becoming organ donors themselves.|$|R

40|$|By using Heidegger’s {{concept of}} Da-sein {{this paper will}} {{investigate}} the meaning that airport customers ascribe to the airport. Looking at {{the meaning of the}} airport experience for individual airport customers will allow researchers to develop an understanding of what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>an</b> airport. This understanding of being in <b>an</b> airport <b>is</b> <b>a</b> novel approach <b>to</b> the management literature which has in the past focused on the effective management of airports. The knowledge of what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>an</b> airport will enable management to better care for the airport passenger or visitor, to create a more hospitable environment and therefore lead to their becoming the preferred airport...|$|R
