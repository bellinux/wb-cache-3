40|$|In deep-space optical communications, acquisition, tracking, and {{pointing}} are all challenging {{because of the}} stringent—on the order of submicroradian—pointing requirement. To achieve this level of pointing accuracy, one must maintain high-bandwidth tracking control. Feasible tracking sources (beacons) include uplink laser beams and celestial objects such as the Earth, Moon, and stars. However, these tracking sources do not all provide the kilohertz tracking rate needed for pointing in deep space. One approach to enable a high tracking rate is to augment the tracking loop with inertial sensors to estimate high-frequency beacon movements. In this article, we discuss the use of <b>linear</b> <b>accelerometers,</b> mounted in a configuration to measure angular displacement, to achieve high-bandwidth tracking with dim beacon sources.

Recently, a new impetus {{has been}} given to work to produce a whole body human/computer {{interface}} system, which encumbers the wearer to a minimum degree and operates over long distances.

Since human limb segments are capable of arbitrary motion, Euler angles do not provide an appropriate means for specifying orientation. Instead, quaternions are used for this purpose. Since a quaternion is a four-dimensional vector, and a MARG sensor produces nine signals, this data processing problem is "overspecified". This fact can be used to discriminate against sensor noise and to reduce the effects of linear acceleration on measurement of the gravity vector by accelerometers.

In the present study, the onset of action and tremor-inducing effect of two doses of inhaled salmeterol (50 and 100 µg) were compared with inhaled salbutamol (200 and 400 µg) and placebo.

It comprises an iPhone with an embedded triaxial <b>linear</b> <b>accelerometer,</b> custom software to estimate body tilt, a “tactor bud ” accessory that plugs into the headphone jack to provide vibrotactile cues of body tilt, and a battery.

Methods. We enrolled 109 patients (78 males, age 62 ± 13 years) referred for exercise stress echocardiography and 16 controls. The PASP was derived from the tricuspid Doppler tracing. A cut-off value of PASP ≥ 50 mmHg at peak stress was considered as indicative of abnormal increase in PASP. Diastolic times and the diastolic/systolic time ratio were recorded by a precordial cutaneous force sensor based on a <b>linear</b> <b>accelerometer.</b> Results At baseline, PASP was 30 ± 5 mmHg in patients and 25 ± 4 in controls.
