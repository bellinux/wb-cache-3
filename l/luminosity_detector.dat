40|$|Abstract—The recent {{availability}} of blue sensitive silicon pho-tomultipliers allows the direct readout of blue emitting plastic scintillator tiles {{without the use}} of a wavelength shifting fiber.

40|$|The {{luminosity}} at {{the four}} interaction points of the Large Hadron Collider must be continuously monitored {{in order to provide}} an adequate tool for the control and optimization of the collision parameters and the beam optics. At both sides of the interaction points absorbers are installed to protect the super-conducting accelerator elements from quenches causes by the deposited energy of collision products. The <b>luminosity</b> <b>detectors</b> will be installed in the copper core of these absorbers to measure the electromagnetic and hadronic showers caused by neutral particles that are produced at the proton-proton collision in the interaction points.

40|$|A {{first study}} of single diffractive central high-p{sub T} dijet events in p{bar p} {{collisions}} at center-of-mass energy {radical}s = 1. 96 TeV is presented, using data {{recorded by the}} D 0 detector at the Tevatron during RunIIa in 2002 - 2004. The total integrated luminosity corresponding to the data sample is 398 pb{sup - 1 }. A diffractive sample is selected using a rapidity gap approach. A precise definition of the rapidity gap constitutes {{the first part of}} the thesis. The rapidity gap is defined by means of two parts of the D 0 <b>detector</b> [...] <b>luminosity</b> <b>detectors</b> and calorimeter. <b>Luminosity</b> <b>detectors</b> serve as a basic indicators of diffractive candidates and the calorimeter is used to confirm the low energy activity in the forward region (a rapidity gap). Presented studies of energy deposited in forward part of calorimeter by various types of events yield two rapidity gap definitions. Both of them use a fixed rapidity interval in calorimeter |{eta}| {element_of} [2. 6, 5. 2] and introduce an upper limit on the energy deposited in this region. First definition, which corresponds to the lowest systematical errors, uses a limit of 10 GeV, an energy limit in the second definition is set to 3 GeV. This alternative definition corresponds to the lowest contamination of diffractive sample by non-diffractive events, on the other hand it is accompanied with rejection of high percentage of diffractive candidates. Using the gap definition dijet diffractive data are then selected and compared to inclusive dijet events in various distributions. The main focus is to measure the difference in azimuthal angles between two leading jets in events with at least two high p{sub t} central jets. This variable is sensitive to the dynamics of the process. Indeed, the results show the different behavior of {Delta}{phi} distributions between the inclusive and diffractive samples. It is also shown that this difference is bigger for lower p{sub T} jets. Other distributions presented in the thesis show that most of the properties are the same for inclusive and diffractive events. The only observed difference is in the transversal properties of the jets, which could be explained as that diffractive jets are narrower than inclusive ones. Results are compared to Monte Carlo Pomwig (for diffractive sample) and Herwig (for inclusive sample); both show a good agreement with the data...|$|R

40|$|The International Linear Collider (ILC) is a {{proposed}} electron-positron collider with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV, and a peak luminosity of 2 · 10 ^ 34 cm^- 2 s^- 1. The ILC will complement the Large Hadron Collider, a proton-proton accelerator, and provide precision measurements, which may help in solving {{some of the}} fundamental questions at the frontier of scientific research, such as the origin of mass and the possible existence of new principles of nature. The linear collider community has set a goal to achieve a precision of 10 ^- 4 on the luminosity measurement at the ILC. This may be accomplished by constructing a finely granulated calorimeter, which will measure Bhabha scattering at small angles. The Bhabha cross-section is theoretically known to great precision, yet the rate of Bhabha scattering events, which would be measured by the <b>luminosity</b> <b>detector,</b> will be influenced by beam-beam effects, and by the inherent energy spread of the collider. The electroweak radiative effects can be calculated to high precision and partially checked with events with final state photon radiation by distinguishing between the observable energy deposits of electrons and of photons in the luminosity calorimeter, using a clustering algorithm. In order to achieve the design goal, the geometrical parameters of the calorimeter need to be reevaluated.

40|$|The photosensory pineal {{complex of}} anurans {{comprises}} an extracranial part, the frontal organ, and an intracranial part, the pineal organ proper. Although the pineal organ functions mainly as a <b>luminosity</b> <b>detector,</b> the frontal organ monitor the relative proportions of short and intermediate/long wavelengths in the ambient illumination. The major pathway of information processing in the pineal and frontal organs is the photoreceptor to ganglion cell synapse. It {{is not known}} whether interneurons form part of the neural circuitry. In the present study, we demonstrate GABA-immunoreactive (GABA-IR) neurons in the pineal and frontal organs of the frog, Rana esculenta. No GABA-IR axons were observed in the pineal nerve between the frontal and pineal organs, or in the pineal tract that connects the pineal complex with the brain. The GABA-IR neurons differed in morphology from centrally projecting neurons visualized by retrograde labeling with horseradish peroxidase. Thus, we suggest that the GABA-IR neurons in the pineal and frontal organs represent local interneurons. Axons of central origin, immunoreactive with a sensitive antiserum against the tetrapeptide Phe-Met-Phe-Arg-NH 2 (FMRFamide), were observed in the intracranial portion of the photosensory pineal organ. The immunoreactive axons enter the caudal pole of the pineal organ via the posterior commissure. The largest density of axons was observed in the caudal part, while fewer axons were detected in the rostral portion. The uneven distribution of the FMRFamide-immunoreactive axons {{may be related to}} the distribution of different types of intrapineal neurons. FMRFamide-immunoreactive varicose axons were observed in the extracranial frontal organ. A central innervation of the pineal organ, previously known exclusively from amniotes, is probably not per se linked with the evolutionary transition of the pineal organ from a directly photosensory organ to a neuroendocrine organ.
