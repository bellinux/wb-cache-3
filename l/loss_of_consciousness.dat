5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues about whether the definition should include only those injuries in which <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> occurs.|$|E

40|$|One hundred {{psychiatric}} {{patients were}} carefully matched with 100 physically ill {{patients and their}} driving records compared. The psychiatric patients were consuming far greater quantities of psychotropic drugs and included {{a larger number of}} alcoholics and heavy drinkers. During the six months before admission {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups of patients with respect to accident and traffic code infringements. Apart from individual patients, drugs did not appear to be influencing the outcome in statistical terms. Alcoholics and heavy drinkers showed an increased lifetime accident liability. No specific psychiatric diagnosis was otherwise associated with increased accident rates. The majority of accidents reported were relatively trivial. Differing opinions have been expressed on whether physically ill or mentally ill drivers have higher than expected rates of road traffic accidents or more frequent violations of traffic rules than healthy drivers.

40|$|We {{argue that}} thought {{insertion}} primarily involves {{a disruption of}} the sense of ownership for thoughts and that the lack of a sense of agency is but a consequence of this disruption.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>consciousness,</b> following severe brain injury or during anesthesia, is changing rapidly.

40|$|Transient <b>losses</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{and muscular}} tone that {{characterize}} syncope {{are due to}} a sudden decrease of {{blood flow to the}} brain. Nevertheless, in part of patients reporting syncope episodes the classic diagnostic process do not lead to a proper organic etiology – e. g. neutrally mediated or cardiac. Psychological non-organic factors like emotional dysregulation or anxiety mechanisms might act as triggers for those clinical manifestations. Given the link between affective experience and sympathetic-parasympathetic autonomic system, this research aims at investigating the hypothesis of a psychogenic etiopathogenesis and at sketching a clearer picture of affective responses in syncope. Control (healthy volunteers) and clinical (syncope patients with no organic etiology) groups were presented with arousing affective visual stimuli and assessed by psychometric tests. In order to explore both automatic and conscious processing of affective information, we recorded participants’ psychophysiological responses (autonomic and EEG) and subjective appraisal ratings (valence and arousal). The comparison of psychometric, electrophysiological and autonomic data across patients and control subjects showed anomalous response profiles, with partially incongruent autonomic automatic psychophysiological responses and conscious appraisal ratings. While the dysregulation of psychophysiological responsivity might characterize syncope profiles, the complexity of clinical pictures suggest that there may exist different non-organic syncope subtypes...|$|R
5|$|While diving, {{the emperor}} penguin's oxygen use is {{markedly}} reduced, as its heart rate {{is reduced to}} as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its haemoglobin and myoglobin are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and fMRI. These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is poisonous. A case of {{poisoning}} {{was reported}} from Finland, where three individuals {{believed they had}} consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had central nervous system manifestations and cholinergic symptoms, including hallucinations, confusion, or <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24hours without any damage to liver, kidneys or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of Amanita regalis. Chemical analysis has shown that this species contains ibotenic acid and muscimol, the same toxic constituents as Amanita muscaria.|$|E
40|$|Background Accurate {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} changes in responses to external stimuli is crucial for characterizing the timing <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> induced by anesthetic drugs. We studied induction and emergence from unconsciousness achieved by administering a computer-controlled infusion of propofol to ten human volunteers. We evaluated <b>loss</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> by having subjects execute every 4 s two interleaved computer delivered behavioral tasks: responding to verbal stimuli (neutral words or the subject's name), or less salient stimuli of auditory clicks. New method We analyzed the data using state-space methods. For each stimulus type the observation model is a two-stage binomial model and the state model is two dimensional random walk in which one cognitive state governs the probability of responding and the second governs the probability of correctly responding given a response. We fit the model to the experimental data using Bayesian Monte Carlo methods. Results During induction subjects lost responsiveness to less salient clicks before losing responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli. During emergence subjects regained responsiveness to the more salient verbal stimuli before regaining responsiveness to the less salient clicks. Comparison with existing method(s) The current state-space model is an extension of previous model used to analyze learning and behavioral performance. In this study, the probability of responding on each trial is obtained separately from the probability of behavioral performance. Conclusions Our analysis provides a principled quantitative approach for defining <b>loss</b> and recovery <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> in experimental studies of general anesthesia.

40|$|Accurately {{measuring}} the neural correlates <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> {{is a grand}} challenge for neuroscience. Despite theoretical advances, developing reliable brain measures to track the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> reportable <b>consciousness</b> during sedation is hampered by significant individual variability in susceptibility to anaesthetics. We addressed this challenge using high-density electroencephalography to characterise changes in brain networks during propofol sedation. Assessments of spectral connectivity networks before, during and after sedation were combined with measurements of behavioural responsiveness and drug concentrations in blood. Strikingly, we found that participants who had weaker alpha band networks at baseline {{were more likely to}} become unresponsive during sedation, despite registering similar levels of drug in blood. In contrast, phase-amplitude coupling between slow and alpha oscillations correlated with drug concentrations in blood. Our findings highlight novel markers that prognosticate individual differences in susceptibility to propofol and track drug exposure.

5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness.</b> This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness).</b> Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous rehydration or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> <b>consciousness</b> or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E

In the absence of any of the other, rarer, causes of villous atrophy, this woman appears to have had coeliac disease. The unexpected finding of an abnormal jejunal mucosa, with villous atrophy, is usually due to subclinical coeliac disease, or dermatitis herpeti-formis, although immunodeficiency, giardiasis, or gastrinoma 2 are other, rarer, causes.
