25|$|The final morning began poorly for Australia with Mohammad Rafique {{picking up}} the wickets of Gilchrist (12) and Warne (5) cheaply to have Australia in trouble at 6-231 still {{requiring}} 76 for victory. However, Ponting remained resolute in defence as he uncharacteristically crawled his way towards a century. He was joined by Lee and together they put on 46 for the 7th wicket. But the new ball turned Bangladesh's fortunes and Lee's wicket in the lead up to lunch gave them some hope. Their biggest opportunity came when Ponting skied a pull shot on 98 only to be dropped by Mashrafe Mortaza at fine leg. He proceeded to his 31st test century in the final over before <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cover drive to the fence. Now joined by Gillespie, victory was delayed only by the lunch break. Ponting remained not out on 118. Mohammad Rafique finished with match figures of 9-160. Adam Gilchrist was named man of the match.|$|E

25|$|With the new ball due six overs {{into the}} fourth day Sri Lankan wickets fell thick and fast, half the team falling before lunch, the last of which being opener Michael Vandort who {{narrowly}} missed out on being the fifth batsmen ever to hold his wicket throughout an entire innings. England took to the crease just before <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very slow run rate that came only from Strauss - Trescothick fell after nine runs, none of them contributed by him. The third man, Alastair Cook held out {{for the rest of}} the innings though achieving 34 not out; during this time Strauss fell to a controversial catch, replays showed it popped off his pads. Pietersen, wanting to end the Test quickly, took the wicket with his usual speed, taking 13 runs off 25 balls his confidence assured by a catch by the tourists' skipper to be called a no ball, and a further two no balls which he took boundaries off. However, his cockiness proved his downfall as he lashed out at a ball from Murali, the only bowler to take wickets in the second innings, and was caught plumb. Collingwood soon fell for 3 and it seemed as if the easy target of 78 was going to be more of a struggle but Cook, remaining from the second partnership, took two runs and two byes and skipper Flintoff, who done nothing with his first three balls, drove Murali down the ground to long on for four on his fourth ball to win the match, and his third in a row as English skipper.|$|E
500|$|After having <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{representative}} from Hodder & Stoughton, who published her detective stories, Heyer felt that her host had patronized her. The company had an option on her next book; {{to make them}} break her contract, she wrote Penhallow, which the 1944 Book Review Digest described as [...] "a murder story but not a mystery story". Hodder & Stoughton turned the book down, thus ending their association with Heyer, and Heinemann agreed to publish it instead. Her publisher in the United States, Doubleday, also disliked the book and ended their relationship with Heyer after its publication.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held in September 1955 and lasted for five days; {{attendees}} remembered that the weather was very hot. The courtroom was filled to capacity with 280 spectators; black attendees sat in segregated sections. Press from major national newspapers attended, including black publications; black reporters were required {{to sit in the}} segregated black section and away from the white press, farther from the jury. Sheriff Strider welcomed black spectators coming back from <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cheerful, [...] "Hello, Niggers!" [...] Some visitors from the North found the court to be run with surprising informality. Jury members were allowed to drink beer on duty, and many white male spectators wore handguns.|$|E

"Green" [...] roams the corridors, first {{following}} Yeoman Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney) {{into the}} botanical laboratory as she brings Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu (George Takei) his <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> salt shaker. A {{plant in the}} lab shrieks and shrinks in fear {{at the entrance of}} the creature, causing alarm. The creature then moves on, attacking several crew members, killing one. It then shape-shifts into the form of McCoy. Meanwhile, Spock confirms that scans show only one person, Crater, on the planet; Kirk and Spock beam down to capture him. They find Green's body before Crater tries to frighten them away with phaser fire. After they stun him with a phaser beam, the dazed Crater reveals that his real wife was killed by the creature—the last member of a long-dead civilization of shape-shifters who feed on salt—a year earlier. The creature continues to take on the appearance of Nancy out of affection for Crater, and he has been feeding it. Kirk informs Enterprise of the creature's intrusion, as the away team and Crater transport back to the ship.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} the 1920s that Leloir invented salsa golf (golf sauce). After being served prawns with the usual sauce during <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group of friends at the Ocean Club in Mar del Plata, Leloir {{came up with a}} {{peculiar}} combination of ketchup and mayonnaise to spice up his meal. With the financial difficulties that later plagued Leloir's laboratories and research, he would joke, [...] "If I had patented that sauce, we'd have a lot more money for research right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than {{accepting}} {{responsibility for}} a transgression through {{the form of an}} apology, a transgressor who explains why they engaged in a behavior is engaging in excuses or justifications. [...] While excuses and justifications aim to minimize blame on the transgressor, the two address blame minimization from completely opposite perspectives. Excuses attempt to minimize blame by focusing on a transgressor’s inability to control their actions (e.g., “How would I have known my exgirlfriend was {{going to be at the}} party.”) or displace blame on a third party (e.g., “I went to lunch with my exgirlfriend because I did not want to hurt her feelings.”). [...] Conversely, a justification minimizes blame by suggesting that actions surrounding the transgression were justified or that the transgression was not severe. [...] For example, a transgressor may justify having <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> past romantic interest, suggesting to their current partner that the lunch meeting was of no major consequence (e.g., “We are just friends.”).|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} the war Low started the Low Engineering Company Ltd in {{association}} with the Hon. C. N. Bruce (later Lord Aberdare). [...] The company offices were on Kensington High Street, and Low spent much of his time trying to bring his inventions to fruition. [...] As usual though he was easily distracted by gadgets that he devised, taking his attention away from the more important work. [...] One of the better gadgets was a motor scooter that Low invented and manufactured in conjunction with Sir Henry Norman. Despite his best efforts, business wasn't his strong point. [...] An example of this is the magazine he started up with his friend Lord Brabazon and others. [...] It was entitled Armchair Science, Low helped edit it, and at one point the sales figures were 80,000 a month, yet it never seemed to make a profit and was sold off. [...] Another of Low's delights was speed, especially racing cars or motorbikes. [...] He was a regular attendee at Brooklands and at one point invented a rocket propelled bike and numerous other gadgets and improvements for the internal combustion engine. [...] An example of Low's prescience is that he was worried about the number of road traffic accidents that were occurring and believed speed in cities should be restricted to 25mph using modern radio methods to enforce it. [...] One of Low's peeves was excess noise, to this end he invented an audiometer to measure and record noise in a visual form. [...] He conducted experiments on the London Underground and achieved some success in pinpointing trouble spots and reducing their impact by use of shields over the wheels and padding of the interior panels. In 1938 Low had <b>lunch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> gentleman called William Joyce. [...] Joyce wanted Low to contribute an article to a paper he helped run. [...] Low declined the offer being too busy; it was only {{a couple of years later}} that Joyce gained infamy as Lord Haw-Haw.|$|E
