50|$|The {{underlying}} {{storage mechanism}} of graph databases can vary. Some {{depend on a}} relational engine and “store” the graph data in a table (although a table is a <b>logical</b> <b>element,</b> therefore this approach imposes another level of abstraction between the graph database, the graph database management system and the physical devices where the data is actually stored). Others use a key-value store or document-oriented database for storage, making them inherently NoSQL structures. Most graph databases based on non-relational storage engines also add the concept of tags or properties, which are essentially relationships having a pointer to another document. This allows data elements to be categorized for easy retrieval en masse.|$|E

Each neuron is apparent (not hidden as in classical architectures) and is associated to a <b>logical</b> <b>element.</b> The recognition proceeds by repetitive perceptive cycles, propagating the information through the layers. In case of low recognition rate output, an enhancement is proceeded by error backpropagation leading to correct or choose a more adapted input feature subset.

The {{efficiency of}} a QCA circuit is {{depends on the}} efficiency of the MV. This paper presents an efficient single layer five-input majority voter gate (MV 5). The structure of proposed MV 5 is very simple and easy to implement in any logical circuit. This proposed MV 5 reduce number of cells and use conventional QCA cells. However, using MV 5 a multilayer 1 -bit full-adder (FA) is designed. The functional accuracy of the proposed MV 5 and FA are confirmed by QCADesigner a well-known QCA layout design and verification tools. Furthermore, the power dissipation of proposed circuits are estimated, which shows that those circuits dissipate extremely small amount of energy and suitable for reversible computing. The simulation outcomes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed circuit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper offers}} a new {{technique}} for designing fuzzy controllers as analog hardware devices on bases of CMOS implementation of multi-valued logical functions. This approach is based on using a summing amplifier with saturation as a building block that {{can be considered as}} a multi-threshold <b>logical</b> <b>element.</b> The functional completeness in an arbitrary-valued logic of a summing amplifier with saturation is proven. This fact gives a theoretical background for an analog implementation of fuzzy devices. In contrast with the traditional software approach to fuzzy controller implementations based on explicit fuzzification, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification procedures, hardware implementations of fuzzy controllers as analog devices have advantages of higher speed, lower power consumption, smaller die area and more. Universal and proper design methods for such type of hardware are offered. The paper illustrates design examples for real industrial fuzzy controllers and provides SPICE simulation results of their functioning...|$|E
