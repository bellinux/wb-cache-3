The high cost of these industrial products is often crippling for farmers, who are reluctant to make such an investment, given the uncertain climate. To overcome these obstacles, experiments have been made using small doses (known as micro-doses) of fertiliser, and placing them directly into the soil {{at the time of}} sowing. An FAO fertiliser project showed an increase in yields of both millet and sorghum from using this technique. For example, the application of 20 kg/ha of Di-ammonium phosphate 18 - 46 - 0 (DAP) into the hole, together with the seed, produces an increase in yield of around 70 %. A secondary advantage of this method is the small amount of fertiliser used overall, with the obvious benefits to the environment. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Niger, together with local partner organisations involved in agricultural research such as the Institut de <b>l</b> <b>environnement</b> et recherches agricoles (INERA) in Burkina Faso, the Institut d économie rurale au Mali (IER) in Mali and the Institut national de recherche agronomique du Niger (INRAN) in Niger have also carried out promising trials using sorghum and millet, which resulted in higher yields for both crops. In Niger, farmers are now being trained in this technique and field schools are being established. Using fertiliser in {{countries of the}} South is often fraught with problems.

40|$|Tibi Guissou, {{microbiologist}} at the INERA {{agricultural research}} institute. Generally a reserved character, Tibi Guissou lights {{up when he}} talks about two topics his research on micro-organisms which live in symbiosis with plants and Spore. His first encounter with the magazine dates back to 1994. At the time, he was finishing his university studies and was doing an internship at the Institut de <b>l</b> <b>environnement</b> et de recherches agricoles (INERA), the agricultural research institute in Burkina Faso where he now works. He found the magazine lying on a table, flicked through it and was captivated. But being a prudent suitor, he was at first happy just to read it, allowing himself occasional furtive visits to his beloved, of whom he still considered himself unworthy. As a young student, I didn t know how to get the magazine, he recalls. I never imagined that I too could receive it. Mr Guissou took his time before subscribing to Spore in 1997. Ever since, his favourite magazine has had a special place on his desk. The issues have piled up over the years. When it fails to arrive on time, he rushes to the documentation centre. Impatient, he fears the worst. In the Netherlands, would the parents of his beloved prevent her from coming out? He could quite believe it, since in his country, a prospective husband must tend the fields of his future in-laws and make them gifts. And he knows he has done none of these things. Then, another thought comes to mind: could she have been carried off by some rival, perhaps by the postman? Comparing the magazine to a talented chef, he confides, I want to discover what she has prepared, in the hope that this time, the dish will be even better than the one before. Like any attentive companion, Spore, plies him with advice. Working on a water and soil conservation project in 1994, Mr Guissou began experimenting with living hedges. These natural barriers protect plants from strong winds in the dry season and ensure that market gardeners get a good crop of vegetables. But to introduce a new technique, {{it is not enough to}} shout it from the rooftops. You need to know how to put across the message, and engineers are not always very good at that. The technical publications and leaflets I order help me to develop the right approach for dealing with rural communities. As a result, I am better able to judge what kind of message to get across to people, and can more easily assess their needs and take their concerns into consideration, explains Mr Guissou. In the articles he writes for specialist magazines, he frequently quotes Spore. Unlike other publications which focus too much on one aspect, Spore has a more multi-disciplinary approach, observes the researcher, who has done work on the jujube, inspired by an article from the magazine.

40|$|DANS LE CADRE DE CE TRAVAIL, JE ME PENCHE SUR DES PRODUCTIONS ETRANGES ET INCONGRUES DANS, LE PAYSAGE EDITORIAL DE NOTRE SOCIETE, Á SAVOIR DES OBJETS LIVRES CONCUS Á PARTIR DE SUPPORTS ET MATERIAUX TRES DIVERS (PLOMB, ACIER, PLEXIGLAS, VERRE, ETC.) J APPREHENDE LA MANIERE DONT TOUS CES MATERIAUX ET TECHNIQUES VIENNENT S AGENCER AUTOUR DU TEXTE - POETIQUE - ET ORGANISER SA MISE EN ESPACE OU MISE EN CORPS. LES OBJETS LIVRES QUI NAISSENT ATTESTENT D UN DIALOGUE PROFOND ET INTIME : LE TEXTE SE PLIE PARFOIS Á L OBJET MAIS LA RECIPROQUE EST VRAIE; LITTERATURE ET ESTHETIQUE OEUVRENT DE CONCERT. CES LIVRES SE DONNENT Á VOIR, Á LIRE ET Á PENSER; ILS SUSCITENT PAR LEUR RIGUEUR QUASI CONCEPTUELLE DES INTERROGATIONS PHILOSOPHIQUES ET DES MEDITATIONS ESTHETIQUES QUE JE TENTERAI DE CERNER. POUR MOI, LA NOTION DE LIVRE OBJET, DE LIVRE SCULPTURE, EST INTERESSANTE CAR ELLE INTERROGE LE LIVRE DANS SA FORME TRADITIONNELLE D ASSEMBLAGE DE CAHIERS COUSUS OU COLLES, COMPOSES DE FEUILLES. IL Y A UNE MISE EN ESPACE QUI FAIT QUE LA DEFINITION MEME DE LIVRE NE VA PLUS DE SOI. ELLE INTERROGE AUSSI L ECRITURE DANS SON STATUT, TANT IL EST VRAI QUE DANS UN OBJET LIVRE, LE TEXTE EST PARFOIS AMENE Á DISPARAITRE, ETANT LITTERALEMENT IMPLIQUE, AU SENS LATIN D ENVELOPPE DANS L OBJET. DANS QUELLE MESURE LE TEXTE EST-IL CAPABLE DE SURVIVRE Á <b>L</b> <b>ENVIRONNEMENT</b> PLASTIQUE QUI LUI EST OFFERT? Y A-T-IL DEPERDITION OU SURCROIT DE SENS ? PAR AILLEURS L OBJET LIVRE REMET EN CAUSE NOTRE MODE DE LECTURE. IL NE SE LIT PAS DE FACON LINEAIRE MAIS DE MANIERE SPATIALE ET DYNAMIQUE. SA CONSOMMATION SE FAIT PAR LE REGARD ET LE TOUCHER; LE CORPS A UNE GRANDE PLACE DANS SON APPREHENSION. L OBJET LIVRE PROVOQUE UNE PERTE DES REPERES, IL CREE UNE SORTE D EBRANLEMENT DES SENS QU IL S AGIRA DE COMPRENDRE. C EST AUSSI LE PARADOXE D UN OBJET AUX FORMES ET LIGNES ARRETEES, MAIS QUI DEPLOIE DE MANIERE INFINIE SON UNIVERS ONIRIQUE. L ESPACE DU LIVRE COMME LIEU DE LA DILATATION. PEUT-ON ENCORE PARLER DE LIVRE ? DE LIVRE Á LA LIMITE PEUT-ETRE. QUOIQU IL EN SOIT, IL RECELE ET CELEBRE UNE ENIGME QU IL S AGIT DE DECHIFFRER. IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS WORK, I SHALL BEND OVER STRANGE AND I IMPROPER PRODUCTIONS IN THE EDITORIAL LANDSCAPE OF OUR SOCIETY, NAMELY BOOK OBJECTS CONCEIVED FROM SUPPORTS AND VERY DIVERSE MATERIALS (LEAD, STEEL, PLEXIGLAS, GLASS). I SHALL EXAMINE THE WAY ALL THESE MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES COME AND PUT THEMSELVES TOGETHER AROUND THE TEXT - ALWAYS POETIC - AND ORGANIZE THEIR PERFORMANCE IN SPACE OR HOW THEY ARE IN A WAY "SET IN BODY ". BOOKS OBJECTS WHICH ARE BORN GIVE EVIDENCE OF A DEEP AND INTIMATE DIALOGUE : THE TEXT SOMETIMES COMPLIES VVIT H THE OBJECT BUT THE REVERSE IS TRUE; LITERATURE AND AESTHETICS WORK TOGETHER. THESE BOOKS SHOW THEMSELVES, TO BE READABLE AND THINKABLE; THEY AROUSE, BY THEIR ALMOST ABSTRACT RIGOUR, PHILOSOPHIC QUESTIONINGS AND AESTHETIC MEDITATIONS WHICH I SHALL TRY TO ENCIRCLE. FOR ME, THE NOTION OF BOOK-OBJECT OR "BOOK SCULPTURE " IS A INTERESTING BECAUSE IT QUESTIONS THE BOOK IN ITS TRADITIONAL SHAPE OF ASSEMBLY OF PAGES SEWN OR STUCK, CONSISTED OF SHEETS. THERE IS A PERFORMANCE IN SPACE WHICH MAKES THAT THE DEFINITION OF BOOK IS NOT OBVIOUS MORE. IT ALSO QUESTIONS THE WRITING- IN ITS STATUS, SO MUCH IT IS TRUE THAT IN A BOOK OBJECT, THE TEXT IS SOMETIMES BROUGHT TO DISAPPEAR, BEING LITERALLY "IMPLIED ", THE WORD IMPLIED BEING TAKEN IN ITS LATIN ACCEPTION, MEANING "ENVELOPPED" WITHIN THE OBJECT. IN VVHAT MEASURE IS THE TEXT ABLE TO SUBVIVE TO THE PLASTIC A ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS OFFERED TO HIM? IS THERE DECREASE OR INCREASING OF SENSE ? BESIDES THE BOOK OBJECT QUESTIONS OUR SWAY OF READING. ONE DOESN'T READ IT IN A LINEAR WAY BUT IN A SPATIAL AND DYNAMIC WAY. ITS CONSUMPTION IS MADE BY THE GLANCE AND THE TOUCH, THE BODY HAS A BIG PLACE ITS APPREHENSION. THE BOOK-OBJECT PROVOKES INDEED A LOSS OF MARKS, IT CREATES A KIND OF SHAKING OF THE SENSES WHICH DEMAND TO BE UNDERSTOOD. IT IS ALSO THE PARADOX OF AN OBJECT VVHICH FORMS AND LINES ARE SETTLED(FIXED), BUT THAT SPREADS, DISPLAYS ITS DREAMLIKE UNIVERSE IN A INFINITE WAY. THE SPACE OF THE BOOK AS THE PLACE OF THE DILATION. CAN VVE STILL SPEAK ABOUT BOOK? OF BOOK "TO THE LIMIT" MAYBE. WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, IT CONCEALS AND CELEBRATES AN ENIGMA VVHICH I VVILL TRY TO DECIPHER.

40|$|International audienceFuel {{poverty is}} a growing concern in France. Following the hike in energy prices that started in 2004, the problem of energy {{affordability}} for low-income households entered the political debate with the " Grenelle de <b>l</b> " <b>environnement</b> " in 2007. According to the standard UK definition (10 % ratio) 3. 8 million households were subject to fuel poverty in France in 2006. We question the way fuel poverty is currently measured and compare the impact of alternative measurement approaches on the extent and composition of fuel poverty in France. Then, we identify and characterize vulnerable households that are not ordinarily poor, but can be pushed into poverty because of their fuel bills. A logit, a clog log and a mixed effect logit model are used to analyze which factors influence the probability of vulnerable households to fall into poverty. The study indicates that the proportion of fuel poor people and their characteristics differ significantly depending on the fuel poverty measure chosen. The econometric results show that the probability of falling into poverty is higher for those who are retired living alone, rent their home, use an individual boiler for heating, cook with butane or propane and have poor roof insulation. Current French fuel poverty reduction policies appear to be inappropriate given our conclusions...|$|R
