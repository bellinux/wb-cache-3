5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to <b>learn</b> <b>anything,</b> he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E

In 1988, Miles stated at the Cannes Film Festival that as an actress de Janzé was a difficult character for her to portray. When she first arrived in Kenya, Miles sought people who knew Alice {{but was unable to}} <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> substantial due to those acquaintances' confused perceptions of de Janzé; some were even uncertain as to her true nationality.|$|E

25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature.

She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E

500|$|The {{reality of}} Pinker's {{proposed}} language instinct, {{and the related}} claim that grammar is innate and genetically based, has been contested by many linguists. One prominent opponent of Pinker's view is Geoffrey Sampson whose 1997 book, [...] {{has been described as}} the [...] "definitive response" [...] to Pinker's book. Sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the 'nature versus nurture' debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind. Sampson denies there is a language instinct, and argues that children can learn language because people can <b>learn</b> <b>anything.</b> Others have sought a middle ground between Pinker's nativism and Sampson's culturalism.|$|E
500|$|It aired as {{the second}} episode of the season on May 31, 1990. The episode was written by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. The narrative features Jerry Seinfeld agreeing to attend a birthday party with his ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. During the party, Jerry tries to flirt with another woman, but fails to <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> about her except her place of work. Jerry is reluctant to ask Elaine for the woman's number {{because he does not}} talk to her about other women. Jerry's father, Morty, suggests that he [...] "stake out" [...] the woman's workplace and pretend to meet her accidentally, which Jerry does. [...] "The Stake Out" [...] is the first episode to feature Jerry's parents. The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even though I knew the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E

500|$|In {{the final}} pages, Raskolnikov, who {{at this point}} is in the prison infirmary, has a feverish dream about a plague of nihilism, that enters Russia and Europe from the east and which spreads {{senseless}} dissent (Raskolnikov's name alludes to [...] "raskol", dissent) and fanatic dedication to [...] "new ideas": it finally engulfs all of mankind. Though we don't <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> about the content of these ideas they clearly disrupt society forever and are seen as exclusively critical assaults on ordinary thinking: it is clear that Dostoyevsky was envisaging the new, politically and culturally nihilist ideas which were entering Russian literature and society in this watershed decade and with which Dostoyevsky would be in debate {{for the rest of his}} life (cp. Chernyshevsky's What Is to Be Done?, Dobrolyubov's abrasive journalism, Turgenev's Fathers and Sons and Dostoyevsky's own The Possessed). Janko Lavrin, who took part in the revolutions of the World War I era, knew Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky and many others, and later would spend years writing and researching on Dostoyevsky and other Russian classics, called this final dream [...] "prophetic in its symbolism".|$|E
500|$|Seacole's name {{appears in}} an {{appendix}} to the Key Stage 2 National Curriculum, {{as an example}} of a significant Victorian historical figure. There is no requirement that teachers include Seacole in their lessons. At the end of 2012 it was reported that Mary Seacole was to be removed from the National Curriculum. Opposing this, Greg Jenner, historical consultant to [...] Horrible Histories, has stated that while her medical achievements have been exaggerated, removing Seacole from the curriculum would be a mistake. While Peter Hitchens has argued that Seacole's accomplishments have been exaggerated because anybody who put a contrary view was afraid to be accused of racism, both Jenner and Hugh Muir have asserted that this is not the case. Susan Sheridan has argued that the leaked proposal to remove Seacole from the National Curriculum is part of [...] "a concentration solely on large-scale political and military history and a fundamental shift away from social history." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Cathy Newman argues that Michael Gove's plans for the new history curriculum [...] "could mean the only women children <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> about will be queens".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the heyday}} of the psychometric and behaviorist eras, it was {{generally}} believed that intelligence was a single entity that was inherited; and that human beings - initially a blank slate - could be trained to <b>learn</b> <b>anything,</b> provided that it was presented in an appropriate way. Nowadays an increasing number of researchers believe precisely the opposite; that there exists a multitude of intelligences, quite independent of each other; that each intelligence has its own strengths and constraints; that the mind is far from unencumbered at birth; and that it is unexpectedly difficult to teach things that go against early 'naive' theories of that challenge the natural lines of force within an intelligence and its matching domains.

50|$|More {{formally}} a {{blind signature}} scheme is a cryptographic protocol that involves two parties, a user Alice {{that wants to}} obtain signatures on her messages, and a signer Bob that is in possession of his secret signing key. At {{the end of the}} protocol Alice obtains a signature on m without Bob <b>learning</b> <b>anything</b> about the message. This intuition of not <b>learning</b> <b>anything</b> is hard to capture in mathematical terms. The usual approach is to show that for every (adversarial) signer, there exists a simulator that can output the same information as the signer. This is similar to the way zero-knowledge is defined in zero-knowledge proof systems.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, many {{have argued that}} The Holocaust Industry is an unscholarly work that {{promotes}} antisemitic stereotypes. For example, according to Israeli journalist Yair Sheleg, in August 2000, German historian Hans Mommsen called it [...] "a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti-Semitic prejudices." [...] Wolfgang Benz stated to Le Monde: [...] "It is impossible to <b>learn</b> <b>anything</b> from Finkelstein's book. At best, it is interesting for a psychotherapist." [...] The reviewer of this daily added that Norman Finkelstein [...] "hardly cares about nuance" [...] and Rony Brauman wrote {{in the preface to}} the French edition (L'Industrie de l'Holocauste, Paris, La Fabrique, 2001) that some assertions of N.

[...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body seemed to be going through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E
