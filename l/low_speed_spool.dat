40|$|An {{optimized}} rotorcraft {{propulsion system}} incorporating a foil air bearing supported Oil-Free engine coupled {{to a high}} power density gearbox using high viscosity gear oil is explored. Foil air bearings have adequate load capacity and temperature capability for the highspeed gas generator shaft of a rotorcraft engine. Managing the axial loads of the power turbine shaft (<b>low</b> <b>speed</b> <b>spool)</b> will likely require thrust load support from the gearbox through a suitable coupling or other design. Employing specially formulated, high viscosity gear oil for the transmission can yield significant improvements (approx. 2 X) in allowable gear loading. Though a completely new propulsion system design is needed to implement such a system, improved performance is possible...|$|E
40|$|A 48 -microphone planar {{phased array}} system {{was used to}} acquire noise source {{localization}} data on a full-scale Williams International FJ 44 turbofan engine. Data were acquired with the array at three different locations relative to the engine, two {{on the side and}} one in front of the engine. At the two side locations the planar microphone array was parallel to the engine centerline; at the front location the array was perpendicular to the engine centerline. At each of the three locations, data were acquired at eleven different engine operating conditions ranging from engine idle to maximum (take off) speed. Data obtained with the array {{off to the side of}} the engine were spatially filtered to separate the inlet and nozzle noise. Tones occurring in the inlet and nozzle spectra were traced to the <b>low</b> and high <b>speed</b> <b>spools</b> within the engine. The phased array data indicate that the Inflow Control Device (ICD) used during this test was not acoustically transparent; instead, some of the noise emanating from the inlet reflected off of the inlet lip of the ICD. This reflection is a source of error for far field noise measurements made during the test. The data also indicate that a total temperature rake in the inlet of the engine is a source of fan noise...|$|R
5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a USB hub detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full <b>speed</b> and <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, it will by default disable communication to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> device unless requested to switch to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices, to allow the host to send a single <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices. After the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> devices again.|$|R
50|$|A {{turbocharger}} {{relies on}} the volume and velocity of exhaust gases to spin (spool) the turbine wheel, which {{is connected to the}} compressor wheel via a common shaft. The boost pressure made can be regulated by a system of release valves and electronic controllers. The chief benefit of a turbocharger is that it consumes less power from the engine than a supercharger; the main drawback is that engine response suffers greatly because it takes time for the turbocharger to come up to <b>speed</b> (<b>spool</b> up). This delay in power delivery is referred to as turbo lag. Any given turbo design is inherently one of compromise; a smaller turbo will spool quickly and deliver full boost pressure at <b>low</b> engine <b>speeds,</b> but boost pressure will suffer at high engine RPM. A larger turbo, on the other hand, will provide improved high-rev performance at the expense of low-end response. Other common design issues include limited turbine lifespan, due to the high exhaust temperatures it must withstand, and the restrictive effect the turbine has upon exhaust flow.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} {{mentioned}} that the SuperDARN radar needs ionospheric irregularities to receive echoes, which {{are considered to be}} generated mainly by gradient-drift instability (e.g., Keskinen and Ossakow 1983), growing in intensity if the electric field and plasma density are strong enough and properly oriented. In fact, there is a weak relationship between the SuperDARN echo power and Doppler velocity (Fukumoto et al. 1999; Fukumoto et al. 2000). We therefore examined whether the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is also the <b>low</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observations by checking the echo power around the above limit. The result is that the echo power is mostly 3 to 25  dB, well above the noise level (0  dB) around the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS (250 to 300  m/s) (not shown in the figure). Therefore, we can say that the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SAPS is not the <b>lowest</b> <b>speed</b> limit of SuperDARN observation.|$|R
