5|$|Like {{much of the}} country, and {{particularly}} Texas, Galveston boomed in the 1920s. But even the Great Depression did not stop Galveston's run of prosperity. Despite the financial ruin that faced {{much of the country}} during the Depression, not a single Galveston bank failed and unemployment was almost unheard of. Key business sectors in Galveston during the Free State era were casinos and prostitution, in addition to many legitimate businesses. During much of the period, the vice industries provided the majority of employment. Two families held particular prominence on the island during this era: the Moodys controlled the largest <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests,</b> and the Maceos controlled the largest criminal enterprises. Both families were wealthy with business empires that extended beyond the island.|$|E

30|$|Second, {{we studied}} the legal {{conditions}} for the collection of data and data retention. Administrators of honeypots and honeynets, who are seen as personal data controllers {{in the eyes of}} the law, because IP addresses are considered personal data within EU law, can rely on the legal ground of <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> to collect and process personal. In production honeypots, the <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> lies in safeguarding the security of the service. In our opinion, the legal ground of <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> is applicable also for research honeypots. An adequate length of retention of personal data is also an important issue for the processing of honeypot data, since the data minimization principle applies. In situations where a researcher wants to publish data collected by honeypots and honeynets, anonymization is needed.|$|R

25|$|Although the Soviet Union's {{position}} in the crisis was as helpless as was the United States' regarding Hungary's uprising, Premier Nikolai Bulganin threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side, and to launch rocket attacks on Britain, France and Israel. Bulganin accused Ben-Gurion of supporting European colonialism, and Mollet of hypocrisy for leading a socialist government while pursuing a right-wing foreign policy. He did however concede {{in his letter to}} Eden that Britain had <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered victimisation because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} case, the data {{controller}} {{can rely on}} their <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in the cybersecurity of his network. The possible harm of privacy for the data subject (those whose IP addresses are processed) is very little. Therefore, they can process personal data in accordance with Art. 7 letter f) of the Data Protection Directive. Furthermore, this processing is also {{in accordance with the}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> of the owners whose devices were used for the attack, since this processing might help to solve their unfortunate situation.|$|R
50|$|Judge Reyna {{disagreed}} with {{the majority in the}} sense that trademark are exclusively commercial speech and should therefore be analyzed under the Central Hudson test and intermediate scrutiny. From here, Judge Reyna determined that the government does have a <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> in promoting the orderly flow of commerce and therefore, should pass intermediate scrutiny. Judge Reyna stated that when you balance the <b>legitimate</b> <b>interest</b> of the disparaging provision versus how narrowly tailored the statute is, that is makes sense that the Lanham Act should survive scrutiny.|$|R
500|$|Abbott {{concluded}} that Eiland-Hall had <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> in the website's name {{for purposes of}} political satire {{in the form of}} comedic parody. Abbott did not draw a conclusion on the third point, noting that it was unlikely that Beck would have prevailed on the [...] "bad faith" [...] issue. Abbott wrote that the determination of whether the website is defamatory would not be an issue for WIPO. Instead, the WIPO limited the case's scope to a determination of whether the website registrant had engaged in [...] "abusive domain name registration and use".|$|E
500|$|There is {{much debate}} whether a public–private divide in {{administrative}} law is necessary. It has been contended {{that such a}} division has [...] "turned {{the law in the}} wrong direction, away from flexibility of procedure and towards a rigidity reminiscent of the bad old days...". Peter Leyland and Gordon Anthony have suggested that a more desirable alternative presents itself in Northern Ireland, where the test for amenability to review is dependent on the [...] "public interest" [...] in the issue. Thus, the public–private divide does not function {{at the expense of the}} <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> of individuals.|$|E
500|$|Like {{most of the}} South, the Texas {{economy was}} devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as {{dependent}} on slaves as {{other parts of the}} South it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people {{from other parts of the}} country who wanted to escape debt, criminal prosecution, or other problems. Indeed, [...] "Gone to Texas" [...] was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{draft of}} the {{application}} to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation was considered in the paper [...] "Current legal issues relevant to forensic-psychiatric expert evaluation" [...] by Elena Shchukina and Sergei Shishkov focusing on the inadmissibility of appealing against the expert report without regard for {{the scope of the}} evaluated case. While talking about appealing against [...] "the reports", the authors of the paper, according to lawyer Dmitry Bartenev, mistakenly identify the reports with actions of the experts (or an expert institution) and justify the impossibility of the [...] "parallel" [...] examination and evaluation of the actions of the experts without regard for the scope of the evaluated case. Such a conclusion made by the authors appears clearly erroneous because abuse by the experts of rights and <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> of citizens including trial participants, of course, may be a subject for a separate appeal.|$|E
500|$|The {{same year}} that the medium of {{instruction}} was changed to Malay, the National Culture Policy (NCP) was announced. Syed Nasir Ismail described the government's policies as aimed at creating a [...] "Bumiputra Muslim identity" [...] (identiti Islam Kebumiputraan) for Malaysians. In essence, the NCP's goal was to eventually assimilate the non-indigenous peoples into an indigenous Malaysian identity. Despite stiff opposition from Chinese pressure groups, the government refused to withdraw the NCP. To foster national unity, the Rukunegara, or national ideology, was also introduced. Although the Rukunegara itself contains no references to ketuanan Melayu or the social contract, a government commentary mentioned the [...] "position of Malays and other Natives, the <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> of the other communities, and the conferment of citizenship" [...] as key aspects of the Constitution while insisting: [...] "No citizen should question the loyalty of another citizen {{on the ground that}} he belongs to a particular community." [...] One political pundit described it as a formal declaration of the social contract or [...] "Racial Bargain".|$|E
500|$|Dolores and Roger Flaherty wrote a {{positive}} {{review in the}} Chicago Sun-Times, noting how [...] "Houle blends elements of adventure, romance, humor and pathos {{in the story of}} her rookie summer as a wildlife biologist.

Schwartz, in the May 1992 edition of Smithsonian, praised Houle's prose in Wings for My Flight, and wrote that the story is [...] "told with a charming simplicity in fewer than 200 pages". Schwartz also praised Houle for including her notational system for documenting field observations, stating that it [...] "opens a window on field biology". Writing in the Library Journal, Henry T. Armistead referred to the book as [...] "well crafted and compelling, a dramatization of the classic conflict between the <b>legitimate</b> <b>interests</b> of conservationists and developers", and, [...] "highly recommended on several levels, as science, sociology, or a story". Andrew Gulliford, a professor of history and environmental studies at Fort Lewis College, noted in The Durango Herald the significance of Houle's efforts to prevent [...] "inappropriate development" [...] at Chimney Rock, which was proclaimed a U.S. National Monument by President Barack Obama in 2012. [...] "Wings for My Flight is a personal story", wrote Gulliford, [...] "but also a chronicle of environmental success. Without a doubt, peregrines saved Chimney Rock for the rest of us." ...|$|E
