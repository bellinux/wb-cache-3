5|$|Personnel {{experienced}} in direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> {{are not always}} immediately available in certain settings that require emergency tracheal intubation. For this reason, specialized devices {{have been designed to}} act as bridges to a definitive airway. Such devices include the laryngeal mask airway, cuffed oropharyngeal airway and the esophageal-tracheal combitube (Combitube). Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct <b>laryngoscopy.</b> Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks, and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

A manikin equipped with two sensors, to measure forces applied to the maxillary incisors in the axial and the transverse direction, was used. Fourteen staff anaesthetists and 16 residents each performed two <b>laryngoscopies</b> with both blades. All <b>laryngoscopies</b> resulted in successful tracheal intubation.

40|$|Multiple endotracheal {{intubation}} (ETI) attempts {{increase the risk}} of airway-related adverse events. However, little is known about autopsy findings after severe ETI-related complications. We present the detailed pathological findings of a case with severe ETI-related complications. A 77 -year-old obese male suffered cardiopulmonary arrest after choking at a rehabilitation facility. Spontaneous circulation returned after chest compressions and foreign-body removal. After multiple failed direct <b>laryngoscopies,</b> the patient was transferred to our hospital. He had massive subcutaneous emphysema, bilateral pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pneumoperitoneum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and pneumoscrotum on admission and died from hypoxic brain injury 15 hours later. Autopsy revealed severe oropharyngeal; laryngeal; and left lung lower lobe injury. The likely mechanisms of diffuse emphysema were: 1) oropharyngeal injury associated with multiple ETI attempts and excessive ventilation pressures and 2) left lung lower lobe injury associated with chest compressions and other resuscitative procedures. Multiple <b>laryngoscopies</b> can cause severe upper-airway injury, worsen respiratory status, and make ETI more difficult—a vicious circle that can be prevented by limiting ETI attempts. This is particularly important in unfavorable environments, in which backup devices and personnel are not easily obtained.

Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for <b>laryngoscopy</b> and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E
5|$|More serious {{complications}} include laryngospasm, perforation of the trachea or esophagus, pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents {{or other}} foreign bodies, fracture or dislocation of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint or arytenoid cartilages, decreased oxygen content, elevated arterial carbon dioxide, and vocal cord weakness. In {{addition to these}} complications, tracheal intubation via the nasal route carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and potentially severe nasal bleeding. Newer technologies such as flexible fiberoptic <b>laryngoscopy</b> have fared better in reducing the incidence {{of some of these}} complications, though the most frequent cause of intubation trauma remains a lack of skill {{on the part of the}} laryngoscopist.|$|E

5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by <b>laryngoscopy,</b> during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches.

5|$|Treatment of TBI varies {{based on}} the {{location}} and severity of injury and whether the patient is stable or having trouble breathing, but ensuring that the airway is patent so that the patient can breathe is always of paramount importance. Ensuring an open airway and adequate ventilation may be difficult in people with TBI. Intubation, one method to secure the airway, {{may be used to}} bypass a disruption in the airway in order to send air to the lungs. If necessary, a tube can be placed into the uninjured bronchus, and a single lung can be ventilated. If there is a penetrating injury to the neck through which air is escaping, the trachea may be intubated through the wound. Multiple unsuccessful attempts at conventional (direct) <b>laryngoscopy</b> may threaten the airway, so alternative techniques to visualize the airway, such as fiberoptic or video <b>laryngoscopy,</b> may be employed to facilitate tracheal intubation. If the upper trachea is injured, an incision can be made in the trachea (tracheotomy) or the cricothyroid membrane (cricothyrotomy, or cricothyroidotomy) in order to ensure an open airway. However, cricothyrotomy may not be useful if the trachea is lacerated below the site of the artificial airway. Tracheotomy is used sparingly because it can cause complications such as infections and narrowing of the trachea and larynx. When it is impossible to establish a sufficient airway, or when complicated surgery must be performed, cardiopulmonary bypass may be used—blood is pumped out of the body, oxygenated by a machine, and pumped back in. If a pneumothorax occurs, a chest tube may be inserted into the pleural cavity to remove the air.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

5|$|In 1913, Chevalier Jackson was {{the first}} to report a high rate of success for the use of direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson {{introduced}} a new laryngoscope blade that incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope. Also in 1913, New York surgeon Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) published results he had achieved using a laryngoscope he had recently developed. Another pioneer in this field was Sir Ivan Whiteside Magill (1888–1986), who developed the technique of awake blind nasotracheal intubation, the Magill forceps, the Magill laryngoscope blade, and several apparati for the administration of volatile anesthetic agents. The Magill curve of an endotracheal tube is also named for Magill. Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh (1897–1989) introduced a curved laryngoscope blade in 1943; the Macintosh blade remains to this day the most widely used laryngoscope blade for orotracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional <b>laryngoscopy</b> and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Computed {{tomography}} (TC) generated tridimensional (3 D) reconstructions {{allow the}} observation of cavities and anatomic structures of our body with detail. In our specialty there have been attempts to carry out virtual endoscopies and <b>laryngoscopies.</b> However, such application has been practically abandoned due to its complexity and need for computers with high power of graphic processing. Objective: To demonstrate the production of 3 D reconstructions from CTs of patients in personal computers, with a free specific program and compare them to the surgery actual endoscopic images. Method: Prospective study in which the CTs proper files of 10 patients were reconstructed with the program Intage Realia, version 2009, 0, 0, 702 (KGT Inc., Japan). The reconstructions were carried out before the surgeries and a virtual endoscopy was made to assess the recess and frontal sinus region. After this study, the surgery was digitally performed and stored. The actual endoscopic images of the recess and frontal sinus region were compared to the virtual images. Results: The 3 D reconstruction and virtual endoscopy were made in 10 patients submitted to the surgery. The virtual images had a large resemblance with the actual surgical images. Conclusion: With relatively simple tools and personal computer, we demonstrated the possibility to generate 3 D reconstructions and virtual endoscopies. The preoperative knowledge of the frontal sinus natural draining path location may generate benefits during the performance of surgeries. However, more studies must be developed {{for the evaluation of}} the real roles of such 3 D reconstructions and virtual endoscopies...|$|R

It is still controversial whether the recurrent nerve should be identified and preserved during thyroidectomy. Material and Methods: In this study 244 cases performed thyroidectomy with routine recurrent nerve dissection in Bakırkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital between January 2001 and February 2004 were evaluated regarding temporary and permanent recurrent nerve injury {{in the light of the}} literature. Results: Of these 244 cases 209 were female and 35 were male with a mean age of 43. 36 years. Mean follow up was 15 months and mean hospital stay was 2. 5 days. Preoperative diagnosis was multinodular goiter in 222 cases, thyroid carcinoma in 11 cases, diffuse toxic goiter in 6 cases and follicular neoplasia in 5 cases. Choice of operation was bilateral subtotal thyroidectomy in 114 cases, unilateral total thyroidectomy in 49 cases, unilateral total and unilateral subtotal thyroidectomy in 48 cases and bilateral total thyroidectomy in 33 cases. Mean operation time was 73 minutes. In early postoperative period symptoms suggesting recurrent nerve injury developed in 10 cases as hoarseness in 8 cases and hoarseness accompanied with respiratory distress in 2 cases. Control <b>laryngoscopies</b> performed at the end of the first postoperative month revealed recurrent nerve paralysis in 3 of the cases but at the control by the end of the sixth postoperative month 2 of these cases were improved.

The larynx may be examined by indirect <b>laryngoscopy</b> using a small angled mirror with a long handle (akin to a dentist's mirror) and a strong light. Indirect <b>laryngoscopy</b> can be highly effective, but requires skill and practice for consistent results.

All previous observations of the glottis and larynx (including those of Manuel García, Wilhelm Hack and Macewen) had been performed under indirect vision (using mirrors) until 23 April 1895, when Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Germany first described direct visualization of the vocal cords. Kirstein performed the first direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> in Berlin, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope. The death of Emperor Frederick III (1831–1888) may have motivated Kirstein to develop the autoscope.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the causes}} for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of {{miscellaneous}} factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as gastric reflux, lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for <b>laryngoscopy</b> and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. Patients who suffer from the burning mouth syndrome, most likely menopausal women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.|$|E
25|$|Until 1913, {{oral and}} maxillofacial surgery was {{performed}} by mask inhalation anesthesia, topical application of local anesthetics to the mucosa, rectal anesthesia, or intravenous anesthesia. While otherwise effective, these techniques did not protect the airway from obstruction and also exposed patients {{to the risk of}} pulmonary aspiration of blood and mucus into the tracheobronchial tree. In 1913, Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) was the first to report a high rate of success for the use of direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> as a means to intubate the trachea. Jackson introduced a new laryngoscope blade that had a light source at the distal tip, rather than the proximal light source used by Kirstein. This new blade incorporated a component that the operator could slide out to allow room for passage of an endotracheal tube or bronchoscope.|$|E
25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} (usually simply {{referred to}} as intubation), an invasive medical procedure, is the placement of a flexible plastic catheter into the trachea. For millennia, tracheotomy was considered the most reliable (and most risky) method of tracheal intubation. By the late 19th century, advances in the sciences of anatomy and physiology, {{as well as the}} beginnings of an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had reduced the morbidity and mortality of this operation to a more acceptable rate. Also in the late 19th century, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved {{to such a degree that}} direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> had finally become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation was not widely practiced until the early 20th century. The 20th century saw the transformation of the practices of tracheotomy, endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation from rarely employed procedures to essential components of the practices of anesthesia, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, gastroenterology, pulmonology and surgery.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1913, Henry H. Janeway (1873–1921) {{published}} results he {{had achieved}} using a laryngoscope {{he had recently}} developed. An American anesthesiologist practicing at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Janeway was {{of the opinion that}} direct intratracheal insufflation of volatile anesthetics would provide improved conditions for otolaryngologic surgery. With this in mind, he developed a laryngoscope designed {{for the sole purpose of}} tracheal intubation. Similar to Jackson's device, Janeway's instrument incorporated a distal light source. Unique however was the inclusion of batteries within the handle, a central notch in the blade for maintaining the tracheal tube in the midline of the oropharynx during intubation and a slight curve to the distal tip of the blade to help guide the tube through the glottis. The success of this design led to its subsequent use in other types of surgery. Janeway was thus instrumental in popularizing the widespread use of direct <b>laryngoscopy</b> and tracheal intubation in the practice of anesthesiology.|$|E

Both cricoid pressure and the BURP maneuver have the potential to worsen <b>laryngoscopy.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{tracheal}} tube exchanger is a hollow catheter, [...] in length, {{that can be}} used for removal and replacement of {{tracheal tube}}s without the need for <b>laryngoscopy.</b> The Cook Airway Exchange Catheter (CAEC) is another example of this type of catheter; this device has a central lumen (hollow channel) through which oxygen can be administered.|$|E
