5|$|The {{line was}} single tracked between Appledore and Ore on 1 October 1979, leaving a passing loop at Rye. At Winchelsea, the down {{platform}} was removed; trains {{in both directions}} now stop on the former up platform. <b>Line</b> <b>speed</b> was reduced from 85mph to 60mph, but there are additional long term speed restrictions in place, including 40mph between Doleham and Ore and 20mph across a half barrier level crossing at Winchelsea.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{introduced}} {{more stringent}} {{tests on the}} cars at the Malaysian race to ensure floor mounting systems used by Ferrari and BMW Sauber were not in breach of the regulations. After the first race {{of the season in}} Australia, the McLaren team had requested clarification of the rules regarding systems that allowed the front of the car's undertray to move upwards under aerodynamic loading at high speed. Autosport magazine reported that this movement would potentially increase straight <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b> Massa and Räikkönen said the performance of the Ferrari F2007 car would not be compromised in any way by the required modifications.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens were exchanged at , but soon they were exchanged at <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b> After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.|$|E
30|$|Two key {{requirements}} for outdoor OW systems are ever-increasing <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> and link distances. Multi-Gb/s OW <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> are feasible at modest distances {{at the time}} of writing, owing to technological advances in optical fiber technology and adaptive optics. Fiber networks are expected to advance to 100 Gb/s in the near future, providing the necessary end-point components for OW, as well. As a result, OW <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> are expected to keep up with their fiber optic counterparts, attaining ultra-high capacities per channel.|$|R

5|$|As Vettel {{maintained}} his lead, the stewards informed the Lotus team that Kovalainen {{had been caught}} speeding in the pit lane, {{for which he was}} served with a ten-second stop-and-go penalty that was taken on lap thirty-nine. Alonso set a new fastest lap and closed the gap to 1.2 seconds behind Vettel at the start of lap thirty-seven. Further back, Sutil overtook Heidfeld for twelfth on the following lap. Sutil tried to pass Kobayashi on lap thirty-eight at turn three but out-braked himself, allowing Kobayashi to retake the position. He passed the Kobayashi because of his higher straight <b>line</b> <b>speed,</b> but Sutil braked later and slid off the track, rejoining in fourteenth. One lap later, Alonso was told by his team to drive less aggressively through turns seven and eight in an effort to preserve tyre life because he was spinning his tyres under acceleration. At the conclusion of lap thirty-nine, all of the drivers had made pit stops. Vettel was leading Alonso, who was followed by Hamilton, Massa, Schumacher, Barrichello, Petrov, Hülkenberg, Kubica, Liuzzi, Kobayashi, Heidfeld, Alguersari, Sutil, Button, Senna, Kovalainen and Yamamoto. A dry line began to emerge on lap forty-one as Petrov lost control of the rear-end of his car between turns seventeen and eighteen; he slid sideways into the tyre barrier at the pit lane entry.|$|E

50|$|Virgin Trains {{provide a}} small number of Pendolino {{services}} to London at the extremes of the day. But nearly all Virgin trains use the direct main <b>line.</b> <b>Line</b> <b>speeds</b> on the loop line are currently limited to 75 mph compared to 125 mph on the fast line, making the line unattractive to the routing of fast services. As of 2011, <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> were expected to increase to 90 mph once signalling improvements are in place north of Northampton up to Rugby.|$|R
25|$|The {{production}} <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> {{was initially}} about 400 cars per shift (54 jobs per hour) {{with only one}} shift scheduled. There were frequent layoffs at this new factory while AMC's old Brampton plant located at Kennedy Road worked steady producing Jeep Wranglers.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a long {{distance}} free in front of the train the driver will see the target speed and permitted speed equal to the maximum <b>line</b> <b>speed,</b> with the distance showing the maximum distance, between 4km and 13.2km depending on the unit, train, and line.|$|E
25|$|A {{temporary}} {{speed restriction}} warning board showing R is positioned beyond {{the end of}} platforms where trains may stop between the warning board {{and the start of}} the restriction, to remind drivers of the restriction ahead. A warning or commencement board showing a diagonal line means that a TSR shown in the operating notices is not in place and trains may proceed at normal <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
50|$|In comics, motion lines (also {{known as}} {{movement}} <b>lines,</b> action <b>lines,</b> <b>speed</b> <b>lines</b> or zip ribbons) are the abstract lines that appear behind a moving object or person, parallel to its direction of movement, {{to make it}} appear as if it is moving quickly.|$|R

25|$|The Australian Rail Track Corporation has {{recently}} resleepered the track with concrete sleepers, upgraded the signals and installed new loops to increase efficiency. In mid-2011 they eased about 58 sections of curves on the line, increasing <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> for the XPT and freight trains. The curve easing was done without land purchases, so the track changes would be minor, staying within the existing corridor.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{he joined}} Ducati, taking their first win at Barcelona and fourth {{overall in the}} championship, before a {{slightly}} disappointing 2004 season on a bike with huge straight <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> but a lack of grip. He stayed in the team for the 2005 season, which saw him become competitive {{by the end of}} the year, taking two victories in Japan and Malaysia, aided by improving Bridgestone tyres.|$|E
25|$|Warning {{lights and}} bells are {{activated}} {{when the train}} is about 1km before the crossing, depending on <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b> 5seconds later the barriers start closing, which takes about 10seconds. When the barriers have closed, the bells are often set less loud. Lights and bells are stopped when the barriers have raised again. As passive warning signs there are red and white striped fences, red and white saltires for single tracks (doubled in case {{of two or more}} tracks) and sometimes advanced warning signs at 80, 160 and 240metres.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{hardware}} architecture for string matching. Our solution based on using a Bloom filter based pre-processor and a parallelized hashing engine is capable of handling wire <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> with zero false-positive probability. String matching modules are extensively used in the network security domain especially in network intrusion detection systems where {{they are required to}} operate at wire <b>line</b> <b>speeds.</b> Our analysis shows that our system is capable of matching 16000 strings and achieves throughput in excess of 100 Gbps (i. e. capable of handling 10 OC− 192 links comfortably) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{line was}} built by the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. It was four-tracked until 1984 when it was reduced to double track, with the running lines slewed over to {{increase}} <b>line</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
25|$|During the Regional Fast Rail project, {{a number}} of {{shutdowns}} were carried out to normal passenger services, with the N class being used to haul ballast trains on the Geelong line in 2003/04, {{as well as being}} hired to Freight Australia in January 2004 to haul log and grain services. Since 2007 class members have also been hired to heritage operator Seymour Railway Heritage Centre for use on its trains, as the provision of TPWS equipment permits running at full <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> over the Regional Fast Rail network.|$|E
25|$|The L class {{proved to}} be a fine {{locomotive}} for express passenger service where their high power output was put to good use hauling The Gippslander and other services at the <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, in heavy freight service they were somewhat less successful, as their relatively light weight and low factor of adhesion caused them to slip on heavy loads. Despite this, they were regularly used to haul heavy briquette trains of over 1,000 tons from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. They could also be seen on some suburban freight services.|$|E
25|$|The West Coast Main Line upgrade was a {{long-term}} project covering {{a series of}} technical aspects. Improvements included the four-tracking (from three) of the Trent Valley (a bypass of the West Midlands), redesigning the layout of several junction/stations e.g. Rugby and other associated work to increase <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b> This culminated in tilting trains at 125mph being extended to Glasgow in 2005. The cost overruns of the programme are infamous - attributed to wide scope of programme (the promise to Virgin to build a 140mph railway which would require moving block signalling) and poor project management by the defunct Railtrack.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{telecommunications}} network planning, {{the problem of}} multiplexing low <b>speed</b> <b>lines</b> onto high <b>speed</b> transmission channels provides opportunities for attractive economic solutions. In many cases, the overall costs for transmission channels runs into {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars per year. Thus, the problem of finding the minimum number of transmission channels to support low <b>speed</b> <b>lines</b> might be very important. This paper describes an exact packing algorithm (OPTPACK) for determining the packing of low <b>speed</b> <b>lines</b> onto high <b>speed</b> channels in such a way that the number of required channels is minimized...|$|R
25|$|The {{facility}} {{was composed of}} an assembly plant, parts warehouse, and engine plant, with an annual capacity of over 50,000 vehicles while employing 1,100 hourly and 500 salaried workers. The Rambler Classic was built on a <b>line</b> <b>speed</b> of 32 cars per shift. The {{facility was}} soon producing 33,000 cars annually in Canada. This assembly plant produced Rambler Americans, AMC Rebels, and later, Hornets, Concords, Gremlins, Spirits, and Eagles. A long rail spur was built south from Canadian National Railway's busy Halton Sub mainline to service the plant. New automobiles were loaded with ramps onto autoracks for rail shipment at the plant.|$|E
25|$|During {{qualifying}} for the 2010 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest times in Q2 and Q3 clinching pole by {{just over a}} tenth of second from Ferrari's Felipe Massa. From the lights Sebastian Vettel led until lap 33 when the car had what was at first {{thought to be a}} broken exhaust but was later revealed to be a spark plug problem which reduced the power and straight <b>line</b> <b>speed.</b> Over the remaining laps of the race Vettel dropped down to fourth behind both Ferraris and Lewis Hamilton where he would finish the race. Webber finished 8th.|$|E
25|$|Most reef fishes have body {{shapes that}} are {{different}} from open water fishes. Open water fish are usually built for speed in the open sea, streamlined like torpedoes to minimise friction as they move through the water. Reef fish are operating in the relatively confined spaces and complex underwater landscapes of coral reefs. For this manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} straight <b>line</b> <b>speed,</b> so coral reef fish have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. They outwit predators by dodging into fissures in the reef or playing hide and seek around coral heads.|$|E
50|$|This {{arrangement}} {{is common for}} slow speed diesel shunters, but not usually for main <b>line</b> <b>speeds.</b> The Swedish D-lok of 1925 did use it, with two motors geared to a single jackshaft with short rods between two driving axles of a 1-C-1 layout.|$|R
50|$|In China, {{high-speed}} <b>lines</b> at <b>speeds</b> between 200 and 250 km/h {{may carry}} freight or passengers. While <b>lines</b> operating at <b>speeds</b> over 300 km/h are used only by passenger CRH trains.|$|R
50|$|Market Harborough {{station is}} located on a large curve on the Midland Main Line, {{as a result of}} this <b>line</b> <b>speeds</b> through the station have always been {{relatively}} slow, at around 60 mph. The track layout is set to change significantly over the next couple of years as Network Rail engineers set about straightening the line, as part of their overall plan to increase overall <b>line</b> <b>speeds,</b> it is planned that both platforms will be extended by up to 106 metres. This work was originally scheduled to be complete by no later than 2012. Work on the re-alignment and speed improvements was postponed and a decision on the solution is due in December 2016 with work complete by March 2019.|$|R
