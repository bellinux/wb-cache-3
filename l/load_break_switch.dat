40|$|A {{stable and}} {{reliable}} {{electric power supply}} system is an inevitable pre-requisite for the technological and economic growth of any nation. Due to this, utilities must strive and ensure that the customer s reliability requirements are met and the regulators requirements satisfied at the lowest possible cost. It is known fact {{around the world that}} 90 % of the of the customer service interruptions are caused due to failure in distribution system. Therefore, it is worth considering reliability worth assessments as it provides an opportunity to incorporate the cost or losses incurred by the utilities customer as a result of power failure and this must be considered in planning and operating practices. The system modeling and simulation study is carried out on one of the district s distribution system which consists of 33 kV and 11 kV network in Bhutan. The reliability assessment is done on both 11 and 33 kV system to assess the performance of the present system and also predictive reliability analysis for the future system considering load growth and system expansion. The alternative which gives low SAIDI, SAIFI and minimum breakeven costs are being assessed and considered. The reliability of 33 kV system could be further improved by installation of <b>load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switch,</b> auto recloser and connecting with line coming from other district (reserve) at reasonable break even cost. The decision base could be further improved by having Bhutan s context interruption cost. However, the questionnaire s which may be used in Bhutan to acquire interruption costs from the customers are being proposed. The utility should have their own reliability improvement strategy depending upon their needs and requirements of the regulators. Although there is no magic bullet in managing power quality issues, utilities can maximize network performance and better serve customers by diligently addressing trouble prone areas. In order to achieve this objective, a computer program NetBas/Lesvik is used to run load flow and reliability analysis, thus selecting the alternatives either based on reliability indices or on cost benefit ratio. </p...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the result of}} pilot project that creates an intelligent outage management System which accurately locates faults in real-time and send fault details to the relevant maintenance crew. Several measures of reliability indices have been developed by the electric utility industry to measure system performance. The reliability of supply is governed by the frequency and the duration of interruptions to supply {{and the number of}} customers affected by interruption. An Outage Management System (OMS) will certainly help utilities identify and restore outages sooner and more efficiently. A fault affected zone in the distribution network can be isolated from the healthy part of the network by disconnecting the affected sector using Air Break Switches, Drift down Lift Off switches, (D. D. L. O) or Autoreclosers. That equipment can be used to optimize the restoring process by isolating smallest possible section of the network affected by fault. Without confining merely to an Outage Management System (OMS), this can be further developed to a supervisory control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) that facilitate distribution automation function with communications, help to strengthen existing distribution systems and provide a strong foundation for building a fully implemented feeder scheme. But presently Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) which is the national utility responsible for the major portion of distribution of electrical power in Sri Lanka is not taking maximum usage of automation facility of currently available equipment. There is no proper coordination between automated equipment. Also proper automatic reporting and recording system is not available. As a result of this, expected level of reliability improvement couldn't be achieved. Hence the automatic outage program can be used to overcome above shortage. Main objective of the project is to develop automatic outage reporting and controlling system for the North Western Province Branch of CEB, integrating all switching facilities like Auto recloses, GSM fault indicators, Non GSM fault indicators and <b>Load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> to improve distribution network reliability. The proposed outage management system has modern features such as Data acquisitioning from GSM fault indicators, storing the data for future analysis, indicating the fault location in network diagram, Generating the massage automatically and sending to nearest crew, and Capable of handling data base files. Since North Western Province has very complicated electrical network, Thulhiriya - Kuliyapitiy feeder which has large number of transformers and having long length is selected as pilot project considering distribution indices such as System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) using past outage data of year 2008 and 2009. Based on SynerGEE software reliability data, the locations to install new GSM type fault indicators, Non GSM type fault indicators were identified. So 10 number of GSM type fault indicators, 20 number of Non GSM type fault indicators, 08 number of DDLOs, were installed. The outage management system was developed using Visual Basic 6 for usage of at the Distribution Control Centre. Then program was installed in the control centre and executed for six months. Then the reported break down was compared with break down history of the feeder and Financial Feasibility Analysis was done. It was observed that the initial investment is paid back within first four years which indicates the implement of the Outage Management system is financially feasible. Also the significant improvement of reliability could be observed...|$|E

40|$|Current {{interruption}} {{is vital}} {{in the power}} system, as this {{makes it possible to}} control the use of different loads, change the grid configuration, and minimize damage when faults occur. This thesis presents a study of the different switch design and test circuit parameters involved in medium voltage air load break switching and how they affect the thermal interrupting capability. Mediumvoltage load break switches are common in the distribution grid, and are a cheaper option than installing circuit breakers. Medium voltage load current ratings are typically in the range of 6 – 36 kV and 400 A up to around 1 kA (50 Hz). Air is considered an environmentally benign alternative as an interrupting medium compared to SF 6 for these ratings, and is also thought to be cost-competitive compared to vacuum. However, no compact air <b>load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> for 24 kV is currently available for commercial use. Thus, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the design parameters involved, and how they affect the interrupting capability of the switch. This thesis addresses medium-voltage load current interruption in air. It is an empirical study based on an extensive test program in a medium voltage test lab, and the main results and contents of this thesis are presented in five papers. The two first are switch design parameter studies. Using a test switch that is simple and axisymmetric, yet in many aspects similar to commercial puffer devices, one test switch parameter has been changed at a time to find the air flow over-pressure needed for successful interruption. The test circuit settings are also varied to find how the interrupting capability changes with load currents in the range 400 – 880 A, and with a transient recovery voltage corresponding to IEC’s 24 kV ”mainly active load” test duty. Only the thermal phase of current interruption has been considered, i. e. the first tens of microseconds after current zero. The over-pressures needed to interrupt the load currents were typically from 0. 2 to 0. 4 bar. The third paper presents a logistic regression analysis of all the conducted interruption tests, with the goal of describing the interruption performance {{as a function of the}} main test switch design parameters and transient recovery voltage stresses. More than 3 000 interruption tests are used as input data for this analysis, which produce a mathematical expression that summarizes all the empirical results. The nozzle-to-contact diameter ratio has been found to be an important design factor. Low ratios require a substantially lower air over-pressure than high nozzle-to-contact diameter ratios in order to interrupt successfully. The choice of contact diameter important as well, where larger contact diameters require lower over-pressures, but higher mass flow rates. The nozzle length does not influence the interrupting capability very much, but the chance of successful interruption is greater when the pin contact has moved out of the nozzle at current zero. The interruption becomes more difficult with increasing current and the rate of the voltage build-up across the contacts after interruption. The other two papers are based on the current interruption experiments mentioned above, but concern details of the arc behavior and arc voltage under different currents, test design variations and air flow conditions. For typical medium-voltage and load current ratings, the arc greatly affects the air flow during current interruption. The flow through the tulip contact and nozzle is clogged during the high current part of the half-cycle, even for moderate currents and relatively large contact dimensions. The typical over-pressures needed for successful interruption correspond to air velocities that are well below supersonic level. The arc voltage is a function of several parameters, and rises with increasing air over-pressure, decreasing current, and a larger contact gap. There is also a clear visible difference in the arc appearance when it is either subjected to forced cooling or not. The typical arc voltage is a few hundred volts...|$|E

40|$|Though {{synthetic}} {{test methods}} {{are widely used}} for testing high-power circuit breakers (CBs), synthetic testing has not {{been reported in the}} literature as being extended to the testing of medium-voltage (MV) <b>load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> (LBS). This paper investigates the possibility of type testing of MV LBS using synthetic test procedures. The transient recovery voltage (TRV) required is calculated from both IEC and IEEE standards and it is shown that the IEC TRV specification results in a more severe TRV. It is found that testing with a basic Weil circuit requires two-part testing. In one test, a low-amplitude TRV with a fast rate of rise stresses the early region associated with thermal failure. In the other test, a higher-amplitude slowly rising TRV stresses the later dielectric region. However, the two-part test using the unmodified Weil circuit is shown to cause significant TRV overstressing. Insertion of a precharged capacitor and additional damping resistors into the Weil circuit at critical times using triggered spark gaps are found to be effective to reduce overstressing. Simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} use a modified synthetic test circuit to test LBS with voltage ratings of up to 38 kV and load currents of 800 A...|$|R
40|$|Near an {{electric}} arc some polymers {{can change the}} properties of an arcing medium in a beneficial manner. Such polymers, known as ablation material, decompose and evaporate when exposed to heat from {{an electric}} arc. The evaporated polymer improves current interruption capability by increased pressure and heat dissipation. The target is to use arc quenching properties of ablation material {{to reduce the size}} of <b>load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> (LBSs) that interrupts current in atmospheric air. Consequently, the air insulated LBSs can be more competitive to more compact SF 6 insulated breakers. The present thesis is an experimental study of polypropylene (PP) as ablation material. Experiments are performed in a medium-voltage (MV) laboratory to determine the interruption limits with regards to current level and shape of transient recovery voltage (TRV). Little has earlier been published in this field of study so the design of the test switch is developed through experimental work. The test switch interrupts the thermal part of the current interruption for all tested currents, up to 800 A. Even for hard TRVs the switch interrupted the thermal part to an impressive degree. The dielectric strength in the arcing zone after the thermal phase is however a larger challenge. For a current of 800 A, the test switch struggles to withstand a recovery voltage higher than 6 kV the first 300 &# 181;s after current zero (CZ) crossing. The ablation effect is more or less self-regulated since the arc intensity is directly related to current magnitude. Experiments indicate that the test switch struggles with low currents since the heat becomes too low. However, the thermal part is still interrupted for a current of 80 A, but recovery voltages above 2 kV the first 200 &# 181;s after CZ crossing &# 181;s is likely to cause a re-ignition. </p...|$|R

These observations have urged the necessity of analyzing the 33 kV network on reliability {{point of view and}} proposing a cost effective method to improve the reliability level of the 33 kV network. In addition to improve consumer satisfaction, reliability improvement of the 33 kV distribution network shall make significant positive impact on the economy of the country since the recovery of unserved electrical energy has provided considerable benefits to industrial and other consumer categories. For this study, 33 kV network of North Central Province (NCP) was selected and analyzed focusing on the reliability of the network using the distribution planning software-SyneerGEE. This involves producing a model compatible to existing reliability level of 33 kV network by providing required data. Required data for model for reliability analysis shall be obtained by processing the available data relating to network reliability. Proposed method for the reliability improvement of the network is introduction of optimally located remote operated <b>Load</b> <b>Break</b> <b>Switches</b> (LBS). Fault indicators having remote communication facility are proposed to install and to be operated for the identification of fault location. Above methods were simulated on prepared model which is compatible to the existing reliability level of 33 kV network of NCP and searched for the best cost effective option. Number of LBSs that should be installed for a particular feeder, locations at where those LBSs should be installed to get the maximum reliability improvement of the network and target reliability level of each feeder were mainly determined by considering the cost of unserved energy and the cost for the utility for the improvement of reliability up to the required level...|$|R
40|$|Compact <b>load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> (LBSs) {{are common}} inside compact substations, {{and other places}} in the medium voltage {{distribution}} system where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually applied as interruption and insulation gas due to its excellent electrical characteristics. However, because of its strong greenhouse gas potential, other more environmentally benign gases, like air, are of interest to the industry. Current interruption is a complex process, and optimising the design of a medium voltage LBS is difficult. When using air instead of SF 6, optimisation with regard to size is important, since larger equipment will not fit in many existing installation sites. Due to the superior properties of SF 6, little research has been done on using air as interrupting gas in LBSs, and good simulation tools for design optimisation are yet to be developed. This master thesis concerns current interruption in air at load currents with different nozzle and contact geometries, and investigates how the air flow is affected by these parameters. Furthermore, the possibility to use the arcing voltage as a parameter {{in the development of a}} simulation tool for predicting the outcome of an interruption is also examined. A high-speed camera has been used to film the interruption to more thoroughly understand the impact the air flow has on the arc. This report consists mainly of experimental work conducted with a test switch and laboratory designed for parameter studies, and with test conditions similar to those used for product testing. The results from current interruption testing show that the minimum upstream over-pressure needed to successfully interrupt the current varies for different currents and nozzle geometries. For the 24 kV / 630 A tests, a threshold value for obtaining successful interruptions seems to be 0. 3 bar over-pressure, while at 880 A an over-pressure of at least 0. 4 bar is required for the tested geometries. The arcing voltage was monitored during successful and unsuccessful current interruptions, but no clear difference in the arcing voltage was found between the two outcomes. During interruption testing, steep drops in the arcing voltage have occasionally been observed. By filming the arc it was found that these steep drops most likely were caused by the arc short circuiting itself due to unnecessary elongation. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Load</b> <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> (LBSs) {{are common}} inside metal clad {{switchgear}} assemblies where space is a limiting factor. SF 6 is usually used in this application due to its superior electrical characteristics, but is unfortunately also a strong greenhouse gas. Therefore development of new products, utilizing air which is an environmental friendly alternative, is in progress. Since air has much lower dielectric strength than SF 6, the main challenge with this is therefore to reduce the size. Compact SF 6 products have created a retrofit market, and in many existing installation sites larger products will not fit. Current interruption is a complex process and depends on several parameters, {{and it is not}} straight forward to optimize the design of a medium voltage (MV) switch. Numerical simulation which is a common for product development in other areas is difficult for this application. Due to the long dominance of SF 6 products, little research has been published about the design criteria for LBS technology in air. The scope of the thesis covers current interruption of MV LBSs in air with respect to various design parameters, such as nozzle geometry, nozzle materials, gas flow, and contact movement. Both gas blow-assisted current interruption (associated with puffer breakers) and ablation-assisted current interruption are addressed. The material in the nozzle can enhance the interruption capability. Such a nozzle material is called ablation material. When the arc is burning close to the surface of an ablation material, gas is evaporated which cools the arc. This technology is used to some extent for low voltage switchgear, but much less for higher voltages. The objective is therefore to investigate the potential of this technology for the MV LBS application. All work is done experimentally with similar test conditions as are used for product type testing. A direct powered MV laboratory and a test switch are built. The test switch is designed particularly for parameter studies. The result from air blow experiments reveal the minimum upstream pressure drop required for current interruption for various basic nozzle geometries, and at different contact positions. One study is particular relevant for the 24 kV / 630 A class, and it is found that 0. 25 - 0. 3 bar upstream pressure drop appears to be a threshold value for successful interruption. It is also presented how the minimum upstream pressure drop varies for different MV LBS ratings. The results show that the needed pressure drop is approximately proportional, both towards the current and towards the rate of rise of recovery voltage. This investigation is made so that the majority of all MV LBS ratings (7 - 52 kV and up to 900 A) are covered. From the ablation experiments it was found that high content of hydrogen in the ablation material is favorable for enhancing the current interruption capability. In a comparison experiment between different polymers, polypropylene shows best interruption capability. This material was therefor applied as ablation material in the test switch, and tested in the MV laboratory. The results reveal high capability to interrupt the thermal phase (over the needs for most MV LBSs), but also that the transient recovery voltage several milliseconds after current zero often leads to dielectric re-ignition. This is opposite to a puffer breaker where the thermal interruption instead appears to be the crucial part. PhD i elkraftteknikkPhD in Electric Power Engineerin...|$|R

The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, short staple spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>loads,</b> corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; short staple spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by short staple spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and short staple spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the short staple spun threads; short staple spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and elongation of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar.
