40|$|The {{published}} literature about measuring children's hearing aid outcomes in real-world contexts is limited, {{compared with that}} relating to adults. This research investigates two key issues: {{the validity of the}} data obtained when using a questionnaire and the extent of aqreement between child and adult proxy respondents. The research used {{a modified version of the}} Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) which was administered to 49 deaf children aged 11 - 13 years and their parents and Teachers of the Deaf (ToDs) from the Greater Manchester area. Audiological and demographic data were obtained for each child, including the aided and unaided Speech Intelligibility Index and scores on the <b>Ling</b> <b>six</b> <b>sound</b> <b>test.</b> A feature of the research is the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. The research paradigm is post-positivist, i. e. it is postulated that the questionnaire data are, at best, only approximations to the reality of the children's experience with hearing aids. The quantitative data were explored by several statistical methods, including Generalised Linear Models and Rasch Rating Scale models: the latter are used here for the first time In audiology. The issue of proxy reporting was explored quantitatively by means of Psychometric Profile Analysis and other measures developed in the present research. The qualitative data were investigated by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Objective. As {{a result}} of newborn hearing screenings, an {{increasing}} number of infants are being identified with a hearing loss at birth or within a few months of life. The literature supports that early identification in conjunction with early intervention services have led to drastic improvements in speech and language outcomes for children who have a received a cochlear implant (CI). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the amount, type, and quality of services that young children with CI(s) are receiving. Methods. Participants in this study included 22 teachers of the deaf/hard of hearing (TD/HH), 7 speech-language pathologists (SLP), and 4 early childhood interventionists (ECI). All of the service providers were serving at least one child with a CI(s) at the time of the study. Three on-line service provider surveys were modified from the National Early Intervention Longitudinal Study (NEILS) in order to specifically address the concerns and interests of service provision for children with CIs. The three surveys addressed the birth- 3, preschool, and school-age populations. Results. Results from the birth- 3 and preschool populations with CIs were analyzed. The school-age population was not analyzed due to the low response rate from that age group. Findings from this study revealed that the TD/HH is the primary service provider for the birth- 5 population with CIs. In addition, other service providers (i. e. SLP, ECI) reported that they do not feel completely comfortable working with the CI device (i. e. troubleshooting, utilizing the <b>Ling</b> <b>Six</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>test).</b> Another area of concern was the child 2 ̆ 7 s compliance in wearing the CI on a full-time, daily basis. Collaboration and education among professionals and the families of children with CIs must be stressed in order for early intervention services to effectively facilitate the child 2 ̆ 7 s speech, language, and educational development. Conclusion. The results revealed characteristics specific to both the child (i. e. services the child has received in the past 6 months as part of his/her intervention program) and the service provider (i. e. amount of professional education concerning children with CIs). More research is needed to assess the relationship between the amount and quality of service provision and the child 2 ̆ 7 s speech and language performance to ensure that this population is receiving appropriate early intervention services...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionCochlear {{implants}} {{have become}} the method of choice {{for the treatment of}} severe-to-profound hearing loss in both children and adults. Its benefits are well documented in the pediatric and adult population. Also deaf children with additional needs, including autism, have been covered by this treatment. ObjectiveThe aim {{of this study was to}} assess the benefits from cochlear implantation in deafened children with autism as the only additional disability. MethodsThis study analyzes data of six children. The follow-up time was at least 43 months. The following data were analyzed: medical history, reaction to music and <b>sound,</b> Ling's <b>six</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>test,</b> onomatopoeic word test, reaction to spoken child's name, response to requests, questionnaire given to parents, sound processor fitting sessions and data. ResultsAfter cochlear implantation each child presented other communication skills. In some children, the symptoms of speech understanding were observed. No increased hyperactivity associated with daily use cochlear implant was observed. The study showed that in autistic children the perception is very important for a child's sense of security and makes contact with parents easier. ConclusionOur study showed that oral communication is not likely to be a realistic goal in children with cochlear implants and autism. The implantation results showed benefits that varied among those children. The traditional methods of evaluating the results of cochlear implantation in children with autism are usually insufficient to fully assess the functional benefits. These benefits should be assessed in a more comprehensive manner taking into account the limitations of communication resulting from the essence of autism. It is important that we share knowledge about these complex children with cochlear implants...|$|R

Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis of 31 postlingually deafened elderly (≥ 60 years of age) with unilateral cochlear implants was conducted. Audiological testing included preoperative and postoperative pure-tone audiometry and a monosyllabic word recognition test presented from recorded material in free field. Speech perception tests included Ling&# 39;s <b>six</b> <b>sound</b> <b>test</b> (<b>sound</b> detection, discrimination, and identification), syllable discrimination, and monosyllabic and multisyllabic word recognition (open set) without lip-reading. Everyday life benefits from cochlear implantation were also evaluated. Results: The mean age {{at the time of}} cochlear implantation was 72. 4 years old. The mean post-implantation follow-up time was 2. 34 years. All patients significantly improved their audiological and speech understanding performances. The preoperative mean pure-tone average threshold for 500 Hz, 1, 000 Hz, 2, 000 Hz, and 4, 000 Hz was 110. 17 dB HL. Before cochlear implantation, all patients scored 0 % on the monosyllabic word recognition test in free field at 70 dB SPL intensity level. The postoperative pure-tone average was 37. 14 dB HL (the best mean threshold was 17. 50 dB HL, the worst was 58. 75 dB HL). After the surgery, mean monosyllabic word recognition reached 47. 25 %. Speech perception tests showed statistically significant improvement in speech recognition. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that cochlear implantation is indeed a successful treatment for improving speech recognition and offers a great help in everyday life to deafened elderly patients. Therefore, they can be good candidates for cochlear implantation and their age alone should not be a relevant or excluding factor when choosing candidates for cochlear implantation.

40|$|Literature {{available}} on Honegger’s Cello Concerto suggests this concerto is often {{considered as a}} composition that resonates with <b>Les</b> <b>Six</b> traditions. While reflecting currents of <b>Les</b> <b>Six,</b> the Cello Concerto also features departures from Erik Satie’s and Jean Cocteau’s ideal for French composers to return to simplicity. Both characteristics of and departures from <b>Les</b> <b>Six</b> examined in this concerto include metric organization, thematic and rhythmic development, melodic wedge shapes, contrapuntal techniques, simplicity in orchestration, diatonicism, the use of humor, jazz influences, and other unique performance techniques...|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{elements of}} Honegger's style are: Bachian counterpoint, driving rhythms, melodic amplitude, highly coloristic harmonies, an impressionistic use of orchestral sonorities, and {{a concern for}} formal architecture. His style is weightier and more solemn than that of his colleagues in <b>Les</b> <b>Six.</b> Far from reacting against German romanticism as {{the other members of}} <b>Les</b> <b>Six</b> did, Honegger's mature works show evidence of a distinct influence by it. Despite the differences in their styles, he and fellow <b>Les</b> <b>Six</b> member Darius Milhaud were close friends, having studied together at the Paris Conservatoire. Milhaud dedicated his fourth string quintet to Honegger's memory, while Francis Poulenc similarly dedicated his Clarinet Sonata.|$|R
