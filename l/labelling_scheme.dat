40|$|Abstract—Dynamic XML <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> have {{important}} applications in XML Database Management Systems. In this paper, we explore dynamic XML <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> from a novel order-centric perspective. We compare the various <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> {{proposed in the}} literature with a special focus on their orders of labels. We show that the order of labels fundamentally impacts the update performance of a <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> and develop an order-based framework to classify and characterize XML <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes.</b> Although there are dynamic XML <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> that can completely avoid re-labeling, the gain in update performance all come with considerable costs such as larger label size and lower query performance, even if the XML documents are hardly updated. We introduce vector order which {{is the foundation of}} the dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> we propose. Compared with previous solutions that are based on natural order or lexicographical order, vector order is a simple, yet most effective solution to process updates in XML DBMS. We show that vector order can be gracefully applied to both range-based and prefix-based <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> with little overhead introduced. Moreover, vector order-based <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> are not only efficient to process, but also resilient to skewed insertions. Qualitative and experimental evaluations confirm the benefits of our approach compared to previous solutions.

However, most of these <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> do not well support update operations. To achieve update-friendly operations, some of the methods keep intervals between labeling numbers, but it requires whole relabeling when the intervals are used up. Several <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> support dynamic XML documents, {{but most of these}} <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> allow only leaf node insertions. OrdPathX supports both leaf node insertions and internal node insertions. Inspired by the method of inserting internal nodes of OrdPathX and extending the C-DO-VLEI code, in this paper we propose two dimensions VLEI code. We discuss how this <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> <b>labels</b> nodes and how we can get the structural information of nodes from their labels.

40|$|Dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for XML updates {{have been}} the focus of {{significant}} research activity in recent years. However the <b>label</b> storage <b>schemes</b> underpinning the dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> have not received as much attention. <b>Label</b> storage <b>schemes</b> specify how <b>labels</b> are physically encoded and stored on disk.

In this paper, we provide an overview of the existing <b>label</b> storage <b>schemes.</b> We present a novel <b>label</b> storage <b>scheme</b> based on the Fibonacci sequence that can completely avoid relabeling existing nodes under dynamic insertions.

40|$|Indices {{and data}} {{structures}} for web querying have mostly considered tree shaped data, reflecting {{the view of}} XML documents as tree-shaped. However, for RDF (and when querying ID/IDREF constraints in XML) data is indisputably graph-shaped. In this chapter, we first study existing indexing and <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for RDF and graph data in general with focus on support for efficient adjacency and reachability queries. For XML, <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> {{are an important part}} of the widespread adoption of XML, in particular for mapping XML to existing (relational) database technology. However, the existing indexing and <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for RDF (and graph data in general) sacrifice one of the most attractive properties of XML <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes,</b> the constant time (and per-node space) test for adjacency (child) and reachability (descendant).

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{there has}} been much {{research}} into the specification of dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> supporting XML updates.

An F- <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> is composed of a marker algorithm for labeling the vertices of a graph with short labels, coupled with a decoder algorithm allowing one to compute F (u, v) of any two vertices u and v directly from their labels. As applications for <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> concern mainly large and dynamically changing networks, it is of interest to study distributed dynamic <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes.</b> This paper investigates <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> for dynamic trees.

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} {{the problem}} of {{assigning}} labels to nodes of a dynamic XML tree such that the labels encode all ancestor-descendant relationships between the nodes and the document-order between the nodes. Such labeling facilitates efficient XML query processing. A number of <b>labeling</b> <b>schemes</b> have been designed for this task. These schemes can be broadly classified into (1) Static <b>Labeling</b> <b>Schemes</b> and (2) Dynamic <b>Labeling</b> <b>Schemes.</b> While static <b>schemes</b> generate short <b>labels,</b> their performance degrades in update intensive environments. Dynamic schemes have nice update performance, but their size of labels is high. A good <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> should generate concise labels and should perform better when there are arbitrary updates on the XML tree. In this paper, we present a new <b>labeling</b> <b>scheme</b> called Sector-based <b>Labeling</b> (SL) <b>scheme</b> which <b>labels</b> nodes with sectors. We analyze the proposed SL scheme and show that it generates smaller labels than the static schemes and has update performance as good as the dynamic schemes.
