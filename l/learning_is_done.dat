Thorndike developed {{the theory of}} instrumental conditioning or the law of effect. [...] The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> {{a little at a}} time or in increments, learning is an automatic process and all the principles of learning apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with Robert Woodworth on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to learn another subject if the subjects are similar. This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the classics because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence. Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in cognitive tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability. [...] He contributed word dictionaries that were scientifically based to determine the words and definitions used. The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level. [...] He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions. Thorndike contributed arithmetic books based on learning theory. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general intelligence. He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects. His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.

Rather, the Faculty has long conducted classes in a seminar-format, similar to American law schools. Students are asked to contribute to class discussion using Socratic method; basic <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> through reading materials prior to class, and class time is devoted to examining the complexities and critical exploration of the material, though the level of Socratic questioning varies between teachers and courses. First year classes ordinarily have a maximum of 28 students. Most upper-year classes have a maximum of 44 students. Some upper-year courses have up to 90 students.|$|E
50|$|The yeshiva has six rabbis and {{approximately}} 40 students, both married and unmarried men. It {{is a combination}} of a regular yeshiva of the Ponevitch type and a yeshiva for baalei teshuva. The yeshiva accepts even students who have almost no knowledge of Judaism. Nevertheless, in contrast to many baal teshuva yeshivas, the level of religious observance is significantly higher at Marbeh Torah. Although mainly American, most English-speaking countries are represented, as well as many European countries. <b>Learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> with original texts in Hebrew or Aramaic, though the lessons are given in English.

50|$|The {{program is}} divided into two parts: the pre-clerkship {{curriculum}} and the clerkship curriculum, each spanning half of the three years. The pre-clerkship curriculum {{is divided into}} five medical foundations, where students meet with a faculty member twice a week in a small group setting for teaching. <b>Learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> using the problem-based learning approach, where students set objectives, complete independent research, and then use their small group sessions to teach others, ask questions, and challenge one another with the guidance of their tutor. Students also complete clinical skills and professional competencies training at this time. Students are not graded during pre-clerkship. Evaluations are given {{at the end of each}} medical foundation.

5000|$|Guthrie’s {{theories}} {{went against}} those of Watson’s classical conditioning and Skinner’s operant conditioning due mainly to Guthrie’s insistence that their [...] "desire for results of immediate practical applications" [...] {{led to their}} theories being wrong. [...] Guthrie’s learning theory is called one-trial learning and he developed it with Smith at the University of Washington. [...] Guthrie and Smith’s theory states that all <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> within a single exposure to a situation. [...] Guthrie admitted that his own theory required the assumption that people react to a given situation the same way {{so long as it}} was still effective. [...] Guthrie’s more ambiguous theories and assumptions were put into more understandable terms after his death. [...] These notes focused upon the following three principles, the principle of association, the principle of postremity, and the principle of response probability.|$|E
50|$|All <b>learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> {{within a}} system of chaburos (study groups) in which 15 to 200 {{scholars}} are seated together to study the same subject at the same pace with their individual chavrusa (study partner). Every chaburah is headed by a rosh chaburah (head/leader of the study group). The rosh chaburah is typically somebody that is more advanced than {{the members of the}} chabura and his primary function is to assist the chabura in their studies. Additionally some roshai chaburah assist in pairing the members of their chaburah with an appropriate chavrusah (study partner). Most roshei chaburah will study the material on their own time so that they are proficient and thoroughly knowledgeable on the subject. Some roshai chaburah (plural of rosh hachaburah) also give a weekly discourse on the topic that was studied that week. A small number of chaburos require members themselves to prepare and give discourses of their own on a rotating basis. Other responsibilities of the rosh chaburah include submitting the amount of seats needed for the members of his chaburah, and to decide the topic of study for the semester.|$|E

50|$|A key {{characteristic}} {{of this type}} of nonverbal learning is that children have the opportunity to observe and interact with all parts of an activity. Many Indigenous American children are in close contact with adults and other children who are performing the activities that they will eventually master. Objects and materials become familiar to the child as the activities are a normal part of everyday life. <b>Learning</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> in an extremely contextualized environment rather than one specifically tailored to be instructional. For example, the direct involvement that Mazahua children take in the marketplace is used as a type of interactional organization for learning without explicit verbal instruction. Children learn how to run a market stall, take part in caregiving, and also learn other basic responsibilities through non-structured activities, cooperating voluntarily within a motivational context to participate. Not explicitly instructing or guiding the children teaches them how to integrate into small coordinated groups to solve a problem through consensus and shared space. These Mazahua separate-but-together practices have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities establishes enculturation that is rooted in nonverbal social experience. As the children participate in everyday interactions, they are simultaneously learning the cultural meanings behind these interactions. Children's experience with nonverbally organized social interaction helps constitute the process of enculturation.|$|E
