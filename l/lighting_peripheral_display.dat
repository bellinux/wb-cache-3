[11] present one attempt to {{bridge this gap by}} adapting Nielsen’s Heuristic evaluation to the defining characteristics and goals of <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays.</b> In this paper, we present a complementary approach that depends on active user participation and emphasizes the experience of using <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays.</b> The Context of Use Evaluation of <b>Peripheral</b> <b>Displays</b> (CUEPD) captures context of use through individualized scenario building, enactment and reflection. We illustrate the CUEPD method in a study to evaluate two <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays.</b> The evaluation using CUEPD revealed important design recommendations, suggesting that the method may be an important advance in evaluation methods for <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Although <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> {{have been}} a domain of inquiry {{for over a decade}} now, {{evaluation}} criteria and techniques for this area are still being created. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>display</b> evaluation is an acknowledged challenge in a field setting. This article first describes models and methods that have been tailored specifically to evaluating <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> (measuring how well they achieve their goals).

40|$|Abstract: <b>Peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> {{are useful}} for {{organizing}} information and providing additional screen space for managing information. One design issue is whether <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> {{should be part of}} a single large contiguous display space or segmented into many dedicated displays. To test this, an experiment was conducted comparing performance for on-screen versus off-screen displays and bordered (i. e., with a bezel) versus borderless displays. To measure multitask performance, participants were tested under dual-task (document editing and headline checking) and single-task (document editing alone) conditions. Distance between <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> and workstation display was also varied (near versus far). Results showed that off-screen <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> reduce editing performance more than on-screen <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays,</b> independent of distance. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> with borders were also found to reduce editing performance, but only at far distances. Performance on the headline-checking task was reduced by the far display but not by the bordered display. These results suggest that segmenting display space also segments information space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- <b>Peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> {{provide a}} means to present {{information}} to users in {{the periphery of the}} computer desktop. There are several forms of <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays,</b> some of the most widely recognized being stock tickers, email alert tools, and percent-done indicators. The use of such displays inevitably leads to the questions of how successful they are at communicating information to the user and how distracting they are when performing other tasks. This paper presents a study on the effectiveness of using <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> of varying type and number to convey potentially interesting but non-urgent information to the user. The {{participants in this study were}} asked to perform a primary task while one or more <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> disseminated information.

40|$|Sleep {{is a basic}} {{physiological}} process {{essential for}} good health. However, 40 {{million people in the}} U. S. are diag-nosed with sleep disorders, with many more undiagnosed. To help address this problem, we developed an application, ShutEye, which provides a <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> on the wall-paper of the user‘s mobile phone to promote awareness about recommended activities that promote good sleep quality. Based on preferences about the user‘s desired bed-time and activities—for example, consuming caffeine or performing vigorous exercise—ShutEye displays guidance about when engaging in those activities is likely to affect sleep without requiring any explicit interaction from the user. In this paper, we describe ShutEye and results from a four-week field study with 12 participants. Results indicate that a simple, recommendation-based <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> can be a very low-effort but still effective method for improving awareness of healthy sleep habits.

40|$|Peripheral {{information}} is {{information that is}} not central to a person's current task, but provides the person {{the opportunity to learn}} more, to do a better job, or to keep track of less important tasks.

We report a series of experiments on scrolling displays aimed at examining tradeoffs between distraction of scrolling motion and memorability of information displayed. Overall, we found that continuously scrolling displays are more distracting than displays that start and stop, but information in both is remembered equally well.

40|$|Local {{display unit}} {{functions}} as a user interface of the protection relay. It is therefore an indispensable part of the relay, used for monitoring and controlling of the relay and,consequently, of certain power grid elements. Local display unit is composed of two parts: a standalone <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> unit (the master device), and a software driver (the slave) running on the protection relay control unit. The thesis describes a software driver which is incorporated into the existing architecture of the 'rcman' information-communication system, and runs on the protection relay. The software driver communicates with the master device using the Modbus protocol over an RS- 232 interface. The two key requirements to be met in preparation of the thesis were a high data throughput, on one hand, and a simple extensibility of the driver on the other hand. During the initial development phase it was established that the implemented subset of Modbus functions is not sufficient for communication between the driver and the <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> unit. Therefore,certain Modbus functions had to be modified {{at the expense of}} losing their compatibility with the standard Modbus protocol. The result is a working software driver that meets the above mentioned requirements and provides the <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> unit with the data describing alarms, events, analogue measurements,LED indications, and the status of digital input lines. ...|$|R

40|$|Information workers {{often have}} to balance many tasks and interruptions. In this work, we explore <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> {{techniques}} that improve multitasking efficiency by helping users maintain task flow, know when to resume tasks, and more easily reacquire tasks. Specifically, we compare two types of abstraction that provide different task information: semantic content extraction, which displays only the most relevant content in a window, and change detection, which signals when a change has occurred in a window (all designed as modifications to Scalable Fabric [17]). Results from our user study suggest that semantic content extraction improves multitasking performance more so than either change detection or our base case of scaling. Results also show that semantic content extraction provides significant benefits to task flow, resumption timing, and reacquisition. We discuss the implication of these findings {{on the design of}} peripheral interfaces that support multitasking.

40|$|Abstract. Informative Art display {{systems have}} been {{proposed}} to provide users with information considered relevant at arbitrary points of work or living engagement, originating from many different –mostly geographically dislocated– sources and presented at the periphery of human (visual) perception. Having the displays operate at the periphery of a user's attention allows other user tasks to sustain primary. Much like the information presented by wallclocks, posters, paintings or windows, <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> move {{to the center of}} attention only when appropriate and desirable. Abstract art has been proposed to serve as the visualization paradigm, encoding information into graphical or pictorial artwork by subtly modifying its shape, color and appearance details or its overall impression. This paper approaches a systematic elaboration of visual metaphors able to deliver information via <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> in an aesthetic, artful way. In our approach, the choice of metaphors is driven by the aesthetic appeal of the visual appearance of the display as a whole, out of which certain dynamic emblems or symbols are used to conotate information in a visual style. From experiments we find, that such metaphors are considered by users as a means of personal emotional expression, and that controllable aesthetic attractiveness {{turns out to be the}} dominant factor of display appreciation. The choice of aesthetic themes, as well as the control of emblem and symbol dynamics are supported and implemented in our <b>peripheral</b> <b>display</b> framework, a general purpose software framework for informative art display systems...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A {{pilot study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of continuous haptic <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> in supporting multiple UAV supervisory control. Background: Previous research shows that continuous auditory <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> can enhance operator performance in monitoring events that are continuous in nature, such as monitoring how well UAVs stay on their pre-planned courses. This research also shows that auditory alerts can be masked by other auditory information. Command and control operations are generally performed in noisy environments with multiple auditory alerts presented to the operators. In order to avoid this masking problem, another potentially useful sensory channel for providing redundant information to UAV operators is the haptic channel. Method: A pilot experiment was conducted with 13 participants, using a simulated multiple UAV supervisory control task. All participants completed two haptic feedback conditions (continuous and threshold), where they received alerts based on UAV course deviations and late arrivals to targets. Results: Threshold haptic feedback was found to be more effective for late target arrivals, whereas continuous haptic feedback resulted in faster reactions to course deviations. Conclusions: Continuous haptic feedback appears to be more appropriate for monitoring events that are continuous in nature (i. e., how well a UAV keeps its course). In contrast, threshold haptic feedback appears to better support response to discrete events (i. e., late target arrivals). Future research: Because this is a pilot study, {{more research is needed to}} validate these preliminary findings. A direct comparison between auditory and haptic feedback is also needed to provide better insights into the potential benefits of multi-modal <b>peripheral</b> <b>displays</b> in command and control of multiple UAVs.
