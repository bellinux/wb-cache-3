40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of the photosynthetic apparatus of intermittent light grown pea plants under continuous illumination has been investigated. We determined the formation of antenna proteins and the synthesis of pigments {{at different stages of}} greening and compared the data with the changes in the xanthophyll cycle reactions. The <b>limited</b> <b>convertibility</b> of violaxanthin in the de-epoxidation reactions of the cycle was found to be closely related to the presence of antenna proteins and could be attributed to direct (pigment binding) and indirect (grana formation) functions of antenna proteins. The reduced epoxidation rate in intermittent light plants was found to be accelerated with increasing amounts of antenna proteins. However, the changes in the epoxidation rates were not consistent with the assignment of the epoxidase activity to LHC II, the major light harvesting complex protein of photosystem II. This interpretation was further supported by an unchanged epoxidase activity in – also LHC II depleted – bundle sheath cells of the C 4 plant Sorghum bicolor and stroma fractions of isolated spinach thylakoids. We assume that the basic function of antenna proteins in the xanthophyll cycle of higher plants is mainly related to the binding of the substrate and/or to interactions with the de-epoxidase/epoxidase. By that antenna proteins seem to be responsible for the limited violaxanthin convertibility as well as they are required for highest epoxidation rates...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The low exergy {{approach}} {{should be}} the key concept in any long term strategy aiming at creating a sustainable built environment. In recent years, how to build sustainable houses {{has been a constant}} source of discussion. A highly efficient usage of energy and all of the potentials in the involved energy flows are undisputable mandatory for that. To find and to quantify further potentials in energy use, the thermodynamic concept of exergy can be beneficial. Energy, which is entirely convertible into other types of energy, is exergy (high valued energy such as electricity and mechanical workload). Energy, which has a very <b>limited</b> <b>convertibility</b> potential, such as heat close to room air temperature, is low valued energy. Low exergy heating and cooling systems use low valued energy, which could also easily be delivered by sustainable energy sources (e. g. by using heat pumps, solar collectors or others). Common energy carriers like fossil fuels deliver high valued energy. Heat emission systems, that are often part of the building construction itself, have a much longer service lifetime than building service equipment, such as boilers or chillers. With appropriate emission systems, the overall system design of a building is flexible in meeting future requirements, and they are open to being supplied by low temperature energy sources, such as renewable ones. There are already a number of different low temperature components, systems and technologies on the market, such as the known hydronic floor heating systems. Examples of buildings equipped with low exergy heating and cooling systems {{from all over the world}} and from all kinds of buildings, from newly erected to retrofit, from dwellings to commercial buildings, and also cultural monuments, such as churches and castles are collected during the course of the project...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} a development of financial {{relations of the}} socialist states in the years of 1945 — 1963 and 1964 — 1982. Conditioning of the first period, forming and developing bilateral financial relations, {{is presented in the}} aspect of strong trends of protection of newly constructed industry, limited supply of export goods and inelastic demand on certain products. Circumstances of the second period which gave rise to technical and settling conditions for multilateral settlements are discussed in the latter part, they were not able to relieve a trade system of the socialist countries from the bilateral balancing. Discussing a complex problem of efficiency of multilateral settlements, the author quotes opinions of international finances' specialists and researchers and seeks for new substantial and technical solutions in order to arrive to an agreement between principles of state controlled economy and demands of international trade in the aspect of settlements. In the author's opinion, models of cash settlements between the socialist countries are unsatisfactory at their present stage. The author advocates that requirements of life have to be followed: the conditions of foreign trade are varying, world's economy is not static, supply of goods and services and demand are constantly fluctuating as well as world prices. It is therefore necessary to introduce a reasonable multilaterality of settlements making for stimulation of currency and increase of weight of finances in international settlements and in consequence- for multilateral balancing of trade turnover. In view of the tendencies to isolate socialist countries in the foreign trade, the author emphasises the need to concentrate efforts to create better currency system which would, under the influence of developing CMEA cooperation, improve multilateral settlements. Although payments turnover is functioning efficiently in the CMEA countries by means of the transfer ruble, the article indicates that major problems in the trade between socialist countries are caused by the fact that each socialist state, in order to balance its foreign trade according to plan, establishes quotas, attempts at bilateral balancing of a foreign trade and links directly a volume of exports and imports of deliveries under contract. Bilaterality understood in that way diminishes utility of transfer ruble and its flexibility in settlements and results in ruble's failure to perform its functions in the international trade. In the following remarks the author discusses the role of transfer ruble in settlements in socialist states as a product of the currency system of these states and of the principle of inconvertibility of national currencies, he is also trying to determine whether transfer ruble is a contractual unit of settlement predominated by elements of bilateralism or it is a type of international currency. The author adopts a notion of transfer ruble as an international currency, in its narrow meaning, i. e. which is recognized solely by those states which had created it, as their common unit of account. The article attributes functions of money sui generis to transfer ruble: a scope in which the ruble can perform classical functions of money is described, as a standard of value, as a tender, as a means of accumulation of value. Various views of scientists and financial experts are quoted in this respect. In conclusion, the author admits that transfer ruble is not an international currency in the wide meaning of this word and should be classed among extramonetary units of settlement. Present forms of trade between socialist countries should be, in the authors opinion, altered to overcome a "product for product" barrier, to extend the trade turnover and to create a possibility of converting a value expressed in one currency into another currency. This requires the existence of real exchange rates and a national currency should act as a tender not only in the country but also abroad. Estimating real financial relations of trade and settlements, the author speaks for improving the existing collective currency and elaborating a program in future aiming at introducing convertible currency of the CMEA states or, at least, a currency of partially <b>limited</b> <b>convertibility.</b> Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. After {{reviewing}} the post-World War II {{evolution of the}} international financial architecture, this paper presents a critical appraisal of current proposals for reform: <b>limiting</b> capital account <b>convertibility,</b> introducing an international lender of last resort, and reforming debt market institutions and instruments. These proposals do not quite examine whether the potential of triggering a contagious crisis is confined to a few countries. Instead of looking for an institutional framework that in an abstract and universal sense minimizes {{the probability of a}} crisis, a more modest approach focusing on countries that could potentially trigger a crisis could have a much higher payoff...|$|R

These extra features were all strategies investors could perform themselves using options and other derivatives, except that they were prepackaged as one product. The goal was again to give investors more reasons to accept a lower interest rate on debt in exchange for certain features. On the other hand, the goal for investment banks was to increase profit margins since the newer products with added features were harder to value, and thus harder to gauge bank profits.|$|R

40|$|China-bashing {{has become}} a popular media and {{political}} sport. This {{is largely due to}} the U. S. trade imbalance and the belief, by some, that China is responsible for it because it manipulates its currency to hold down the dollar prices of its goods, unfairly creating a trade advantage that has contributed to the loss of U. S. businesses and jobs. This paper reviews the problem of the large trade imbalance that the United States has with China and its relationship to Chinese exchange rate policy. It examines the link between a Chinese renminbi appreciation and the trade balance and also whether a generalized dollar decline could solve the global or Chinese U. S. trade imbalance. The consensus view explained here is that a renminbi appreciation is not likely to fix either the trade imbalance with China or overall. Though these perceived benefits of a managed float are small or non-existent, perhaps they should be pursued anyway because of small costs or even benefits for China. Section IV looks at the costs of a managed float in terms of the benefits of the earlier peg. Opponents of a fixed dollar/yuan exchange rate ignore the costs of a managed float for China, especially with <b>limits</b> on currency <b>convertibility.</b> These costs are outlined here in order to provide an economic basis for the earlier fixed rate and China’s reluctance to appreciate. Finally it is suggested that the necessary convertibility on capital account, toward which China is moving, could easily result in yuan depreciation under a floating rate regime. This is hardly the end that China critics have in mind and it is not one that would improve U. S. or other trade imbalances with China. ...|$|R
