40|$|<b>Lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> on {{the road}} {{experience}} pleasant as well as unpleasant aspects of their job. They usually find their job pleasant, but the special measures aimed at lorries are sometimes found unpleasant or even irritating. This questionnaire study of <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> deals with whether these emotions have consequences for safe and unsafe behaviour. The study {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part studied if there are traffic situations involving the overtaking prohibition and the speed limiter for <b>lorries.</b> 85 <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> were asked how frequently they encounter these situations and how `annoying' they find them. The second part studied how (especially negative) emotions developed in six of these situations, and what the consequences were for behaviour and safety. This was done by confronting 206 <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> with statements. The third part studied the more general aspect of the `emotional housekeeping': which moods and emotions are generally present before and during driving, and how they relate to (un) safety. All <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> were asked questions about age, experience, type of transport, distances covered, offences, fines, near-accidents, and accidents.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Prolonged time sitting {{has been linked to}} an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cardiovascular mortality (CVM), all-cause mortality, diabetes and some cancers. Workers in occupations where there is no alternative to sitting can best be defined as compulsory sedentary workers, which involve bus and <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> amongst others. Limited research is available on the health behaviours and health profiles of individuals working within these occupations. This thesis adopts a mixed methods approach and fits within the MRC framework for the development of complex interventions to specifically investigate bus and <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> sedentary behaviours and physical activity levels in association with their cardiovascular health. Chapter 3 describes a pilot study, which results showed bus drivers accumulate 12 hours sitting on workdays and presented higher than the recommended ranges for BMI, body fat, waist circumference and blood pressure. Chapter 4 explores the validity of using an ActiGraph accelerometer compared to the activPAL to assess bus drivers sedentary behaviours. Results highlight that compared to the activPAL, the ActiGraph underestimates sedentary time during workdays (151 minutes/day) and working hours (172 min/day). Chapter 5 phenotypes UK <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> sedentary behaviours and non-sedentary behaviours during workdays and non-workdays and examines <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> markers of cardiovascular health. <b>Lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> accumulate 13 hours sitting on workdays and 8 hours on non-workdays and presented an ill-cardiovascular profile. Chapter 6 examines the effects of an intervention designed to promote PA and reduce sedentary time on a range of cardiovascular risk factors in a sample of <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers.</b> Chapter 7 presents a process evaluation of the Structured Health Intervention for Truckers (SHIFT) programme described in Chapter 6. This thesis highlights that bus and <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> accumulate the highest amount of sitting time reported up to date, together with high levels of physical inactivity and an ill-cardiovascular profile. However, positive changes in cardiovascular risk factors were observed when drivers increased their daily average of step counts. Overall, these results emphasise that targeting bus and <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> health behaviours should be a public health priority...|$|R

5|$|Abraham Waddington {{was born}} in Clayton, Bradford, on 4 February 1893, the eldest of three brothers. His family owned a fat-refining {{business}} managed by his father, Sam. When he left school, Waddington joined the family firm as a <b>lorry</b> <b>driver,</b> occasionally working in the refinery. He began playing cricket for Crossley Hall in the West Bradford League {{at the age of}} 11; as a teenager he played in the Bradford League for Lidget Green and then Laisterdyke, gaining a local reputation as a fast-medium bowler. He helped Laisterdyke win the League championship in 1913, before moving to Wakefield for the 1914 season, where he took 98 wickets at an average of 12.00. He played for Yorkshire Second XI in August 1914, alongside future First XI teammates Herbert Sutcliffe and Cec Tyson, but the outbreak of the First World War prevented him making any further appearances for the county.|$|E
5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children were taken into the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a <b>lorry</b> <b>driver,</b> Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 12 months after publication. Objectives: To {{undertake}} a process-evaluation of a Structured Health Intervention for Truckers (SHIFT) implemented {{in a sample}} of UK <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers.</b> Methods: A combination of ‘debrief interviews’, focus groups and one-to-one interviews, in addition to observations and reflections of the two lead researchers were used to collect data on the acceptability of SHIFT from a group of 16 <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> and 4 transport managers. Results: The SHIFT program was considered relevant and acceptable to <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers.</b> It provided them with health information tailored to their specific health needs, long-lasting tools and techniques, which helped to raise their awareness of key health issues and helped to stimulate lifestyle changes during their daily routine.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} risk of lung cancer in {{different}} subgroups of professional drivers in {{urban and rural areas}} of Sweden. METHODS: Information on occupation and geographical region was obtained from the Swedish census of 1970 and data on the incidence of lung cancer between 1971 and 1984 from the National Swedish Cancer Registry. Professional drivers were separated into bus, taxi, and long and short distance <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers.</b> Comparisons of cumulative incidence of lung cancer were made between each particular group of drivers and gainfully employed men in the same region. RESULTS: Taxi drivers, and long and short distance <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> in Stockholm County showed increased relative risks (RRs) of lung cancer with the highest risk among the short distance <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> (RR 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 1. 5 to 2. 6). These categories of drivers also showed increased risks in the other two large conurbations in Sweden. In {{the rest of the country}} (mainly rural areas) there were no increased RRs for any category of driver. The RR for bus drivers was not increased in any region. After adjustment for assumed differences in smoking habits the RRs remained significantly increased for <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> in Stockholm but not for other groups of drivers in other areas. However, the RRs remained numerically higher in large conurbations than in rural regions for all groups of drivers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that some factors present in the urban environment play a substantial part in the excess of lung cancer among short distance <b>lorry</b> <b>drivers</b> in urban areas of Sweden. Exposure to motor exhaust fumes may have contributed to this excess...|$|R
