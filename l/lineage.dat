5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{belongs to a}} genus whose <b>lineage</b> includes the hierofalcons and the prairie falcon (F.mexicanus).

By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third <b>lineage</b> of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn.

40|$|Influenza {{neuraminidase}} (NA) is {{an important}} surface glycoprotein and plays {{a vital role in}} viral replication and drug development. The NA is found in influenza A and B viruses, with nine subtypes classified in influenza A. The complete knowledge of influenza NA evolutionary history and phylodynamics, although critical for the prevention and control of influenza epidemics and pandemics, remains lacking. Evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of influenza NA sequences using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods demonstrated that the divergence of influenza viruses into types A and B occurred earlier than the divergence of influenza A NA subtypes. Twenty-three <b>lineages</b> were identified within influenza A, two <b>lineages</b> were classified within influenza B, and most <b>lineages</b> were specific to host, subtype or geographical location. Interestingly, evolutionary rates vary not only among <b>lineages</b> but also among branches within <b>lineages.</b> The estimated tMRCAs of influenza <b>lineages</b> suggest that the viruses of different <b>lineages</b> emerge several months or even years before their initial detection. The d(N) /d(S) ratios ranged from 0. 062 to 0. 313 for influenza A <b>lineages,</b> and 0. 257 to 0. 259 for influenza B <b>lineages.</b> Structural analyses revealed that all positively selected sites are at the surface of the NA protein, with a number of sites found to be important for host antibody and drug binding. The divergence into influenza type A and B from a putative ancestral NA was followed by the divergence of type A into nine NA subtypes, of which 23 <b>lineages</b> subsequently diverged.
