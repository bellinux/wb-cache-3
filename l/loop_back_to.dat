5|$|In December 2009, Circle line {{services}} began serving the station. Originally operating as a loop-line using tracks {{constructed by the}} MR and the DR and serving only the station in Praed Street, the Circle line's route was altered to include the Hammersmith branch to increase train frequency on the branch and improve the regularity of Circle line trains. Trains run in a spiral anti-clockwise from Edgware Road around the <b>loop,</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Edgware Road {{and then on to}} the Hammersmith branch.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station and then run to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August15, the NHC began {{forecasting}} {{that the}} hurricane would make landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina within two days. Early on August16, the eye became better defined, although the feature diminished {{within a few}} hours, and the NHC {{was on the verge}} of downgrading Felix to tropical storm status. A break in the ridge allowed Felix to turn to the north, bringing it about 150mi (250km) east of the Outer Banks. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to a northeast drift, and there was initial uncertainty whether Felix would <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west or recurve to the northeast. During this time, the system remained a minimal hurricane, maintaining a large eye about 60 to 80miles (95 to 130km) in diameter, but with weak convection due to cooler air. After the trough that turned Felix to the east-northeast bypassed it to the north, the hurricane turned to the southeast, executing a small loop while northwest of Bermuda. On August20, Felix weakened below hurricane intensity for the first time in nine days, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. By that time, the convection was removed from the center, and another trough brought the storm to the northeast. While passing east of Newfoundland on August22, Felix became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, eventually passing north of the United Kingdom on August25.|$|E

25|$|Cross-country ski venues often {{comprise}} {{a system of}} trails or loipes of varying length and difficulty that <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a starting point. Often trails branch out from a common segment; the more challenging ones then branch off on longer legs. The length of each loop, including segments that coincide with other loops, is typically counted separately. Consequently, the total length of loops {{is greater than the}} total length of trail structure.|$|E
25|$|To the {{southwest}} in Henrietta, construction began by 1978 on {{an extension of}} Erie Station Road {{in the vicinity of}} Scottsville–West Henrietta and East River Roads. The new roadway, as proposed, would begin at the junction of Erie Station and East River Roads and parallel the New York State Thruway westward toward the Genesee River, then <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the southeast to end at Farrell Road. Ultimately, the proposed loop to Farrell Road was scrapped in favor of a more direct connection with Scottsville–West Henrietta Road. The new highway became part of a rerouted NY253 on April1, 1984, when it was added to the state highway system as part of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Monroe County. In the swap, ownership and maintenance of the former routing of NY253 on Scottsville–West Henrietta Road was transferred from the state to the town of Henrietta while the East River Road portion was given to Monroe County and is now part of County Route84 (CR84).|$|E

500|$|On November29, the JTWC began {{tracking}} {{a disturbance}} {{well to the}} northeast of Madagascar. On December1, after a defined circulation developed, MFR began issuing warnings on the system. After having moved to the west-southwest, the depression turned to the southeast on December2. Haven received the name Bemany, the storm gradually intensified; the JTWC upgraded it to the equivalent of minimal hurricane status on December3, {{and the next day}} MFR estimated peak winds of 115km/h (70mph). While near peak intensity, Bemany passed about [...] east of Mauritius, and it subsequently weakened. The influence of an anticyclone turned the storm to the east and caused Bemany to <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the west. On December5, the storm became extratropical, and the next day the JTWC issued its last advisory. On [...] December7, Bemany briefly became a tropical depression again, only to become extratropical for the final time the next day; Bemany dissipated on December9.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of the eye}} {{movements}} in “rapid eye movement” sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration {{and more likely to}} <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their starting point. About seven of such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem. These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, [...] still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for procedural memory processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the brain processing the eye-related procedural memory.|$|E
2500|$|The Mount Pleasant Track is [...] long. It extends between Parrish Avenue at Mount Pleasant and Mount Keira Road. By car, Parrish Avenue {{is reached}} by turning left off Mount Ousley Road (immediately before the Mount Pleasant road {{overpass}} bridge, driving southbound), {{and then right}} onto the overpass bridge. The track climbs the middle slopes of Mount Keira via dense rainforest. From Parrish Avenue, the walk steeply ascends a [...] wide trail for about [...] before narrowing to less than [...] The final [...] wind through the rainforest, which contains many ferns, vines and palms. Large boulders are evidence of previous rockfalls from the sandstone plateau, which forms the escarpment cliffs and Mount Keira summit.

[...] It was opened in 1986 and comprises two overlapping lasso-shaped paths, one slightly {{longer than the}} other. Along the shared [...] "lasso spur" [...] is a canal for mosquito control {{as well as an}} intersection with the old Hunter Island causeway's cobblestone approach path. Going counterclockwise from the intersection with the two [...] "loops", the trail passes through a grove of 100 Norway Spruces planted in 1918; a black locust forest from the 1970s; and a thicket of shrubs and vines.

60|$|Section 2. If we now {{compare the}} general {{anatomy of the}} frog (vide Sheet 11) {{with that of the}} rabbit, we notice that the {{diaphragm}} is absent (Rabbit, Section 4), and the body cavity, or coelom, is, {{with the exception of the}} small bag of the pericardium round the heart, one continuous space. The forked tongue is attached in front of the lower jaw, and can be flicked out and back with great rapidity in the capture of the small insects upon which the frog lives. The posterior nares open into the front of the mouth-- there is no long nasal chamber, and no palate, and there is no long trachea between the epiglottis and the lungs. The oesophagus is less distinct, and passes gradually, so far as external appearances go, into the bag-like stomach, which is much less inflated and transverse than that of the rabbit. The duodenum is not a U-shaped loop, but makes one together with the stomach; the pancreas lies between it and the stomach, and is more compact than the rabbit's. There is no separate pancreatic duct, but the bile duct runs through the pancreas, and receives a series of ducts from that gland as it does so. The ileum is shorter, there is no sacculus rotundus, and the large intestine has no caecum, none of the characteristic sacculations of the rabbit's colon, and does not <b>loop</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the stomach before the rectum section commences. The anus opens not upon the exterior, but into a cloacal chamber. The urinary and genital ducts open separately into this cloaca, and dorsally and posteriorly to the anus. The so-called urinary bladder is ventral to the intestine, in a position answering to that of the rabbit, but it has no connection with the ureters, and it is two-horned.|$|E
