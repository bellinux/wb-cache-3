40|$|Leakage from {{pipelines}} has {{the potential}} to cause significant environmental damage and economic losses. While pipelines are designed and constructed to maintain their integrity, it is difficult to avoid the occurrence of leakage in a pipeline system during its lifetime. Often accurate <b>leak</b> <b>detection,</b> enabling a quick response, is necessary to minimise damage. Many <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> methods have been proposed previously. Among these methods, hydraulic <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> has the advantages of being less expensive and faster in response as compared to other <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> methods. In this paper various <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> methods are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are highlighted, emphasising the selection of an appropriate solution for different pipeline systems. Recent research on transient <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> techniques that is currently being carried out at Adelaide University is also described. In particular the inverse transient method is considered in detail...|$|R

30|$|The water {{infrastructure}} worldwide {{is riddled with}} leaks, which contribute {{to a variety of}} losses within the water network. Losses can be in the form of direct water dissipation, production energy losses, and losses in treatment costs. We rely on early detection systems to minimize the negative impact of leaks (Colombo & Karney, 2002). Based on what preceded, a need is identified to maximize the efficiency of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> systems to act more efficiently regarding leak repairs. Therefore, this paper aims to (1) Identify current <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> approaches, (2) Propose a <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> system approach, and (3) Propose an aggregation approach to improve the accuracy of available <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> systems.|$|R

40|$|Near-surface {{monitoring}} is {{an essential}} component of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> at geologic CO 2 sequestration sites. With different strengths and weaknesses for every monitoring technique, an integrated system of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> monitoring methods is needed to combine the information provided by different techniques deployed at a site, and no current methodology exists that allows one to quantitatively combine the results from different monitoring technologies and optimize their design. More importantly, an evaluation that is able to provide the assessment of possible size of a leak based on the multiple monitoring results further helps the managers and decision makers to know whether the unexpected leakage event is smaller than the required annual seepage rate for effective long-term storage. The proposed methodology for this application is the development and use of a Bayesian belief network (BBN) for combining measurements from multiple <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> technologies at a site. The Bayesian Belief Network for CO 2 <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> is built through an integrated application of a subsurface model for CO 2 migration under different site conditions; field-generated background information on several monitoring techniques; and statistical methods for processing the field background data to infer the <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> threshold for each monitoring technique and the conditional probability values used in the BBN. Several statistical methods are applied to estimate the detection thresholds and the conditional probabilities, including (1) Bayesian methods for characterizing the natural background (pre-injection) conditions of the techniques for <b>leak</b> <b>detection,</b> (2) the combination of the characterization of the background monitoring results and the simulated CO 2 migration for estimating the probability of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> for each monitoring technique given the size of leak, (3) a probabilistic design of CO 2 <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> for estimating the detection probability of a monitoring technique under different site conditions and monitoring densities, (4) a Bayesian belief network for combining measurements from multiple <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> technologies at an actual test site, with the site conditions and the probability distributions of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> and leakage rate estimated for the site. The BBN model is built for the Zero Emissions Research and Technology (ZERT) test site in Montana. The monitoring techniques considered in this dissertation include soil CO 2 flux measurement and PFC tracer monitoring. The possible near-surface CO 2 and PFC tracer flux rates as a function of distance from a leakage point are simulated by TOUGH 2, given different leakage rates and permeabilities. The natural near-surface CO 2 flux and background PFC tracer concentration measured at the ZERT site are used to determine critical values for leak inference and to calculate the probabilities of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> given a monitoring network. A BBN of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> is established by combing the TOUGH 2 simulations and the background characterization of near-surface CO 2 flux and PFC tracer at the sequestration site. The BBN model can be used as an integrated <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> tool at a geologic sequestration site, increasing the predicted precision and inferring the possible leak distribution by combining the information from multiple <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> techniques. Moreover, the BBN model can also be used for evaluating each monitoring technique deployed at a site and for determining the performance of a proposed monitoring network design by a single or multiple techniques...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} applies {{a commercial}} flow simulation software package together with common signal processing techniques {{to the task}} of accurately detecting leakage in a large commercial gas pipeline. The techniques developed significantly improved the ability to produce accurate, reliable and stable <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> predictions for the gas transmission pipeline studied and can be applied generally to other pipelines as well. Recommendations for minimum pipeline requirements to implement successful <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> are also detailed. There are several commercial software packages available that perform some form of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> via system modelling. However, due to the commercial aspects of these products, vendors do not publish the detailed methods of <b>leak</b> <b>detection.</b> This thesis identifies the fundamental techniques required to have accurate and reliable <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> on a gas transmission pipeline, whilst taking into account the lack of measurement data typically encountered on most gas pipelines. The investigation confirmed that a mass balance technique could be successfully used to produce stable <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> results for compressible flow in gas transmission pipelines. This <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> [using mass balance] can be achieved without flow measurement along the pipeline, instead, using only pressure and temperature measurements. Although it is recognized that flow measurement data will greatly improve the ability to detect leaks, the focus of this work is on pipelines where this flow measurement data at intermediate points along the pipeline is not available. It was also demonstrated the reliability of the <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> was improved by the application of on-line signal processing techniques at various stages of the data processing. It was clear early into the investigation {{that the majority of the}} errors within the <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> model were created by random errors from the input field data. These non-systematic errors from the measurement data that included pressure and temperature, produced interference with model output. This interference resembled random “white” noise that was removed by a combination of well established data filtering techniques. The most appropriate process of calculating <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> flow was determined after analysing the results of different techniques applied to large quantities of actual pipeline operating data. The validation of the on-line techniques developed provides a valuable resource for those wishing to implement similar <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> schemes elsewhere. Furthermore a software environment was chosen which incorporated an open input and output platform for data that could be interfaced with any operating system. Therefore these techniques can be applied to the numerous Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in operation throughout the gas transmission industry, to provide a low cost solution to leak monitoring...|$|R

Computer model-based <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> methods that detect leaks by analyzing the pipeline hydraulic state have been widely employed in the industry, but their effectiveness in practical applications is often challenged by real-world uncertainties. This study quantitatively assessed the effects of uncertainties on leak detectability of a commonly used real-time transient model-based <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> system. Uncertainties in fluid properties, field sensors, and the data acquisition system were evaluated. Errors were introduced into the input variables of the <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> system individually and collectively, and the changes in leak detectability caused by the uncertainties were quantified using simulated leaks. This study provides valuable quantitative results contributing towards {{a better understanding of how}} real-world uncertainties affect <b>leak</b> <b>detection.</b> A general ranking of the importance of the uncertainty sources was obtained: from high to low it is time skew, bulk modulus error, viscosity error, and polling time.

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{evaluating}} traditional computational <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> technologies pipeline operators have a suite of simulated testing methods available. In {{the last several years}} however External <b>Leak</b> <b>Detection</b> Technologies have become more mature and potentially could provide operators with another layer of <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> with more sensitivity than seen in traditional methods. The challenge with these technologies is in the evaluation of their sensitivity, reliability, and robustness. ENBRIDGE INC (Enbridge) and C-FER Technologies 1999 Inc. (C-FER) begun a comprehensive study to assess the state-of-the-art external, continuously distributed sensors for <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> in early 2012. Initially, a technology review was undertaken to identify commercial, off-the-shelf technologies with the potential to detect small leaks of oil from buried pipelines. From this literature review, four technologies were identified; Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), Vapor Sensing Tubes (VST), and Hydrocarbon Sensing Cables (HSC). All four methods require proprietary materials and technology, which have had limited independent testing efforts to date. To evaluate these four <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> methods and their vendors in an objective way, Enbridge and C-FER initiated the design and construction of a large-scale External <b>Leak</b> <b>Detection</b> Experimental Research apparatus (ELDER) that can accommodate a full-size segment of pipeline within a trench, at the same scale used in pipeline construction in North America. An instrumented pipe segment is buried in the trench with sensing cables laid alongside. The apparatus generates leaks with controlled variables including rate, pressure and temperature, and at various locations to accurately represent pipeline leaks. This paper summarizes the literature review on the four selected <b>leak</b> <b>detection</b> technologies that were identified as candidates for large-scale evaluation. The discussion will also include features of the ELDER apparatus, and re-engineered pipeline construction techniques that were required to accurately represent a full-scale pipeline trench within a laboratory environment.
