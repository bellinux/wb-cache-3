5|$|Non-reproductive health {{remains an}} {{important}} predictor of maternal health. In the United States, the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> maternal death are cardiovascular disease (15% of deaths), endocrine, respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders, infection, hemorrhage and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (Gronowski and Schindler, Table II).|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> {{neurological}} {{disabilities in}} African children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Despite these differences, the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> {{death in}} the United States are remarkably similar for men and women, headed by heart disease, which {{accounts}} {{for a quarter of}} all deaths, followed by cancer, lung disease and stroke. While women have a lower incidence of death from unintentional injury (see below) and suicide, they have a higher incidence of dementia (Gronowski and Schindler, Table I).|$|E

5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving their mothers, while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|American Cocker Spaniels in UK and USA/Canada surveys had {{a median}} {{lifespan}} of about 10 to 11 years, {{which is on}} {{the low end of the}} typical range for purebred dogs, and one to two years less than other breeds of their size. The larger English Cocker Spaniel typically lives about a year longer than the American Cocker Spaniel. In a 2004 UK Kennel Club survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (23%), old age (20%), cardiac (8%), and immune-mediated (8%). In a 2003 USA/Canada Health Survey with a smaller sample size, the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were cancer, hepatic disease, and immune-mediated.|$|E
5|$|Lead, {{one of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> {{toxicity}} in waterfowl, {{has been}} known to cause die-offs of wild bird populations. When hunters use lead shot, waterfowl such as ducks can ingest the spent pellets later and be poisoned; predators that eat these birds are also at risk. Lead shot-related waterfowl poisonings were first documented in the US in the 1880s. By 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as the source of waterfowl deaths. Lead shot has been banned for hunting waterfowl in several countries, including the US in 1991 and Canada in 1997. Other threats to wildlife include lead paint, sediment from lead mines and smelters, and lead weights from fishing lines. Lead in some fishing gear has been banned in several countries.|$|E
50|$|The <b>leading</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> {{unexpected}} death after otherwise routine {{surgery is}} myocardial infarction.

5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{receives}} {{close attention}} from surgeons since during neck surgery, especially thyroid and parathyroid surgery, the nerve {{is at risk}} for injury. Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a stroboscopic light confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches. The nerve is permanently damaged in 0.33% of thyroid surgery, and transiently in 38% of surgeries, {{and is one of the}} <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> medicolegal issues for surgeons.|$|E
5|$|Human {{factors are}} the {{physical}} or cognitive properties of individuals, or social behaviour specific to humans, which influences functioning of technological systems {{as well as}} human-environment equilibrium. Human error is inevitable and everyone makes mistakes at some time, {{and the consequences of}} these errors are varied and depend on many factors. Most errors are minor and do not cause harm, but in a high risk environment, such as in diving, errors {{are more likely to have}} catastrophic consequences. Examples of human error leading to accidents are available in vast numbers, as it is the direct cause of 60% to 80% of all accidents. Human error and panic are considered to be the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> diving accidents and fatalities. A study by William P. Morgan indicates that over half of all divers in the survey had experienced panic underwater at some time during their diving career, and these findings were independently corroborated by a survey that suggested 65% of recreational divers have panicked under water. Panic frequently leads to errors in a diver's judgement or performance, and may result in an accident. The safety of underwater diving operations can be improved by reducing the frequency of human error and the consequences when it does occur.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{cultural}} factors that reinforce this practice. These include the child's financial future, her dowry, social ties and social status, prevention of premarital sex, extramarital pregnancy and STIs. The arguments against it include interruption of education and loss of employment prospects, and hence economic status, as well as loss of normal childhood and its emotional maturation and social isolation. Child marriage places the girl in a relationship where she is in a major imbalance of power and perpetuates the gender inequality that contributed to the practice in the first place. Also in the case of minors, there are the issues of human rights, non-consensual sexual activity and forced marriage and a 2016 joint report of the WHO and Inter-Parliamentary Union places the two concepts together as Child, Early and Forced Marriage (CEFM), as did the 2014 Girl Summit (see below). In addition the likely pregnancies at a young age are associated with higher medical risks for both mother and child, multiple pregnancies and less access to care with pregnancy being amongst the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death amongst girls aged 15–19. Girls married under age {{are also more likely to}} be the victims of domestic violence.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rates}} of the <b>leading</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death, {{cardiovascular}} disease, cancer and lung disease, are similar in women and men, women have different experiences. Lung cancer has overtaken all other types of cancer as {{the leading cause of}} cancer death in women, followed by breast cancer, colorectal, ovarian, uterine and cervical cancers. While smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, amongst nonsmoking women the risk of developing cancer is three times greater than amongst nonsmoking men. Despite this, breast cancer remains the commonest cancer in women in developed countries, {{and is one of the}} more important chronic diseases of women, while cervical cancer remains one of the commonest cancers in developing countries, associated with human papilloma virus (HPV), an important sexually transmitted disease. HPV vaccine together with screening offers the promise of controlling these diseases. Other important health issues for women include cardiovascular disease, depression, dementia, osteoporosis and anemia. A major impediment to advancing women's health has been their underrepresentation in research studies, an inequity being addressed in the United States and other western nations by the establishment of centers of excellence in women's health research and large scale clinical trials such as the Women's Health Initiative.|$|E
