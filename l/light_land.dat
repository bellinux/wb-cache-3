Despite these early exploits and the company having extensive interests in producing engines for agricultural purposes Burrell paid scant attention to the construction of ploughing engines.

40|$|By far the {{greatest}} {{proportion of the}} 1, 150, 000 acres of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> in Canterbury is found on the Canterbury Plain. This plain, originally covered by "low tussock" and of easy contour, was enticing to the early pioneers {{and became one of}} the earliest areas in New Zealand to be settled and farmed. Over the years it has developed {{into one of the most}} intensively farmed and productive areas of New Zealand. The dominant characteristic of the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> of Canterbury is undoubtedly the climate. The rainfall is reasonably evenly distributed over the year, but because of the low humidity, high temperatures and warm winds experienced over the summer in association with a free draining soil, the effectiveness of the rainfall over this period is drastically reduced. Consequently active plant growth is severely restricted for several months over the summer, and occasionally extends into the spring and/or autumn periods. The uncertainty as to the length and severity of this restricted growth period and the associated problem of equating the variable feed supply to the stock requirements, both within and between years, is the basic problem confronting the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farmer. In spite of the environmental difficulties the productivity of the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> has increased several fold since early settlement. The original holdings on the Canterbury Plain were large with their boundaries on the rivers so as to provide access to water. Fine wool sheep were extensively grazed. However the introduction of refrigerated shipping and the extension of the water race system in the 1880 's brought about a reduction in the size of holdings and a change in the pattern of farming. Dual purpose sheep were run and by the 1930 's in response to favourable crop prices the system of diversified farming was firmly established. Unfortunately this system placed excessive emphasis on cash cropping, particularly on the light soils. Soil fertility was drained, structure severely damaged and subsequent pasture establishment and survival poor. In the late 1940 s and early 1950 s, with declining crop yields and with more favourable prices being obtained for fat lambs and particularly wool, the emphasis shifted from cropping to livestock farming. The carrying capacity however, was restricted by the reduced soil fertility and poor quality pastures and an environment in which climatic uncertainty tended to inhibit the rapid expansion of stock numbers. The results of research work carried out at the various institutions in Canterbury over the years have undoubtedly promoted a greater understanding and appreciation of the problems confronting the farmer and the limitations of the particular environment in which he must operate. For example, pasture species more suited to the low fertility conditions and climate were introduced with spectacular results. The most significant of these was subterranean clover (introduced in the 1930 s), noted for its ability to withstand the summer droughts, to regenerate in the autumn, and to provide an increased bulk of feed in the spring. Research work had shown that both lime and phosphate were necessary on the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> soils, if high pasture production and persistency was to be expected. Soil fertility increased subsequent to a reduction in the emphasis on cropping and with the higher levels of fertiliser application. High fertility pasture species (e. g. white clover and lucerne), were introduced and not only gave higher and more reliable total production but exhibited improved seasonal spread of production. Investigations into pasture diseases and stock health provided answers to specific problems. Research into flock management generally and in comparisons between the productivity of various sheep breeds indicated the most suitable type of flock and breed for the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farmer. From this and other research work (in conjunction with the observations of leading farmers in the area), an efficient system of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farming has gradually evolved in which many of the basic problems have been overcome and which has resulted in a raising of the carrying capacity of the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> from ¾ stock unit per acre in the 1930 's to 3 ½- 4 stock units per acre at present. A central feature of this system (particularly at high stocking rates), is the high degree of flexibility incorporated in both the stock policies and feed supplies. Where the objective function is to maximise productivity over a period of years, it is essential to utilise the available spring feed efficiently while maintaining the ability to destock when confronted with feed shortages in the spring and early summer. Because of the fluctuating feed supply, which is characteristic of <b>light</b> <b>land,</b> the need to maintain feed reserves and to incorporate a high degree of flexibility in the stock policy is evident if the feed supply and demand are to be equated. In summary, the increased productivity can be attributed to two factors: (1) The ability to grow a greatly increased quantity of herbage per acre with an improved seasonal pattern of production. (2) A more efficient utilisation of the herbage produced. Unlike his counterpart in more reliable farming districts, the <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farmer operates in an environment of uncertainty. Yield uncertainty, particularly at high stocking rates, is the major problem to be overcome and this dictates very largely the system of farming adopted. Price uncertainty is also a significant aspect of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farming because of the reliance on a limited range of products and the inability to diversify. In an analysis of physical and financial data collected from a sample of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farms in Canterbury (1) there was no evidence to suggest that any one particular pattern of output was superior to all others. This result was surprising, but may reflect the uncertainty inherent in the environment. (1) For a full discussion on this, see Section 3. 3. 2 (a). Alternatively it may infer that the actual patterns of production are less important than the managerial skill with which they are implemented. These results pointed to the need to explore more fully the following facets of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> management: (1) Given a developed farm, is there any one optimal pattern of production which (a) generates increased profit under average seasonal and price conditions, and (b) is subject to only small variations in profit under changing seasonal and price conditions? (2) Given the potential for the development and expansion of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farming, how profitable is this from the individual farmer's viewpoint? If, in an evaluation of the first problem, high levels of productivity are shown to be profitable on existing well developed farms, then a reallocation of resources to obtain the desired combination should be recommended. An optimum combination of enterprises shown by such an analysis might well serve as the goal where an undeveloped potential still exists on a farm and where a reallocation and intensification in the use of resources is necessary if productivity is to be increased. In this study of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farming two case farms have been used and although the results refer specifically to these particular farms, some conclusions of a general nature are possible. In Chapter II the physical characteristics of the area are described. In Chapter III a review of the research into specific problems relating to the management of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> is presented. This is followed in Chapter IV by an explanation of the technical principles of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farming which have evolved.

40|$|Approximately ¾ {{million acres}} of the Canterbury Plains are {{classified}} as <b>light</b> <b>land.</b> The soils are a shallow, stony loam overlying an open, shingle subsoil with a very low moisture holding capacity.

40|$|The study {{described}} in this article is concerned with the derivation of an average production function for 50 sheep farms on an area of <b>light</b> <b>land</b> in the Malvern County, Canterbury Plains, New Zealand. It is based on farm survey data for the 1955 / 6 season. The locality of the survey was chosen chiefly because it contained 51, 000 acres of essentially similar soils, the Lismore series, and an adequate number of farms exhibiting a fairly high degree of homogeneity in their management. Although there are variations in farm management in the area, the predominant pattern consists of the maintenance of half bred, threequarter bred, or Romney-cross ewe flocks for the production of Downcross fat lambs. Most of the replacements for ewe flocks are purchased from other areas but some of the larger properties breed their own. The average winter carrying capacity of the sheep farms in the area was 1. 7 ewe equivalents per acre for 1956. The system of farming is practically confined to a pastoral one due to the desiccating effect of the north west Fohn type winds which prevail during the summer. These conditions, combined with a shallow shingly soil, result in unreliable yields of cash crops and small seeds. Livestock Production/Industries, Productivity Analysis,...|$|E

40|$|Every year in New Zealand {{large numbers}} of ewes which are {{suitable}} for another full year of production are killed at the freezing works. This {{is the result of}} the breeding ewe's productive life being traditionally determined by the state of its incisor teeth. The basis for this culling policy is that ewes with worn or missing teeth are considered unable to graze and therefore to produce satisfactorily. The study takes the following form; (1) review of the relevant literature, (2) survey of farmers running 'gummy' ewes, (3) trial work analysing production and management characteristics of 'broken mouth' and 'gummy' ewes, and (4) development of two linear programming models (representing typical Canterbury <b>light</b> <b>land</b> and irrigated farms) utilising information gained in the above studies. The survey and trial work showed that a higher lambing percentage can be expected from aged (‘gummy') ewes. However, this was the case only when the ewes were given preference, over younger ewes, for good feed especially in the six week period before parturition. The results also show that the average wool weights from the aged ('gummy') ewes was lower than that expected from mixed aged ewes. The linear programming model solutions indicate that ewes should be culled at five and six years of age, under irrigated and dryland conditions respectively. The flock structures obtained were stable. Large variations in the cull ewe. prime lamb and wool prices were needed to alter the flock structures significantly. The results show that the traditional culling practice leads to unnecessary wastage of productive stock from the national ewe flock. Retention of 'broken' and 'gummy' mouth ewes is found to be physically possible and economically desirable, both to the individual farmer and to the nation...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} legume content in dryland pastures. Most dryland farmers continue to sow ryegrass/white clover pasture mixtures, but white clover fails to persist in drought conditions, leading to poor quality pastures. The objective {{of the study was}} to find out how much lucerne and subterranean clover are currently being utilised, to see which clovers are sown and the to assess the persistence of clovers, based on farmers' visual assessments of their pastures. A postal questionnaire was sent to 360 <b>light</b> <b>land</b> farmers in Canterbury and North Otago. The questionnaire focussed on pasture types, sowing rates, the use of greenfeeds, pasture management and animal carrying capacities on each property. A total of 82 questionnaire responses were received (26 %), 7 were discounted due to the small size of the properties, leaving 75 for the analysis. For the analysis of the results the respondents were stratified into those growing lucerne (n= 50) and those growing pastures only (n= 25). From the questionnaire respondents ten were selected for in-depth interviews, five that grew larger areas of lucerne and five that had predominately subterranean clover based pastures. The interviews and pasture assessments were conducted in October and November 2000. The results showed that for the farms growing lucerne (66. 7 %) the average area is only 17 % of the total farm area. The lambing percentage (survival to tailing) was 132 % on lucerne farms and 117 % on farms with 'no lucerne', but for the interviewed farmers growing lucerne the lambing percentage was 147 %, with 124 % for the no lucerne farms. The improved lambing percentage may be attributed to better ewe nutrition resulting in heavier liveweight ewes and the ability to flush ewes over mating. The predominant ewe breed was Border Corriedale (45 % of the farms surveyed), Corriedale (24 %) followed by Coop worth and Border Romney. The preferred sire was Polled Dorset (24 %), Border Corriedales (22 %) then Dorset Downs and Texels. The white clover cover as a percentage of total pasture cover was estimated by farmers as being 21 % in young pastures, but they estimated that this declined to 13 % in older pastures. Ninety seven percent of the surveyed farmers sowed white clover in their pasture mixes at an average sowing rate of 2. 35 kg/ha. Farmers believed that white clover persisted in their pastures for 6. 2 years on average, yet they only renewed their grass/clover pastures every 9. 9 years for the lucerne farmers and 12. 2 years for pasture only farmers. This implies that pastures are without white clover for between one third to one half of the lifetime of the pasture. Red clover is sown by 38 % of the farmers at an average of 2. 35 kg/ha, but has little contribution to pastures at less than 1 % of pasture cover on average. Only 32 % of farmers sowed subterranean (sub) clover in their pasture mixes despite the fact they believed it persists for 15. 4 years on average (beyond their current pasture renewal date). The farm owners visually estimated the sub clover botanical cover to constitute 11 % in young and 6 % in older pastures on the surveyed farms. On the interview farms, sub clover made up 41 % of the pasture cover in young and 35 % in old pastures. Meanwhile on the farms with no lucerne, sub clover was estimated to comprise 22 % in young and 21 % in the older pastures of the lucerne farms, when the farms were visited in mid/late spring. The average area of winter greenfeed sown was 15 hectares (8 % of farm area) for the sheep and beef farmers who did not winter graze additional stock, but 18 hectares (10 %) for the sheep and beef farmers who wintered dairy cows or deer. The latter group represented 18 % of all the farmers surveyed. Annual grass was the most commonly sown greenfeed type (25 %), followed by turnips (18 %) and then turnips and grass (14 %). There was little difference in the area of greenfeed sown between lucerne and pasture only farms...|$|E
40|$|Presencing Place is {{the inaugural}} {{exhibition}} {{of a newly}} formed North East artist collective Land/Space/Place opening 22 February 2014 for four weeks. The group is comprised of post-graduate research students and staff from Northumbria University and University of Sunderland, who have come together to explore convergent themes within their research projects that broadly investigate contemporary cultural uses of space. Curator Suzy O’Hara says “Presencing Place provides us with a route from the virtual world, where contemporary digital culture is rapidly altering the shape and nature of our everyday experiences and interactions, back to our physical, sensory landscapes’ Through a series of physical, intellectual and sensory explorations, we are invited to pause and take time to observe and respond to our material, natural environments. Each work presents a distinct artistic strategy that enables us to reflect and contemplate upon how we negotiate the physicality and experience the impact our presence has upon our surroundings. The exhibition {{is part of a}} pilot Graduate Art Programme, a seven month long programme run by Whistle Art Stop. Project co-ordinator Alison Raimes explains “The programme is committed to researching how to support and develop the North East arts graduates, and Haltwhistle provides a fitting context for the group’s first showcase. ” Each artist provides a unique perspective exploring our perception and experience of land, space and place. The accepted and often unquestioned authority imbibed in traditional maps is interrogated and challenged in the work of Clare Money. Through a series of techniques that involve pushing the maps fibrous structure past its tipping point and selectively erasing specific information, she investigates if the concealment or refocusing of data can result in alternative clarities or the underlying nature of the land to emerge. Paul Goodfellow seeks to ground his experience and artistic practice in the physical, psychological and sublime landscape. For this work, he draws upon his past career in environmental research and adopts a process known as ‘ground-truthing’. This involves mapping changes in the landscape through the intepretation of satellite images and physically walking in these areas to build up a sense of how these abstract colours related to the place. By logging key information about the physical landscape during a series of ‘System Walks’, and visually interpretating the data produced, he creates what he describes as ‘Systems Art’. As most of these ‘systems’ relate, on some level to landscape, walking in the landscape and a ‘sense of place’ The images to emerge from his ‘Systems Walks’ highlight the dramatic impact that the spatial and temporal fluidity of the Internet and networked information has had on our relationship and understanding of the complex nature of space. Agnieszka Kozlowska experiments in the medium of photography and is driven by a fascination with the moment of photographic exposure, when a tangible link is formed between the light-sensitive surface and the physical world. By constructing primitive cameras, using historical photographic processes and making paper, she explores the status of a photograph as a physical trace rather than purely an image. Kozlowska is interested in how such unique photographic objects affected by rays of light reflected off the scene in front of the lens can signify that which escapes pictorial representation, for example embodied perception of the environment or durational experience of long distance walking. Through a series of photographic objects, she proposes that photography, a natural phenomenon that takes place essentially independently of human intervention, can be a tool for representing what some cultural geographers have termed the ‘more-than-human’, sensuous dimensions of our interaction with the surrounding world. Jude Thomas creates momentary opportunities for reflection and contemplation by carving out space to breathe and escape. These spaces or pauses give permission to encounter and to recognise creativity. The work reflects her sense of awe of what is beyond us, what controls us and shapes the world we live in, the space of weather, of climate, of light. Thomas recognises that instead of skimming across and through the world, we need time to observe and be responsive, somewhere to contain the chaos. Thomas is interested in the layers of space presented by the sky, weather, <b>light,</b> <b>land</b> and thoughts. Through quiet contemplation of the physical object (the natural environment), she understands that nature offers us a sense of release yet also confronts us with challenge, friction and a sense of the unknown. Katie McGown work examines the translation of architectural structures into fabric forms to investigate the potential for urban spaces to be adapted to individual desire. She explores the nature of shelter and construction and how we conceive of the buildings and space around us and imagined rearrangements of the spaces and forms that hold and contain our lives. McGown draws upon personal experiences of moving to a new town, and reimaging a pretty little park whose manicured lawns and panoramic views obscure a history of windmills, plane crashes and plague pits. Her work imagines the missing foundations of past homes through repeated images of fabric blocks photographed on the site, shifting from whole shapes to fragments over the two panels. Lucy Livingstone explores the relationship between narrative and space. Using performance, site-specific installation, video screenings, photography and animation to examine philosophical questions about how we negotiate our environment and how spatial relationships are constructed through, and mediated by, cultural, political and economic imperatives. Drawing on a rich history of walking artists, which emerged from the literary lineage of Edgar Allen Poe and Walter Benjamin, and manifested in the Dadaist, The Surrealists and the Situationalists, she has developed a strategy of ‘getting lost’ on immersive walks. Her walks document the environment through lens based and aural recordings, using the material to create re-presentations of the sites.
