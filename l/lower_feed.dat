50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{environmental}} impact of aquaculture and especially of salmon farming, researches are being conducted to find alternatives to existing technologies. For the time being the marine net-pens is the only technology that dominates the aquaculture system in Canada.

Culturing fish in a closed environment not only can help fish farmers to better control the rearing conditions but also improve the quality of the fish. Closed containment systems could reduce {{the environmental impact}} of the salmon farming industry's current practices. Some of the benefits of these systems are: reduced fish escapes, minimized predator interactions, reduced disease transmission, <b>lower</b> <b>feed</b> inputs, higher stocking densities, and improved waste management capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Belgian Blue cattle have {{improved}} {{feed conversion ratio}} (FCR) due to <b>lower</b> <b>feed</b> intake compared to weight gain. The ability for these animals to {{have improved}} FCR is due to an altered composition of body weight gain which includes increased protein and decreased fat deposition. The Belgian Blue’s bone structure {{is the same as}} a normal cow, albeit holding a greater amount of muscle, which causes them to have a greater meat to bone ratio. These cattle have a muscle yield of about 20% more on average than cattle without the genetic myostatin mutation. Because of this breed’s increased muscle yield a diet containing higher protein is required to compensate for the altered mode of weight gain. During finishing this breed requires high-energy (concentrated) feeds, and will not yield the same results if put on a high-fiber diet.|$|E

Parental test consisted of parent rearing until the age of 154 days, the laying period of 280 days and from four fattening progeny tests (lasting for 35 days or else 42 days). Ross 308 chickens reached the higher live weight compared to Cobb 500 {{at the end of the}} rearing period in parental test. The <b>lower</b> <b>feed</b> consumption per head and day had Cobb 500 hybrids during this period.

The feeding rates consisted of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of body weight while feeding frequencies were one, three, and five times daily. Results showed that final weight, final length, and specific growth rate (SGR) differed in relation to feeding rate but not to feeding frequency. Highest values were obtained for fish on the 30 % ration and fed once a day. A significant effect of higher <b>feeding</b> rate using <b>lower</b> <b>feeding</b> frequency on growth was manifested in final mean weight and SGR; increasing feeding rate resulted in increased growth. Feeding frequency significantly influenced fry survival with highest values observed when fry were fed once or three times per day. Highest survivals were achieved by fry on the 30 % ration fed once daily. At higher feeding rates using lesser feeding frequencies better survival was noted. Survival rate had an inverse relationship to feeding frequency, but no overall relationship existed between feeding rate and survival rate. Both ration and feeding frequency significantly influenced normalized biomass index (NBI). Highest values were again obtained on the 30 % ration and feeding once daily.

40|$|METHODS: We {{conducted}} this mixed-method study among 748 {{children aged}} 6 months- 14 years attending 9 {{of a total}} of 32 care and treatment centers in Tanga region, Tanzania. We collected quantitative data using a standard questionnaire and qualitative data through seven focus group discussions (FGDs). RESULTS: HIV-positive children had high magnitudes of undernutrition. Stunting, underweight, wasting, and thinness were prevalent among 61. 9 %, 38. 7 %, 26. 0 %, and 21. 1 % of HIV-positive children, respectively. They also had poor feeding practices: 88. 1 % were fed at a frequency below the recommendations, and 62. 3 % had a low level of dietary diversity. <b>Lower</b> <b>feeding</b> frequency was associated with stunting (β = 0. 11, p = 0. 016); underweight (β = 0. 12, p = 0. 029); and thinness (β = 0. 11, p = 0. 026). <b>Lower</b> <b>feeding</b> frequency was associated with low wealth index (β = 0. 06, p< 0. 001), food insecurity (β =  - 0. 05, p< 0. 001), and caregiver's education. In the FGDs, participants discussed the causal relationships among the key associations; undernutrition was mainly due to low feeding frequency and dietary diversity. Such poor feeding practices resulted from poor nutrition knowledge, food insecurity, low income, and poverty. CONCLUSION: Feeding practices and nutrition status were poor among HIV-positive children even in food rich areas. Improving feeding frequency may help to ameliorate undernutrition. To improve it, tailored interventions should target children of poor households, the food insecure, and caregivers who have received only a low level of education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Zimbabwe, {{studies were}} made {{of the effect of}} host {{behaviour}} on the feeding success of Glossina pallidipes Austen and G. morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) attracted to cattle of different age and sex. The mean feeding rates for male and female G. pallidipes attracted to oxen were 60 % and 58 %, respectively, compared to 33 % and 53 % for male and female G. m. morsitans. The feeding rate of G. pallidipes varied between oxen and was inversely correlated with a host's rate of defensive leg movements, which, in turn, was positively correlated with the density of Stomoxys spp. (Diptera: Muscidae) caught {{in the vicinity of the}} host. Tsetse were signi®cantly less successful in feeding from young cattle. For G. pallidipes, the feeding rate on calves (< 6 months) was 11 %, whereas for male and female G. m. morsitans the rates were 12 % and 20 %, respectively. Signi®cantly <b>lower</b> <b>feeding</b> rates were apparent for cattle aged up to 2 years, when the feeding rate for G. pallidipes (31 %) was still signi®cantly less than that on mature oxen (68 %).
