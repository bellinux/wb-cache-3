5000|$|The {{resolution}} of a halftone screen {{is measured in}} <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>lpi).</b> This {{is the number of}} lines of dots in one inch, measured parallel with the screen's angle. Known as the screen ruling, the {{resolution of}} a screen is written either with the suffix lpi or a hash mark; for example, [...] "150 lpi" [...] or [...] "150#".|$|E
5000|$|Screens with a [...] "frequency" [...] of 60 to 120 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>lpi)</b> {{reproduce}} {{color photographs}} in newspapers. The coarser the screen (lower frequency), {{the lower the}} quality of the printed image. Highly absorbent newsprint requires a lower screen frequency than less-absorbent coated paper stock used in magazines and books, where screen frequencies of 133 to 200 lpi and higher are used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>LPI)</b> is a {{measurement}} of printing resolution. A line consists of halftones that is built up by physical ink dots {{made by the}} printer device to create different tones. Specifically LPI {{is a measure of}} how close together the lines in a halftone grid are. The quality of printer device or screen determines how high the LPI will be. High LPI indicates greater detail and sharpness.|$|E
40|$|Frequency Modulated (FM) {{screening}} {{has been}} praised for its apparent resolution advantage over conventional halftone screening. Studies showed FM screening can be processed {{with the existing}} technology, and it does bring about a visible improvement in image quality on newsprint. This study focused on the press performance of the FM halftone printing on newsprint. The fineness of conventional halftone screens can be described by indicating the screen rulings (<b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> or <b>lpi),</b> and the fineness of FM screens {{is measured by the}} size of the micro dots ([micron] or 10 ~ 6 m). It is difficult to equate the microdot size in FM screen to the screen ruling in the conventional halftone. This research uses the concept of the total border length per unit area on a given % film dot area as a common parameter to characterize both FM and conventional screens. By comparing the border length difference between a number of FM screens to the 85 -lpi conventional screen, the results show that the higher the border length ratio, the higher the dot gain of the screen in question. In addition, the maximum border length ratio for a given screen is where the maximum dot gain difference occurs. This research also investigated if there is significant color variation between FM and conventional screens when solid ink densities are varied. The Specifications for Non-Heat Advertising Printing (SNAP) recommends an 85 - lpi conventional screen for newsprint. UGRA recommends 40 [micron] FM screen for newspaper printing. Therefore, in this study the 85 -lpi conventional screen (AGFA Balanced screen) was used as the reference screen. The 42 [micron] FM screen (UGRA Velvet screen) was used for the color stability test. The test run was conducted on the Rockwell positive-feed keyless Newsliner newspaper press. Five inking levels were tested in the experiment with two inking levels lowered and two inking levels increased over the normal inking condition. The normal inking condition was set to conform to SNAP specifications. The results show that there is no significant color variation between FM and conventional screens over a wide range of solid ink density variation...|$|R
40|$|Color {{matching}} is {{an important}} issue in the flexographic industry today because of many problems related to it. For example, there are few standards of ink and color for spot color printing. Further, there is no standardization in the communication among anilox roller suppliers and their customers concerning the specific cell volume measurement of the anilox roller. This research focused on the study of the use of the banded anilox roller as a tool for color proofing under the assumption that a spot color printed by the flexographic process actually should be produced using a banded anilox roller as a tool for color proofing. The major questions for this study were: 1. How will the anilox cell volume and <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> affect the CIE LAB total color difference (AE) ? 2. Can the same color actually be produced with a AE 3 ̆c 2 (good match) by using the same specification of anilox roller? This research was conducted by printing a spot color with two banded anilox rollers to match the original Pantone color as close as possible and using it for the reference. The data collected from each of the bands was plotted in diagrams to see the effects of cell volume and <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> on the total color difference(AE). In this experiment, two ink color strengths were used. In the second experiment, three anilox rollers were tested. The same specifications were given from the particular band of banded anilox roller derived from the first experiment to give the best color match from the first run. The second experiment was to print the same spot color using the three anilox rollers and banded anilox to deter mine which would give the closest match to the original Pantone color. Samples from each of the anilox rollers were collected and measured for their total color differences (AE) as determined relative to the sample mean of press sheets selected from the second press run of the banded anilox roller. In addition, the same banded anilox from the second press run was used to run again to confirm the result. The press sheets for each of the anilox rollers was evaluated for the degree of color matching to the press sheet printed by the banded anilox from the second press run. The study results show that there is a negative linear relationship between the cell volume (BCM) and the CIE LAB total color difference (AE), and a positive linear relationship between the <b>line</b> screen <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>LPI)</b> and the CIE LAB total color difference (AE). Ink color strength also has {{a significant impact on the}} changing of the AE value. Furthermore, the same color can be produced with AE 3 ̆c 1 (no difference) by using the same banded anilox roller. However, only one of the three anilox rollers from different suppliers can produce the same color with the CIE LAB total color diffference (AE) 3 ̆c 2...|$|R

5000|$|PPI {{can also}} {{describe}} the resolution, in pixels, {{of an image}} file. A 100×100 pixel image printed in a 1 inch square has a resolution of 100 pixels per inch. Used this way, the measurement is meaningful when printing an image. It has become commonplace to refer to PPI as DPI, even though PPI refers to input resolution. Industry standard, good quality photographs usually require 300 pixels per inch, at 100% size, when printed onto coated paper stock, using a printing screen of 150 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>lpi).</b> This delivers a quality factor of 2, which is optimum. The lowest acceptable quality factor is considered 1.5, which equates to printing a 225 ppi image using a 150 lpi screen onto coated paper.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} screen ruling on color gamut were studied using 175, 330, 700 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>LPI)</b> {{halftone}} printed matter. The reflectance in the muddiness wavelength range, i. e., green (G) range of cyan (C) ink and blue (B) range of magenta (M) ink, improved drastically with increasing screen ruling. Micro reflection spectra of dot and non-dot (paper) areas were measured. With C printed matter, the G reflectance of dot area increased {{and that of}} non-dot area in red (R) range decreases with increasing the screen ruling. With M printed matter, the reflectance of dot area in B range increased and that of non-dot area in G range decreased with increasing the screen ruling. With accurate ink yellow (Y) printed matter, reflectance of the none-dot area in B region decreased with increasing the screen ruling. These phenomena {{can be explained by}} optical dot gain. Resulting these phenomena, color appearance became better according to increase the screen ruling...|$|E

40|$|The space which {{black and}} white or color images require to be stored {{introduces}} {{one of the biggest}} problems in the field of Graphic Arts. A solution to this problem is offered through the use of software programs that compress the data of a scanned image. Compressing images without any consideration can create other problems. These problems arise because each image has a different structure. It is possible to classify images into three main categories using as a criterion the frequencies the images contain. The first category includes images that contain high frequencies -a lot of detail and very small uniform areas. The second category includes images with fewer frequencies - less detail and larger uniform areas. The third includes images with low frequencies - just a few (or no) details and large uniform areas. The main goal of this study was to set compression ratio standards according to the structure of the images. A software program that does data compression was used. Three 35 mm slides were used as well. The slides have been chosen carefully so that the main topics were composed of frequencies in distinct ranges. All of the images were scanned at 300 pixels per inch. Then all of the images were compressed at three specific compression ratios (5 : 1, 8 : 1, and 14 : 1) and then printed. Output size was 5 x 7 inches, the resolution was 256 dpi, and halftones were 150 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> (<b>LPI).</b> A group of forty people (twenty professionals and twenty novices) compared the control image (non compressed image) with each of the compressed images. The Chi square test was used to analyze the data. The results indicate that it is acceptable to compress images with low detail (like the image Shaving Material) and medium detail (like the image Three Amigos) up to fourteen to one (14 : 1), because any loss of data is apparently not detectable by the human eye. On the other hand, images which contain a lot of detail (like the image Doll), can not be compressed using the above (14 : 1) compression ratio without any loss of information being detected. However these images can be compressed up to 8 : 1, and any loss of detail up to this compression ratio will not be detected...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to measure the amount of image quality loss due to the effect of screening an image with halftone screens. This was done by using screens of different line number and images with differing amounts of image quality. Six black and white continuous tone positive originals were used to scale the image quality. These prints had been produced so as to have equal steps of image quality from the sharpest and ranging to some lower image quality which was at or slightly below a just acceptable level of image quality. Each of these images was then screened by contact screens with rulings of 85, 100, 133, 150, and 200 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch.</b> Each image was viewed by a panel of judges using the method of categories. This was the method by which the relationship between screen ruling number and image quality was determined. The conclusions were that image quality of the original was {{the most important factor in}} the quality reproduction. The relation between input and output image quality was linear in terms of overall image quality of black and white halftone prints. Next important factor in the quality reproduction was the ink density in shadow areas, The 133 line screen prints had better quality than that of the 200 line screen on the average because of this factor. Screen ruling was a minor important factor in the quality reproduction. The screen rulings from 100 to 200 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> did not have so much effect toward image quality. In contrast, the screen rulings below 100 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> <b>inch</b> made the quality drop noticeably...|$|R

50|$|Image {{resolution}} can {{be measured}} in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be visibly resolved.

Line pairs are often used instead of lines; a line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 <b>lines</b> <b>per</b> millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 <b>line</b> pairs <b>per</b> millimeter (5 LP/mm).
