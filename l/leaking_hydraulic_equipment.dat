40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: The South African Hydraulic {{industry}} has an {{estimated market value}} of R 4. 63 billion [1]. Without the use of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> certain production processes would be impossible [2] [3]. A vast quantity of hydraulic systems are specifically designed and built to a user’s specific requirements and specification [4]. With the hydraulic market becoming more competitive, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers are required to maintain higher standards of quality with increasingly stringent safety regulations. The onset of poor performance of a hydraulic system can tarnish a manufactures’ reputation and influence future business opportunities [5]. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the cost implication claims have on the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Unsatisfactory performance within the standard guarantee period was investigated to determine the root causes of the systems failures. The investigation used existing claim data lodged against a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturer. It was made available by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturer to be analyzed. Each particular claim lodged, was sorted into categories pertaining to the claim initiators and the roots causes identified. The financial implication due to the claims were calculated and presented in terms of total cost, claim initiators and root cause of failures. The primary claim initiators were found to be system malfunction due to insufficient system performance. The major root causes of equipment failure identified poor assembly procedures and incorrect system design. The investigation concluded with recommendations that can reduce insufficient system performance due to poor assembly and system design...|$|R
25|$|A {{hydraulic}} power network {{is a system}} of interconnected pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few {{hydraulic power}} transmission networks are still in use; modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>equipment</b> has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a hydraulic network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|R
