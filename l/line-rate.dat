40|$|In {{high-speed}} network switches and routers, packet memories {{have to allow}} line-speed buffering of data packets. With today’s growing network <b>line-rates,</b> memory bandwidth is an essential constraint to build {{high-speed network}} buffers. In this paper, we propose a methodology for designing high-performance network-specific memories using slower lower-cost building blocks. We use parallel memory devices to increase the bandwidth. One possible problem of such architecture is inefficient usage of memory capacities due to division of buffering space between two or more memory pieces. We have concluded that this problem arises {{from the fact that}} numbers of accesses to memory blocks are imbalanced due to random nature of packet arrivals and departures. For some specific applications (e. g. network buffers) where accessing the memory is more predictable, this problem could be resolved. What we introduce is a new access control mechanism for a parallel memory system which increases the overall bandwidth while utilizes the entire buffering space. To show a case study, we have designed a double-bandwidth network buffer which uses two half-speed memory devices and supports a multi-FIFO queuing system. The analysis and simulation results show that while the bandwidth of the memory system is increased by a factor of two, the buffering space is totally utilized...|$|R
40|$|Internet {{traffic is}} {{doubling}} {{almost every other}} year which implies that datacenter (DC) scalability will {{play a critical role}} in enabling future communications. In this paper, we propose FISSION (Flexible Interconnection of Scalable Systems Integrated using Optical Networks) -a scalable, fault-tolerant DC architecture based on a switchless optical-bus backplane and carrier-class switches, and its supporting protocol. The FISSIONDCenables unprecedented scalability using affordable optics and standardized electrical switches. It is architecturally bifurcated into sectors that internally have a nonblocking carrier-class switching interconnection structure. Sectors are connected in the switchless backplane using optical buses. Each sector can receive traffic on all wavelengths (achieved through optical-bus property without any switch reconfiguration) and across all fibers, but a sector transmits on only a group of wavelengths and only in one of the fiber rings in the backplane. The switches function based on an SDN methodology that facilitate mapping of complex protocols and addresses to DC-specific addressing that is scalable and easier to use. We present an analysis to optimize the FISSION architecture. A simulation model is proposed that (1) compares the FISSION approach to other contemporary designs; (2) provides scalability analysis and protocol performance measurement; and, (3) provides optical layer modeling to validate working of the FISSION framework at high <b>line-rates.</b> Our architecture, which provides 100 % bisection bandwidth, is validated by simulation results exhibiting negligible packet loss and low end-to-end latency...|$|R
40|$|Longest Prefix Matching (LPM) is a {{fundamental}} part of various network processing tasks. Previously proposed approaches for LPM result in prohibitive cost and power dissipation (TCAMs) or in large memory requirements and long lookup latencies (tries), when considering future <b>line-rates,</b> table sizes and key lengths (e. g., IPv 6). Hash-based approaches {{appear to be an}} excellent candidate for LPM with the possibility of low power, compact storage, and O(1) latencies. However, there are two key problems that hinder their practical deployment as LPM solutions. First, naïve hash tables incur collisions and resolve them using chaining, adversely affecting worst-case lookup-rate guarantees that routers must provide. Second, hash functions cannot directly operate on wildcard bits, a requirement for LPM, and current solutions require either considerably complex hardware or large storage space. In this paper we propose a novel architecture which successfully addresses for the first time, both key problems in hash based LPM — making the following contributions: (1) We architect an LPM solution based upon a recently-proposed, collision-free hashing scheme called Bloomier filter, by eliminating its false positives in a storage efficient way. (2) We propose a novel scheme called prefix collapsing, which provides support for wildcard bits with small additional storage and reduced hardware complexity. (3) We exploit prefix collapsing and key characteristics found in real update traces to support fast and incremental updates, a feature generally not available in collision-free hashing schemes...|$|R

5000|$|In December 1953 the FCC {{unanimously}} approved what is {{now called}} the NTSC color television standard (later defined as RS-170a). The compatible color standard retained full backward compatibility with existing black-and-white television sets. Color information was added to the black-and-white image by introducing a color subcarrier of precisely 315/88 MHz (usually described as 3.579545 MHz or 3.58 MHz). The precise frequency was chosen so that horizontal <b>line-rate</b> modulation components of the chrominance signal would fall exactly in between the horizontal <b>line-rate</b> modulation components of the luminance signal, thereby enabling the chrominance signal to be filtered out of the luminance signal with minor degradation of the luminance signal. Due to limitations of frequency divider circuits at the time the color standard was promulgated, the color subcarrier frequency was constructed as composite frequency assembled from small integers, in this case 5×7×9/(8×11) MHz. [...] The horizontal line rate was reduced to approximately 15,734 lines per second (3.579545×2/455 MHz = 9/572 MHz) from 15,750 lines per second, and the frame rate was reduced to 30/1.001 ≈ 29.970 frames per second (the horizontal line rate divided by 525 lines/frame) from 30 frames per second. These changes amounted to 0.1 percent and were readily tolerated by existing television receivers.|$|E
40|$|Systems {{designed}} to prevent security breaches on a network tend to be slow or inextensible due to high complexity. In this report I have outlined the design and implementation of an extensible network intrusion detection (NID) framework built in hardware. This system is the first packet processing framework written in a highlevel hardware-based language, that has had implementations of the Snort rule-set adapted for it to provide a flexible intrusion detection system with runtime reconfiguration, running at over 1 Gbs − 1. Coupled with this, the framework can operate at extremely low-latencies of less than 5 µs enabling it to respond rapidly to new requests. The framework uses 35 % of a Virtex-II 6000 FPGA with a built in abstraction layer to separate blocks, making it appear as though data is a stream flowing through the system. Abstraction {{and the fact that}} it is written in a high-level language makes the system easier to extend than existing solutions. The low area means that the power consumption of the board is lower, opening up the opportunity for portability using only 61 mA of current for the design. Several other applications have been plugged into the framework. It can process video streams over a network at Gigabit <b>line-rates,</b> twice as fast as a Pentium IV 3. 2 GHz processor. The framework enables blocks written in multiple hardware-based languages to be plugged directly into the system with no loss of throughput or latency making it just as flexible as existing solutions. Automation tools have been written to automatically plug blocks into the framework. This enables faster testing and the ability to view the components of the system and links between them. An innovative method of automating system design and viewing the system has been developed. This enables Handel-C components to be viewed along with the links between them, and different components to be plugged together automatically. 3...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet {{continues}} as its usage continues to pervade everyday life, significantly impacting individuals, businesses, industries, and academia. Studies {{have shown that the}} both the traffic and the number of hosts on the Internet have been, and are expected to continue, growing exponentially. In addition, security concerns and innovative applications continue to add to the functionality demanded by the Internet. ^ The operation of the Internet is fundamentally facilitated by routers, or packet switches. The growth trends in size, speed and functionality translate into opportunities and challenges in the design of future-generation routers. Edge-routers perform elaborate packet processing, but with less rigid performance guarantees because they are usually lower in cost. On the other hand, core-routers typically perform IP-lookup on the packets and are expected to do so with worst-case guarantees, albeit at higher system cost. Furthermore, advanced packet classification and a possible transition to IPv 6 require longest prefix matching (LPM) on keys significantly longer than IPv 4, and there is need for an efficient LPM scheme for arbitrarily long keys. ^ In edge-routers, elaborate packet processing leads to high variation in processing times across packets. This variation and the cost and complexity considerations for edge-routers preclude a worst-case design paradigm. The packet-buffer design in edge-routers offers opportunities for average-case improvements, which are currently unexploited. As the first contribution of my dissertation, I propose and quantitatively evaluate a number of opportunistic techniques for improving performance of network-processor-based edge-routers by efficiently utilizing the memory bandwidth of the packet-buffer. ^ In core-routers, worst-case guarantees and high <b>line-rates</b> necessitate IP-lookup to be performed on custom hardware. Yet, even with custom hardware, the growth trends of the Internet are beginning to outpace the technology scaling of hardware components such as memory, giving rise to scalability challenges. A truly scalable IP-lookup scheme must address five challenges of scalability, namely: routing-table size, lookup throughput, implementation cost, power dissipation, and routing-table update cost. However, when subjected to the scaling requirements of tomorrow 2 ̆ 7 s routers, none of the previously-proposed IP-lookup schemes satisfy all the five scalability requirements. As the second contribution of my dissertation, I propose Scalable Dynamic Pipelining, a novel IP-lookup scheme which is the first to scale well in all five factors with worst-case guarantees.
