40|$|One of {{component}} which a part {{to determine}} the efficacy of learning process is the <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> Teaching is a meaningful process, which contains many values to transmit to students. The values couldn 2 ̆ 7 t come by themselves, however there were taken away from various <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> which could be utilized in the instructional process directly and even indirectly. <b>Learning</b> <b>resources</b> is the substance or material to adding science and loading new information for students. In these meaning, learning sources are including message, people, materiasl, devices, techniques, and setting. <b>Learning</b> <b>resources</b> will be more meaningful and useful if teacher could apply them {{in the right way}} in learning process.

The increased time spent learning in the clinical setting means that {{a deeper understanding of the}} use of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> by nursing students is necessary. A questionnaire survey was completed by 247 nursing students at Northumbria University around their use of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> on placement.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{literature}} review of research {{concerned with the}} production of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> in higher education (HE). It forms {{part of a larger}} research project in progress. We identify and discuss six models which may be used to understand the development and reuse of <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> We focus specifically on the level at which the models operate, their purpose, structure and content and critically analyse the advantages and disadvantages associated with their application. Aspects which the models do not address, for instance actual staff practices and the cultural context of development, are then discussed. We focus on understanding academic staff practices and behaviour in <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> production. Staff time is a major cost element in the production of <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> Despite recent international work on costing methodologies for HE and their application to networked <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> (for example, Bacsich and Ash, 2000; DETYA, Ernst and Young, 2000; Flashlight, 2002; Jones, 2001; NBEET, 1994), there is little documentation of the use of staff time in the production of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> for face-to-face campus-based teaching. This paper is not concerned with costing methodologies, rather we are interested in the non-economic factors which influence the everyday practice of staff in the <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> production process. We argue that the latter will enable us to understand better the needs of staff for support in the production of <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> A phenomenographic approach is needed to understand the everyday practices of staff and factors influencing the <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> production process...|$|R

30|$|Each of {{the main}} topics has a topic “bundle,” which is a {{conditional}} branching structure composed of various <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> that cover that specific topic (along with the associated KCs).

That is, ASSISTments provided “If-Then” functionality within a bundle to sequence <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> and tasks within a topic, based on performance of the student on the specific topic and also previous measures in the Learning Record Store. The conditional branching between different <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> within a topic is sensitive to the scores while tracking student knowledge at the KC level and governs what <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> are presented at the local bundle level (as opposed to a more global level).|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a report of a study that was {{undertaken}} to establish <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> {{that are used in}} the teaching of Kiswahili oral literature in secondary schools in Kenya.

Second, to investigate and report on the state of affairs as regards <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> for teaching Kiswahili oral literature in our schools. Third, to assess methods that are used by the teachers to assess the learning of oral Literature in Kiswahili. Fourth, to make recommendation on strategies which could be employed to improve the <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> used in the teaching of Kiswahili oral literature in secondary schools. This research adopted descriptive survey design. In total, twenty-seven Form Two Kiswahili teachers took part in the study. The research study reported that most schools had <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> {{that could be used in}} the teaching of Kiswahili oral literature, the notable ones included, textbooks for teachers and students, reference books, chalkboard and chalk materials, teacher made handouts, Kiswahili newspapers and magazines cuttings and pictures, charts, audio tapes and posters, pupil researched topics, notice boards and television. When the frequency of use was checked it was established that availability of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> did not automatically lead to their use. The research study further realized that most Kiswahili oral literature <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> were supplied by schools, students, teachers and parents. Very few <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> were acquired through donations or on loan. Finally, the paper suggested and discussed various recommendations on strategies which could be employed to improve the <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> used in the teaching of Kiswahili oral literature in secondary schools...|$|R

40|$|An {{appropriate}} use {{of various}} pedagogical strategies is fundamental for the effective transfer of knowledge in a flourishing e-learning environment. The resultant information superfluity, however, needs to be tackled for developing sustainable e-learning. This necessitates an effective representation and intelligent access to <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> Topic maps address these problems of representation and retrieval of information in a distributed environment. The former aspect is particularly relevant where the subject domain is complex and the later aspect is important where the amount of resources is abundant but not easily accessible. Conversely, effective presentation of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> based on various pedagogical strategies along with global capturing and authentication of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> are an intrinsic part of effective management of <b>learning</b> <b>resources.</b> Towards fulfilling this objective, this paper proposes a multi-level ontology-driven topic mapping approach to facilitate an effective visualization, classification and global authoring of <b>learning</b> <b>resources</b> in e-learning...|$|R
