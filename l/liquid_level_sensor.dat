The liquid {{level in the}} horizontal pipe is controlled {{in the middle of}} the pipe. The liquid level is controlled by a <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensor</b> in the horizontal pipe and a control valve in the gas run. As the liquid level rises in the horizontal pipe, the level sensor sends a signal to the control valve and which begins to pinch shut to create some slight back pressure to push the liquid level down. Conversely, as liquid level goes goes down, the control valve beings to open to relieve pressure to allow the liquid level to rise. In essence, the control valve modulates to maintain the liquid level {{in the middle of the}} horizontal pipe. With a large gas/liquid interface area, thin gas-bearing emulsion layer and quiescent flow in the horizontal pipe, all contribute to the final removal of free gas bubbles from the liquid stream. All of the free gas removed in the horizontal section joins the gas run through a connecting run and is measured in the gas leg. The liquid, now free of gas drops to a liquid run for measurement.|$|E

The overall system was designed to measure nozzle effluent in 25 mm divisions from 38. 1 to 76. 2 cm in width for multiple nozzle configurations with a total patternator surface width of 3. 05 m. The patternator surface and data collection system were designed and developed to achieve three primary goals: patternator surface division accuracy, data collection system accuracy, and data collection system repeatability. Patternator surface measurements indicated an average standard deviation of approximately 0. 1 mm (0. 4 %) which would not contribute significantly to spray pattern CV estimates. To quantify the measurement accuracy, the automated system was compared to manual data collection using weights collected from graduated cylinders. Statistical analysis revealed no difference (p > 0. 05) between CV estimates from the manual and automated data collection methods. The average difference in CV between the two methods was 0. 15 % which considered 12 tests per method. Repeatability was also a primary concern, the standard deviation among CV values for tests conducted with the automated system was only 0. 35 %. The evaluation of the system provided confidence that suitable results would be acquired for different nozzle configurations consisting of acceptable or relatively poor spray patterns. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers...|$|R

The most frequently used <b>level</b> <b>sensors</b> in aircraft fuel systems are based on capacitive, ultrasonic and electric techniques, however they suffer from intrinsic safety concerns in explosive environments combined with issues relating to reliability and maintainability. In the last few years, optical fiber <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensors</b> (OFLLSs) have been reported to be safe and reliable and present many advantages for aircraft fuel measurement. Different OFLLSs have been developed, such as the pressure type, float type, optical radar type, TIR type and side-leaking type. Amongst these, many types of OFLLSs based on fiber gratings have been demonstrated. However, these sensors have not been commercialized because they exhibit some drawbacks: low sensitivity, limited range, long-term instability, or limited resolution. In addition, any sensors that involve direct interaction of the optical field with the fuel (either by launching light into the fuel tank or via the evanescent field of a fiber-guided mode) must be able to cope with the potential build up of contamination-often bacterial-on the optical surface.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 93 - 94. The {{coplanar}} {{line has}} been used very successfully as an element in microwave circuits. Small size, high Q-factor, and accurate reproduction, are some of its many advantages. The coplanar transmission lines discussed in this report, are targeted at <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement, and are typically 30 cm. long. Their operating frequencies are consequently much {{lower than those of}} microwave coplanar waveguides, but they have common advantages. The factor which separates the coplanar line from similar <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> <b>sensors,</b> is that it makes use of the electrical component of the electromagnetic fringe field, setup between its inner conductor, and the surrounding ground plane. The line is effectively a sharply tuned resonator, incorporated as the frequency controlling element of an electronic oscillator. The output frequency falls as a dielectric material penetrates the fringe field. An impressive sensitivity is accomplished by using very thin conductors, thereby ensuring that the fringe field energy is maximised. The most important feature of this sensor is its ability to operate non-intrusively when used with non-conducting vessels, or if employed in a metal tank, the unit can be encased in a dielectric material where the line is non-contacting (the liquid does not penetrate the unit). This combined with its excellent mechanical and electrical stability, and an accuracy better than 1 percent, makes the coplanar line a strong competitor in the field of <b>liquid</b> <b>level</b> measurement. The research began with a theoretical approach, and used lines machined from an Aluminium plate for characteristic impedance measurement. An empirical relation between the gap width, the line thickness, and the characteristic impedance of the line is presented.
