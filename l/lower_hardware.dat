50|$|Powerful desktop {{computers}} are commonplace in amateur radio stations. Software modems using the computer's soundcard have <b>lowered</b> <b>hardware</b> requirements even further. However, with their lower cost comes additional tweaking {{in order to}} make them work properly, and they often do not provide the decoding capabilities at low Signal/Noise ratios. Some handheld and mobile VHF radios currently on the market incorporate TNC abilities within the radio itself in support of the APRS protocol.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lowered</b> <b>hardware</b> {{prices for}} new (or changing) {{customers}} were compensated by cutting the free-of-charge digital tv basic package (over 110 TV channels) in half, into a free-of-charge Mini package (over 50 TV channels) and a chargeable Classic package, containing more than 60 additional TV channels. Also the former five thematic collection packages, and the HD package were folded {{into the new}} Comfort package, and aren't sold individually anymore. Customers opting to keep their existing packages are unaffected by the changes, and get the digital tv basic (now Classic) free-of-charge, and the individual collection packages as following described.|$|R

40|$|Data {{analytics}} and {{enterprise applications}} have very dif-ferent storage functionality requirements. For this rea-son, enterprise deployments of data analytics {{are on a}} separate storage silo. This may generate additional costs and inefficiencies in data management, e. g., whenever data needs to be archived, copied, or migrated across si-los. We introduce MixApart, a scalable data processing framework for shared enterprise storage systems. With MixApart, a single consolidated storage back-end man-ages enterprise data and services all types of workloads, thereby <b>lowering</b> <b>hardware</b> costs and simplifying data management. In addition, MixApart enables the local storage performance required by analytics through an in-tegrated data caching and scheduling solution. Our pre-liminary evaluation shows that MixApart can be 45 % faster than the traditional ingest-then-compute workflow used in enterprise IT analytics, while requiring one third of storage capacity when compared to HDFS. ...|$|R
50|$|Then, {{after the}} early '90s, Microsoft's Windows PC {{platform}} {{was starting to}} reach the performance needed for Antics, but with much <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> costs—and additionally it was also incorporating the kind of output and video devices required as standard, in particular for the emerging market of PC multimedia production.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} conceived after the authors {{created a new}} routine for hardware scrolling; when the player uses a speed scroll, the routine {{can be seen at}} full speed. Due to <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> specifications, the Acorn Electron version used a much smaller playing window and the speed scrolls were omitted.|$|E
50|$|A line {{discipline}} (LDISC) is a layer {{in the terminal}} subsystem in some Unix-like systems. The terminal subsystem consists of three layers: the upper layer to provide the character device interface, the <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> driver {{to communicate with the}} hardware or pseudo terminal, and the middle {{line discipline}} to specify a policy for the driver.|$|E

5000|$|File Service Protocol (FSP) is a UDP-based {{replacement}} for the File Transfer Protocol, designed for anonymous access with <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> and network requirements than FTP. In particular, because it uses UDP, it avoids the problems that many FTP servers have had with requiring a separate process for each client, [...] {{and because it is}} built to use an unreliable protocol, it can more easily handle resuming a transfer after a network failure.|$|E
30|$|For pilot {{testing of}} the system, we {{recruited}} 150 volunteers to test our system in real-life conditions for at least 3 months each. We performed the tests in two consecutive rounds—this approach allowed us {{to work with a}} manageable number of users, <b>lowered</b> the <b>hardware</b> costs, and allowed us to enroll minor fixes to the bugs encountered in the first round before starting with the second round.|$|R

First, we extend the behavioral model we already proposed, in order to include detailed fractional aspects. Second, we propose a new adaptive algorithm that can be integrated in this ADPLL in order to <b>lower</b> its <b>hardware</b> complexity, and argue on a recently proposed algorithm for DCO gain estimation. These points are illustrated through simulations. I...|$|R
50|$|A hosted system {{relies on}} an outside service provider. Software is {{purchased}} and {{installed in a}} data center on either physical or virtual servers that may be owned or leased by the business. Implementation is similar to an on-premises solution, but the cost is typically <b>lower</b> because <b>hardware</b> need not be purchased. However, the business must pay an initial provisioning fee {{as well as a}} monthly fee for the rental or usage of the hosting center’s equipment and personnel.|$|R

The product tracks metadata, information about each block of data stored on the Compellent system, including the date and time written, frequency of access, associated volume, type of disk drive used, type of data stored and RAID level. Large amounts of data are stored and managed on a granular level and assigned automatically to high-performance drives or large-capacity drives. Compellent said this method of data management can <b>lower</b> <b>hardware,</b> power and cooling costs." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Ubuntu Developer Summit held in May 2012 set the {{priorities}} for this release. They are forecast {{to include an}} improved boot up sequence and log-in screen, dropping Unity 2D in favor of <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> requirements for Unity 3D, wrap around dialogs and toolbars for the HUD and a [...] "vanilla" [...] version of Gnome-Shell as an option. The release would likely include GNOME 3.6, Python 3 and the 3.5 Linux kernel. It would ship with Python 3 in the image, but with Python 2 available in the repositories, via the [...] "python" [...] package.The kernel will have the PAE switched on by default.|$|E
50|$|The {{pseudorandom}} keystream {{is typically}} generated serially from a random seed value using digital shift registers. The seed value {{serves as the}} cryptographic key for decrypting the ciphertext stream.Stream ciphers represent {{a different approach to}} symmetric encryption from block ciphers. Block ciphers operate on large blocks of digits with a fixed, unvarying transformation. This distinction is not always clear-cut: in some modes of operation, a block cipher primitive is used {{in such a way that}} it acts effectively as a stream cipher. Stream ciphers typically execute at a higher speed than block ciphers and have <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> complexity. However, stream ciphers can be susceptible to serious security problems if used incorrectly (see stream cipher attacks); in particular, the same starting state (seed) must never be used twice.|$|E
50|$|When game servers were {{restricted}} by limited available {{resources such as}} storage, memory, internal bandwidth, and computational capacity due to the technologies available {{and the cost of}} the hardware, coupled with internet connections that were slow, it was believed to be necessary to compromise on security for optimization to minimize the impact on the end-user. Today however, with the increased speed and power of multi-core computers, <b>lower</b> priced <b>hardware,</b> and the increased availability of broadband internet, this has become less of an issue.|$|R

The update {{included a}} mobile version of Internet Explorer 9 {{that supports the}} same web standards and graphical capability as the desktop version, multi-tasking of third-party apps, Twitter integration for the People Hub, and Windows Live SkyDrive access. A minor update released in 2012 known as [...] "Tango", along with other bug fixes, <b>lowered</b> the <b>hardware</b> requirements to allow for devices with 800 MHz CPUs and 256 MB of RAM to run Windows Phone.|$|R
50|$|The Game Boy Color {{version was}} {{released}} in Japan in 1999 and Europe in 2000. It is scaled down in all ways, with downgraded graphics and different musical themes (albeit derived {{from those of the}} N64) designed specifically for its much <b>lower</b> powered <b>hardware,</b> and with gameplay that is significantly slower and does not fully match that of the console/PC versions (e.g. the points system uses much lower base scores, Lakes in which the player wants to create Rubber Ducks must have larger areas, etc.).|$|R
5000|$|However, {{multiplexed}} display {{techniques are}} more often used than direct drive, because they have lower net hardware costs.For example, most people who design digital clocks design them such that when the clock displays [...] "12:34" [...] on a seven-segment display, at any one instant the clock turns on the appropriate segments {{of one of the}} digits—all the other digits are dark. The clock scans through the digits rapidly enough that it gives the illusion that it is [...] "constantly" [...] displaying [...] "12:34" [...] for an entire minute. However, each [...] "on" [...] segment is actually being rapidly pulsed on and off many times a second. Such multiplexed displays have net <b>lower</b> <b>hardware</b> costs, but the resulting pulsed operationmakes the display inevitably dimmer than directly driving the same LEDs independently.|$|E

5000|$|Major {{corporations}} tend to instead implement {{thin clients}} (using Microsoft Windows Terminal Server or other such software), since much <b>lower</b> specification <b>hardware</b> {{can be used}} for the client (which essentially acts as a simple [...] "window" [...] into the central server which is actually running the users operating system as a login session). Of course, diskless nodes can also be used as thin clients.
