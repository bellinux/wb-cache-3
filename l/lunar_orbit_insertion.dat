5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would then have been used to perform <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E
5|$|The {{first three}} lunar {{missions}} (Apollo 8, Apollo 10, and Apollo 11) used a free return trajectory, keeping a flight path coplanar with the lunar orbit, {{which would allow}} a return to Earth in case the SM engine failed to make <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> Landing site lighting conditions on later missions dictated a lunar orbital plane change, which required a course change maneuver soon after TLI, and eliminated the free-return option.|$|E
5|$|One {{of these}} {{proposals}} was the Gemini Lunar Orbit Rescue Vehicle, {{which was designed}} to retrieve the crew of an Apollo spacecraft stranded in orbit around the Moon. It was to have used a stretched reentry module to accommodate the three astronauts who would have been aboard the Apollo. This would have been attached to a modified Equipment Module. The Equipment Module contained engines which would be used for <b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and trans-Earth injection, as well as life support equipment to keep the crew alive until they returned to Earth. Launch and trans-Lunar injection would have been performed by a Saturn V. Once the spacecraft was in Lunar orbit, the Apollo crew would have boarded it by means of an EVA.|$|E
50|$|At {{approximately}} 2:47 pm EST on December 10, the Service Propulsion System engine on the Command/Service Module ignited to {{slow down}} the CSM/Lunar Module stack into <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> Following <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and orbital stabilization, the crew began preparations for landing in the Taurus-Littrow valley.|$|R
40|$|A {{first order}} orbital {{mechanics}} {{analysis was conducted}} to examine the possibility of utilizing the Space Shuttle Orbiter to perform payload delivery missions to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> In the analysis, the earth orbit of departure was constrained {{to be that of}} Space Station Freedom. Furthermore, no enhancements of the Orbiter's thermal protection system were assumed. Therefore, earth <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuvers were constrained to be all propulsive. Only minimal constraints were placed on the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> and no consideration was given to possible landing sites for lunar surface payloads. The various phases and maneuvers of the mission are discussed for both a conventional (Apollo type) and an unconventional mission profile. The velocity impulses needed, and the propellant masses required are presented for all of the mission maneuvers. Maximum payload capabilities were determined for both of the mission profiles examined. In addition, other issues relating to the feasibility of such lunar shuttle missions are discussed. The results of the analysis indicate that the Shuttle Orbiter would be a poor vehicle for payload delivery missions to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit...</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{reaching}} <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> {{three days}} later, Young {{remained in the}} Command Module (CM) Charlie Brown while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM Snoopy and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> maneuver by firing their descent engine, and tested their crafts landing radar {{as they approached the}} 50000 ft altitude where powered descent would begin on Apollo 11. They surveyed the landing site in the Sea of Tranquility, then separated the descent stage and fired the ascent engine to return to Charlie Brown. The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moons non-uniform gravitational field; its location was not tracked.|$|R
25|$|During {{the three-day}} trans-lunar coast, the four-man crew would monitor the Orion's systems, inspect their Altair {{spacecraft}} and its support equipment, and correct their flight path {{as necessary to}} allow the Altair to land at a near-polar landing site suitable for a future lunar base. Approaching the lunar far side, the Orion/Altair combination would orient the Altair's engines forward and make the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI) burn.|$|E
25|$|The Altair descent {{stage was}} to be powered by four RL-10 rocket engines, which are also those used in the Centaur upper stage of the Atlas V rocket. Unlike the current RL-10 engines in use, these newer RL-10s were {{to have the ability}} to {{throttle}} down to as low as 10% rated thrust (the older specifications allow for 20%), thus allowing the use of Altair for both the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> (LOI) and landing stages of lunar missions. The ascent stage was designed to be powered by a single engine, likely a hypergolic engine similar or identical to the main engine of the Orion CSM, which would use the descent stage as both a launchpad and a platform for future base construction. Alternately, there was a small possibility that the original plan of using LOX/CH4–fueled engines on board the Block II (lunar) Orion CSM and Altair ascent stage would have been adopted.|$|E
500|$|After {{waking up}} on flight day four, the crew began {{preparations}} for the maneuver that would brake the spacecraft into orbit around the Moon, or <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion.</b> At a distance of [...] from the Moon, the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay cover was jettisoned. At just over 74 hours into the mission, the spacecraft passed behind the Moon, losing direct contact with Mission Control. While over {{the far side of}} the Moon, the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine burned for 6 minutes and 15 seconds, braking the spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon with a low point (pericynthion) of 58.3 and a high point (apocynthion) of 170.4 nautical miles (108.0 and 315.6km, respectively). After entering lunar orbit, the crew began {{preparations for the}} Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) maneuver to further modify the spacecraft's orbital trajectory. The maneuver was successful, decreasing the craft's pericynthion to [...] The remainder of flight day four was spent making observations and preparing for activation of the Lunar Module, undocking, and landing the next day.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many <b>lunar</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, {{scientists}} came to discover that most low <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> (LLO) are unstable. PFS-2 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, squarely {{into one of the}} most unstable of orbits, at 11 degrees orbital inclination, far from the four frozen <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> discovered only later at 27°, 50°, 76°, and 86° inclination.|$|R
50|$|The crew stayed {{an extra}} day in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> taking photographs, for a total lunar surface stay of 31 {{and a half hours}} and a total time in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> of eighty-nine hours.|$|R
50|$|In later years, {{through a}} study of many <b>lunar</b> <b>orbiting</b> satellites, {{scientists}} came to discover that most low <b>lunar</b> <b>orbits</b> (LLO) are unstable. Fortunately, PFS-1 had been placed, unknown to mission planners at the time, very near to one of only four <b>lunar</b> frozen <b>orbits,</b> where a <b>lunar</b> satellite may remain indefinitely.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} Mission Control issued the {{wake-up call to}} the crew for flight day two, the {{spacecraft}} was about [...] away from the Earth, traveling at about [...] As it was not due to arrive in lunar orbit until flight day four, flight days two and three were largely preparatory days, consisting of spacecraft maintenance and scientific research. On day two, the crew performed an electrophoresis experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which they attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module {{for the second time}} in the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite this, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> <b>Insertion</b> burn. Command Module Pilot Mattingly reported a [...] "gimbal lock" [...] warning light, indicating the craft was not reporting an attitude. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon. At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about [...] away from Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Chandrayaan-1 {{successfully}} completed the <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> operation on 8 November 2008 at 11:21UTC. This manoeuvre involved firing {{of the liquid}} engine for 817seconds (about thirteen and half minutes) when the spacecraft passed within [...] from the Moon. The satellite was placed in an elliptical orbit that passed over the polar regions of the Moon, with [...] aposelene and [...] periselene. The orbital period {{was estimated to be}} around 11 hours. With the successful completion of this operation, India became the sixth nation to put a vehicle in lunar orbit.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet space program's {{counterpart}} to the Saturn V was Sergei Korolev's N1-L3. The Saturn V was taller, heavier, and had greater payload capacity, both to low Earth orbit and to translunar injection. The N-1 was a three-stage launch vehicle with more liftoff thrust {{and a larger}} first stage diameter than the Saturn V. It was to carry the [...] L3 vehicle into orbit. The L3 contained an Earth departure stage, which would send to the Moon a [...] package which contained another stage for <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>insertion</b> and powered descent initiation, a single-cosmonaut lander, and a two-cosmonaut lunar orbiter for the return to Earth. The N1/L3 would have produced more total impulse (product of thrust and time) in its first four stages than the three-stage Saturn V, {{but it was not}} able to convert as much of this into payload momentum (product of mass and velocity).|$|E
50|$|<b>Lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> {{rendezvous}} (LOR) {{is a key}} {{concept for}} efficiently landing humans on the Moon and returning them to Earth. It was utilized for the Project Apollo missions in the 1960s and 1970s. In a LOR mission, a main spacecraft and a smaller lunar lander travel to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> The <b>lunar</b> lander then independently descends {{to the surface of}} the Moon, while the main spacecraft remains in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> After completion of the mission there, the lander returns to <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> to rendezvous and re-dock with the main spacecraft, then is discarded after transfer of crew and payload. Only the main spacecraft returns to Earth.|$|R
50|$|The LM {{frequency}} pair {{was also}} used by the subsatellites left in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> by the later J-missions. They were deployed by the CSM shortly before leaving <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit</b> and after the LM had completed its mission.|$|R
50|$|The {{design was}} based on the <b>Lunar</b> <b>Orbit</b> Rendezvous approach: two docked {{spacecraft}} were sent to the Moon and went into <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit.</b> While the LM separated and landed, the CSM remained in <b>orbit.</b> After the <b>lunar</b> excursion, the two craft rendezvoused and docked in <b>lunar</b> <b>orbit,</b> and the CSM returned the crew to Earth. The Command Module was {{the only part of the}} space vehicle that returned with the crew to the Earth's surface.|$|R
