This significantly improved the <b>Lightning's</b> rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive <b>Lightnings,</b> and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of <b>Lightnings</b> each month.|$|R

The first Kuwait aircraft, a T.55K first flew on 24 May 1968 and deliveries to Kuwait started in December 1968. The Kuwaitis somewhat overestimated {{their ability to}} maintain such a complex aircraft, not adopting the extensive support from BAC and Airwork Services that the Saudis used to keep their <b>Lightnings</b> operational, so serviceability was poor. The Kuwaiti <b>Lightnings</b> {{did not have a}} long service career; after unsuccessfully trying to sell them to Egypt in 1973, Kuwait replaced its last <b>Lightnings</b> with Dassault Mirage F1s in 1977. The remaining aircraft were stored at Kuwait International Airport, many were subsequently destroyed during the Invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990.|$|R

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} game, enemies appear in the open field and can be avoided or engaged. The number of enemies increases during night-time, and their strength and ability to deal damage increases the more days pass in-game. By killing all the standard versions of an enemy, a final version appears as a boss. Defeating it will yield a high reward and make the enemy type extinct {{in an area of}} the game. When <b>Lightning</b> attacks an enemy, or they attack her, the battle starts. If <b>Lightning</b> strikes a monster, they lose a small portion of health, while if the enemy strikes <b>Lightning</b> first, she will lose health. As <b>Lightning</b> performs attacks, her ATB meter is drained and she must switch to another assigned garb: the depleted garb's meter recharges while not being used. <b>Lightning</b> utilizes her many swords for short-range melee attacks and magic for long-range attacks. She can block enemy attacks using her shield and has the option to evade an attack, which can be assigned to any garb. Each enemy has a stagger meter, represented by a line behind their health bar. As <b>Lightning</b> lands certain kinds of magical or physical blows on the enemy, their meter oscillates more. Eventually, the enemy is staggered, rendering them vulnerable to damaging attacks. <b>Lightning</b> can also spend Energy Points to perform special moves or activate abilities, such as Overclock (which slows time for Lightning's opponents and enables her to land more hits); and Army of One, Lightning's signature move. By winning battles, <b>Lightning</b> earns gil, the in-game currency, and replenishes a portion of her Energy Point gauge. In Normal and Hard modes, if <b>Lightning</b> flees from or dies in battle, one in-game hour is lost. Unlike the last two games, the player character does not automatically recover HP after battles, instead needing to use remedies bought from merchants and shops, and there is no auto-battle mode, with <b>Lightning</b> needing to be controlled manually at all times. In Easy Mode, <b>Lightning</b> regenerates health if she stands idle.|$|E

5|$|In , <b>Lightning</b> is revived after 500 {{years by}} the god Bhunivelze. The world is set to end in {{thirteen}} days, and <b>Lightning</b> is chosen as the Savior, a spiritual guide for humanity, which has ceased to age due {{to the influence of}} chaos. In return for Lightning's help, Serah will be resurrected. Aided by Hope, <b>Lightning</b> frees her former allies of emotional burdens, reunites with Odin {{in the form of a}} white Chocobo, and frequently crosses paths with Lumina, the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. <b>Lightning</b> begins to doubt her humanity, and, when she learns that Bhunivelze stole Serah's soul and manipulated Lightning's memories, she plans to betray him after he has finished building the new world. When the end of the world arrives, <b>Lightning</b> fights Bhunivelze, who wants to transform humanity into his ideal image and has been shaping <b>Lightning</b> as Etro's replacement. Although she is prepared to fulfill her new role and abandon her human life, <b>Lightning</b> instead chooses to call for help and to accept Lumina as a part of herself. Everyone she has saved, including Serah, unites with her and defeats Bhunivelze. <b>Lightning</b> then witnesses the creation of a new universe, into which she goes with her allies and the souls of humanity. In the epilogue, she is seen traveling to reunite with one of her friends.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII, <b>Lightning</b> reaches Anima {{along with}} Hope, Sazh Katzroy, and Oerba Dia Vanille, {{three of the}} {{surviving}} Purge exiles. When they find Serah, she turns to crystal. <b>Lightning</b> and the party fight Anima and are marked as l'Cie when PSICOM, Cocoon's main military force, destroys Anima. Skeptical of Snow's resolve to save her sister, <b>Lightning</b> abandons him and Serah, {{both of whom are}} then rescued by Oerba Yun Fang and a rogue Cocoon military force called the Cavalry. <b>Lightning</b> ends up traveling with Hope. During their time together, <b>Lightning</b> inadvertently summons Odin, and she unknowingly supports Hope's plan to assassinate Snow by protecting and training him. Throughout the game, <b>Lightning</b> struggles to deal with her nature as a l'Cie, her anger at being made Cocoon's enemy, and her guilt at disbelieving Serah's story. After overcoming these issues, she acknowledges Snow's relationship with Serah and his faith that they will restore her. When they kill the Sanctum fal'Cie Orphan to save Cocoon, <b>Lightning,</b> Serah and the party except for Vanille and Fang are allowed to return to their normal lives: Vanille and Fang form a crystal pillar to stop Cocoon from colliding with Gran Pulse.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Serah is {{the only}} one who remembers <b>Lightning</b> being on Gran Pulse after she is taken to Valhalla, with all the others believing she sacrificed herself to save Cocoon. She {{eventually}} becomes a teacher in the village of New Bodhum, the town she and Snow help build on Gran Pulse, before it is invaded by monsters three years after the fall of Cocoon. Serah is aided by Noel Kreiss, who tells her of Lightning's fate and his own mission. After Serah accepts Noel's offer to be brought to <b>Lightning,</b> the two embark on a journey across time to find her sister. In the process, Serah encounters Caius Ballad, while learning from Paddra Nsu-Yeul that she possesses the same detrimental ability as her to see the future. Despite learning that she would die herself if she continues seeing visions of the future, Serah resolves to change the future for everyone's sake. However, after Caius's defeat and returning to Gran Pulse five hundred years in her future, Serah has another vision and dies moments before Gran Pulse is infected by Valhalla's chaos. Serah appears to <b>Lightning</b> in Valhalla as a spirit, telling her she knew that she could have died from her visions but still took the risk regardless. Serah promises <b>Lightning</b> that they will see each other again as long as <b>Lightning</b> promises to remember her. In <b>Lightning</b> Returns, Serah's soul, which has been kept safe within <b>Lightning,</b> is removed and cast away by Bhunivelze. Lumina acts as a shelter for Serah's soul, resulting in the two being similar in appearance. Bhunivelze also creates a false version of Serah to keep <b>Lightning</b> in line. This false Serah, who develops feelings for her 'sister' arrives when <b>Lightning</b> intends to become the protector of the new world and persuades her to accept her vulnerabilities and call for aid. The real Serah reunites with <b>Lightning</b> and her allies, and travels with them to the new world.|$|E

5|$|In <b>Lightning</b> Returns, Hope {{resides in}} a special base {{constructed}} within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with <b>Lightning</b> via a wireless com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from the past two games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as <b>Lightning</b> completes quests and fulfills missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's eyes and ears, and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with <b>Lightning</b> and capturing her allies. During the final battle <b>Lightning</b> frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good.|$|E
