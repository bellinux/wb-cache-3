40|$|A new <b>LD</b> (<b>Laser</b> <b>Diode)</b> was {{developed}} to 	specifically excite protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a 	photochemotherapeutic agent that is selectively produced in 	human tumor tissues following administration of 5 - 	aminolevulinic acid (5 -ALA), {{as well as its}} photoproduct. 	PpIX emits red fluorescence if it is exposed by the blue light 	(410 nm) of the laser. During fluorescent diagnosis, the 2 	wavelengths of red excitation (635 and 665 nm) from the <b>LD</b> 	<b>laser</b> were both exposed to the tumor at the same time. Both 	wavelengths were effectively absorbance matched for the 	PpIX and the photoproduct produced during irradiation. 	There is an overlap in the spectral characteristics of the PpIX 	absorbance and emission. Both processes occur at 635 nm. 	As such, a continuous wave laser cannot excite PpIX and 	monitor its emission simultaneously. We therefore 	developed a pulsed CW laser that could time gate between the 	blue and red lights, enabling us to both excite and monitor the 	PpIX at the same time. In future, this laser will be used in a 	risk assessment protocol for the treatment of elderly patients 	and to also assess the relative cost this treatment in 	comparison with other cancer treatments...|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} goal of {{the project}} was the investigation of the basic principles of a broadly tunable <b>laser</b> <b>diode</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with a narrow linewidth, enabling an effective and simple gas analysis in process gas monitoring and environmental technique. The design of the spectrometer occurs on the basis of commercially available anti-reflection coated VIS- and NIR-laser diodes operating in external resonators. Particularly with the realized different grating resonators, the results of our theoretical investigation concerning mode hop free tuning ranges could be verified. By using these optimized configurations mode hop free tuning ranges across the whole gain region of the <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> could be realized. Furthermore, the properties of a spectrometer with a high output power was determined. In order to qualify the spectrometer, absorption measurements of selected gases has been performed. In addition, the basic principles of anti-reflection coatings for <b>laser</b> <b>diodes</b> were investigated. By using a special simulation code, an optimization of the coating parameters could be achieved. By this means, high quality coatings with different materials could be realized. (orig.)

Flight parameters were optimized to closely match an ENVISAT overpass. Like all other instruments of TRIPLE, the CHILD spectrometer suffered mechanical damage during the landing, when the gondola hit an electricity pole (concrete) and then was torn across a crop field by its parachutes due to relatively strong ground winds. 1.

However, the 2 ppmv increase of stratospheric water since the 1950 s can only partly be explained by the increase of tropospheric methane (0. 55 ppmv) during the same period.
