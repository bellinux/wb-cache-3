5|$|Most records {{received}} by the committee are processed within a year and published in its annual report in British Birds. Some records prove problematic, and for some species, it has taken the committee {{many years to come}} to a decision. This has particularly been the case where the species or subspecies in question was new to Britain—examples include northern harrier (Britain's first, in Scilly in 1982, accepted in 2007), long-toed stint (Britain's first, in Cornwall in 1970, accepted in 1994), least tern (Britain's first, and to date only record, accepted in 2005, after first occurring in 1983), black lark (Britain's first, from Spurn, Yorkshire in 1984, accepted in 2004 after a second set of notes came to light), Sykes's warbler (the first three records, from 1959, 1977, and 1993, accepted in 2003), Iberian chiffchaff (the first two records, from 1972 and 1992, accepted in 2000), and Hume's leaf warbler (the first 27 records, the earliest from 1966, accepted in 1998). Occasionally, decisions have been delayed due to non-ornithological factors, perhaps most notably with the loss by the Royal Mail of a file on Britain's first <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> was {{originally}} described {{as belonging to}} the genus Alauda. The genus name Alaudala is a diminutive of Alauda, and the specific rufescens is Latin for [...] "reddish", from rufus [...] "red".Alternate names for the <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> include the common short-toed lark, grey lark, rufous short-toed lark and short-toed lark. Formerly or presently, some authorities considered the Athi short-toed lark, Asian short-toed lark and/or the Somali short-toed lark to be subspecies of the <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|E

5000|$|All {{but some}} southernmost populations are migratory, {{wintering}} {{south to the}} southern edge of the Sahara and India. This species is a fairly common wanderer to northern and western Europe in spring and autumn. Populations breeding in the Iberian Peninsula winter south of the Sahara in Africa. Here they prefer crop land and dry pastures with short shrubs while the syntopic <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>larks</b> (Calandrella rufescens) prefer drier areas.|$|R
50|$|Established as {{an ideal}} site for the {{protection}} of the bustard in the 1980s, conservation efforts at Rollapadu have suffered severe setbacks in recent years with the bustard population falling in recent years. The sanctuary houses nearly 800 blackbucks which often raid the farmlands beyond the sanctuary’s borders and this has led to public anger against the sanctuary. Grazing of cattle within the sanctuary’s precincts has also affected the breeding of the bustards. Changes in the ecosystem due to the linking of the Alganur tank with the Telugu Ganga Canal and the consequent rise in ground water levels in this semi-arid region have led to changes in flora as well as in the nature of agriculture practiced around the sanctuary’s periphery. Harriers have been found dead presumably due to the effect of biomagnification. Foxes, the <b>lesser</b> florican and <b>short-toed</b> <b>larks</b> have not been spotted at the sanctuary in recent years.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> (Alaudala rufescens) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{found in}} southern Eurasia and northern Africa. It is a common bird with a very wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern". Confusingly, Hume's short-toed lark is also sometimes called the <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|E

50|$|The greater <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. The alternate name <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> may {{also be used for}} three other species in the genus Calandrella.

50|$|The Mongolian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. It was then considered as a subspecies of the morphologically similar greater <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark,</b> but recent analyses of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA showed {{that it was more}} closely related to Hume's <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b> It was split in 2016 by the IOC, although not all other authorities have recognized this re-classification to date. Additionally, some authorities considered the Mongolian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> to be a subspecies of the red-capped lark. The name 'Mongolian short-toed lark' is also used as an alternate name for the Asian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b> The alternate name <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> may also be used for three other species in the genus Calandrella.|$|R
5000|$|The {{red-capped lark}} was {{originally}} {{placed in the}} genus Alauda. Alternate names for the red-capped <b>lark</b> include rufous <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> and <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark,</b> although the former may also describe the Somali <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> and the latter is also used as an alternate name for three other species in the genus Calandrella. Formerly, some authorities considered both the Mongolian <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> (as C. c. dukhunensis) and Erlanger's lark (as C. c. erlangeri or C. c. ruficeps) to be subspecies of the red-capped lark [...] Additionally, some authorities considered the red-capped lark itself to be ether conspecific with or as a subspecies of the greater <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>lesser</b> <b>short-toed</b> <b>lark</b> breeds in Spain, north Africa, also {{including}} Turkey eastwards {{across the}} semi-deserts of central Asia to Mongolia and China.
