5|$|After the fiasco of Bannockburn, the earls of <b>Lancaster</b> and Warwick {{saw their}} {{political}} influence increase, and they pressured Edward to re-implement the Ordinances of 1311. <b>Lancaster</b> became {{the head of}} the royal council in 1316, promising to take forward the Ordinances through a new reform commission, but he appears to have abandoned this role soon afterwards, partially because of disagreements with the other barons, and possibly because of ill-health. <b>Lancaster</b> refused to meet with Edward in parliament for the next two years, bringing effective governance to a standstill. This stymied any hopes for a fresh campaign into Scotland and raised fears of civil war. After much negotiation, once again involving the Earl of Pembroke, Edward and <b>Lancaster</b> finally agreed to the Treaty of Leake in August 1318, which pardoned <b>Lancaster</b> and his faction and established a new royal council, temporarily averting conflict.|$|E
5|$|Both Mary and Philip were {{descended from}} {{legitimate}} children of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of <b>Lancaster,</b> {{by his first}} two wives, a relationship which was used to portray Philip as an English king. Mary descended from the Duke of <b>Lancaster</b> by all three of his wives, Blanche of <b>Lancaster,</b> Constance of Castile, and Katherine Swynford.|$|E
5|$|Edmund Crouchback {{passed on}} the castle to his eldest son, Thomas, Earl of <b>Lancaster,</b> in 1298. <b>Lancaster</b> married Alice de Lacy, which made him the richest nobleman in England. Kenilworth became the primary castle of the <b>Lancaster</b> estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. <b>Lancaster,</b> with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and <b>Lancaster</b> was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and executed. His estates, including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown. Edward and his wife, Isabella of France, spent Christmas 1323 at Kenilworth, amidst major celebrations.|$|E

5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. <b>Lancaster</b> convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his hand against the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while <b>Lancaster</b> remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, <b>Lancaster</b> was forced to flee north. On 16 March <b>Lancaster</b> and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E
5|$|In 1345, while Grosmont was in France, {{his father}} died. The younger Henry was now Earl of <b>Lancaster</b> – the wealthiest and most {{powerful}} peer of the realm. After participating in the Siege of Calais in 1347, the king honoured <b>Lancaster</b> by including him as a founding knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348. A few years later, in 1351, Edward bestowed an even greater honour on <b>Lancaster</b> when he created him Duke of <b>Lancaster.</b> The title of duke was of relatively new origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously.|$|E
5|$|In December, Edward led {{his army}} across the River Severn and {{advanced}} into the Welsh Marches, where the opposition forces had gathered. The coalition of Marcher Lords crumbled and the Mortimers {{surrendered to the}} King, but Damory, Audley and the Earl of Hereford marched north in January to join <b>Lancaster,</b> who had laid siege the King's castle at Tickhill. Bolstered by fresh reinforcements from the Marcher Lords, Edward pursued them, meeting Lancaster's army on 10 March at Burton-on-Trent. <b>Lancaster,</b> outnumbered, retreated without a fight, fleeing north. Andrew Harclay cornered <b>Lancaster</b> at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and captured the Earl. Edward and Hugh the Younger met <b>Lancaster</b> at Pontefract, where, after a summary trial, the earl {{was found guilty of}} treason and beheaded.|$|E

5|$|<b>Lancaster</b> {{was married}} to Isabella, {{daughter}} of Henry, Lord Beaumont, in 1330. The two had no sons, but two daughters: Maud and Blanche. While Maud {{was married to}} William I, Duke of Bavaria, Blanche married Edward III's son John of Gaunt. Gaunt ended up inheriting Lancaster's possessions and ducal title, {{but it was not}} until 1377, when the dying King Edward III was largely incapacitated, that he was able to restore the palatinate rights for the county of <b>Lancaster.</b> When Gaunt's son Henry of Bolingbroke usurped the crown in 1399 and became Henry IV, the vast <b>Lancaster</b> inheritance, including the Lordship of Bowland, was merged with the crown as the Duchy of <b>Lancaster.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although ostracised {{because of}} the murder of Gaveston, Thomas of <b>Lancaster</b> had regained virtual control of royal {{government}} in the period after England's defeat at Bannockburn. Proving himself as incapable to rule as Edward, however, he soon grew unpopular. Pembroke was one of the magnates who in the years 1316-18 tried to prevent civil war from breaking out between the supporters of Edward and those of <b>Lancaster,</b> and he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake in 1318, restoring Edward to power. Peace did not last long, however, as the King by now had taken on Hugh Despenser the younger as another favourite, in much the same position as Gaveston. Pembroke's attempts at reconciliation eventually failed, and civil war broke out in 1321. In 1322 <b>Lancaster</b> was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and executed. Pembroke was among the Earls behind the conviction. Also in 1322, Pembroke founded a leper hospital in Gravesend.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and <b>Lancaster</b> had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove <b>Lancaster</b> and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while <b>Lancaster</b> and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
