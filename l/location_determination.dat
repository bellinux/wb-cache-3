2500|$|USA - Unconventional Stellar Aspect (1990-22/NRL) - Sponsored by Naval Research Lab, Space Science Division, the USA {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} observe bright x-ray sources, mostly binary star systems, including a black hole, a neutron star, or a white dwarf, orbiting with a more typical star. In neutron stars, gravity has compressed matter down to densities larger than {{those found in the}} nucleus of an atom. In all of these types of binary systems, extraordinarily strong, relativistic gravitational forces and enormous magnetic fields act in concert to produce dramatic phenomena not observable from Earth-based laboratories. [...] In addition to providing valuable new information for astrophysicists and particle physicists, USA has been designed to make significant contributions to applied science, environmental science, and engineering research. It will use x-ray sources to test new approaches to satellite navigation and to conduct the first tomographic survey of Earth's atmosphere. It will also test new concepts for making spacecraft computers more reliable, an approach called fault-tolerant computing. [...] Finally, a unique feature of USA is that photon events are time tagged by reference to an onboard GPS receiver allowing precise absolute time and <b>location</b> <b>determination.</b> [...] USA operated from May 1, 1999, through November 16, 2000.|$|E

40|$|At present, Sri Lanka is investheavily on the {{development}} of the country’s infrastructure., facilitating the vast demand for construction materials particularly, aggregate metals. Blast fragmentation is one of the most important aspects in open pit blasting. Blasted rock should be easily loaded and transported and the rock fragments should be adequately pre-conditioned (i. e. weakened) in order to reduce the energy requirements in down-stream processes such as, crushing and grinding. In Sri Lanka, the geological parameters of rocks vary throughout the island. Currently, there is a large number of metal quarries and mining activities operating all over the country, but the lack of optimum blasting practice and specific charge selection is a drawback to achieve the optimum benefits. In this research, an investigation on specific charge values have been carried out for the required level of fragmentation in quarrying industry and tunneling practice throughout Sri Lanka depending on geological parameters varying from region to region.

40|$|A new {{shear wave}} {{velocity}} model offshore Southern California is presented that images plate boundary deformation including both thickening and thinning of the crustal and mantle lithosphere at the westernmost edge of the North American continent. The Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the California Offshore Region Experiment (ALBACORE) ocean bottom seismometer array, together with 65 stations of the onshore Southern California Seismic Network, is used to measure ambient noise correlation functions and Rayleigh wave dispersion curves which are inverted for 3 -D shear wave velocities. The resulting velocity model defines the transition from continental lithosphere to oceanic, illuminating the complex history and deformation in the region. A transition to the present-day strike-slip regime between the Pacific and North American Plates resulted in broad deformation and capture of the now > 200 [*]km wide continental shelf. Our velocity model suggests {{the persistence of the}} uppermost mantle volcanic processes associated with East Pacific Rise spreading adjacent to the Patton Escarpment, which marks the former subduction of Farallon Plate underneath North America. The most prominent of these seismic structures is a low-velocity anomaly underlying the San Juan Seamount, suggesting ponding of magma {{at the base of the}} crust, resulting in thickening and ongoing adjustment of the lithosphere due to the localized loading. The velocity model also provides a robust framework for future earthquake <b>location</b> <b>determinations</b> and ground-shaking simulations for risk estimates...|$|R

40|$|Explosive {{volcanic}} eruptions emit large proportions of very fine ash (3 ̆c 30 μm) into the atmosphere, posing hazards to aviation, infrastructure, and human health. Here we present {{an analysis of}} bubble size distributions {{at the point of}} fragmentation during the 18 May 1980 eruption of MSH through the examination of simple ash particles in distally deposited fall samples. The external surfaces of individual fine ash grains preserve the morphology of the bubbles that burst to form the ash, so bubble sizes can be measured using stereo-scanning electron microscopy. Simple ash particles are those that allow the measurement of a single vesicle imprint per individual grain. These simple ash particles are the finest component of the tephra, and can thus travel great distances from the source volcano. Analyses of samples provided bubble volume distributions with a dominant peak between 560 and 5600 μm 3, corresponding to equivalent vesicle diameter modes of 10 – 22 μm, and these values were consistent for all examined sample <b>locations.</b> <b>Determination</b> of syn-eruptive bubble sizes thus makes it possible to glean information regarding conduit dynamics at the point of magma fragmentation from observed ash deposits, to parameterize numerical eruption models in ways not previously possible, and to quantify the size of bubbles that burst to create the ash component most hazardous to the aviation industry and human health...|$|R

40|$|Surgical and transcatheter {{ablation}} of accessory atrioventricular (AV) connections (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome) requires accurate localization of {{the accessory}} pathway. In a canine model of endocardial pacing, a continuous loop two-dimensional echocardiographic technique {{was developed for}} determining the earliest site of ventricular activation. This technique was then used to localize accessory AV connections in patients. Echocardiographic images were acquired on videotape and converted to a digital continuous loop format, from which the earliest site of systolic motion was determined. In six dogs, using six distinct endocardial sites, two blinded observers accurately identified the earliest site of ventricular activation in 31 (86 %) of 36 and 32 (89 %) of 36 <b>locations.</b> <b>Determination</b> of the earliest site of ventricular activation with the continuous loop digital technique was superior to standard analog analysis in overall accuracy (p < 0. 02) and in intraobserver variability (p < 0. 004). After validation of this technique, 21 patients with 22 accessory AV connections with anterograde conduction were studied. The earliest site of mechanical activity was determined during sinus (10 patients) or atrial paced (11 patients) rhythms by two blinded observers and compared with electrophysiologic mapping and surface electrocardiograms. Digitally processed echocardiograms correctly localized the earliest site of ventricular activation in 18 of 22 connections and predicted an adjacent location in the remaining 4. It is concluded that digitally processed continuous loop echocardiographic analysis accurately localizes the site of origin of ventricular activation in patients with ventricular pre-excitation associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome...|$|R

40|$|The Unified Radio and Plasma Wave (URAP) {{experiment}} on Ulysses has provided unique high latitude measurements of Jovian hectometric radiation (HOM) during its encounter with Jupiter in February 1992. URAP {{was the first}} radio instrument in the Jovian environment with radio direction-finding capability, which was previously {{used to determine the}} HOM source locations in the Jovian magnetosphere. These initial source <b>location</b> <b>determinations</b> were based on several assumptions, including the neglect of refractive effects, which may be tested. We have, for the first time, combined the measured incident ray-direction at the spacecraft with a model magnetosphere to directly trace the rays back to the HOM source. We concentrate on the observations of HOM from high northern latitudes when Ulysses was at distances less than 15 R(sub j). The three- dimensional ray-tracing calculations presented here indicate that the HOM sources probably lie on L shells in the range 3 less than or approximately equal to L less than 7 (tilted dipole magnetic field model) consistent with previous determinations that ignored the effects of refraction. The ray-tracing results, however, indicate that wave refraction due to the Io torus and the magnetic field can significantly influence the precise source location. We show that constraints on the locations imposed by the gyroemission mechanism suggest that the lo torus density may have experienced temporal and/or spatial fluctuations during the Ulysses observations of HOM. Finally, in the cold plasma approximation we demonstrate that even if the emission were nearly linearly polarized near the source region, almost circular polarization will be observed at Ulysses, in agreement with observations...|$|R
