40|$|Background: Although most orbital <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors</b> are {{characterized}} by a slow, painless onset and a mass that molds to orbital structures, different presentations may occur. Intensity on T 2 -weighted MRI is a possible means for differentiating <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors</b> (hyperintense) from pseudotumors (hypointense). In addition, it is generally assumed that 75 % of orbital lymphomas are at stage I on presentation. Methods: The clinical, CT, and MRI presentation of 95 primary and secondary orbital <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors</b> (63 non-Hodgkin lymphomas and 32 lymphoid hyperplasias) and their histological grade and staging were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry and PCR {{were used to determine}} clonality. Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} non-Hodgkin lymphomas and lymphoid hyperplasias, except for the mean age of the patients (6. 3 years older in non-Hodgkin lymphomas). In both groups the most common presentation was a mass with an indolent course; visual impairment was seen in 13 %, conjunctival redness in 25 %, pain in 12 %, and acute orbital inflammation in 15 % of the patients. In most cases, the CT showed one or more lobulated or rounded masses, molding to adjacent structures, or a wedge-shaped enlargement of the lacrimal gland. Intramuscular lymphomas were rare and always associated with extramuscular masses. On T 2 -weighted MRI, only 35 % of <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors</b> were hyperintense. Only 49 % of lymphomas were at stage I on presentation.

40|$|Genetic {{mutations}} of oncogenes often underlie deranged cell {{growth and}} altered differentiation pathways leading to malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes. However, addiction to oncogenes {{is not the}} only drive to <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumor</b> pathogenesis. Dependence on non-oncogenes, which act by propelling basic mechanisms of cell proliferation and survival, has also been recognized in the pathobiology of lymphoid leukemias, lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Among the growing number of molecules that may uphold non-oncogene addiction, a key place is increasingly being recognized to the serine-threonine kinase CK 2. This enzyme is overexpressed and overactive in B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, such as mantle cell, follicular, Burkitt's and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In these tumors, CK 2 may serve the activity of oncogenes, similar to BCR-ABL and c-MYC, control the activation of critical signaling cascades, such as NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB), STAT 3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and PTEN/PI 3 K/AKT (phosphatase and tensin homolog protein/phosphoinositide 3 -kinase/AKR thymoma), and sustain multiple cellular stress-elicited pathways, such as the proteotoxic stress, unfolded protein and DNA-damage responses. CK 2 has also been shown to have an essential role in tuning signals derived from the stromal tumor microenvironment. Not surprisingly, targeting CK 2 in <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumor</b> cell lines or mouse xenograft models can boost the cytotoxic effects of both conventional chemotherapeutics and novel agents, similar to heat-shock protein 90, proteasome and tyrosine kinases inhibitors.

40|$|In {{comparison}} with our earlier colleagues {{quoted in the}} introduction, we have made substantial progress in understanding the biology of ocular adnexal <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> While we have refined various categories with prognostic clinical value regarding possible associated systemic disease, none is foolproof and all have varying degrees of unpredictability. Comparatively well-differentiated histologic subtypes predominate among ocular adnexal <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors.</b> Polyclonal lesions occur less than half as often as monoclonal B-cell lesions. Molecular genetic studies have revealed small clones of monoclonal populations among the B-cells comprising most of the immunophenotypically polyclonal lesions, but no clonal genetic rearrangements have been uncovered within the preponderant constituent T-cell populations. The overall prognosis for ocular adnexal <b>lymphoid</b> <b>tumors</b> is excellent; when lumped together, 67 % are {{not found to be}} associated with systemic disease with mean follow-ups of over 4 years. This is similar to experience with extranodal and extralymphatic lesions in other sites of the body, which also frequently have a small lymphocyte composition. The incidence of nonocular disease in all categories of our studies, however, will probably increase with the acquisition of longer follow-ups. Careful histopathologic evaluation is as good as immunophenotypic analysis of these lesions in predicting clinical outcome in terms of associated nonocular disease. Polyclonal and well-differentiated B-cell monoclonal lesions displayed equivalent clinical behavior. Benign polyclonal lesions may be associated with systemic disease but in a minority of cases (27 %), as has also been determined in earlier studies. Clinical staging {{is the single most important}} predictor of associated monocular disease. In this study, patients with stage I-E disease had an 87 % chance of not developing any nonocular lymphomatous lesion. We believe that this figure may also somewhat decrease with the passage of time. Precise anatomic localization of the lesion within the adnexa had considerable predictive value. Lesions of the conjunctiva fared the best; those of the orbit had an intermediate prognosis; while lid lesions had the worst prognosis. The most favorable prognosis would be held by a conjunctival lymphoid lesion in stage I-E composed of small lymphocytes. The fact that there is a fairly close equivalence in outcome between polyclonal and monoclonal well-differentiated lesions indicates that these lesions are in the vast majority of cases primary hyperplasias or primary lymphomas. The discovery by genetic probes of small monoclonal populations in immunophenotypically polyclonal lesions suggests that there is an evolution that goes on in situ.
