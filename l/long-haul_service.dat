2500|$|High-speed rail {{are special}} inter-city trains that operate at much higher speeds than {{conventional}} railways, the limit being regarded at [...] High-speed trains are used mostly for <b>long-haul</b> <b>service</b> and most systems are in Western Europe and East Asia. The speed record is , set by a modified French TGV. Magnetic levitation trains {{such as the}} Shanghai airport train use under-riding magnets which attract themselves upward towards the underside of a guideway and this line has achieved somewhat higher peak speeds in day-to-day operation than conventional high-speed railways, although only over short distances. Due to their heightened speeds, route alignments for high-speed rail tend to have shallower grades and broader curves than conventional railways.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 October 2005, Aer Lingus {{announced}} its first scheduled service to Asia from March 2006 as Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, where Chief Executive Dermot Mannion was based when at Emirates. [...] Despite the Aer Lingus press release describing {{it as the}} first <b>long-haul</b> <b>service</b> outside the United States, there had in fact been a previous service to Montreal from 1966 to 1979. The great circle distance of [...] {{is comparable to the}} service to Chicago. At the same time Mannion linked the funding of new long-haul aircraft to replace the A330 fleet with the privatisation of the airline. The Dubai service ceased in March 2008 as the airline sought to increase its market share in the newly liberalised transatlantic market.|$|E

2500|$|After {{deregulation}} of the U.S. airline industry in 1978, Southwest Airlines was able to enter the larger passenger markets and announced plans to start providing interstate service in 1979. This angered the City of Fort Worth and DFW International Airport, which resented expanded air service at Love Field. Therefore, Fort Worth-based U.S. Representative (later Speaker of the House) Jim Wright helped get a [...] "compromise" [...] law through Congress that restricted air service at Love Field. Using the pretext of protecting DFW, the Wright Amendment restricted passenger air traffic out of Love Field in the following ways: Passenger service on regular mid-sized and large aircraft could only be provided from Love Field to locations within Texas and four neighboring states (Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico). <b>Long-haul</b> <b>service</b> to other states was possible, but only on commuter aircraft with no more capacity than 56 passengers.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of the {{amendment}} asserted that the restrictions on long-haul travel from Dallas Love Field were anti-competitive. [...] They asked for the [...] "freedom to fly" [...] from Love Field to any destination. [...] They also argued that the restrictions on full use of Love Field artificially inflated fares at the DFW Airport. They believed that eliminating {{the amendment}}, and thus allowing any airline to fly <b>long-haul</b> <b>service</b> out of DAL, would allow the so-called [...] "Southwest effect" [...] to occur, where new, inexpensive capacity will increase traffic at both airports (assuming that the market effect of low fares on flights {{into and out of}} Love Field will serve to drive down fares on corresponding routes at DFW); these projections are based upon historic results in other air travel markets in which low-fare carriers, most frequently, Southwest, have initiated service. [...] Wright opponents also argued that DFW's main tenant, American Airlines, could charge high prices out of DFW because, with AA controlling in excess of 80% of air carrier traffic at DFW, there is little competition on most routes, a problem that has recently been attributed to Delta Air Lines discontinuing its usage of DFW as a hub.|$|E
