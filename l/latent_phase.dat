25|$|Cutaneous {{radiation}} syndrome (CRS) {{refers to the}} skin symptoms of radiation exposure. Within {{a few hours after}} irradiation, a transient and inconsistent redness (associated with itching) can occur. Then, a <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, blistering, and ulceration of the irradiated site are visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis (mostly Keloids), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or necrosis of the exposed tissue. Notably, as seen at Chernobyl, when skin is irradiated with high energy beta particles, moist desquamation (peeling of skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin. This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in Oxford.|$|E

40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has {{provided}} the prototype for viral latency with previously well-defined acute or lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases.</b> More recently, the deep quiescence of HSV latency has been questioned with evidence that lytic genes can be transcribed in this state. However, to date the only evidence that these transcripts might be translated has come from immunological studies that show activated T cells persist in the nervous system during latency. Here we use a highly sensitive Cre-marking model to show that lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> are less clearly defined in two significant ways. First, around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection and second, we show direct evidence that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency...|$|R

25|$|Fasciolosis (also {{known as}} fascioliasis, fasciolasis, {{distomatosis}} and liver rot) is a parasitic worm infection {{caused by the}} common liver fluke Fasciola hepatica {{as well as by}} Fasciola gigantica. The disease is a plant-borne trematode zoonosis, and is classified as a neglected tropical disease (NTD). It affects humans, but its main host is ruminants such as cattle and sheep. The disease progresses through four distinct phases; an initial incubation phase of between a few days up to three months with little or no symptoms; an invasive or acute phase which may manifest with: fever, malaise, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, anemia, jaundice, and respiratory symptoms. The disease later progresses to a <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> with less symptoms and ultimately into a chronic or obstructive phase months to years later. In the chronic state the disease causes inflammation of the bile ducts, gall bladder and may cause gall stones as well as fibrosis. While chronic inflammation is connected to increased cancer rates, it is unclear whether fasciolosis is associated with increased cancer risk.|$|E
500|$|HIV {{seeks out}} and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection. [...] A {{vigorous}} immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically <b>latent</b> <b>phase.</b> CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected. Continuous HIV replication causes {{a state of}} generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase. Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to {{the breakdown of the}} immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.|$|E

40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) {{requires}} long-term treat­ment and follow-up, {{although many}} patients experience life-long remission. The {{aim of this}} cross-sectional postal survey was to describe and investigate the association between illness perception, health complaints, self-reported symptoms and distress in persons with PCT. The participants perceived PCT as a chronic condition {{with high levels of}} personal and treatment control. Persons who reported active symptoms scored higher on perceived illness threat, total health complaints and psychological distress compared with those in remission or <b>latent</b> <b>phases.</b> However, a higher perception of illness threat and the total burden of health complaints were more closely associated with psychological distress than were perceived PCT symptoms activity. This has implications for clinical consultation; dermatologists should be attentive to symptoms activity, but also recognize that patients in remission with a high perceived illness threat and multiple health complaints might be especially vulnerable to psychological distress with regards to PCT.

In contrast, Braxton Hicks contractions, which are contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called [...] "false labour", should be infrequent, irregular, and involve only mild cramping. The signaling mechanisms responsible for uterine coordination are complex. Electrical propagation is the primary mechanism used for signaling up to several centimeters. Over longer distances, however, signaling may involve a mechanical mechanism.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{varicella}} zoster virus (VZV) IE 63 {{protein is}} required for growth of the virus in cell culture and is expressed during both lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> of VZV infection. We have investigated the physical and functional interaction of this protein with the major VZV transactivating protein IE 62. The region of the IE 63 protein required for interaction with the IE 62 protein has been identified and encompasses the N-terminal 142 amino acids. We {{have found that the}} interaction is stable at physiological ionic strength. We have also shown that a portion of the IE 63 and IE 62 proteins colocalize in VZV-infected cells at both 15 and 48 h postinfection. IE 63 was found to have no transcriptional activating or repressing activity {{within the context of a}} minimal VZV glycoprotein promoter. The presence of the IE 63, however, upmodulated the IE 62 transactivation of this promoter. Finally, we show that the IE 63 protein can be coimmunoprecipitated with the cellular RNA polymerase II from infected cell extracts, indicating that it is present in a complex with that enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to develop an antibody-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity assay to discriminate between acute and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> of Toxoplasma gondii infection by using recombinant antigens. One hundred twenty-one serum samples from women who developed IgG antibodies against Toxoplasma during pregnancy were used. The IgG avidities of antibodies directed against epitopes carried by fragments of GRA 3, GRA 7, MIC 3, and SAG 1 antigens were measured by performing parallel enzyme immunoassays. The avidity index for Toxoplasma-specific antibodies against a homogeneous mixture of recombinant GRA 3, GRA 7, MIC 3, and SAG 1 antigens correlated closely with the IgG avidity of antibodies against lysed whole-cell T. gondii antigen. The avidity assay performed with the recombinant MIC 3 antigen highlighted the presence of avidity low-antibodies IgG exclusively in sera collected within 2 months after primary infection. The presence of T. gondii-specific, low-avidity IgG antibodies against recombinant MIC 3 antigen {{can be used to}} determine the point of infection with T. gondii within a 2 -month time frame after infection...|$|R

50|$|Latency is {{maintained}} {{in a variety}} of ways, one of which is the latency-associated transcript, or LAT. This long non-coding RNA accumulates in the <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> and has been found to suppress the lytic genes. It is also possible that the LAT transcript plays a role in determining which neurons become infected and maintain the lytic phase. LAT manages this suppression of the viral genome through miRNAs that block viral transcription factors such as ICP0 and ICP4 that play a very important role in the lytic phase of infection. Another mechanism that is used to maintain the <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> is chromatin remodeling. During the <b>latent</b> <b>phase,</b> researchers have found more methylated chromatin in the lytic genes and less acetylated chromatin, whereas in the LAT region there is less methylation and more acetylation found during latency. This was reversed during the lytic phase, Suggesting that this change of chromatin structure is used to control the and maintain the lytic and latent phases.|$|E
40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA 1 protein plays {{important}} roles in latent infection, including transcriptional activation of EBV latency genes by binding to the family-of-repeats (FR) element. Through a proteomic approach, we previously identified an interaction between EBNA 1 and the histone chaperone nucleophosmin. Here we show that the EBNA 1 -nucleophosmin interac-tion is direct and requires the Gly-Arg-rich sequences that contribute to transactivation. Additionally, nucleophosmin is re-cruited by EBNA 1 to the FR element and is required for EBNA 1 -mediated transcriptional activation. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a gammaherpesvirus that infectsgreater than 95 % the of world’s adult population. The EBV infectious cycle is composed of lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases,</b> each char-acterized by the expression of specific viral genes. Upon primary infection, EBV establishes latency and the viral genome is circu-larized and maintained as nuclear episomes that are assembled into nucleosomes similar to cellular chromatin (1, 2). The EBV EBNA 1 protein plays {{important roles}} in replicating and maintain-ing the EBV episomes, {{as well as in}} transactivating the expression of itself and other EBV latency genes important for cell immortal-ization (reviewed in reference 3).

40|$|The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is {{a member}} of the herpes family of viruses and is very common in humans. EBV is most often {{associated}} with infectious mononucleosis. However, it is estimated that 1 % of tumors including lymphoproliferative, epithelial and mesenchymal are linked to EBV infection. EBV has a tropism for certain epithelial cells, lymphocytes and myocytes. Like other herpesviruses, EBV has both lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> of infection. In the latent form, EBV-encoded genes ensure the survival of the viral genome, allowing it to circumvent the host's immune surveillance by limited expression of viral proteins and carries with it the risk of neoplastic transformation. Cytologists are likely to encounter EBV-associated malignancies in cytology material but unlike other herpesviruses, EBV does not evoke a viral cytopathic effect. The manifestation of EBV-related tumors is also often variable depending upon the patient's immune status. Therefore, knowledge of the patient's EBV status and immune competence (e. g. HIV-infection or transplant-related immunosuppression) combined with the cytomorphology and results of ancillary studies are often all required to make a diagnosis of EBV-associated malignancy. This review discusses the unique cytomorphology and ancillary studies required to diagnose EBV-related neoplasms. © 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel...|$|R

40|$|Human {{herpesvirus}} 8 (HHV- 8) /Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection {{goes through}} lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> that are regulated by viral gene products, but {{very little is}} known about the involvement of host proteins. The replication and transcription activator (RTA) is a viral protein sufficient to initiate lytic replication by activating downstream genes, including the viral early gene open reading frame 57 (ORF 57), which codes for a posttranscriptional activator. In this study, we demonstrate that cellular interferon regu-latory factor 7 (IRF- 7) negatively regulates this process by competing with RTA for binding to the RTA response element in the ORF 57 promoter to down-regulate RTA-induced gene expression. We also show that alpha interferon represses RTA-mediated transactivation and that repression involves IRF- 7. Our study indicates that upon HHV- 8 infection, the host responds by suppression of lytic gene expression through binding of IRF- 7 to the lytic viral gene promoter. These findings suggest that HHV- 8 has developed a novel mechanism to induce but then subvert the innate antiviral response, specifically the interferon-signaling pathway, to regulate RTA activity and ultimately the viral latent/lytic replicative cycle.

40|$|The role of {{antiviral}} antibody {{in controlling}} the acute and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> of herpes implex virus (HSV) infection in sensory ganglia of mice was studied in vitro and in vivo. Organ cultures of ganglia inoculated in vitro with HSV produced infectious virus {{for at least}} 3 weeks. In the presence of antiviral antibody, the titre of virus was markedly reduced, but the infection was not eliminated. Similarly, passive administration f antibody to HSV-infected immunodeficient (ude) mice reduced the virus titre but did not eliminate the acute phase of the ganglionic infection. Suppression of the cell-mediated immune response in latently infected immunocompetent mice by treatment with cyclophosphamide and/or X-irradiation resulted in reactivation of HSV in up to 7 o % of the animals. Reactivation was demonstrated by recovering infectious virus in cell-free homogenates of ganglia and eye globes and by finding virus antigens in ganglia by immunofluorescent staining. Reactivation occurred both in vitro and in vivo {{in the presence of}} high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.

50|$|One {{mechanism}} for this control {{is that the}} miRNAs down regulate the lytic activator protein known as Rta or orf50. This down regulation is accomplished through {{increasing the amount of}} methyltransferases and CpG methylation. The main miRNA responsible for this is miR-K12-5 which interacts with orf50 through its 3’ untranslated region (UTR). These miRNAs also change the methylation of the histones in the viral genome. In the <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> {{there is a lot of}} H3K9 trimethylation near the terminal repeats, which is an indication of heterochromatin in these areas. Another of these miRNAs, miR-K12-4-5p, targets retinoblastoma (Rb)-like protein 2 (Rbl2). Rbl2 regulates DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), which in turn regulates the amount of DNA methylation. miR-K12-4-5p has been shown to upregulate the amount of DNMTs which increases DNA methylation and allows the <b>latent</b> <b>phase</b> of the infection to continue.|$|E
50|$|The HIV {{virus is}} {{commonly}} transmitted via unprotected sexual activity, blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child.

There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a <b>latent,</b> asymptomatic <b>phase.</b> When the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} 6 months after {{infection}} HIV viral loads {{tend to be}} elevated and people are more often symptomatic than in later <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> of HIV disease. There may be special benefits to starting antiretroviral therapy early during this acute phase, including lowering the viral [...] "set-point" [...] or baseline viral load, reduce the mutation rate of the virus, and {{reduce the size of}} the viral reservoir (See section below on viral reservoirs). The SPARTAC trial compared 48 weeks of ART vs 12 weeks vs no treatment in acute HIV infection and found that 48 weeks of treatment delayed the time to decline in CD4 count below 350 cells per ml by 65 weeks and kept viral loads significantly lower even after treatment was stopped. Since viral loads are usually very high during acute infection, this period carries an estimated 26 times higher risk of transmission. By treating acutely infected patients, it is presumed that it could {{have a significant impact on}} decreasing overall HIV transmission rates since lower viral loads are associated with lower risk of transmission (See section on treatment as prevention). However an overall benefit has not been proven and has to be balanced with the risks of HIV treatment. Therapy during acute infection carries a grade BII recommendation from the US DHHS.|$|R
40|$|Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) is an oncogenic herpesvirus {{associated with}} multiple AIDS-related malignancies. Like other herpesviruses, KSHV has a biphasic life cycle {{and both the}} lytic and <b>latent</b> <b>phases</b> are required for tumorigenesis. Evidence suggests that KSHV lytic replication can cause genome instability in KSHV-infected cells, although no mechanism has thus far been described. A surprising link has recently been suggested between mRNA export, genome instability and cancer development. Notably, aberrations in the cellular transcription and export complex (hTREX) proteins {{have been identified in}} high-grade tumours and these defects contribute to genome instability. We have previously shown that the lytically expressed KSHV ORF 57 protein interacts with the complete hTREX complex; therefore, we investigated the possible intriguing link between ORF 57, hTREX and KSHV-induced genome instability. Herein, we show that lytically active KSHV infected cells induce a DNA damage response and, importantly, we demonstrate directly that this is due to DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, we show that sequestration of the hTREX complex by the KSHV ORF 57 protein leads to this double strand break response and significant DNA damage. Moreover, we describe a novel mechanism showing that the genetic instability observed is a consequence of R-loop formation. Importantly, the link between hTREX sequestration and DNA damage may be a common feature in herpesvirus infection, as a similar phenotype was observed with the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) ICP 27 protein. Our data provide a model of R-loop induced DNA damage in KSHV infected cells an...|$|R
