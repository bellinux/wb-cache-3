40|$|The {{mammalian}} fauna of Nicaragua includes seven {{species in}} the order Xenarthra, including the brown-throated three-toed sloth (Bradypus variegatus) in the family Bradypodidae, Hoffmann 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Choloepus hoffmanni) in the family Megalonychidae, the northern naked-tailed armadillo (Cabassous centralis) and nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus) in the family Dasypodidae, and the silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana) in the family Myrmecophagidae. Additionally, the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) in the family Myrmecophagidae is (or was) certainly part of the fauna of Nicaragua but {{has yet to be}} documented there. Based on 133 xenarthran specimens available in museums and our observations, we herein review and provide new information on distributions, systematics, morphometrics, and natural history of these species in Nicaragua. Replacement of the milk dentition in Dasypus novemcinctus is described and illustrated, documenting the most common adult dental formula of i 0 / 0, c 0 / 0, p 7 / 7, m 1 / 1 = 32...|$|R

5000|$|Choloepus is a genus {{of mammals}} of Central and South America, {{within the family}} Megalonychidae {{consisting}} of <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths.</b> The two species of Choloepus (which means [...] "lame foot"), Linnaeus's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Choloepus didactylus) and Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Choloepus hoffmanni), are the only surviving {{members of the family}} Megalonychidae.|$|R

There is now evidence suggesting the species's range expands into Bolivia.|$|R
50|$|Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> is, however, {{much easier}} to confuse with the related Linnaeus's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth,</b> which it closely resembles. The primary {{physical}} {{differences between the two}} species relate to subtle skeletal features; for example, Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> has three foramina in the upper forward part of the interpterygoid space, rather than just two, and often - but not always - has fewer cervical vertebrae.|$|R
50|$|Modern sloths {{are divided}} into two {{families}} {{based on the number}} of toes on their front feet, Megalonychidae and Bradypodidae. Linnaeus's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> and Hoffmann's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> (Choloepus hoffmanni) belong to the family Megalonychidae, which included extinct ground sloths.|$|R

2500|$|Currently living sloths belong {{largely to}} two families, Megalonychidae ("two-toed" [...] sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths). All living sloths {{have in fact}} three toes; the [...] "two-toed" [...] sloths, however, have only two fingers. <b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> {{generally}} move faster than three-toed sloths. Both types tend to occupy the same forests; in most areas, one species of three-toed sloth and one species of the larger <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> will jointly predominate.|$|R

50|$|Linne's <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloth</b> has a ten-month {{gestation}} period. Their inter-birth rate extends past sixteen months {{so there}} is not an overlap of young to care for. There is only one offspring per litter and the young becomes independent at about a year old. It take longer for <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> to become independent as well as the gestation period is longer than in three-toed sloths. It has been suggested that this difference may be caused by their difference in diet.|$|R

25|$|However, their adaptations {{contradict}} the actual {{relationship of the}} two families, which are more distant from each other than their outward similarity suggests. The common ancestor of the two families lived around 35 Mya, making the living forms exceptional examples of convergent or parallel evolution. The modern <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are far {{more closely related to}} the Megalonychidae ground sloths than to the living three-toed sloths. Whether the ground-dwelling Megalonychidae descended from tree-climbing ancestors or whether the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> are really miniature ground sloths that have converted or reverted to arboreal life cannot be properly determined yet. The latter possibility seems slightly more likely, because the small ground sloths Acratocnus and Neocnus, which were also able to climb, are among the closer relatives of the <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths,</b> and these together were related to the huge ground sloths Megalonyx and Megalocnus.|$|R

50|$|<b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> {{spend most}} of their lives hanging upside down from trees. They cannot walk, so they pull hand-over-hand to move around, which is at an {{extremely}} slow rate. Being predominantly nocturnal, their fur, which grows greenish algae to blend in, is their main source of protection. Their body temperatures depend at least partially on the ambient temperature; they cannot shiver to keep warm, as other mammals do, because of their unusually low metabolic rates and reduced musculature. <b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> also differ from three-toed sloths in their climbing behavior, preferring to descend head first.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> have a reduced, ever growing dentition, with no incisors or true canines, which overall lacks {{homology}} {{with the}} dental formula of other mammals. Their first tooth is very canine-like {{in shape and}} {{is referred to as}} a caniniform. It is separated from the other teeth, or molariforms, by a diastema. The molariforms are used specifically for grinding and are mortar and pestle-like in appearance and function. Thus, they can grind food for easier digestibility, which takes the majority of their energy. The dental formula of <b>two-toed</b> <b>sloths</b> is: [...] (unau) ...|$|R
