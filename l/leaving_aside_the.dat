25|$|Starting {{off with}} {{pioneering}} work by Ernest Mandel from 1964, various {{attempts have been}} made to link the long waves of capitalist development to long-term fluctuations in average profitability. Mandel's influential Phd thesis Late Capitalism (in German 1972, English version 1975) was a critical response to Henryk Grossman's theory. Like Henryk Grossman, Mandel was convinced of the centrality of profitability in the trajectory of capitalist development, but Mandel did not believe that Marx's reproduction models could be used to create a theory of capitalist crises. In Grossman's profitability model, there was only a series of business cycles and, sometime after the 34th cycle, a general breakdown of capitalism, because insufficient surplus value was being generated. <b>Leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> issue of the validity of Grossman's model, his picture of capitalist development did not explain historical phases of faster and slower economic growth lasting about 25 years or so. After World War 2, a long boom occurred, instead of a deepening capitalist crisis which many Marxists had expected. That was what Mandel wanted to explain (Mandel's and Grossman's growth models both ignore the accumulation of non-productive capital assets and profits not arising from new surplus-value).|$|E

500|$|Its {{mastery of}} form, light, and shadow made the work look so {{realistic}} that Rodin {{was accused of}} surmoulage– having taken a cast from a living model. Rodin vigorously denied the charges, writing to newspapers and having photographs taken of the model to prove how the sculpture differed. He demanded an inquiry and was eventually exonerated by a committee of sculptors. <b>Leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> false charges, the piece polarized critics. It had barely won acceptance for display at the Paris Salon, and criticism likened it to [...] "a statue of a sleepwalker" [...] and called it [...] "an astonishingly accurate copy of a low type". Others rallied to defend the piece and Rodin's integrity. The government minister Turquet admired the piece, and The Age of Bronze was purchased by the state for 2,200 francs– what it had cost Rodin to have it cast in bronze.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1998 about {{a period}} more than 100 years before, Waters employs a {{continuity}} between {{the past and}} present, particularly {{as it relates to}} an outsider's view of sexuality and gender. Diana bestows Nan with the finest gift she had ever received, an expensive watch that requires no winding. She has nowhere to be except at Diana's beck and call, and never leaves Diana's mansion without her. Emily Jeremiah uses this {{as an example of how}} Tipping the Velvet fits Judith Halberstam's declaration that homosexual historiographies [...] "produce alternative temporalities". Gay and lesbian stories do not use the same rites of passage that most mainstream stories do, <b>leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> importance of birth, marriage, reproduction, and death. This transcendence of time is evident in the narration of the novel. It is Nan's first-person account of her own past, told many years later. When Nan divulges her past to Florence, Waters uses the first line of the novel to signify where she begins, cycling the story.|$|E
500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as one looks at higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in rank order as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (<b>leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels of giftedness, those norms are not based on well validated data.|$|E

Yaroslav and Mstislav then divided Kievan Rus' between them: the area stretching left from the Dnieper River, with the capital at Chernihiv, was ceded to Mstislav until his death in 1036.|$|E
2500|$|One {{theory about}} the Highland Fling {{is that it}} was a dance of triumph {{at the end of a}} battle.

The shield would have a spike in the middle, around which the dancer would do the dance that involves flicking of the feet, jumping and careful stepping supposedly to drive evil spirits away.

2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of liability may hang on a foreseeability test. The fact that the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion of drugs may cause a loss of control is well known. Thus, anyone who knowingly consumes is, at the very least, reckless as to the possibility of losing control. If they did not wish to lose control, they would not consume, so loss of control must be within the scope of their intention by continuing to consume. But, loss of control is not instantaneous and without symptoms. The issue of involuntary consumption is therefore contentious. In most legal systems, involuntary loss of control is limited to cases where there is no real loss of control with noticeable symptoms. Thus, for example, in many states, the blood alcohol level for the commission of the offence of driving under the influence is set sufficiently low that people might exceed the limit without realising that they had consumed enough alcohol to do so. <b>Leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> issue that, in some states, this is a strict liability offense excluding drunkenness as a defense, there is usually a requirement that the person who [...] "spiked" [...] the drinks be prosecuted in place of the driver. This reflects the fact that the commission of a crime has been procured by the actions of secretly adding the alcohol and the practical fact that without this rule, too many accused who are only marginally over the limit, might be encouraged to blame others for their intoxication.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{parts of}} the Universe are too far away for the light emitted since the Big Bang to have {{had enough time to}} reach Earth, so these {{portions}} of the Universe lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to Hubble's law, regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light (special relativity prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see uses of the proper distance for a discussion) and furthermore the expansion rate appears to be accelerating due to dark energy. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging cosmological constant), so that the expansion rate of the Universe continues to accelerate, there is a [...] "future visibility limit" [...] beyond which objects will never enter our observable universe {{at any time in the}} infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually). This future visibility limit is calculated at a comoving distance of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light years), assuming the Universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (<b>leaving</b> <b>aside</b> <b>the</b> issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36. = 2.36.|$|E
