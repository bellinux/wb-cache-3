40|$|Dropping out of {{high school}} culminates a {{long-term}} process of disengagement from school and has profound social and economic consequences for students, their families, and their communities. Students who drop {{out of high}} school {{are more likely to be}} unemployed, to earn less than those who graduate, to be on public assistance, and to end up in prison. The present study examined dropout rates in Kentucky high schools (N = 196), using both quantitative and qualitative procedures. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were computed to identify those school-level variables that showed strong relationships to dropout rates. A sample of 20 schools with the highest dropout rates was compared to a sample of 20 schools with the <b>lowest</b> <b>dropout</b> rates using a multivariate analysis of variance.

40|$|Nowadays, {{small area}} {{information}} {{that has a}} small sample size is needed. A direct estimation in the small area will produce a large variance of values. In order of that, another alternative is needed {{that can be used}} is the indirect estimation. Small area estimation is an indirect estimation method {{that can be used to}} estimate parameters in a small area by utilizing information from outside the area, from the area itself, and from outside the survey. One of the methods that can be used is the empirical best linear unbiased prediction (EBLUP). EBLUP will be used to estimate the dropout rate for each village in the district of Semarang. Additional information used in this EBLUP method are the number of educational facilities, population, average expenditure per capita and distance from village to district. The results of EBLUP estimation showed that the <b>lowest</b> <b>dropout</b> rate village is Beji village and the highest is Pledokan village.

A university with a <b>low</b> absolute <b>dropout</b> rate of 2% and a benchmark of 2% would thus be rated worse on this measure than a university with a much higher absolute dropout rate of 8% but a benchmark of 11%. The ratings are thus a measure of whether a university exceeds, meets or falls short of expectations based on the profile of students admitted and subjects taught.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{determine}} the extent to which current changes in the American health care system might adversely effect the willingness of community physicians to volunteer to teach medical students. Design Surveys in the form of 2 mailings were sent to 466 physicians in the Pacific Northwest who volunteer to teach first- and second-year medical students. The physicians were categorized into medical specialty or primary care, urban or rural location, and type of practice. Participants A total of 333 physicians completed the surveys on which responses were analyzed. Results Respondents noted that clinical and nonclinical workloads had increased (n= 211 [63 %] and n= 276 [83 %], respectively) in the past 5 years. One hundred eighty-six respondents (56 %) said that they had less time for teaching medical students. Forty-five physicians (14 %) indicated that they had discontinued their volunteer teaching activities altogether. During the past 5 years, solo practitioners had the <b>lowest</b> <b>dropout</b> rate (7 % [4 / 57]), and physicians at health maintenance organizations had the highest (23 % [7 / 30]). Primary care physicians were more likely to indicate that they had decreased time for each patient encounter (P= 0. 006). Conclusions Increasing nonclinical workload demands and higher patient loads are a substantial threat to the recruitment and retention of volunteer faculty. In particular, the involvement of urban, HMO, and primary care physicians may decrease disproportionately in the future...|$|R

50|$|All linear {{regulators}} {{require an}} input voltage {{at least some}} minimum amount higher than the desired output voltage. That minimum amount is called the dropout voltage. For example, a common regulator such as the 7805 has an output voltage of 5V, but can only maintain this if the input voltage remains above about 7V, before the output voltage begins sagging below the rated output. Its dropout voltage is therefore 7V − 5V = 2V. When the supply voltage is less than about 2V above the desired output voltage, {{as is the case}} in low-voltage microprocessor power supplies, so-called <b>low</b> <b>dropout</b> regulators (LDOs) must be used.|$|E
5000|$|A {{low-dropout}} or LDO [...] regulator is a DC linear {{voltage regulator}} that can regulate the output voltage {{even when the}} supply voltage {{is very close to}} the output voltage. The advantages of a <b>low</b> <b>dropout</b> voltage regulator over other DC to DC regulators include the absence of switching noise (as no switching takes place), smaller device size (as neither large inductors nor transformers are needed), and greater design simplicity (usually consists of a reference, an amplifier, and a pass element). A significant disadvantage is that, unlike switching regulators, linear DC regulators must dissipate power across the regulation device in order to regulate the output voltage.|$|E
40|$|This article reports Year One of {{a two-year}} study {{to develop a}} model to {{accelerate}} compulsory basic education completiontoward Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Magelang, Indonesia. The study focuses on five issues: (1) profile of MDGs in Magelang, (2) achievement of MDGs, (3) problems in MDGs implementation, (4) model of compulsary basic education completion acceleration, and (5) effectiveness of the model proposed. As R&D undertaking, {{the data were collected}} through documentation and interviews with related authorities, including focused group discussion. The initial model underwent a limited test for necessary revision. The findings showed that the Local Government has implemented the compulsary education with relatively high gross and net enrolment rates of 96. 80 % and <b>low</b> <b>dropouts</b> and repeaters rates. In 2013 - 2014, many of the students were from outside Magelang. However, such achievements have not complied with MDGs. One possible cause of the problems was a top-down management system, resulting in low participation of the society members. In conclusion, Magelang Municipality has actually been highly committed to the completion of basic education in accordance with the strategic plans 2010 - 2014 of the National Education Ministry.

Four new lessons emerge from research that has been conducted since a comprehensive review of GED-related research that was published in 1998.

Second, economic benefits associated with a GED appear over time rather than immediately upon receipt of the credential. Third, GED benefits associated with post-secondary education and training are small due to the small amounts of each that GED holders obtain.

In this paper we utilize unique student-level data from the Texas Schools Microdata Panel (TSMP) in an attempt to determine what factors contribute to the higher minority dropout rates. We show that poverty is a key contributor. Lack of English proficiency among Hispanic student is linked to the higher Hispanic dropout probability. Our results also suggest that neighborhood characteristics may be important in explaining the high African-American dropout rates.

5000|$|Series {{regulators}} {{are the more}} common form; they are more efficient than shunt designs. The series regulator works by providing a path from the supply voltage to the load through a variable resistance, usually a transistor (in this role it is usually termed the series pass transistor); {{it is in the}} [...] "top half" [...] of the voltage divider - the bottom half being the load. The power dissipated by the regulating device is equal to the power supply output current times the voltage drop in the regulating device. For efficiency and reduced stress on the pass transistor, designs try to minimize the voltage drop but not all circuits regulate well once the input (unregulated) voltage comes close to the required output voltage; those that do are termed <b>Low</b> <b>Dropout</b> regulators, A series regulator can usually only source (supply) current, unlike shunt regulators.|$|E
