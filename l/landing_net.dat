Here we describe a new method of directly capturing beavers (C. fiber) alive. We captured beavers from 3 rivers in Telemark County, Norway, from 31 March to 23 September 1999. Working at night (2000 - 0845 hours) with a 2 -person team in a boat, we located beavers with a spotlight and captured them using 4 different <b>landing</b> <b>nets.</b> We captured 84 beavers during 22 nights and 130 hours of effort. We used 0. 3 nights/beaver and worked on average 5. 9 ± 2. 3 hours/night; mean capture effort was 1. 9 ± 1. 1 hours/beaver. Number of captures during a night ranged from 1 to 8. We captured 18 beavers on land with the <b>land</b> <b>net</b> or the scoopnet, 56 in water with the diving net, and 10 by scooping them directly out of the water with the scoop net. We captured beavers as early as 2120 hours and as late as 0755 hours, with the greatest capture rate recorded between 0200 and 0300 hours. We captured 39 beavers (47 %) between 2400 and 0300 hours, when it was completely dark. A major decrease in capture rate was recorded at 0300 - 0500 hours. Capture rates on cloudy versus c 1 ear nights did not differ. We captured 76. 2 % adults, 9. 5 % 2 -year-olds, and 14. 3 % one-year-olds. Mean weight of animals captured in the <b>landing</b> <b>nets</b> was 18. 4 kg± 6. 6 (range 3. 5 to 30. 5 kg). There was no difference in frequency of males and females captured. We also recaptured 10 selected beavers with a fine-mesh diving net during 14 hours of effort, with a mean recapture effort of 1. 8 ± 1. 0 hours/beaver. This capture technique is quick, efficient, and resulted in no mortalities or injuries to either beavers or researchers. Our method is best suited for large river systems but also may be used in lakes and large ponds or even on land...|$|R

Jones says no: give him a hook well through the fish and a stout line in his hand and that fish has got to come in. Popley says so too. He says let him have his hook fast through the fish's head with a short stout line, and put him (Popley) at the other end of that line and that fish will come in. It's got to. Otherwise Popley will know why. That's the alternative. Either the fish must come in or Popley must know why. There's no escape from the logic of it.|$|E
40|$|A {{recent study}} of the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon sink {{estimated}} using the Mauna Loa, Hawaii atmospheric CO 2 record, fossil fuel estimates, and a suite of ocean models suggests that {{the mean of the}} <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon uptake remained approximately constant for three decades and increased after 1988 / 1989. Due to the large variability in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake, {{it is not possible to}} determine the exact timing and nature of the increase robustly by visual inspection. Here, we develop a general methodology to objectively determine the nature and timing of the shift in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake based on the Schwarz Information Criterion. We confirm that it is likely that an abrupt shift in the mean <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon uptake occurred in 1988. After taking into account the variability in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake due to the influence of volcanic aerosols and the El Niño Southern Oscillation, we find that it is most likely that there is a remaining step increase at the same time (p-values of 0. 01 and 0. 04 for Mauna Loa and South Pole, respectively) of about 1 Pg C/yr. Thus, we conclude that neither the effect of volcanic eruptions nor the El Niño Southern Oscillation are the causes of the sudden increase of the land carbon sink. By also applying our methodology to the atmospheric growth rate of CO 2, we demonstrate that it is likely that the atmospheric growth rate of CO 2 exhibits a step decrease between two fitted lines in 1988 – 1989, which is most likely due to the shift in the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> uptake of carbon...|$|R

Collectors do get very odd things together. Poor M. Soleirol had quite a gallery of portraits and autographs of Moliere, and a French mathematician, about a dozen years ago, possessed an assortment of apocryphal letters from almost every one mentioned in history, sacred or profane.

6000|$|The thing somehow {{seemed to}} fall into the mood of each of us. Jones said he had been hoping that some of the boys would get up a fishing party. It was {{apparently}} the one kind of pleasure that he really cared for. For myself I was delighted to get in with a crowd of regular fishermen like these four, especially as I hadn't been out fishing for nearly ten years, though fishing is a thing I am passionately fond of. I know no pleasure in life like the sensation of getting a four-pound bass on the hook and hauling him {{up to the top of}} the water, to weigh him. But, as I say, I hadn't been out for ten years. Oh, yes, I live right beside the water every summer, and yes, certainly--I am saying so--I am passionately fond of fishing, but still somehow I hadn't been out. Every fisherman knows just how that happens. The years have a way of slipping by. Yet I must say I was surprised to find that so keen a sport as Jones hadn't been out--so it presently appeared--for eight years. I had imagined he practically lived on the water. And Colonel Morse and Kernin, I was amazed to find, hadn't been out for twelve years, not since the day--so it came out in conversation--when they went out together in Lake Rosseau and Kernin landed a perfect monster, a regular corker, five pounds and a half, they said; or no, I don't think he landed him. No, I remember, he didn't land him. He caught him--and he could have landed him, he should have landed him--but he didn't land him. That was it. Yes, I remember Kernin and Morse had a slight discussion about it--oh, perfectly amicable--as to whether Morse had fumbled with the net or whether Kernin--the whole argument was perfectly friendly--had made an ass of himself by not [...] "striking" [...] soon enough. Of course the whole thing was so long ago that both of them could look back on it without any bitterness or ill nature. In fact it amused them. Kernin said it was the most laughable thing he ever saw in his life to see poor old Jack--that's Morse's name--shoving away with the <b>landing</b> <b>net</b> wrong side up. And Morse said he'd never forget seeing poor old Kernin yanking his line first this way and then that and not knowing where to try to haul it. It made him laugh to look back at it.|$|E

40|$|A design-based {{procedure}} for estimating the <b>land</b> cover <b>net</b> change between two dates in time {{is considered by}} means of aerial information. The aerial information in the first date consists of analogical photos while the aerial information in the second date consists of digital photos or satellite imagery. In {{the first phase of}} sampling a set of points is selected on the study area by means of unaligned systematic sampling. The digital imagery available for the second date may be readily adopted for spotting and classifying the first-phase points, thus obtaining a firstphase estimator of the areal extents in the second date. On the other hand, owing to the operational difficulties of spotting all the first-phase points on the analogical photos, a second-phase sample selected from these points is necessary to estimate the areal extents of the land categories in the first date. Finally, the <b>land</b> cover <b>net</b> changes may be estimated by means of the difference between the resulting estimates in the two dates. The use of stratified network sampling is considered in the second phase in order to handle the presence of analogical photos overlapping each other at their boundaries.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{terrestrial}} photosynthesis and 13 C discrimination vary in response to a number of environmental and biological factors such as atmospheric humidity and genotypic differences in stomatal regulation. Small changes in the global balance between diffusive conductances to CO 2 and photosynthesis in C 3 vegetation have the potential to influence the 13 C budget of the atmosphere because these changes scale with the relatively large one-way gross primary production (GPP) flux. Over a period of days to years, this atmospheric isotopic forcing is damped by the return flux consisting mostly of respiration, Fire, and volatile organic carbon losses. Here we explore the magnitude of this class of isotopic disequilibria with an ecophysiological model (SiB 2) and a double deconvolution inversion framework that includes time-varying discrimination for the period of 1981 – 1994. If the <b>net</b> <b>land</b> carbon sink and plant 13 C discrimination covary on interannual timescales at the global scale, consistent with El Niño-induced drought stress causing a decline in global GPP and C 3 discrimination, then less interannual variability in ocean and <b>land</b> <b>net</b> carbon exchange is required to explain atmospheric trends in δ 13 C and CO 2 as compared with previous studies that assumed discrimination was invariant...|$|R
