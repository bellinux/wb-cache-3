40|$|This study {{investigates the}} diet of {{breeding}} Black Sparrowhawks (Accipiter melanoleucus) on the Cape Peninsula of South Africa. Macro-remains of prey {{were collected from}} below and around the vicinity of nests throughout the breeding seasons of 2012 and 2013. These prey items were then identified down to species where possible {{through the use of}} a museum reference collection. In both years 85. 9 % of the individual remains were those of Columbidae, which corresponds with the only other diet study on Black Sparrowhawks. Redeyed Doves were the most common prey species, accounting for around 35 % of the diet’s biomass and 45 % of the prey items. Helmeted Guineafowl were also an important component of the diet for certain nests, making up on average 26. 4 % biomass of the diet. I found very little difference in diet between the different stages of breeding (pre-lay, incubation and nestling), despite the fact that females only contribute significantly during the nestling state and are considerably larger than the males. I also found little difference in the diet composition between pairs which bred either earlier or later in the year, despite productivity being significantly higher for earlier breeding pairs. However, a crude analysis of the overall diet per month revealed increased diet breadth in the early lay months as opposed to the later months. This was a result of fluctuations in the presence of <b>Laughing</b> <b>Doves,</b> Feral Pigeons and Helmeted Guineafowl, probably driven by those species breeding behaviour. Lastly, I also found no difference in the diet composition between pairs with either pure or mixed plumage morph compositions in this polymorphic species. This study provides further evidence to the claim that Black Sparrowhawks on the Cape Peninsula are benefiting from man-altered environments that provide perfect habitat for suitable prey...|$|R

40|$|Red-billed Quelea Quelea quelea have {{expanded}} their {{range in the}} Eastern Cape and now occur throughout the year in new areas. Recent changes in agricultural practice have probably been a contributing factor as flocks are larger than previously recorded and were more often associated with artificial food sources than natural grasses. Ringing and census data indicate that quelea have reduced movements during the non-breeding season and may display strong fidelity (over successive years) to dry season quarters with reliable food supplies. Although the recapture/recovery rate for quelea in the Eastern Cape (1. 0 - 2. 5 %) was {{higher than the national}} average, it was still lower than expected and there may be considerable movement between nearby feeding sites. Some quelea breed locally, but most disperse during summer and their numbers at the feedlots were generally highest in winter and spring. The breeding season of quelea is later than other ploceids in the region and post-nuptial moult overlaps with winter. Replacement of primary wing feathers is relatively slow (124 days), and this is considered an adaptation to minimise disruption of flight capabilities and insulation. Significantly more quelea in the Eastern Cape have breeding plumage suffused with pink than in other southern African populations. However, during the non-breeding season there is apparently considerable intermixing between local populations and those from further north and the existence of a local sub-species is not supported. Seeds of two grass species, Echinochloa sp. and Urochloa panicoides, and two weed species, Amaranthus sp. and Chenopodium sp., were important in the diet of both quelea and <b>Laughing</b> <b>Doves</b> Streptopelia senegalensis. Maize comprised {{a large proportion of the}} diet of these species and losses at one ostrich feedlot were estimated at over R 17 000 in two years. Dependence on artificial food sources was generally greatest in winter and spring, but economically significant damage was not confined to this period. Alpha-chloralose showed good potential for reducing numbers of problem birds at livestock feedlots. However, the dynamic nature of problem bird populations favours a non-lethal management approach. Reduction of feed loss through manipulation of the ostrich ration could provide a relatively cheap and effective alternative to lethal control if applied appropriately...|$|R

5000|$|In Chinese literature, the Daoist classic Zhuangzi has {{the oldest}} {{record of the}} Peng and Kun myth. The first chapter ("Free and Easy Wandering" [...] 逍遙遊 pinyin Xiao Yao You) begins with three {{versions}} of this parable; the lead paragraph, a quote from the Qixie (齊諧 [...] "Universal Harmony", probably invented by Zhuangzi), and a quote from the Tang zhi wen Ji (湯之問棘 [...] "Questions of Tang to Ji", cf. Liezi chapter 5, Tang wen 湯問). The first account contrasts the giant Peng bird with a small tiao (蜩 [...] "cicada") and jiu (鳩 [...] "pigeon; turtledove") and the third with a yan (鴳 or 鷃 [...] "quail"). The Peng fish-bird transformation {{is not only the}} beginning myth in Zhuangzi, but Robert Allinson claims, [...] "the central myth". In the northern darkness there is a fish and his name is Kun. The Kun is so huge I dont know how many thousand li he measures. He changes and becomes a bird whose name is Peng. The back of the Peng measures I dont know how many thousand li across and, when he rises up and flies off, his wings are like clouds all over the sky. When the sea begins to move, this bird sets off for the southern darkness, which is the Lake of Heaven.The Universal Harmony records various wonders, and it says: [...] "When the Peng journeys to the southern darkness, the waters are roiled for three thousand li. He beats the whirlwind and rises ninety thousand li, setting off on the sixth month gale." [...] Wavering heat, bits of dust, living things blowing each other about - the sky looks very blue. Is that its real color, or is it because it is so far away and has no end? When the bird looks down, all he sees is blue too.If water is not piled up deep enough, it wont have the strength to bear up a big boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor and bits of trash will sail on it like boats. But set the cup there and it will stick fast, for the water is too shallow and the boat too large. If wind is not piled up deep enough, it wont have the strength to bear up great wings. Therefore when the Peng rises ninety thousand li, he must have the wind under him like that. Only then can he mount {{on the back of the}} wind, shoulder the blue sky, and nothing can hinder or block him. Only then can he set his eyes to the south.The cicada and the little <b>dove</b> <b>laugh</b> at this saying, [...] "When we make an effort and fly up, we can get as far as the elm or the sapanwood tree, but sometimes we dont make it and just fall down on the ground. Now how is anyone going to go ninety thousand li to the south!If you go off to the green woods nearby, you can take along food for three meals and come back with your stomach as full as ever. If you are going a hundred li, you must grind your grain the night before; and if you are going a thousand li you must start getting together provisions three months in advance. What do these two creatures understand? Little understanding cannot come up to great understanding; the short-lived cannot come up to the long-lived. ...Among the questions of Tang to Chi we find the same thing. In the bald and barren north, there is a dark sea, the Lake of Heaven. In it is a fish which is several thousand li across, and no one knows how long. His name is Kun. There is also a bird there, named Peng, with a back like Mount Tai and wings like clouds filling the sky. He beats the whirlwind, leaps into the air, and rises up ninety thousand li, cutting through the clouds and mist, shouldering the blue sky, and then he turns his eyes south and prepares to journey to the southern darkness.The little quail laughs at him, saying, [...] "Where does he think hes going? I give a great leap and fly up, but I never get more than ten or twelve yards before I come down fluttering among the weeds and brambles. And thats the best kind of flying anyway! Where does he think hes going?" [...] Such is the difference between big and little.|$|R

The two-species lineages appear to be each other's closest relatives and cannot be firmly assigned to either Columba or Streptopelia (although overall they seem to be close to the latter). Thus, it might be best to split the two minor lineages off as distinct genera, namely Spilopelia for the first (which has priority over Stigmatopelia) and Nesoenas for the last.|$|E

Among passerines, the most frequently taken are likely to be corvids, which are often favored by Bubo owls from around the world due to their large size, relatively open nests and frequently easy-to-find, communal nocturnal roosts. To date the cape crow (Corvus capensis) and pied crow (Corvus albus) are the corvids reported in dietary studies but in Ethiopia thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), which at 1500 g are possible the heaviest corvid species in the world, mobbed them vigorously and seemed to consider them a primary threat. Smaller passerines are by no means ignored. White-eyes are among the more frequently taken smaller passerines, with the 10.9 g African yellow white-eye (Zosterops senegalensis) being the smallest identified avian prey species, although penduline tits (Anthoscopus ssp.) (thus far unidentified to species) are likely to be even smaller. The largest bird to be hunted to Verreaux's eagle-owl is {{complicated by the fact that}} they often take relatively small nestlings of larger species, such as ostriches (Struthio camelus) and grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum). The only avian prey items successfully attacked larger than other types of birds of prey (reviewed later) are likely bustards. Most predation records have reported on relatively small bustards, namely northern (Afrotis afraoides) and southern black korhaans (Afrotis afra), which average only 745 g and 690 g, respectively. Larger species of bustard thought to be threatened by Verreaux's eagle-owl are the 4790 g Denham's bustard (Neotis denhami) and the 8430 g kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), although it is not clear whether adults (especially males) are attacked in the latter species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species is}} usually seen in pairs or small parties and only rarely in larger groups. Larger groups are formed {{especially}} when drinking at waterholes in arid regions. Small numbers assemble on trees near waterholes before flying to the water's edge {{where they are}} able to suck up water like other members of the pigeon family. Laughing doves eat the fallen seeds, mainly of grasses, other vegetable matter and small ground insects such as termites and beetles. They are fairly terrestrial, foraging on the ground in grasslands and cultivation. Their flight is quick and direct with the regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings which are characteristic of pigeons in general. The male in courtship display follows the female with head bobbing displays while cooing. The male pecks its folded wings in [...] "displacement-preening" [...] to solicit copulation from the female. A female accepts by crouching and begging for food. The male may indulge in courtship feeding before mounting and copulating. Pairs may preen each other. Males may also launch into the air with wing clapping sounds and then glide down in a gentle arc when displaying. The species has a spread out breeding season in Africa. Almost year round in Malawi and Turkey; and mainly May to November in Zimbabwe, February to June in Egypt and Tunisia. In Australia the main breeding season is September to November. The nest is a very flimsy platform of twigs built in a low bush and sometimes in crevices or under the eaves of houses. Both parents build the nest with males bringing the twigs which are then placed by the female. Two eggs are laid within an interval of a day between them and both parents take part in building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. Males spend more time incubating the nest during the day. The eggs are incubated after the second egg is laid and the eggs hatch after about 13 to 15 days. Nesting adults may feign injury to distract and draw predators away from the nest. Multiple broods may be raised by the same pair in the same nest. Seven broods by the same pair have been noted in Turkey. The young fledge and leave the nest after about 14 to 16 days. The Jacobin cuckoo sometimes lays its egg in the nests of the <b>laughing</b> <b>dove</b> in Africa.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the activities of some serum enzymes of Collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) and <b>Laughing</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia senegalensis) as a species classification. Twenty (10 males and 10 females) individuals of Collared dove and eighteen (10 males and 8 females) of <b>Laughing</b> <b>dove</b> were collected from different regions of Baghdad city during two seasons, winter and summer. Serum enzymes in three replicates for each species in both sexes were determined. Results revealed significant species differences in serum enzymes (P< 0. 05). Collared dove dominated <b>Laughing</b> <b>dove</b> in the average values of serum GOT, GPT and AP in winter season. Also, significant species differences were found in serum enzymes activity (P< 0. 05) during summer season. Collared dove predominated <b>Laughing</b> <b>dove</b> in the average values of studied enzymes with high values compared with winter. Significant sex differences were found in serum enzymes activity (P< 0. 05). Males of the two species predominated females in the values of studied enzymes during the two seasons...|$|E
40|$|As part {{of ongoing}} {{studies on the}} blood {{profiles}} of the Nigerian avian species, haematological and plasma biochemical parameters were determined in the Nigerian <b>laughing</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia senegalensis). There were no significant sex differences in all the parameters studied. However, when the values that were observed in the Nigerian <b>laughing</b> <b>dove</b> were {{compared with those of}} the Nigerian duck (Anas platyrhynchos), the Nigerian duck had significantly higher mean corpuscular volume, total white blood counts, plasma urea, total protein and globulin, but significantly lower red blood cell counts, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, plasma potassium and albumin/globulin ratio than the Nigerian <b>laughing</b> <b>dove.</b> However, the packed cell volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, plasma sodium, creatinine and albumin were similar in the two species of bird...|$|E
