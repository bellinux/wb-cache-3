40|$|Pressure {{to support}} {{responses}} to <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has intensified in recent years. <b>Loss</b> <b>and</b> damage – an issue gaining prominence {{largely due to}} shortfalls of mitigation action and adaptation support – has never been officially defined under the UNFCCC. Here, the term “loss and damage” refers to irreversible losses (e. g. loss of life, species, land) and costly damages (e. g. destroyed infrastructure) caused, at least in part, by climate change. Although <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage has been a subject of debate among Parties to the UNFCCC for years, the agreement reached in Paris {{was the first to}} devote a full article to <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage. In that article, Parties agreed to enhance “understanding, action <b>and</b> support” for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage and to strengthen the Warsaw International Mechanism for <b>Loss</b> <b>and</b> Damage associated with Climate Change (WIM) (UNFCCC, 2015, Art. 8). In coming years, as climate change advances and Parties work to implement this and other directions from the Paris Agreement, it will prove more crucial than ever to support <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response, especially should efforts to sufficiently scale up mitigation commitments and adaptation capacity fall short. Given mounting pressure to finance effective <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response efforts, understanding of the Warsaw International Mechanism’s activities must be strengthened, and the question of how funding for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response might be raised and allocated must be widely considered. To these ends, this paper endeavours to answer two questions {{at the core of the}} emergent drive to fund efforts to address <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage. First, what do we mean by financing <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response? We examine language relevant to financing efforts in the initial two-year workplan of the Executive Committee (ExCom) of the WIM to answer this question, reviewing the workplan’s listed financing options. Second, what are some possible means for raising predictable funding that will prove adequate to finance <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response? We discuss a number of innovative fundraising mechanisms that have been proposed and assess their adequacy, predictability, technical feasibility, fairness (whether polluters or the most vulnerable pay), indirect effects <b>and</b> link to <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage. These criteria provide a framework to evaluate the concepts that underlie each mechanism (such as fairness <b>and</b> links to <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage), to assess whether each mechanism can be implemented and become a sufficient, stable source of support for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response (using criteria of feasibility, adequacy and predictability), and to judge what tangential impacts use of each mechanism might produce (by examining potential indirect effects). We conclude that there are a number of viable proposals for both gathering and effectively using funds to support <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response. Two proposals stand out: a levy on airline travel and risk transfer approaches. However, we also identify a number of outstanding issues in funding <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage response, including the ambiguity of relevant UNFCCC texts; the shortfalls of proposed mechanisms in terms of providing for slow onset or high-certainty events <b>and</b> non-economic <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage; the lack of an agreed definition of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage under the UNFCCC; developed countries’ disproportionate (and inadequate) support for risk transfer over other approaches; the large gap that exists between funding made available and funding needed; and the inevitable contention surrounding the question of how finance should be distributed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
30|$|Submissions made by {{developed}} countries from 2011 to 2013 highlighted that <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage {{is caused by}} a complex mixture of factors. As highlighted by Norway’s submission, the impacts of climate change are considered as one of many factors that can result in <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage: “Vulnerability to the impacts of climate change is not only caused by climate change… To understand risk and the concept of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage, the drivers of vulnerability must also be considered, such as institutional set up, legislation, social and economic structures, not only the exposure to climate change effects… <b>Loss</b> <b>and</b> damage will be affected by multiple stressors and be the result of the impact of climate change and vulnerability to those impacts, combined with other stressors such as <b>loss</b> of biodiversity <b>and</b> desertification” (Norwegian Government 2011, p. 2). Such a position gives the impression of protracted responsibility on behalf of {{developed countries}} for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage as a result of historical and current emissions. Emphasizing a complex mixture of reasons for <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage weakens the concerns raised by developing countries that the impacts of climate change are causing <b>and</b> exacerbating <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage.|$|R

30|$|Three {{years later}} in 2010, COP 16 in Cancún {{was the site of}} an {{agreement}} to a work program on <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage under the Subsidiary Body of Implementation. As stipulated in the Cancún Agreements, parties: “Recognize[d] the need to strengthen international cooperation and expertise in order to understand <b>and</b> reduce <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including impacts related to extreme weather events and slow onset events” (UNFCCC 2010, p. 6). This was a critical moment in the <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage genealogy as it was a compromise reached by both developed and developing countries to move this discussion forward. In the following year (COP 17, Durban 2011), negotiators agreed that the work program on <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage continue and in particular assess the risk of <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage, develop approaches to address such, and consider the role of the Convention in addressing <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage. At COP 18 in Doha in late 2012, parties agreed that institutional arrangements to address <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> damage as a result of climate change would be firmly established under the Convention—a decision known as the “Doha Gateway” (UNFCCC 2012).|$|R

40|$|Despite major {{advances}} in the treatment and survival of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting remain common problems. In the HIV-infected population, weight loss is associated with lower CD 4 + cell counts and is an independent predictor of mortality. The etiology of weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting is complex and multifactorial. We discuss, {{on the basis of}} a large longitudinal cohort that examined nutritional status in HIV infection, data on weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting from the present clinical era. The definition, prevalence, and significance of HIV-associated weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting are summarized. The etiology of weight loss is discussed for 2 main categories: inadequate nutrient intake and altered metabolism. Finally, studies of interventions to treat HIV-associated weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting are discussed. This information is intended to raise awareness among health care providers of HIV-infected patients that weight <b>loss</b> <b>and</b> wasting remain important acquired immunodeficiency syndrome–defining conditions, despite the advent of HAART. During the HAART era, HIV infection has become a chronic, manageable disease. Nutrition-related complications remain a challenging issue for HIV-infected patients and for those in-volved in their care.
