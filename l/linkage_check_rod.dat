Forms of this techniques are used in a variety of applications, such as record <b>linkage,</b> spell <b>checking,</b> and Web searches. Many use fixed n-gram-based indexing, in which fixed n-grams are substrings that have a certain length. One disadvantage of this approach is that the n-gram length can {{have a negative effect on}} the performance of the algorithms. To solve this problem, using variable length n-grams for indexing have been proposed. However, these methods have difficulty extracting variable length n-grams to use for the index. We therefore developed the algorithm,FPI(Frequent Pattern Indexing), to extract variable length n-grams for use with approximate string searches, FPI uses high-frequency patterns that appear in a dataset for index and returns exact answers Patterns used by the proposed algorithms run in linear-time using a suffix array and an LCP array...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple procedure that identifies linkage. The Linkage Identification by Nonlinearity Check (LINC) algorithm we propose checks arbitrary nonlinearity of fitness function for perturbations {{in a pair}} of loci to detect their linkage. To avoid overspecified linkage caused by GA-easy nonlinearity, the algorithm also detects monotonicity for perturbations in each pair of previously obtained linkage to be removed. The algorithm effectively identifies <b>linkage</b> by <b>checking</b> O(2 k) strings and the computational cost for each string is O(l 2) where l is the string length. 1 Introduction Holland's early work hinted that promoting the exchange of building blocks [...] - essential subcomponents of solutions [...] - was important to succeed in artificial genetic search, but more recent work (Goldberg, Deb, & Thierens, 1993; Thierens, 1995; Thierens & Goldberg, 1993) has shown that effective building block mixing is absolutely essential.

Second, {{it is important to}} accurately estimate each intermediary’s amount of damage and the model’s parameters by comprehensively collecting the data of global inter-firm relationships. Part of the money which was spent in firms flows into conflict minerals through multiple inter-firm networks. Third, we need to expand our model by connecting a customer-supplier network with licensee-licensor and strategic alliance networks. This expanded model might help make more effective policies for conflict minerals. Recently, the global diffusion of weaponry, technical know-how, conflict oil, and natural gas through lawful trades is also attracting attention. Our results might resolve such issues and contribute to global peace.|$|R
40|$|Approximate queries on a {{collection}} of strings are important in many applications such as record <b>linkage,</b> spell <b>checking,</b> and Web search, where inconsistencies and errors exist in data as well as queries. Several existing algorithms use the concept of “grams, ” which are substrings of strings used as signatures for the strings to build index structures. A recently proposed technique, called VGRAM, improves the performance of these algorithms by using a carefully chosen dictionary of variable-length grams based on their frequencies in the string collection. Since an index structure using fixed-length grams {{can be viewed as}} a special case of VGRAM, a fundamental problem arises naturally: what is the relationship between the gram dictionary and the performance of queries? We study this problem in this paper. We propose a dynamic programming algorithm for computing a tight lower bound on the number of common grams shared by two similar strings in order to improve query performance. We analyze how a gram dictionary affects the index structure of the string collection and ultimately the performance of queries. We also propose an algorithm for automatically computing a dictionary of high-quality grams for a workload of queries. Our experiments on real data sets show the improvement on query performance achieved by these techniques. To our best knowledge, this study is the first cost-based quantitative approach to deciding good grams for approximate string queries...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{research into}} the automation of the configuration analysis of eight-bar linkages based on the known 16 linkage topologies. The eight-bar linkage topologies do not distinguish a ground link or an input link, and this {{research shows that the}} selection of a ground link yields 71 unique mechanisms. In addition, the selection of a driving link attached to ground results in 153 eight-bar linkages with distinct sets of loop equations. The research automates the configuration analysis process and has been demonstrated for four-bar and six-bar linkages as well as eight-bar <b>linkages.</b> A <b>check</b> of the process includes example 10 -bar linkages. The automation of linkage analysis begins with an adjacency matrix, which defines how the joints connect the links known as the topology of the linkage. The ground link and driving link are selected by the designer, and the automated analysis process determines the smallest set of independent loops. A naming convention is used to automate the definition of link features, dimensions, and joint angles, which yields a text version of the loop equations for the linkage. These loop equations are solved using the Dixon determinant to find the configuration of the linkage for each value of the driving link angle. This formulation also yields the Jacobian of the loop equations, and factors its determinant which is used to find the singularities of the linkage. The contribution of this research is an automated analysis of eight-bar linkages that applies to four-bar and six-bar linkages, and has been useful in the analysis of 10 -bar linkages. This approach has provided a new classification of the 153 eight-bar linkages by family, link assortment, topology, mechanism, and linkage. The automation process can formulate the loop equations and Jacobian conditions for all 153 cases, as well as for all four-bar and six-bar cases. Automated configuration analysis for eight-bar linkages provides an important tool for evaluating the range of movement of linkages obtained in mechanism synthesis algorithms, allowing identification of linkages that achieve a required task...|$|R
40|$|Background: Designing an {{appropriate}} data system {{is important to}} the success of a clinical study. However, little information is available on this topic. We share our experiences on designing, developing, and implementation of a data system for management of data and field activities of a complex clinical study. Methods: The data system was implemented aiming at determining the biological basis for the underperformance of oral vaccines, such as polio and rotavirus vaccines in children at a site in Kolkata, India. The system included several functionalities to control data and field activities. It was restricted to authorized users based on their access privileges. A relational database platform was chosen, and Microsoft Visual FoxPro 7. 0 (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) was used to develop the system. The system was installed at the clinic and data office to facilitate both the field and data management activities. Results: Data were doubly entered by two different data operators to identify keypunching errors in the data. Outli-ers, duplication, inconsistencies, missing entries, and <b>linkage</b> were also <b>checked.</b> Every modification and users log-in/ log-out information was auto-recorded in an audit trail. The system offered tools for preparation of visit schedule of the participants. A visit considered as protocol deviation was documented by the system.

40|$|With the {{availability}} of fast genotyping methods and genomic databases, the search for statistical association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with a complex trait has become an important methodology in medical genetics. However, even fairly rare errors occurring during the genotyping process can lead to spurious association results and decrease in statistical power. We develop a systematic approach to study how genotyping errors change the genotype distribution in a sample. The general M-marker case is reduced {{to that of a}} single-marker locus by recognizing the underlying tensor-product structure of the error matrix. Both method and general conclusions apply to the general error model; we give detailed results for allele-based errors of size depending both on the marker locus and the allele present. Multiple errors are treated in terms of the associated diffusion process on the space of genotype distributions. We find that certain genotype and haplotype distributions remain unchanged under genotyping errors, and that genotyping errors generally render the distribution more similar to the stable one. In case–control association studies, this will lead to loss of statistical power for nondifferential genotyping errors and increase in type I error for differential genotyping errors. Moreover, we show that allele-based genotyping errors do not disturb Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the genotype distribution. In this setting we also identify maximally affected distributions. As they correspond to situations with rare alleles and marker loci in high <b>linkage</b> disequilibrium, careful <b>checking</b> for genotyping errors is advisable when significant association based on such alleles/haplotypes is observed in association studies...|$|R
