40|$|Wavelength routed optical {{networks}} {{have emerged as}} a technology that can effectively utilize the enormous bandwidth of the optical fiber. Wavelength converters {{play an important role}} in enhancing the fiber utilization and reducing the overall call blocking probability of the network. As the distortion of the optical signal increases with the increase in the range of wavelength conversion in optical wavelength converters, limited range wavelength conversion assumes importance. Placement of wavelength converters is a NP complete problem [K. C. Lee, V. O. K. Li, IEEE J. Lightwave Technol. 11 (1993) 962 - 970] in an arbitrary mesh network. In this paper, we investigate heuristics for placing limited range wavelength converters in arbitrary mesh wavelength routed optical networks. The objective is to achieve near optimal placement of limited range wavelength converters resulting in reduced blocking probabilities and low distortion of the optical signal. The proposed heuristic is to place limited range wavelength converters at the most congested nodes, nodes which lie on the long lightpaths and nodes where conversion of optical signals is significantly high. We observe that limited range converters at few nodes can provide almost the entire improvement in the blocking probability as the full range wavelength converters placed at all the nodes. Congestion control in the network is brought about by dynamically adjusting the weights of the channels in the link thereby balancing the load and reducing the average delay of the traffic in the entire network.

40|$|Local area {{networks}} (LANs) nowadays use {{optical fiber}} as {{the medium of}} communication. This fiber is used to connect a collection of electro-optic nodes which form network clouds. A network cloud is a distribution network that connects several external nodes to the backbone, and often {{takes the form of}} a star or tree. Optical stars and trees have expensive and inefficient recovery schemes, and as a result, are not attractive options when designing networks. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a virtual topology that makes use of the robustness that is inherently present in a metropolitan area network (MAN) or wide area network (WAN) (<b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>network).</b> The virtual topology uses a folded bus scheme and includes some of the elements of the real topology (architecture). By optically bypassing some of the router/switch nodes in the physical architecture, the virtual topology yields better recovery performance and more efficient systems (with respect to cost related to bandwidth and recoverability). We present a bus overlay which uses simple access nodes and is robust to single failures. Our architecture allows the use of existing optical backbone infrastructure. We consider a linear folded bus architecture and introduce a T-shaped folded bus. Although buses are generally not able to recover from failures, we propose a loopback approach. Our approach allows optical bypass of some routers during normal operation, thus reducing the load on routers, but makes use of routers in case of failures. We analyze the behavior of our linear and T-shaped systems under average use and failure conditions. We show that certain simple characteristics of the traffic matrix give meaningful performance characterization.

40|$|As {{data rates}} in {{broadband}} optical networks continue to grow, all optical signal processing technologies {{are expected to}} become important for future high bit-rate communication systems to address the growing demand for network flexibility, low cost and high bandwidth. Along {{the line of the}} capacity increased, many new modulation formats have been introduced. The most straightforward format is on-off-keying (OOK) modulation format. The state of art reveals that the differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) modulation format is the best candidate for high-speed <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> <b>network</b> segment, while OOK is suitable for short reach network segment. However, the next generation transmission systems will more likely employ mixed modulation formats. Thus, the shift towards these changes to be applied in many applications is necessary. Hence, it is worth investigating several signal processing, not only by using a single modulation format but also mixed modulation formats. In order to realize such systems, the scheme requirement must be transparent to modulation format and bit-rate. One of the promising candidates is based on the third-order nonlinear susceptibility x(3) in a nonlinear fiber, which is also called four-wave mixing (FWM). Fiber-based FWM, in a highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) is a preferable choice due to its fast nonlinear response and high conversion efficiency. FWM technique can be also be used as an all-optical AND logic gates and signal regenerator. In optical fiber communication systems, signal distortions due to chromatic dispersion in fiber dominantly limit transmission length and bit-rate. An improvement in the distorted signal is crucially needed, as the processed signal will become more degraded after some distance of transmission. Optical phase conjugation (OPC) and tunable dispersion compensation modulator (TDCM) are two attractive schemes used to increase the signal robustness in transmission systems. It is also desirable if a practical function such as flexible picosecond width-tunability can be accomplished. The advantageous of flexible converted pulse width are for the creation of higher bit-rate signals and the ability to support wider bandwidth requirements. In this thesis, the experimental demonstration using compressed RZ clock from Raman adiabatic-soliton compressor (RASC) and continuous wave (CW) signal as a pump signals in all-optical fiber-based FWM AND-gate using singleand mixed OOK-DPSK modulation formats in many applications can be realised. The applications including: all-optical nonreturn-to-zero(NRZ) -to-return-to-zero(RZ) wavelength-waveform conversions, all optical wave-length multicasting, all channel OTDM demultiplexing, and transmission performance between the midspan of OPC and TDCM. We experimentally demonstrated an all-optical NRZ-DPSK-to-RZ-DPSK waveform-wavelength conversion with flexible picosecond width-tunability and signal regeneration with reshaping functionality. The scheme is based on a RASC and a fiber-based AND-gate. In the first demonstration, we demonstrate waveform-wavelength conversion of a 10 -Gb/s DPSK signal without input signal degradation over wide input-output wavelength ranges. The measurement results of the converted RZ-DPSK signal are pedestal-free, and its converted pulse width can be adjusted by tuning the Raman pump power in RASC. Further investigation of the regenerative properties due to chromatic dispersion is conducted at several Raman pump power settings over 40 -km standard single-mode fibers (SSMFs) without dispersion compensation. Also, low power penalty with an error-free operation is obtained for the RZ-DPSK regenerated converted signal. Next, an all-optical 1 -to- 6 wavelength multicasting of a 10 -Gb/s picosecond-tunable-width converted OOK data signal using a parametric pulse source from a RASC is experimentally demonstrated. Width-tunable wavelength multicasting within the C-band with approximately 40. 6 -nm of separation with various compressed RZ data signal inputs has been proposed and demonstrated. The converted multicast pulse widths can be flexibly controlled down by tuning the Raman pump powers of the RASC. Nearly equal pulse widths at all multicast wavelengths are obtained. Furthermore, wide open eye patterns and low power penalties at the 10 ?? 9 BER level are found. An all-optical demultiplexing of 40 -Gb/s hybrid OTDM mixed format channels by using RASC-flexible control-window is also demonstrated. Error-free operations with less than 1. 3 -dB power penalties were obtained and this scheme is expected to be scalable toward higher bit-rates. Further demonstration related to NRZ-to-RZ waveform-wavelength conversion for 4 x 10 -Gb/s multichannel mixed OOK-DPSK data formats, deploying a single FWM and RASC has been done. The fiber-based switch in HNLF based on parametric process between mixed data signals and the compressed RZ clock from RASC. By flexibly tuning the Raman pump power from RASC in between 0. 20 and 0. 90 W, high quality converted signal can be achieved. Bit-error-rate measurements show negative power penalties for the obtained RZ signals with pedestal-free pulses. Finally, we demonstrated the transmission performance between the midspan of TDCM and OPC schemes with specialty using multichannel-mixed OOK and DPSK format. The OPC scheme has the advantage over the penalties performance compared to TDCM scheme. 電気通信大学 201...|$|E

In this paper we propose the dynamic bandwidth assignment algorithm, which has the two mode of with and without reservation. In this algorithm, we investigate the prioritization scheme for aggregating packets into optical burst at the edge node in regional networks. And we evaluate the network performance by the prioritization scheme compared with no priority...|$|R
5000|$|Eddington {{attributed}} {{this loss}} to Gatwick's failure to attract sufficient high-yield traffic. He furthermore stated that Gatwick's loss was entirely {{accounted for by}} its mainline short haul operation whose schedules were primarily designed to feed BA's <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> services at the airport. Eddington was {{of the opinion that}} this was the wrong way around because there were not enough early morning departures and late-evening arrivals that could have attracted a greater number of locally based business and leisure passengers requiring same-day-return facilities. Also, the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> route <b>network</b> BA operated from Gatwick at the time strangely resembled the <b>long</b> <b>haul</b> route structure British Caledonian had inherited from British United {{at the time of its}} inception three decades earlier. Moreover, in his opinion, the physical constraints imposed on BA's Gatwick operation by the airport's single runway and two terminals meant that the airline could not offer truly competitive schedules, in terms of frequencies and conveniently timed connections. In addition, Eddington also felt that Gatwick's operation was far too fragmented, in terms of what he called the airport's [...] "bewildering array" [...] of operators and their equipment, which substantially increased costs. At the time, in addition to BA's mainline operation, which accounted for the bulk of the airline's scheduled services at Gatwick, all of its UK-based franchisees (with the exception of British Mediterranean and Loganair) as well as the company's subsidiaries and partners provided scheduled services at the airport as well, in some cases with a single aircraft on one route only, operating all aircraft types in their combined inventory except Concorde and some of the smaller commuter planes.|$|R
