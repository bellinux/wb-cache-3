The leading bit in the byte (also the leading bit in the first nibble) is flipped to make 00000111, which is 0x07, as shown in the <b>lower</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{makeshift}} {{to achieve}} real-time requirement in multidimensional DSP applications {{is to use}} a <b>lower</b> <b>sampling</b> rate, which can efficiently reduce the number of samples to be processed at one time and thereby decrease the total processing time. However, this can lead to the aliasing problem due to the sampling theorem and poor-quality outputs. In some applications, such as military radars and medical images, we are eager to have highly precise and accurate results. In such cases, using a <b>lower</b> <b>sampling</b> rate {{to reduce the amount of}} computation in the multidimensional DSP domain is not always allowable.|$|R

50|$|The {{software}} generally {{goes through}} a two-step process to accomplish this. First, the audio file is played back at a <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> rate {{than that of the}} original file. This has the same effect as playing a tape or vinyl record at slower speed - the pitch is lowered meaning the music can sound like it is in a different key. The second step is to use Digital Signal Processing (or DSP) to shift the pitch back up to the original pitch level or musical key.|$|E

5000|$|When undersampling a {{real-world}} signal, the sampling circuit must be {{fast enough to}} capture the highest signal frequency of interest. Theoretically, each sample should be taken during an infinitesimally short interval, {{but this is not}} practically feasible. Instead, the sampling of the signal should be made in a short enough interval that it can represent the instantaneous value of the signal with the highest frequency. This means that in the FM radio example above, the sampling circuit must be able to capture a signal with a frequency of 108 MHz, not 43.2 MHz. Thus, the sampling frequency may be only a little bit greater than 43.2 MHz, but the input bandwidth of the system must be at least 108 MHz. Similarly, the accuracy of the sampling timing, or [...] aperture uncertainty of the sampler, frequently the analog-to-digital converter, must be appropriate for the frequencies being sampled 108MHz, not the <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> rate.|$|E
40|$|The {{compressive}} sensing (CS) framework aims to {{ease the}} burden on analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) by exploiting inherent structure in natural and man-made signals. It has been demon-strated that structured signals can be acquired with just {{a small number of}} linear measurements, on the order of the signal complexity. In practice, this enables <b>lower</b> <b>sampling</b> rates that can be more easily achieved by current hardware designs. The primary bottleneck that limits ADC sam-pling rates is quantization, i. e., higher bit-depths impose <b>lower</b> <b>sampling</b> rates. Thus, the decreased sampling rates of CS ADCs accommodate the otherwise limiting quantizer of conventional ADCs. In this thesis, we consider a different approach to CS ADC by shifting towards lower quantizer bit-depths rather than <b>lower</b> <b>sampling</b> rates. We explore the extreme case where each measurement is quantized to just one bit, representing its sign. We develop a new theoretical framework to analyze this extreme case and develop new algorithms for signal reconstruction from such coarsely quantized measurements. The 1 -bit CS framework leads us to scenarios where it may be more appropriate to reduce bit-depth instead of sampling rate. We find that there exist two distinct regimes of operation that correspond to high/low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the measuremen...|$|R

30|$|The {{profile of}} the water {{concentration}} (Fig.  11) {{is similar to that}} of the zoisite distribution (Fig.  7). IR spectra from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> boundaries show that water is dominantly trapped within the zoisite (Fig.  9). Assuming a 2.0  wt% H 2 O stoichiometric amount of water in a zoisite crystal structure (e.g., Hurlbut 1969), the representative zoisite area fractions of 18.3 % (maximum at 25  μm from the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> boundaries), 12.6 % (50  μm), 3.5 % (75  μm), and 0.9 % (200  μm) shown in Fig.  7 can be converted into 3700, 2520, 700, and 180  ppm H 2 O, respectively. These converted water contents roughly correspond to the values measured via IR spectroscopy (1500  ppm at the maximum at the sample boundary; Fig.  9). However, fine zoisite grains also develop along the anorthite grain boundaries (Fig.  6 c). The quantity of these fine grains would also be high along the sample boundaries, and water would also be trapped in these grains.|$|E
40|$|Measuring intraday {{volatility}} {{is one of}} {{the more}} difficult tasks facing financial researchers and practitioners. There are a number of efficient methods of estimating volatility. However, the efficiency of volatility estimators decreases as the kurtosis of the return distribution increases, and intraday data are widely known to have thick tails. This paper introduces new methods of estimating historic volatility using the trading range. These estimators differ from existing range-based estimation techniques in two ways. First, these estimators are derived under the binomial model. Prior research has assumed a diffusion process. Because of minimum tick sizes, intraday data may be better modeled by the binomial model. Second, existing estimators are derived from the second sample moment of observed ranges or returns. The estimators introduced here rely on <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> moments. Using <b>lower</b> <b>sample</b> moments mitigates the problem cause by thick tails in the return distribution, resulting in more efficient estimates.

40|$|Northern peatlands store {{approximately}} {{one-third of}} the World’s soil carbon through the long-term accumulation of carbon as peat. However, when peatlands are exploited for Sphagnum moss and horticultural peat, they become degraded and large, persistent sources of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Recent advances in peatland restoration techniques have succeeded in the re-vegetation of Sphagnum moss on previously cutover surfaces. The long-term success of peatland restoration depends {{on the development of}} a sufficiently thick new peat layer that has ecohydrological and hydrophysical properties similar to natural peatlands. We determined these properties for an upper (0 – 4 cm) and lower (8 – 12 cm) peat layer in a recently restored peatland, a naturally re-vegetated cutover peatland, and a natural peatland in eastern Québec. The properties of the new peat layer differed significantly between the sites, especially for the <b>lower</b> layer <b>samples.</b> <b>Lower</b> <b>samples</b> for the natural and naturally re-vegetated sites had a bulk density of 43 š 5 and 41 š 11 kg m 3, respectively, almost twice as high as the value for <b>lower</b> <b>samples</b> from the restored site (24 š 4 kg m 3).
