The results of this baseline research indicated that livers generally concentrated {{trace elements}} {{to a greater extent}} than muscles. Nevertheless, the overall trace element concentrations in both tissues were barely above the levels reported in fish and thus contamination at the local scale was poorly discriminated. Although these levels were low, preliminary risk assessment from a global health standpoints suggest that As could potentially lead to concern for fish consumers. Based on the trace element concentrations in livers and the fish trophic preferences, some tendencies have been observed among trophic groups: Ag, Cu, Fe, Hg, and Zn concentrations were generally higher in liver of fish with the highest trophic position whereas Cd concentrations were lower in these groups. The use of the <b>leopard</b> coral <b>grouper</b> Plectropomus leopardus as a resident top predator allowed determining the geographical variations in contamination levels with significant differences in six out of the fourteen elements investigated. The sampling sites influenced by anthropogenic inputs were revealed by high Ag, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb concentrations.

40|$|<b>Leopard</b> coral <b>grouper,</b> Plectropomus leopardus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important finfish fish in Indonesia and the demand for the grouper is rapidly increasing in Asia and the Pacific. Grouper exports from Bali were 1, 613 mt in 2001, 2, 082 mt in 2002 and 2, 861 mt in 2003. Understanding the reproductive biology of fishes is an important component in developing mariculture and in the management of capture fisheries. This study reports on the reproductive biology of 86 coral groupers collected from various locations in Indonesia. The length and weight of these fish were recorded and related to gonad development. There was a strong relationship between length and weight; weight being proportional to the length raised to the power (b value) 3. 2. As the value of b was greater than 3, this suggests that growth is allometric. Histological analysis 73 % of the fish were immature, 19 % were in transition from females to males, only 4 % were male, and only 2 fish (2 %) had mature gonads: these were female. The sex of 2 fish could not be determined. From these data it can be seen that the leopard coralgrouper has asynchronous gonad development. The two fish that were mature contained 343, 980 and 429, 259 oocytes and three distinct sizes of oocytes could be found. This suggests that the grouper is a multiple spawner.

40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to reduce body sizes of ectothermic animals. Although the underlying mechanisms of size reductions remain poorly understood, effects appear stronger at latitudinal extremes (poles and tropics) and in aquatic rather than terrestrial systems. To shed light on this phenomenon, we examined the size dependence of critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and aerobic metabolism in a commercially important tropical reef fish, the <b>leopard</b> coral <b>grouper</b> (Plectropomus leopardus) following acclimation to current-day (28. 5  °C) vs. projected end-of-century (33  °C) summer temperatures for the northern Great Barrier Reef (GBR). CTmax declined from 38. 3 to 37. 5  °C with increasing body mass in adult fish (0. 45 - 2. 82  kg), indicating that larger individuals are more thermally sensitive than smaller conspecifics. This {{may be explained by}} a restricted capacity for large fish to increase mass-specific maximum metabolic rate (MMR) at 33  °C compared with 28. 5  °C. Indeed, temperature influenced the relationship between metabolism and body mass (0. 02 - 2. 38  kg), whereby the scaling exponent for MMR increased from 0. 74  ±  0. 02 at 28. 5  °C to 0. 79  ±  0. 01 at 33  °C, and the corresponding exponents for standard metabolic rate (SMR) were 0. 75  ±  0. 04 and 0. 80  ±  0. 03. The increase in metabolic scaling exponents at higher temperatures suggests that energy budgets may be disproportionately impacted in larger fish and contribute to reduced maximum adult size. Such climate-induced reductions in body size would have important ramifications for fisheries productivity, but are also likely to have knock-on effects for trophodynamics and functioning of ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The diet of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae, Lacepede 1802) was {{examined}} on {{two pairs of}} reefs in the Cairns Section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia. For both pairs, one reef was open to fishing and the other had been closed to fishing for eight years; however zoning appeared to be ineffective as {{there was no difference}} in the size structure of <b>leopard</b> coral <b>grouper</b> populations on either open or closed reefs. Two fishing methods were used to sample reefs concurrently, and the size structure and diet of P. leopardus that were speared randomly (n= 587) were compared to samples caught by line (n= 85). Adult P. leopardus were highly piscivorous (96 % of prey was fish by number), and two families of fishes, Pomacentridae and Labridae, composed approximately half of their diet (index of relative importance= 48. 4 %). Numerical composition of fish in the diet varied significantly among reefs, but there were no patterns related to reef closures when fish prey were classified by taxa or by their habitat. Fishes categorized as living in the demersal reef habitat were the dominant prey consumed, followed by midwater fishes. When the data from reefs were pooled, the abundance of families in the diet differed between locations (north and south) but not between fishing zones. Dietary overlap was high between the different fishing zones and was very high in relation to naturally occurring spatial and temporal variability in the diet of P. leopardus found in other studies. With line fishing larger and hungry fish are caught, and the few data on natural prey suggest tentatively that line catches are biased toward P. leopardus feeding on pelagic fishes. The coral reefs and surrounding waters provide the major food source of P. leopardus, whereas sandy areas are much less important. Our data suggest that the coral trout fishery is resilient to changes in abundances of particular prey species because the diet of P. leopardus is broad and because the two major prey families are diverse and abundant on coral reefs...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a lengthy debate on whether the {{abundance}} of adult reef fishes depends on prerecruitment or postrecruitment processes; however, {{we still do not}} have the ability to predict the magnitude of local fish recruitment. Here we show that the success of the <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> (Myeteroperea rosacea) recruitment in the Gulf of California, Mexico, is determined by the availability of nursery habitat, which in turn is strongly correlated to climate conditions. Observational and experimental studies showed that <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> larvae recruit preferentially on shallow rocky bottoms with brown algal (Sargassum spp.) beds, and that abundance of recruits is determined by the availability of Sargassum. The biomass of Sargassum decreases linearly with an increase in the Multivariate El Niflo Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index (MEI; an index positively correlated with water temperature and negatively correlated with nutrient availability). We analyzed the relationship between the interannual variation of MEI and the recruitment of the <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> using field estimates of abundance of juvenile groupers.

Mitochondrial and nuclear markers were analyzed to investigate potential mechanisms impacting connectivity among and the demographic history of subpopulations of a commercially important species in the Gulf of California, the <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca rosacea). Demographic history and connectivity analyses included a coalescent analysis, estimating neutrality indices, estimating global and pairwise F’ST, ΦST, or G’’ST, and a priori methodologies to identify genetically distinct units and barriers to dispersal. Average, long-term connectivity between geographic regions in the Gulf was also estimated. Divergence of mitochondrial lineages of <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> dated to the late Pleistocene, with deep-water islands serving as demographically stable populations that may have acted as sources for new populations during periods of climate variability. Additionally, we observed genetically distinct units of <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> in the Gulf, particularly between peninsular and mainland sites, as well as asymmetrical migration between the northern and central Gulf. Observed patterns of genetic differentiation are likely attributed to complex asymmetrical oceanographic currents and local larval retention. Based on our genetic findings and current fishing pressure in certain regions, we recommend implementing small, upstream no-take zones in the areas east of Isla Ángel de la Guarda, around Isla San Lorenzo and Isla San Esteban, and north of Isla Tiburón, that would enhance connectivity among subpopulations, preserve sites with high genetic diversity, and benefit fisheries downstream of these sites...|$|E

40|$|The {{management}} of marine resources is often impeded {{by a lack}} of models to integrate ecological and economic information on exploited populations. We used available biological and economic data for an overexploited population of the <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca rosacea) to study if closing parts of the population to fishing would allow sustainable use and maximum economic benefits. Our results suggest that fishing should be closed in all spawning areas and in at least 50 % of the adjacent areas. High non-consumptive benefits would be achieved with large closures because the abundance of the leopard groupers, which is an important attribute for SCUBA divers, would increase. In a no-take reserve, the welfare gains of divers seemingly could compensate for losses incurred by fishers if parts of their fishing grounds are closed. An adaptive management scheme could provide a way to incorporate newly available information into management decisions for the no-take reserve.

40|$|Este artículo contiene 5 páginas, 2 figuras. Interannual and interdecadal {{variability}} of the recruitment and spawning stock biomass of fish {{has been observed}} for many pelagic commercial species. For reef fish, climate variability has been considered only as a pre-recruitment factor that has stochastic impacts on the survival of eggs and larvae during their pelagic stage.

40|$|Growth of the <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper,</b> Mycteroperca rosacea (Streets, 1877), was {{analyzed}} {{in its natural}} habitat. Age determination {{was based on the}} reading of otoliths, and the method was validated under three main criteria: (1) proportionality, (2) seasonality, and (3) concordance with another method. Otolith growth is proportional to organism growth, with a slight degree of allometry, and the otolith registers the growth of the individual, even at advanced ages. The opaque growth zone in the otolith is deposited once a year, between July and October. Thus, taken together, one opaque and one hyaline mark represent an annual cycle. Back-calculated lengths-at-age agreed reasonably well with observed lengths-at-age at the time of capture, considering that back-calculated lengths represent an exact age (birthday), and observed lengths are taken at an intermediate age between birthdays. Fish length and otolith age data were fitted to the von Bertalanffy growth function by two methods: (1) linear regression (Ford-Walford and Beverton), using transformed data, and (2) nonlinear regression, by iteration. Although the nonlinear regression gave a fit with unbiased error, parameters resulting from linear regressions had a better biological meaning for the species.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in systematic establishment of marine protected area (MPA) networks and representative conservation sites. This movement toward networks of no-take zones requires that reserves are deliberately and adequately spaced for connectivity. Here, we test the network functionality of an ecoregional assessment configuration of marine conservation areas by evaluating the habitat protection and connectivity offered to wide-ranging fauna in the Gulf of California (GOC, Mexico). We first use expert opinion to identify representative species of wide-ranging fauna of the GOC. These include <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper,</b> hammerhead sharks, California brown pelicans and green sea turtles. Analyzing habitat models with both structural and functional connectivity indexes, our {{results indicate that the}} configuration includes large proportions of biologically important habitat for the four species considered (25 – 40 %), particularly, the best quality habitats (46 – 57 %). Our results also show that connectivity levels offered by the conservation area design for these four species may be similar to connectivity levels offered by the entire Gulf of California, thus indicating that connectivity offered by the areas may resemble natural connectivity. The selected focal species comprise different life histories among marine or marinerelated vertebrates and are associated with those habitats holding the most biodiversity values (i. e. coastal habitats); our results thus suggest that the proposed configuration may function as a network for connectivity and may adequately represent the marine megafauna in the GOC, including the potential connectivity among habitat patches.

40|$|Overfishing is {{contributing}} to significant declines in marine species worldwide. Here, I evaluated {{the contribution of}} genetic data to enhancing conservation and fisheries management of commercially important fishes. First, I conducted two empirical population genetics studies on groupers that aggregate to spawn. I evaluated population structure of Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) across the Caribbean Sea using mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results suggested ocean currents and long distance migrations of adults to spawning sites may contribute to restricted gene flow and regional genetic differentiation among subpopulations, making it less likely that larvae settle beyond catchment areas of spawning sites. Regional patterns of genetic differentiation warrant international collaboration, standardizing fisheries management and conservation initiatives among countries within genetically isolated clusters. I then evaluated population structure of <b>Leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> (Mycteroperca rosacea) in the Gulf of California using mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites. I observed genetic differentiation and asymmetrical connectivity among subpopulations of M. rosacea, with divergence of lineages dating to the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Findings suggest a combination of marine reserves, catch quotas, and seasonal fishery closures as a potential management strategy for M. rosacea in the Gulf of California. Finally, I conducted a meta-analysis of 386 empirical genetics studies on marine and diadromous fishes in order to evaluate the implications of weak or strong population structure on the implementation of fisheries management. Quantitative adjectives used to describe varying magnitudes of genetic differentiation possessed statistically different mean F ST values in studies utilizing mtDNA, microsatellites and allozymes. Additionally, mean F ST values across stock management strategies were statistically different from one another.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} services that coastal habitats supply is the provision of seafood that feeds people and supports local fishing economies. Despite this importance, there has been little analysis of the ecological processes that contribute to the local economies, and the impact that human activities have on these processes. The objective of this thesis is to study the relationship between coastal habitats and the dynamics of commercial reef fishes in the Gulf of California, and estimate the value of the services these habitats provide for fisheries. In the first section I will describe the interconnections between the life history of yellow snappers and leopard groupers, and their major nursery habitats (mangrove forests and Sargassum beds, respectively). In the second section, beyond recruitment, I will explore whether all mangrove patches contribute equally to maintaining adult fish populations. I will study the relationship between juvenile snapper abundance and the amount of suitable mangrove nursery area, and estimate the contribution of mangrove patches of different sizes to the replenishment of fish populations. The last section includes fishery statistics for both species, and an economic valuation of mangrove ecosystems for the entire Gulf of California. I will analyze yellow snapper and <b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> abundance and fishery data, to determine whether it is possible to predict fish recruitment and landings based on available a priori climate indices. In the final part of this thesis I will test the hypothesis that the amount of mangrove forests has a direct bearing on the production of many commercially important fisheries. The results of this thesis show that the life history characteristics of two {{of the most}} important commercial reef fish species in the Gulf of California are affected by the impact of climate variability on their nurseries. I determined that the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) explained the abundance of juveniles and fisheries landings for both species; increasing recruitment translated into greater fisheries landings once individuals recruited into fishing stocks. I also showed that standard underwater visual surveys combined with traditional fisheries statistics could provide a model to predict fluctuations in abundance over time, and could be used to adapt artisanal fisheries management ahead of time, regulating effort or setting quotas based on expected climate-mediated recruitment of fish into adult populations...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of larval dispersal is key {{in determining whether}} no-take marine reserves are self-sustaining, what will be protected inside reserves and where the benefits of reserves will be observed. We followed a multidisciplinary approach that merged detailed descriptions of fishing zones and spawning time at 17 sites distributed in the Midriff Island region of the Gulf of California with a biophysical oceanographic model that simulated larval transport at Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD) 14, 21 and 28 days for {{the most common and}} targeted predatory reef fish, (<b>leopard</b> <b>grouper</b> Mycteroperca rosacea). We tested the hypothesis that source–sink larval metapopulation dynamics describing the direction and frequency of larval dispersal according to an oceanographic model can help to explain empirical genetic data. We described modeled metapopulation dynamics using graph theory and employed empirical sequence data from a subset of 11 sites at two mitochondrial genes to verify the model predictions based on {{patterns of}} genetic diversity within sites and genetic structure between sites. We employed a population graph describing a network of genetic relationships among sites and contrasted it against modeled networks. While our results failed to explain genetic diversity within sites, they confirmed that ocean models summarized via graph and adjacency distances over modeled networks can explain seemingly chaotic patterns of genetic structure between sites. Empirical and modeled networks showed significant similarities in the clustering coefficients of each site and adjacency matrices between sites. Most of the connectivity patterns observed towards downstream sites (Sonora coast) were strictly asymmetric, while those between upstream sites (Baja and the Midriffs) were symmetric. The best-supported gene flow model and analyses of modularity of the modeled networks confirmed a pulse of larvae from the Baja Peninsula, across the Midriff Island region and towards the Sonoran coastline that acts like a larval sink, in agreement with the cyclonic gyre (anti-clockwise) present at the peak of spawning (May–June). Our approach provided a mechanistic explanation of the location of fishing zones: most of the largest areas where fishing takes place seem to be sustained simultaneously by high levels of local retention, contribution of larvae from upstream sites and oceanographic patterns that concentrate larval density from all over the region. The general asymmetry in marine connectivity observed highlights that benefits from reserves are biased towards particular directions, that no-take areas need to be located upstream of targeted fishing zones, and that some fishing localities might not directly benefit from avoiding fishing within reserves located adjacent to their communities. We discuss the implications of marine connectivity for the current network of marine protected areas and no-take zones, and identify ways of improving it...|$|E
