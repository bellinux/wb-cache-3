40|$|The pupil {{diameter}} is {{a widely}} studied cognitive load measure, which, despite its convenience for non-intrusive operator state monitoring in complex environments, is still not available for in situ measurements because of numerous methodological limitations. The {{most important of these}} limitations is the influence of the pupillary light reflex. Hence, there is the need of providing a pupil-based cognitive load measure independent of light conditions. In this paper, we present a promising technique of pupillary signal analysis resulting in luminance-independent measure of mental effort {{that could be used in}} real-time without a priori on luminous conditions. Twenty two participants performed a short-term memory task under different screen luminance conditions. Our results showed that the amplitude of pupil dilation due to load on memory is luminance-dependent with higher amplitude corresponding to low-luminance condition. Furthermore, our experimentation showed that the load on memory and <b>luminance</b> <b>factors</b> express themselves differently according to frequency. Therefore, as our statistical analysis revealed, the ratio between low (0 – 1. 6 Hz) and high frequency (1. 6 – 4 Hz) bands (LF/HF ratio) of power spectral densities of pupillary signal is sensitive to the cognitive load but not to luminance. This result is promising for the measurements of load on memory in ecological settings...|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods to}} {{determine}} the color gamut of any digital camera are shown. Since an input device is additive, its color triangle was obtained from their spectral sensitivities and it was compared with the theoretical sensors of Ives-Abney-Yule and MacAdam. On the other hand, the RGB digital data of the optimal or MacAdam colors were simulated to transform them into XYZ data according to the colorimetric profile of the digital camera. From this, the MacAdam limits associated to the digital camera are compared with the corresponding ones of the CIE- 1931 XYZ standard observer, resulting that our color device has much smaller MacAdam loci {{than those of the}} colorimetric standard observer. Taking this into account, we have estimated the reduction of discernible colors by the digital camera applying a chromatic discrimination model and a packing algorithm to obtain color discrimination ellipses. Calculating the relative decrement of distinguishable colors by the digital camera in comparison with the colorimetric standard observer at different <b>luminance</b> <b>factors</b> of the optimal colors, we have found that the camera distinguishes considerably fewer very dark than very light ones, but relatively much more colors with middle lightness (Y between 40 and 70, or L* between 69. 5 and 87. 0).

In contrast, the ideality factor of the light output approaches unity, demonstrating that luminance is governed by recombination of the bimolecular Langevin type. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by measuring the current and <b>luminance</b> ideality <b>factor</b> for a white-emitting polymer, where both free and trapped charge carriers recombine radiatively.

40|$|Chromatic {{adaptation}} {{has been}} studied by applying methods of direct scaling to color appearances of stimuli perceived under different conditions of adaptation. This study differs from previous work {{in a number of}} ways. The color appearances of surface color stimuli were scaled by both magnitude estimation and magnitude production psychophysical methods. Changes in color appearances resulting from variations in correlated color temperature of adapting illumination, luminance factors of samples, illuininance, and surround induction conditions were scaled by a group of seven observers who had been trained to describe their perceptions in a uniform manner. This factorial approach to chromatic adaptation- influences on color appearance has yielded information about changes throughout a color solid rather than a single planar section of that solid. A distinction was made between absolute and relative attributes of color appearance. valuations of both internal and external consistency indicate that the data generated have relatively high precision and validity. The results indicate that chromatic adaptation induces smooth, continuous changes in color appearance. The nature of these changes depends upon correlated color temperature, <b>luminance</b> <b>factor,</b> and illuminance of surface color stimuli. Saturation, or colorfulness, is most susceptible to change and is highly dependent upon <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> and illuminance in addition to color temperature. These dependencies are systematic and explicit in the results presented here. Hue appearance of a given sample depends primarily upon color temperature of adapting illumination. Little or no change in hue was found for the range of variation in illuminance and <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> included in this study. In general, the hues of' all stimuli change with adaptation but there are important exceptions. The results do not support a linear model for the chromatic adaptation process...|$|E

40|$|Using a spectroradiometric {{model of}} capture for {{a digital camera}} based on the {{mathematical}} description of the empirical opto-electronic conversion spectral functions (OECSF), the capture of MacAdam or optimal spectra with fixed illumination level is simulated. This model of capture allows to change freely the f-number of the zoom-lens and/or the photosite integration time of the electronic shutter of the camera, regardless of the spectral composition of the stimulus. If we follow the procedure employed by MacAdam in 1935 working with the CIE- 1931 XYZ standard observer, these color-stimuli are arranged in decreasing pyramidal form as the <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> increases for any chromaticity diagram (CIE-xy, UCS-u'v' or CIE-L*a*b*). These loci are often called MacAdam limits or Rösch color solid.

This systematic desaturation of the optimal color-stimuli shows that our color device, in raw performance, desaturates in general the real color-stimuli, so this result justifies the additional use in digital photography of color correction algorithms, more or less complex, in order to reach the colorimetric status of color reproduction.

40|$|This study quantifies {{discolouration}} on {{the surface}} of Pinus radiata boards during kiln drying, particularly kiln brown stain (KBS), and models it as a function of chemical compounds present in the wood closest to the surface. The discolouration was investigated with two experimental factors: drying time, which consisted in drying at 70 / 120 ℃ for 0, 8, 16 and 24 hours; and leaching, done at three levels, noleaching, mild and severe, to reduce the soluble compounds present in wood suspected of developing coloured compounds. The colour change was quantified using a reflectance photometer (colour system CIE Yxy, brightness) and by the analysis of digital photographs (colour system CIE Lab). The chemical analysis of the wood closest {{to the surface of the}} boards determined fructose, glucose, sucrose (HPLC), total sugar (sum of fructose, glucose and sucrose), total nitrogen (combustion gas analysis), and phenols discriminated by molecular weight (Folin-Ciocalteu method).

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new color space normalization (CSN) technique for enhancing the discriminating power of color space {{along with the}} principal component analysis (PCA) for the face recognition process. The common RGB technique is not suitable for the characterizing of the skin color due {{to the presence of}} <b>luminance</b> <b>factor.</b> In the YCbCr color space, the luminance information is contained in Y component, and the chrominance information is in Cb and Cr. Therefore, the luminance information can be easily de-embedded. Different color spaces have different discriminating power, in this paper, eye can be perfectly detected by using YcbCr color space and the mouth regions can be perfectly detected by using the YIQ color space. Then PCA is used to express the large 1 -D vector of pixels constructed from 2 -D facial image into the compact principal components of the feature space. Each face image may be represented as a weighted sum (feature vector) of the eigenfaces, which are stored in a 1 D array. PCA allows us to compute a linear transformation that maps data from a high dimensional space to a lower dimensional space. It covers standard deviation, covariance, eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Face recognition is obtained by PCA without much loss of information. Experiments using different databases by varying the facial expressions (open/closed eyes, smiling/not smiling) show that the proposed method by combining color space discrimination and PCA can improve face recognition to a great extend...|$|E

Study of the relevant literature describes the results achieved up until now for the reflective behaviour of these road surfaces. It becomes clear that the majority of studies which have been carried out have concentrated on reflective behaviour caused by stationary road lighting. The relationships of special vehicle geometry with small angles for illumination and observation as well as measuring distances of up to 100 m, have never been considered in detail. It was possible to calculate the dependency of the <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> for illumination and observation angles which are present with the vehicle geometry in laboratory tests. The tests were supplemented with outside measurements. In order to measure the index values, a new kind of luminance measuring system was used which facilitates high resolution measurement of road surface luminance values. To carry out outside measurements easily, a portable reflectometer for road surfaces was developed. A criterion for the designation of reflective behaviour of road surfaces {{under the influence of}} vehicular lighting has been proposed.

40|$|Human face {{recognition}} {{is an important}} area {{in the field of}} biometrics. It has been an active area of research for several decades, but still remains a challenging problem because of the complexity of the human face. In this thesis we describe fully automatic solutions that can locate faces and then perform identification and verification. We present a solution for face localisation using eye locations. We derive an efficient representation for the decision hyperplane of linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For this we introduce the novel concept of ρ and η prototypes. The standard formulation for the decision hyperplane is reformulated and expressed in terms of the two prototypes. Different kernels are treated separately to achieve further classification efficiency and to facilitate its adaptation to operate with the fast Fourier transform to achieve fast eye detection. Using the eye locations, we extract and normalise the face for size and in-plane rotations. Our method produces a more efficient representation of the SVM decision hyperplane than the well-known reduced set methods. As a result, our eye detection subsystem is faster and more accurate. The use of fractals and fractal image coding for object recognition has been proposed and used by others. Fractal codes have been used as features for recognition, but we need {{to take into account the}} distance between codes, and to ensure the continuity of the parameters of the code. We use a method based on fractal image coding for recognition, which we call the Fractal Neighbour Distance (FND). The FND relies on the Euclidean metric and the uniqueness of the attractor of a fractal code. An advantage of using the FND over fractal codes as features is that we do not have to worry about the uniqueness of, and distance between, codes. We only require the uniqueness of the attractor, which is already an implied property of a properly generated fractal code. Similar methods to the FND have been proposed by others, but what distinguishes our work from the rest is that we investigate the FND in greater detail and use our findings to improve the recognition rate. Our investigations reveal that the FND has some inherent invariance to translation, scale, rotation and changes to illumination. These invariances are image dependent and are affected by fractal encoding parameters. The parameters that have the greatest effect on recognition accuracy are the contrast scaling <b>factor,</b> <b>luminance</b> shift <b>factor</b> and the type of range block partitioning. The contrast scaling factor affect the convergence and eventual convergence rate of a fractal decoding process. We propose a novel method of controlling the convergence rate by altering the contrast scaling factor in a controlled manner, which has not been possible before. This helped us improve the recognition rate because under certain conditions better results are achievable from using a slower rate of convergence. We also investigate the effects of varying the <b>luminance</b> shift <b>factor,</b> and examine three different types of range block partitioning schemes. They are Quad-tree, HV and uniform partitioning. We performed experiments using various face datasets, and the results show that our method indeed performs better than many accepted methods such as eigenfaces. The experiments also show that the FND based classifier increases the separation between classes. The standard FND is further improved by incorporating the use of localised weights. A local search algorithm is introduced to find a best matching local feature using this locally weighted FND. The scores from a set of these locally weighted FND operations are then combined to obtain a global score, which is used as a measure of the similarity between two face images. Each local FND operation possesses the distortion invariant properties described above. Combined with the search procedure, the method has the potential to be invariant to a larger class of non-linear distortions. We also present a set of locally weighted FNDs that concentrate around the upper part of the face encompassing the eyes and nose. This design was motivated by the fact that the region around the eyes has more information for discrimination. Better performance is achieved by using different sets of weights for identification and verification. For facial verification, performance is further improved by using normalised scores and client specific thresholding. In this case, our results are competitive with current state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases outperform all those to which they were compared. For facial identification, under some conditions the weighted FND performs better than the standard FND. However, the weighted FND still has its short comings when some datasets are used, where its performance is not much better than the standard FND. To alleviate this problem we introduce a voting scheme that operates with normalised versions of the weighted FND. Although there are no improvements at lower matching ranks using this method, there are significant improvements for larger matching ranks. Our methods offer advantages over some well-accepted approaches such as eigenfaces, neural networks and those that use statistical learning theory. Some of the advantages are: new faces can be enrolled without re-training involving the whole database; faces can be removed from the database without the need for re-training; there are inherent invariances to face distortions; it is relatively simple to implement; and it is not model-based so there are no model parameters that need to be tweaked...|$|R
40|$|Recent reports ofrapid visual {{search for}} some feature conjunctions-suggested that preattentive vision might be {{sensitive}} to scene-based {{as well as to}} image-based features (Enns & Rensink, 1990 a, 1990 b). This study examined visual search for targets defined by the direction of a lu-minance gradient, a conjunction of luminance and relative location that often: corresponds to ob-= ject curvature and direction of lighting in naturalistic scenes. Experiment 1 showed that such search is influenced by several factors, including the type of gradient, the shape of the contour enclosing the gradient, and the background <b>luminance.</b> These <b>factors</b> were variedsystematically in Experiment 2 in a three-dimensionality rating task and in a visual-search task. The factors combined interactively in the rating task, supporting the presence of an emergent property of three-dimensionality. In contrast, each factor contributed only additively to the speed of the visual-search task. This is inconsistent with the view that search is guided by specialized detectors for surface curvature or direction of lighting. Rather, it is in keeping with the view that search is governed by a number of “quick and dirty ” processes that are implemented rapidly and inparal-lel across the visual field. Conventional theories of preattentive vision claim that simple features such as size, orientation, luminance, and motion are registered automatically and in parallel, where-as the serial spotlight of attention is required todetect con-junctions of these features (Beck, Prazdny, & Rosenfeld, 1983; Julesz, 1984; Treisman, 1986). This claim is based on data from visual-search and texture-segmentation tasks: preattentive sensitivity is implicated by visual-search rates that are relatively independent of display size (i. e., less than 10 msec per item) and by textureboundaries that are perceived spontaneously (i. e., within 50 - 100 msec of dis-play onset). Recently, there havebeen several reports of very rapid search andlor texture segmentation based on complex con-junctions of these features.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{calibration}} experiments were run {{in order to}} determine the effect of the colour of suspended sediment on the response of optical backscatter sensors (OBS). Munsell notation describes the properties of soil and sediment colour using the three parameters, hue, chroma, and value, which represent, respectively, the spectral position, lightness level, and amount of pure chromatic colour present. The exposure of the OBS to Munsell Soil Chart patches revealed that the OBS is sensitive to variations in Munsell value and not Munsell hue or chroma. Since OBS output decreased with darkness level (and increased with lightness level and Munsell value), it is suggested that the level of blackness of particles acts to absorb the near-infrared (IR) signal of the OBS, modifying its output. A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 984) was found between the observed and predicted OBS outputs of varying concentrations and ratios of black and white suspended sediment. The OBS output was predicted using a linear mixture-model incorporating end-member calibrations of black and white sediment (similar to Green and Boon [Green, M. O., Boon, J. D., III, 1993. The measurement of constituent concentrations in nonhomogeneous sediment suspensions using optical backscatter sensors. Marine Geology, 110, pp. 73 – 81. ]). A strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 907) was also observed between <b>luminance</b> <b>factor</b> and IR reflectance for various minerals, suggesting a link between Munsell notation and OBS output. Formulae were developed to predict the IR reflectance of sediment of known Munsell value, concentration, and size. Models predicting sediment transport should consider the effect of the level of blackness of particles on the OBS response...|$|E

40|$|In {{each of four}} experiments, complex visual stimuli [...] {{pictures}} and digit arrays [...] were remembered better when shown at high luminance than when shown at low luminance. Why does this occur? Two possibilities were considered: first that lowering luminance reduces the amount of available information in the stimulus, and second that lowering luminance reduces {{the rate at which}} the information is extracted from the stimulus. Evidence was found for both possibilities. When stimuli were presented at durations hort enough to permit only a single eye fixation, luminance affected only the rate at which information is extracted: decreasing <b>luminance</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 100 caused information to be extracted more slowly by a factor that ranged, over experiments, from 1. 4 to 2. 0. When pictures were presented at durations long enough to permit multiple fixations, however, luminance affected the total amount of extractable information. In a fifth ex-periment, converging evidence was sought for the proposition that within the first eye fixation on a picture, luminance affects the rate of information extraction. If this proposition is correct and, in addition, the first eye fixation lasts until some criterion amount of information isextracted, then fixation duration should increase with decreasing luminance...|$|R
40|$|During scene {{perception}} {{our eyes}} generate complex sequences of fixations. Predictors of fixation locations are bottom-up <b>factors</b> like <b>luminance</b> contrast, top-down <b>factors</b> like viewing instruction, and systematic biases like {{the tendency to}} place fixations {{near the center of}} an image. However, comparatively {{little is known about the}} dynamics of scanpaths after experimental manipulation of specific fixation locations. Here we investigate the influence of initial fixation position on subsequent eye-movement behavior on an image. We presented 64 colored photographs to participants who started their scanpaths from one of two experimentally controlled positions in the right or left part of an image. Additionally, we computed the images' saliency maps and classified them as balanced images or images with high saliency values on either the left or right side of a picture. As a result of the starting point manipulation, we found long transients of mean fixation position and a tendency to overshoot to the image side opposite to the starting position. Possible mechanisms for the generation of this overshoot were investigated using numerical simulations of statistical and dynamical models. We conclude that inhibitory tagging is a viable mechanism for dynamical planning of scanpaths. Comment: 34 pages with 10 figures submitted to Vision Research.

40|$|When an edge can be {{perceived}} to continue either with a collinear {{edge of the}} opposite contrast polarity or with a noncollinear edge of the same contrast polarity, observers perceive an alignment between {{the edges of the}} same contrast polarity, even though they are noncollinear. Using several stimulus configurations and both free and tachistoscopic viewing, we studied the <b>luminance</b> and spatial <b>factors</b> affecting the perceived distortion and binding. The results showed that the two noncollinear edges tended to alignwhen they had the same contrast polarity (Experiment 1 A) and to misalignwhen they had opposite contrast polarity (Experiment 2), providing that (1) they were separated by a distance larger than 1 arcmin and smaller than 3 – 4 arcmin (for all configurations) and (2) they laterally overlapped for about 7 arcmin (Experiment 1 B). The results also showed that the direction of apparent distortion depended on the direction of overlapping. The results of Experiment 3 ruled out the local attraction/repulsion explanation but, instead, supported the suggestionthat the interaction concerned the global edges, or part of them, and produced an inward tilt, which made the edges of the same contrast polarity perceptually to align, or an outward tilt, so that the edges of opposite contrast polarity were perceived to be more misaligned. From the overlap and distance limits found, it can be inferred that for two noncollinear contours to join perceptually, the tilt must not exceed 18 º, a limit compatible with the orientation bandwidth of contrast-sensitive early cortical mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Day {{lighting}} {{is a useful}} and effective source of energy savings and visual comforts in buildings. Occupants expect good daylight in their living spaces for better living environment. The {{quality and quantity of}} natural light entering in to a building depend on both internal and external factors. Daylight strategies basically depend on the accessibility of natural light that is determined by the latitude of the building site and the conditions surrounding the building. Daylight provides lighting energy and energy demand reduction during peak utility hours. Bringing daylight into a building that displaces electric lighting and provides sufficient illumination is the greenest way to light a building presently. This research, aims at analyzing the daylight intensity in residential buildings in Cantonment Cottages Multan {{which is one of the}} hottest and progresse city of Pakistan. The intensity of daylight can be expressed in the terms of <b>luminance</b> and daylight <b>factor.</b> In this research, the 5 and 7 marla houses in Cantt Cottages in Multan were selected. The device lux meter was used for measuring intensity with which the brightness appears to the human eye. The readings were taken by placing Lux Meter at the center and near windows in each building component at 2 - 4 pm. Inorderto evaluate the daylight intensity, the measured luminance in each component of building is compared with the standard illuminance as per recommendation of CIBSE (Chartered Institute of Building Service Engineers). After investigation, it has been found that daylight factor is much higher than the standard value...|$|R
