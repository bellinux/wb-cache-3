25|$|The {{average rate}} of {{accretion}} onto Sgr A* is unusually small for a black hole of its mass and is only detectable {{because it is so}} close to Earth. It was thought that the passage of G2 in 2013 might offer astronomers the chance to <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> more about how material accretes onto supermassive black holes. Several astronomical facilities observed this closest approach, with observations confirmed with Chandra, XMM, EVLA, INTEGRAL, Swift, Fermi and requested at VLT and Keck.|$|E

25|$|Sima Qian states Gongsun's {{background}} {{as that of}} a prison officer, who being dismissed, made his living as a farmhand tending pigs. Sima characterizes Gong (like Dong Zhongshu) as specializing in the Spring and Autumn Annals, but with a bent toward the Gongyang Zhuan commentaries as a disciple of Huwu Zidu. However, neither text is referenced in any of Gongsun's documents, and his actions don't seem to reflect the Gongyang. His family being poor, he did not <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> of the Annals until he was forty, and the Shiji considers his ability secondary to that of Dong Zhongshu.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz {{was perhaps}} the first major European {{intellectual}} to take a close interest in Chinese civilization, which he knew by corresponding with, and reading other works by, European Christian missionaries posted in China. Having read Confucius Sinarum Philosophus on {{the first year of}} its publication, he concluded that Europeans could <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> from the Confucian ethical tradition. He mulled over the possibility that the Chinese characters were an unwitting form of his universal characteristic. He noted with fascination how the I Ching hexagrams correspond to the binary numbers from 000000 to 111111, and concluded that this mapping was evidence of major Chinese accomplishments in the sort of philosophical mathematics he admired.|$|E

Reviewing the documentary in The Guardian, Tim Dowling commented; [...] "it was amusing in parts, charming in others and a little gift for Tintinophiles everywhere.

According to Clive Sinclair, purchasers of the ZX81 came from [...] "a reasonably broad spectrum" [...] that ranged from readers of the upmarket Observer and Sunday Times newspapers to the more downmarket but numerous Sun readers. The largest age group was around 30 years old. The Financial Times reported in March 1982 that most Sinclair computers were being bought for educational purposes, both for adults and children, though the children were usually able to <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> more quickly. Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy note that {{the popularity of the}} ZX81 was [...] "subtly different from the run-of-the-mill social fad"; although most enthusiasts were in their teens or early twenties, many were older users – often parents who had become fascinated by the ZX81s that they had bought for their children. However, the ZX81 boom was overwhelmingly male-dominated.|$|E

Jan Harold Brunvand, professor of English at the University of Utah, introduced the term {{to the general public}} in a series of popular books published beginning in 1981.

2500|$|The Potawatomi did not {{traditionally}} {{live in this}} area, instead inhabiting southern Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. In the Treaties of Chicago in 1821 and 1833, {{they exchanged}} most rights to their lands for promises of cash and land west of the Mississippi. Through the 1830s, many moved to reservations in Kansas and Nebraska - some under force. The general aim of the U.S. government at this time was assimilation - to make [...] "good American" [...] farmers and Christians of the Indians. On the reservation their Midewiwin religion was discouraged, {{and many of the}} children were taken to Indian boarding schools, where they couldn't speak their native language or <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> of their parents' culture.|$|E

Batman swiftly subdues the killer, Jocko-Boy Vanzetti and then rescues Dick from the police, damaging both a police cruiser and the car which Vicki and Alfred Pennyworth are in, injuring Vicki in the process. The stern Batman tells Dick that he has been [...] "drafted into a war", and that he will <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> about fighting crime.

2500|$|In 2013, Abigail Thernstrom, {{reviewing}} Sowell's Intellectuals and Race for National Review, wrote [...] "This book is {{a wonderful}} spin-off from Thomas Sowell's magnificent 2009 volume Intellectuals and Society. For those who want a short introduction to Sowell-think, this small {{book is a}} perfect place to start. His main message—amply illustrated—is that, {{on the subject of}} race, intellectuals are useless. Indeed, they don't even ask the right questions. Thus, they're woefully lost when it comes to analyzing America's most important domestic issue: the status of blacks and the state of race relations. Of course his point about lame-brained intellectuals extends far beyond their writings on race. Indeed, his book is a primer on rigorous thinking about social and economic issues in general, here and abroad." [...] Thernstrom, herself a noted scholar of race relations and the Vice Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, concluded, [...] "I didn't think I would <b>learn</b> <b>much</b> from Sowell's wonderful little book, having slogged through the literature on race since I was born—or at least it feels like it's been that long. But I did. Most NR readers will not have been masochistically race-obsessed for years, but this book's tough questions and clear-eyed answers should make them even more disgusted with America's anti-intellectual intelligentsia than they probably already are. Intellectuals and Race is a feast of hard thinking about America's ongoing racial agony." ...|$|E
