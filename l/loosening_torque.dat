40|$|PURPOSE. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the influence of tightening technique and the screw coating on the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> of screws used for Universal Abutment fixation after cyclic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Forty implants (Titamax Ti Cortical, HE, Neodent) (n= 10) were submerged in acrylic resin and four tightening techniques for Universal Abutment fixation were evaluated: A – torque with 32 Ncm (control); B – torque with 32 Ncm holding the torque meter for 20 seconds; C – torque with 32 Ncm and retorque after 10 minutes; D – torque (32 Ncm) holding the torque meter for 20 seconds and retorque after 10 minutes as initially. Samples were divided into subgroups according to the screw used: conventional titanium screw or diamond like carbon-coated (DLC) screw. Metallic crowns were fabricated for each abutment. Samples were submitted to cyclic loading at 106 cycles and 130 N of force. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (5 %). RESULTS. The tightening technique did not show significant influence on the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> of screws (P=. 509). Conventional titanium screws showed significant higher <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> values than DLC (P=. 000). CONCLUSION. The use of conventional titanium screw is more important than the tightening techniques employed in this study to provide long-term stability to Universal Abutment screws. [J Adv Prosthodon...|$|E
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a wrench (spanner) being used in contrast to the straight hex driver for grub screws. The axial compression force (clamp force) applied through either bolt or grub screw would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|E

Methods: Ten mandibular implant-supported dentures were fabricated. Twenty cast models were fabricated using these dentures. Four groups (n= 10) were tested, according to the vertical fit of the dentures [passive and non-passive] and prosthetic screw materials [titanium (Ti) or gold (Au) alloy]. The one-screw test was performed to quantify the vertical misfits using an optic microscope. The <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> for the prosthetic screws was measured 24 hours after the tightening torque (10 Ncm) using a digital torque meter. Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (�= 0. 05). Results: Overall, dentures with passive fit and Ti screws resulted in significantly higher <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> of the prosthetic screws (p< 0. 05). No significant interaction was found between fit level and screw material (p= 0. 199). The prosthetic screw material and fit of implant-supported dentures have an influence on screw joint stability.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to use {{rotational}} tests on commercially available abutment screws to evaluate their potential for preload generation and to follow changes in torque by using newer fixation geometry on the interface of the implant-abutment screw joint. Five identical implant/abutment assemblies were chosen {{from each of the}} following systems: external hex with standard abutment and Replace with TorgTite screw (Nobel Biocare), Camlog universal abutment (Altatec Biotechnologies), DenTi internal hex (Dentimplant Ltd. Szentes, Hungary), straight abutment with internal antirotational element (Uniplant, Sinalisal, Budapest). Wax patterns of the upper premolar were performed and then cast from nickel-chrome alloy and full crown castings were cemented on abutments. In a test machine the magnitude and time of chewing function was predefined by using the desired force pattern. Each specimen was stressed for cycles equivalent to an intaoral load of 5 months or longer timescale. In the static test greater loss in torques was calculated for standard Branemark and Replace screw joints. Assuming that the optimum proportion is the same when we calculate loosening versus tightening torque we obtained a decrease between 0. 70 - 0. 59 for Replace and Branemark abutments and a more moderate loss of between 0. 90 - 0. 84 for the other systems investigated. The ten month equivalent cycling test produced a <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> of 16 - 17 Ncm for Branemark and Replace abutments. Similar decrease in torque was not found for the other three systems.

The turn-of-nut tightening method is applied experimentally to evaluate the pretension and the torque for tightening and loosening of bolts. It is mentioned that a number of 56 bolts has 76 mm length while the rest is of 152 mm. The experimental preloading and the lost torque that overcomes friction are compared with the respective analytical values.

40|$|Locking {{compression}} {{plates are}} {{proven to be}} safe for use in open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The ORIF is a procedure performed to treat fractures. It has various combination of holes, the system provides more options for clinicians to use either locking screw or non-locking screws. This thesis investigates and determines the best construct with special locking and non-locking screws under both axial and torsion loading. Twenty femur constructs were assembled with 2 cm osteotomy gap between femur shaft and condyle, bridged with 4. 5 mm - 10 holes condyle plates. Femurs were divided in to 4 groups according to screw types and where they were placed. All screws were tightened to 4 Nm torque with a torque meter. Axial loads of - 50 N to - 700 N and ± 5 degree rotation were applied for 50, 000 cycles. <b>Loosening</b> <b>torques</b> of screws, stiffness and displacement of constructs were measured. Finite element analysis (FEA) was performed on locking plate and screws based on computed tomography images and Solidworks models. Analytical simulations were run under static and limited dynamic conditions were investigated with the experimental results. Axial load was applied and stresses induced were measured on the simulated models. Locking screw increased the torsional resistance of adjacent non-locking screw. Deformation and torsional stiffness in constructs with two locking screws were higher compared to one locking screw after 50, 000 cycles. Locking screws increased flexibility of the constructs allowing reduction in osteotomy gap. FEA results show plate with locking screws induced lower von Mises stress compared to plate with non locking screws. This study concluded that among hybrid locked plated constructs, constructs with two locking screws provided more stability, flexibility and durability under various loading.

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe main aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of the geometry of screws on torsion tests when they are retained with adhesives. The geometry of different types of screw threads has been studied, measuring theoretical and real length values to determine the stress undergone by the thread when tightened and/or retained by anaerobic adhesives. Three kinds of joints are subjected to a torsion test to determine their <b>loosening</b> <b>torque.</b> According to their torque, joint loosening load as well as generated stress can be calculated. When tightened, the real contact area is observed to be lower than the theoretical area, and real stresses are therefore higher than the theoretical ones. The same can be observed when only adhesive is applied; the real bonded area is lower than the theoretical, while higher real stresses than theoretical are observed. When adhesive and tightening are combined, the stress due to {{the influence of the}} adhesive is calculated, since the strength ratio attributable to either friction or adhesion remains unknown. These can only be determined through the measurement of real thread dimensions. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Practically every {{engineering}} {{product with}} {{any degree of}} complexity uses threaded fasteners. Although threaded fasteners are generally considered a mature technology, significant problems exist with their use. This study has investigated a number of issues with the tightening and self-loosening of threaded fasteners. - It was found that upon repeated tightening of electro-zinc plated fastners significant wear of the contact surfaces of the bolt/nut thread and nut face occured. This wear was accompanied by an increase in the friction coefficient causing a reduction in the clamp force provided for an assembly when tightened to a specific torque value. - The self-loosening characteristics of prevailing torque nuts were also investigated. It was found that there was a significant loss of prevailing torque when a fastner self-loosened when compared to the prevailing torque when being deliberately disassembled. The current standard test for prevailing torque nuts on re-use does not reflect this surprising result and leads to a significant over-estimate of the capability of this class of nut to resist self-loosening. This is a contribution to knowledge on this topic. - A further major original finding of this study has been that if an axial load is also acting on a joint which is experiencing transverse slip, prevailing torque nuts can continue to self-loosen leading to their possible detachment from bolts. A number of accidents have been caused by such detachments, but the cause was not understood partly because this detachment could not be reproduced on the standard loosening test. Work reported in this thesis has been found that if an external axial load is acting whilst the joint is experiencing transverse slip, under the approprioate conditions, the loosening process will continue until nut detachment occurs. - A series of tests has been completed in which the forces needed to tighten and loosen threaded fastners were measured whilst the joint was being subjected to transverse slip/vibration. Measurements were made of the frictional resistance forces in the circumfrential direction and the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> acting on a fastner under transverse slip conditions. It was found that the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> range varied between two positive limits rather than between zero and an upper limit as anticipated by the theory.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism of TIS and effective factors in employing TIS during design and implementation processes using an analytic method. Materials and Methods: Relevant equations were developed to predict tightening and loosening torques, contactpressure and preloads with and without bone tissue in this analysis. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> to the tightening torque. The effects of the change in elastic modulus and thickness of the bone on operation of this mechanism were investigated. Results: In this study, 14 independent parameters such as taper angle, friction coefficient, abutment and implantgeometry that are effective on performance of TIS mechanism were presented. The role of some factors was shown in the performance of ITI implant using sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: It was shown that friction coefficient, contact length, and implant radius play major roles on tightening and loosening torques and efficiency of the mechanism.

Ten mandibular implant-supported dentures were fabricated and then 20 cast models were then prepared using prosthetic structures to create 2 fit levels: passive fit (Pf) and misfit (Mf). Two tightening techniques were also evaluated: initial torque only (T 1); and initial torque and retorque after 10 min (T 2). Gold or titanium screws were used, resulting in 4 groups to each one: Pf/T 1, Pf/T 2, Mf/T 1, Mf/T 2. The Lt was measured 24 h after the tightening torque using digital torque meter. Data were analyzed statistically by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05), separately for each screw material. For titanium screws, no significant difference (p> 0. 05) was found between Pf/T 1 and Pf/T 2, or between Pf/T 2 and Mf/T 2. However, statistically significant difference (p< 0. 05) was found between Pf/T 1 and Mf/T 1, and between Mf/T 1 and Mf/T 2. Mf reduced the Lt using T 1, while and T 2 increased the Lt for Mf. Retorque and fit were shown to have no significant influence on the Lt of the gold screws. Retorque application made insignificant the misfit effect on the Lt of the titanium screws, suggesting that this procedure should be performed routinely during the screw tightening in multi-unit dentures...|$|E
30|$|The occlusal force {{does not}} load {{only on the}} screw. The {{internal}} conical connection interface also helps to transfer and distribute the loading force to the implant [13]. The axial compressive component of occlusal force during oral function causes axial displacement of the abutment to the implant connection, increasing the frictional resistance and screw joint stability of the dental implant [7, 8]. Three factors {{that may lead to}} the axial displacement of the implant-abutment connection are machining tolerance, the wedge effect, and the settling effect. Firstly, machining tolerance is a dimensional variation characteristic of machined components. The precision of every implant component varies during manufacturing due to machining tolerance [14]. Secondly, the wedge effect occurs when tightening torque or loading force is applied to the abutment [15]. The abutment acts as a wedge transferring the axial force directly to the implant. Lastly, the settling effect occurs when rough spots on the contacting surfaces of the connection are flattened under load [16]. It causes the two surfaces to come closer together and leads to axial displacement. This axial displacement causes the length of the abutment screw to shorten, diminishing the screw preload [17]. The settling effect is the main cause of screw loosening. When the abutment is fastened to the implant body with the abutment screw, a settling phenomenon occurs in which the implant body and the abutment are deformed. Even if fastened at 30 [*]N[*]cm, depending on the implant system, the <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> becomes smaller than the 7 to 10 % fastening torque. After 5 [*]min from this point, it is necessary to loosen it twice [18]. The degree of settling depends on the surface roughness, surface hardness, and magnitude of the tightening torque and of the occlusal loading force [16]. On the one hand, the settling effect [17] causes the axial displacement leading to the decrease of the screw preload. On the other hand, the axial displacement causes the cone connection surface adaptation providing frictional resistance and screw-joint stability [7, 8].|$|E

O estudo foi dividido em duas fases: na primeira, foi avaliado o efeito do carregamento mecânico na perda de torque dos parafusos. 40 implantes foram utilizados. Os implantes e {{abutments}} foram divididos em 4 grupos: Grupo 1 : hexágono externo/parafuso convencional (HE); Grupo 2 : triângulo interno/parafuso convencional (TI); Grupo 3 : hexágono externo/parafuso cone morse (HECM); Grupo 4 : triângulo interno/parafuso cone morse (TICM). Os abutments foram instalados em seus respectivos implantes com torque de aperto de 32 Ncm; após intervalo de 10 minutos, foram medidos os valores dos torques de desaperto. Os abutments foram instalados novamente com torque de 32 Ncm, e após 10 minutos foram carregados mecanicamente, simulando 1 ano de função oral normal; após o carregamento, os torques de desaperto dos parafusos foram medidos novamente. Os dados foram analisados com o teste one-way ANOVA, com nível de significância de p≤ 0, 05 %. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas antes e após os ensaios. Na segunda fase, foi avaliada a resistência à flexão dos conjuntos implante/abutment. Os mesmos 40 conjuntos foram utilizados. Os testes foram realizados em máquina universal de ensaios, com célula de carga de 500 kgf, deslocamento de 1 mm/min, e inclinação de 45 °. A força máxima de flexão (FMF) e a força de ruptura (FR) foram determinadas. As informações coletadas foram analisadas com o teste one-way ANOVA, para p≤ 0, 05. Análises por microscopia óptica foram realizadas para estudo dos componentes após os ensaios de resistência flexural. Os resultados sugeriram que houve diferença significante (p= 0, 000) na pré-carga residual antes e após carregamento mecânico entre os dois tipos de parafuso: os parafusos cone morse apresentaram torques de desaperto significativamente superiores aos apresentados pelos parafusos planos convencionais. Houve diferença significante nos resultados da FMF obtidos pelos parafusos planos convencionais e pelos parafusos cone morse (p= 0, 011), sendo que os conjuntos implante/abutment com parafusos cone morse apresentaram maior resistência à flexão. Para os resultados da FR houve influência significante do tipo de conexão (p= 0, 019), com melhores resultados para a conexão triângulo interno. Considerando as limitações deste estudo, concluiu-se que os parafusos cone morse apresentaram maiores torques de desaperto em comparação aos parafusos planos convencionais; que o design da conexão protética não teve influência significante sobre o torque de desaperto dos parafusos; que os parafusos cone morse obtiveram maiores valores de resistência à flexão, e que a conexão em triângulo interno obteve maiores valores para a força de ruptura. The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the mechanical behavior of two implant/abutment connection designs; external hex and internal tri-channel, using conventional screws and experimental conical screws. The study was divided in two parts; the first evaluated the effect of mechanical loading in the torque loss of the screws. 40 implants were used. The implants and abutments were divided in 4 groups: Group 1 : external hex/conventional screw (HE); Group 2 : tri-channel/conventional screw (TI); Group 3 : external hex/conical screw (HECM); Group 4 : tri-channel/conical screw (TICM). The abutments were installed in their respective implants with a tightening torque of 32 Ncm, after a 10 minute interval, <b>loosening</b> <b>torque</b> were measured. The abutments were installed again with a 32 Ncm torque, and after 10 minutes, they were mechanically loaded, simulating 1 year of normal oral function; after loading, loosening torques of the screws were measured again. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, with significance level of p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed before and after the tests. The second part evaluated the flexural resistance of the implant/abutment assemblies. The same 40 assemblies were used. The tests were performed in an universal testing machine, with a 500 kgf load cell, 1 mm/min displacement, and 45 ° angulation. Maximum bending moment (FMF) and rupture force (FR) were determined. Collected information were analyzed with one-way ANOVA test, for p≤ 0, 05. Optical microscopy analysis were performed for study of the components after the flexural resistance tests. The results suggested that there were significant differences (p= 0, 000) in the residual preload before and after mechanical loading between the two types of screws: conical screws showed significantly higher loosening torques than conventional flat screws. There were significant differences in the FMF obtained by the conventional flat screws and by the conical screws (p= 0, 000); the implant/abutment assemblies with conical screws presented higher flexural resistance. For the FR results, there was significant influence of the type of connection (p= 0, 019); the tri-channel connection presented better results. Considering the limitations of this study, it was concluded that the conical screws presented higher loosening torques compared to conventional flat screws; the design of the implant/abutment connection presented no significant influence on the loosening torques of the screws; conical screws showed higher bending moment values; and the tri-channel connection obtained higher rupture force values...|$|E

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} External {{fixation}} pins tend to loosen with time, especially from cancellous bone. A coating that releases a bisphosphonate {{has been shown}} to improve the fixation of dental implants in humans. We now tested a bisphosphonate coating on steel pins for external fixation. The primary hypothesis was that coated pins would be better fixed in the diaphysis. Methods 20 patients with medial knee osteoarthritis underwent proximal tibial correction osteotomy with hemicallotasis. They received a pair of pins (Orthofix) in the tibial shaft, one bisphosphonate-coated and one uncoated. Another pair of pins was inserted in the metaphysis, near the joint. This pair was a bisphosphonate-coated pin and an HA-coated pin. All pins were inserted according to a random list. The pins were removed after the osteotomy had healed (8 - 15 weeks), and extraction torque served as the predetermined main outcome variable. Results No pins showed clinical signs of <b>loosening.</b> Removal <b>torque</b> for the shaft pins was 6. 6 Nm (SD 2. 2) for the bisphosphonate and 6. 0 Nm (SD 2. 5) for the uncoated (difference = 0. 5, 95 % CI: - 0. 03 to 1. 3). Removal torque for the metaphyseal pins was 4. 4 Nm (SD 1. 3) for the bisphosphonate-coated and 4. 2 Nm (SD 1. 6) for the HA-coated (difference = 0. 2, 95 % CI: - 0. 5 to 1. 0). Interpretation We could not show any improved cortical fixation, but the metaphyseal findings are striking. In a previous study on 19 patients with a similar layout, HA-coated and uncoated pins were compared. In the metaphysis, all 19 uncoated pins loosened before removal. It was concluded that uncoated pins could not be used in the metaphyseal region. The present results suggest that a bisphosphonate coating enables metaphyseal fixation similar to that of hydroxyapatite coatings, with no difference from uncoated pins in cortical bone...|$|R
