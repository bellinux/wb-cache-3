5|$|Paul <b>Labile</b> Pogba (born 15 March 1993) is a French {{professional}} footballer who plays for Premier League club Manchester United and the France national team. He operates {{primarily as a}} central midfielder and is comfortable playing both in attack and defence.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and <b>labile</b> affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly <b>labile</b> and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
5|$|Type II toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{generally}} better-understood than type I. In this system a <b>labile</b> protein antitoxin tightly binds and inhibits {{the activity of}} a stable toxin. The largest family of type II toxin-antitoxin systems is vapBC, which has been found through bioinformatics searches to represent between 37 and 42% of all predicted type II loci.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous <b>labile</b> INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
25|$|The Pseudobulbar affect, also {{referred}} to as emotional lability, {{should not be confused with}} <b>labile</b> mood or <b>labile</b> emotions that stem from emotional instability - affective dysregulation - commonly seen in personality disorders, such as borderline personality disorder.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent that}} kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to proteins. This binding allows cells to benefit from iron while also {{limiting}} its ability to do harm. Typical intracellular <b>labile</b> iron concentrations in bacteria are 10-20 micromolar, though they can be 10-fold higher in anaerobic environment, where free radicals and reactive oxygen species are scarcer. In mammalian cells, intracellular <b>labile</b> iron concentrations are typically smaller than 1 micromolar, less than 5 percent of total cellular iron.|$|E

The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to <b>labile</b> vacillation. This limbo is the threshold for mental prostration.|$|E
25|$|In the cytoplasm, {{ferrous iron}} {{is found in}} a soluble, chelatable state which {{constitutes}} the <b>labile</b> iron pool (~0.001 mM). In this pool, iron {{is thought to be}} bound to low-mass compounds such as peptides, carboxylates and phosphates, although some might be in a free, hydrated form (aqua ions). Alternatively, iron ions might be bound to specialized proteins known as metallochaperones. Specifically, poly-r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) appear to mediate transfer of free iron to ferritin (for storage) and non-heme iron enzymes (for use in catalysis). The <b>labile</b> iron pool is potentially toxic due to iron's ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Iron from this pool can be taken up by mitochondria via mitoferrin to synthesize Fe-S clusters and heme groups.|$|E
25|$|Mood {{symptoms}} in individuals with FXS rarely meet diagnostic {{criteria for a}} major mood disorder as they are typically not of sustained duration. Instead, these are usually transient and related to stressors, and may involve <b>labile</b> (fluctuating) mood, irritability, self-injury and aggression.|$|E
25|$|English {{tends to}} favour <b>labile</b> alternations, {{meaning that the}} same verb {{is used in the}} inchoative and causative forms. This {{can be seen in the}} {{following}} example: broke is an intransitive inchoative verb in (3a) and a transitive causative verb in (3b).|$|E
25|$|Using the {{viewpoints}} of {{this emerging}} science and reading {{extensively in the}} ethology literature, Bowlby developed new explanatory hypotheses for what {{is now known as}} human attachment behaviour. In particular, on the basis of ethological evidence he was able to reject the dominant Cupboard Love theory of attachment prevailing in psychoanalysis and learning theory of the 1940s and 1950s. He also introduced the concepts of environmentally stable or <b>labile</b> human behaviour allowing for the revolutionary combination of the idea of a species-specific genetic bias to become attached and the concept of individual differences in attachment security as environmentally <b>labile</b> strategies for adaptation to a specific childrearing niche. Alternatively, Bowlby's thinking about the nature and function of the caregiver-child relationship influenced ethological research, and inspired students of animal behaviour such as Tinbergen, Hinde, and Harry Harlow.|$|E
25|$|Iron can {{be stored}} in {{ferritin}} as ferric iron due to the ferroxidase activity of the ferritin heavy chain. Dysfunctional ferritin may accumulate as hemosiderin, which can be problematic in cases of iron overload. The ferritin storage iron pool is much larger than the <b>labile</b> iron pool, ranging in concentration from 0.7 mM to 3.6 mM.|$|E
25|$|Metalloenzymes {{all have}} one feature in common, namely that the metal ion {{is bound to}} the protein with one <b>labile</b> {{coordination}} site. As with all enzymes, {{the shape of the}} active site is crucial. The metal ion is usually located in a pocket whose shape fits the substrate. The metal ion catalyzes reactions that are difficult to achieve in organic chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Absorption: Duloxetine is acid <b>labile,</b> and is {{formulated}} with {{enteric coating}} to prevent degradation in the stomach. Duloxetine has good oral bioavailability, averaging 50% after one 60mg dose. There is an average 2-hour lag until absorption begins with maximum plasma concentrations occurring about 6 hours post dose. Food {{does not affect}} the Cmax of duloxetine, but delays the time to reach peak concentration from 6 to 10 hours.|$|E
25|$|The {{coupling}} of MS with LC {{systems is}} attractive because liquid chromatography can separate delicate and complex natural mixtures, which chemical composition {{needs to be}} well established (e.g., biological fluids, environmental samples, and drugs). Nowadays, LC-MS {{has become one of}} the most widely used chemical analysis techniques because more than 85% of natural chemical compounds are polar and thermally <b>labile</b> and GC-MS cannot process these samples. As an example, HPLC-MS is regarded as the leading analytical technique for proteomics and pharmaceutical laboratories. Other important applications of LC-MS include the analysis of food, pesticides, and plant phenols.|$|E
25|$|On the {{molecular}} level, all auxins are compounds with an aromatic ring and a carboxylic acid group. The most important {{member of the}} auxin family is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), which generates the majority of auxin effects in intact plants, and is the most potent native auxin. And as native auxin, its stability is controlled in many ways in plants, from synthesis, through possible conjugation to degradation of its molecules, always {{according to the requirements}} of the situation. However, molecules of IAA are chemically <b>labile</b> in aqueous solution, so it is not used commercially as a plant growth regulator.|$|E
25|$|Free {{radical damage}} to DNA can {{occur as a}} result of {{exposure}} to ionizing radiation or to radiomimetic compounds. Damage to DNA {{as a result of}} free radical attack is called indirect DNA damage because the radicals formed can diffuse throughout the body and affect other organs. Malignant melanoma can be caused by indirect DNA damage because it is found in parts of the body not exposed to sunlight. DNA is vulnerable to radical attack because of the very <b>labile</b> hydrogens that can be abstracted and the prevalence of double bonds in the DNA bases that radicals can easily add to.|$|E
25|$|Bustamante was a well-behaved {{teenager}} who suddenly {{at the age}} of 22 became a career criminal. His crimes included theft, breaking and entering, drug offenses, and robbery. In 1990 Bustamante was charged with a homicide. The defense team discovered that the client had suffered a head injury from a crowbar {{at the age of}} twenty. Bustamante’s behavior changed fundamentally after that, transforming him from a normal individual into an impulsive and emotionally <b>labile</b> criminal. The defense team had his client’s brain scanned, which revealed malfunctioning of the prefrontal cortex. At the end the jury believed that Bustamante’s brain was not normal and spared him from the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Note that <b>labile</b> protons (-OH, -NH2, -SH) have no {{characteristic}} chemical shift. However such resonances can {{be identified}} by the disappearance of a peak when reacted with D2O, as deuterium will replace a protium atom. This method is called a D2O shake. Acidic protons may also be suppressed when a solvent containing acidic deuterium ions (e.g. methanol-d4) is used. An alternate method for identifying protons that are not attached to carbons is the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) experiment, which correlates protons and carbons that are one bond away from each other. A hydrogen that is not attached to a carbon {{can be identified}} {{because it does not}} have a crosspeak in the HSQC spectrum.|$|E
25|$|Spiders fluoresce under UV {{light and}} possess a huge {{diversity}} of fluorophores. Remarkably, spiders {{are the only}} known group in which fluorescence is “taxonomically widespread, variably expressed, evolutionarily <b>labile,</b> and probably under selection and potentially of ecological importance for intraspecific and interspecific signaling.” A study by Andrews et al. (2007) reveals that fluorescence has evolved multiple times across spider taxa, with novel fluorophores evolving during spider diversification. In some spiders, ultraviolet cues are important for predator-prey interactions, intraspecific communication, and camouflaging with matching fluorescent flowers. Differing ecological contexts could favor inhibition or enhancement of fluorescence expression, depending upon whether fluorescence helps spiders be cryptic or makes them more conspicuous to predators. Therefore, natural selection could be acting on expression of fluorescence across spider species.|$|E
25|$|To {{overcome}} {{the need to}} use organic solvents and solid porogens, a technique using gas as a porogen has been developed. First, disc-shaped structures made of the desired polymer are prepared by means of compression molding using a heated mold. The discs are then placed in a chamber where {{they are exposed to}} high pressure CO2 for several days. The pressure inside the chamber is gradually restored to atmospheric levels. During this procedure the pores are formed by the carbon dioxide molecules that abandon the polymer, resulting in a sponge-like structure. The main problems resulting from such a technique are caused by the excessive heat used during compression molding (which prohibits the incorporation of any temperature <b>labile</b> material into the polymer matrix) and {{by the fact that the}} pores do not form an interconnected structure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of complex {{molecule}} synthesis, TBS has been widely used {{as one of the}} most versatile of the silicon-based protecting groups (scheme 4). The use of CSA provides selective removal of a primary TBS ether in the presence of tertiary TBS ether and TIPS ethers. Other means of TBS deprotection include acids (also Lewis acids), and fluorides. TIPS protecting groups were also pioneered by Corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection. TIPS ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions, the disadvantage of this protecting group over TBS ethers being that the group is less <b>labile</b> for deprotection. The most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as TBS ether, but longer reaction times are generally needed.|$|E
25|$|Supercritical fluid {{chromatography}} (SFC) {{can be used}} on {{an analytical}} scale, where it combines many of the advantages of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC). It can be used with non-volatile and thermally <b>labile</b> analytes (unlike GC) and can be used with the universal flame ionization detector (unlike HPLC), as well as producing narrower peaks due to rapid diffusion. In practice, the advantages offered by SFC have not been sufficient to displace the widely used HPLC and GC, except in a few cases such as chiral separations and analysis of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons. For manufacturing, efficient preparative simulated moving bed units are available. The purity of the final products is very high, but the cost makes it suitable only for very high-value materials such as pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Fluids {{that would}} be damaged by heat, {{irradiation}} or chemical sterilization, such as drug products, can be sterilized by microfiltration using membrane filters. This method is commonly used for heat <b>labile</b> pharmaceuticals and protein solutions in medicinal drug processing. A microfilter with pore size 0.2 µm will usually effectively remove microorganisms. Some staphylococcal species have, however, {{been shown to be}} flexible enough to pass through 0.22 µm filters. In the processing of biologics, viruses must be removed or inactivated, requiring the use of nanofilters with a smaller pore size (20-50 nm) are used. Smaller pore sizes lower the flow rate, so in order to achieve higher total throughput or to avoid premature blockage, pre-filters might be used to protect small pore membrane filters. Tangential flow filtration (TFF) and alternating tangential flow (ATF) systems also reduce particulate accumulation and blockage.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{features}} make lanthanide complexes effective catalysts. Hard Lewis acids are able to polarise bonds upon coordination and thus alter the electrophilicity of compounds, with a classic example being the Luche reduction. The large size of the ions coupled with their <b>labile</b> ionic bonding allows even bulky coordinating species to bind and dissociate rapidly, resulting in very high turnover rates; thus excellent yields can often be achieved with loadings {{of only a few}} mol%. The lack of orbital interactions combined with the lanthanide contraction means that the lanthanides change in size across the series but that their chemistry remains much the same. This allows for easy tuning of the steric environments and examples exist where this has been used to improve the catalytic activity of the complex·6THF: New Anhydrous Lithium Lanthanide Binaphtholates and Their Use in Enantioselective Alkyl Addition to Aldehydes|journal=Organometallics|date=1 April 1999|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1366–1368|doi=10.1021/om981011s}} and change the nuclearity of metal clusters.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of all {{molecular}} genetic analyses is the preparation and/or preservation of a sample. In the case of AM fungi, samples typically {{come in the form}} of soil or roots that will contain AM spores, hyphae and/or various AM colonization structures. Sample preservation will vary depending on the desired analysis (DNA or RNA). For analysis of DNA, samples should either be processed immediately or kept frozen prior to nucleic acid extraction. For analysis of RNA, samples should be cryogenically frozen (−196°C) almost immediately upon collection, or stored in an RNA stabilization and preservation reagent (e.g. RNAlater). The next step is to extract the desired nucleic acids from the sample, which can be performed manually using various published extraction methods or by using one of the many commercially available DNA/RNA extraction kits. Due to the <b>labile</b> nature of RNA, synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) using extracted RNA as a template is performed for further analysis. For most molecular genetic sequencing methods of AM fungi a PCR step is required to increase the total amount of target DNA/RNA/cDNA. There are many PCR conditions proposed for analysis of AM fungi and some of the most accessible are briefly summarized below.|$|E

500|$|In the Lower Himalaya, {{landslides}} are common. The {{young age}} of the region's hills result in <b>labile</b> rock formations, which are susceptible to slippages. [...] Short duration high intensity rainfall events typically trigger small scale landslides while long duration low intensity rainfall periods tend to trigger large scale catastrophic landslides. Rising population and development pressures, particularly from logging and tourism, cause deforestation. The result, denuded hillsides, exacerbates the severity of landslides, since tree cover impedes the downhill flow of water. Parts of the Western Ghats also suffer from low-intensity landslides. Avalanches occur in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.|$|E
500|$|Arcadelt's {{several hundred}} madrigals, {{composed}} over {{a span of}} at least two decades, were usually for four voices, although he wrote a few for three, and a handful for five and six voices. Stylistically his madrigals are melodious and simple in structure, singable, and built on a clear harmonic basis, usually completely diatonic. The music is often syllablic, and while it sometimes uses repeated phrases, is almost always through-composed (as opposed to the contemporary chanson, which was often strophic). Arcadelt alternates homophonic and polyphonic textures, [...] "in a state of delicate, <b>labile</b> equilibrium." [...] His madrigals best represent the [...] "classic" [...] phase of development of the form, with their clear outline, four-part writing, refinement, and balance; the word painting, chromaticism, ornamentation, virtuosity, expressionistic and manneristic writing of madrigalists later in the century are nowhere to be found in Arcadelt.|$|E
