2500|$|Aside from {{traditional}} IQ tests like Raven's and WAIS, {{researchers have also}} used other tests that tap more into the Cattell-Horn-Caroll theory of intelligence in relation to gender. For example, a 2008 study by researcher Timothy Z. Keith on 25 subtests of Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities, along {{with a sample of}} 6,818 adults and children from 6 to 59, found females scoring higher on the latent processing speed (Gs) factor, a small male advantage on the latent comprehension–knowledge (Gc) factor, higher male score on the latent visual–spatial reasoning (Gv) and higher male latent quantitative reasoning (RQ) factor. The study found no difference in latent long-term retrieval (Glr), short-term memory (Gsm), auditory processing (Ga) [...] and fluid intelligence (Gf) factors. However the sex difference in general intelligence (g-factor) was inconsistent in children with small higher female g factor during adolescence, and consistent higher female latent g factor during adulthood. The finding of the study confirmed Lynn's theory that males develop slower, but did not replicate results that males after 16 years old should have higher g factor. Lead researcher Timothy Keith suggests past researchers like Lynn's had used emergent scores to calculate g factor which is not accurate since most intelligent theories define g factor as a <b>latent</b> <b>variable</b> and not an emergent one. Researcher Timothy Z Keith replicated the same results again in the same year when he conducted a study of 3,025 6-18 year old participants with higher female latent g factor at all ages. In 2006, researchers Stephen Camarata and Richard Woodcock also replicated exactly the same results in sample of 4,253 children and adults but found no sex differences in g factor. In 2011, researcher Timothy Z. Keith also found no significant sex differences in latent g factor among participants of 5- to 17-year-olds on a different IQ test known as the Differential Ability Scales.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} parameter estimation using weakly supervised datasets, where a training sample consists of the input and a partially specified annotation, which we {{refer to as the}} output. The missing information in the annotation is modeled using <b>latent</b> <b>variables.</b> Previous methods overburden a single distribution with two separate tasks: (i) modeling the uncertainty in the <b>latent</b> <b>variables</b> during training; and (ii) making accurate predictions for the output and the <b>latent</b> <b>variables</b> during testing. We propose a novel framework that separates the demands of the two tasks using two distributions: (i) a conditional distribution to model the uncertainty of the <b>latent</b> <b>variables</b> for a given input-output pair; and (ii) a delta distribution to predict the output and the <b>latent</b> <b>variables</b> for a given input. During learning, we encourage agreement between the two distributions by minimizing a loss-based dissimilarity coefficient. Our approach generalizes latent SVM in two important ways: (i) it models the uncertainty over <b>latent</b> <b>variables</b> instead of relying on a pointwise estimate; and (ii) it allows the use of loss functions that depend on <b>latent</b> <b>variables,</b> which greatly increases its applicability.
