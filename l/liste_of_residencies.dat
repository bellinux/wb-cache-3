40|$|Objective— To {{assess how}} {{exposures}} to community activities in residency impact anticipated future involvement in community child health settings. Methods— Prospective cohort study of pediatric residents from 10 programs (12 sites) who completed training between 2003 and 2009. Residents reported annual participation for ≥ 8 days {{in each of}} 7 community activities (eg, community settings, child health advocacy) in the prior year. At the start and end <b>of</b> <b>residency,</b> residents reported anticipated involvement in 10 years in 8 community settings (eg, school, shelter). Anticipated involvement was dichotomized: moderate/ substantial (“high”) versus none/limited (“low”). Logistic regression modeled whether residency exposures independently influenced anticipated future involvement at the end <b>of</b> <b>residency.</b> Results— A total of 683 residents completed surveys at the start and end <b>of</b> <b>residency</b> (66. 8 % participation). More than half of trainees reported ≥ 8 days’ of involvement in community settings (65. 6 %) or child health advocacy (53. 6 %) in residency. Fewer anticipated high involvement in at least 1 community setting at the end <b>of</b> <b>residency</b> than at the start (65. 5 % vs 85. 6 %, P <. 001). Participation in each community activity mediated but did not moderate relations between anticipated involvement at the start and end <b>of</b> <b>residency.</b> In multivariate models, exposure to community settings in residency was associated with anticipated involvement at end <b>of</b> <b>residency</b> (adjusted odds ratio 1. 5; 95 % confidence interval 1. 2, 2. 0). No other residency exposures were associated. Conclusions— Residents who anticipate high involvement in community pediatrics at the start <b>of</b> <b>residency</b> participate in related opportunities in training. Exposure to community settings during residency may encourage community involvement after training...|$|R
