500|$|While Levine praised [...] "its bright, cartoony visuals [...] are a notch above {{those of}} many other {{animated}} series," [...] Sinnott considered some of the animation to be [...] "a little stilted." [...] Sinnott called it [...] "a fun series overall", but considered some jokes to be [...] "a little stale". Neil Dorsett of DVD Verdict was generally disappointed; he called voice acting [...] "very standard", and said that [...] "artwork and animation are also both behind the times". Dorsett also criticized Virgil's one-lines, which [...] "invites, like many {{other elements of the}} series, comparison to Spider-Man." [...] He, however, pondered that his opinion may come from a bad first impression: [...] "Although there are <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> to nitpick about the show, there's not really anything wrong with it." [...] Both Sinnott and Dorsett compared it unfavorably to the original comic book.|$|E

500|$|Enquiries {{continued}} for many months. The bishop was initially reluctant {{to pursue the}} case—Davidson {{thought he might be}} prepared to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. In February 1932 Dashwood advised Pollock that the matter could not be suppressed in this way; allegations had been printed in the Evening News on 1 February, and the story had been picked up by other papers whose lurid headlines had created much public interest. On 7 February the bishop received a letter from a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: [...] "I know <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> against him that might help you... He has the keys of a lot of girls' flats and front doors." [...] This letter is described by Matthew Parris in his account of the case as [...] "a masterpiece of vituperation"; [...] Davidson's lawyers failed to identify some obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have affected the impact of her subsequent testimony to the court.|$|E

Aguilera also believed that the lyrics of Stripped were so personal, and her vocals [...] "represent a rawer, more bare-bones approach as well, with less of the ostentatious riffing that has miffed critics in the past". She stated, [...] "I did the vocal gymnastics thing because it was fun. That's why I like blues, too, because you can experiment more with that side of your voice.

You can accuse me of <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> – of having a bad day, of missing chances, of many things – but I have always had ambition and always will have. I think I have proved that on the pitch with Zaragoza, Sporting, UD Langreo, and the national team." [...] In October 2008, Kaká praised Villa: speaking to Canal+, he claimed that Villa is [...] "the best Spanish footballer" [...] adding that, [...] "The player with whom I would most like to play is David Villa of Valencia."

[...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly thought that [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] "was downright alive with fascinating new characters, mind-blowing new possibilities, and exciting new theory fodder"; however, he had heard complaints from others who received the preview screeners that they found the episode to be flawed. [...] They considered the scene where 815 is found to be cheating the flashback formula because Daniel only experiences it by watching it on television, Frank's safe landing of the helicopter to be a mystery, Naomi's flashback to be cheating Lost rules because she is dead and Ben's manipulation of Locke to be an overused storyline. [...] E!'s Kristin Dos Santos exclaimed [...] "hot damn!" [...] in response to the scene where 815 is found in the Sunda Trench. [...] She also thought that [...] "Juliet and Kate giggling at Jack's 'wink thing' was hilarious" [...] and it was [...] "awesome to see [...] again". [...] Nikki Stafford of Wizard highlighted [...] "watching Dan's landing from his point of view. [...] You can feel his panic as he's free-falling through the air, looks up at his parachute, looks down to see himself about to hit the trees... it was amazing." [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave [...] "Confirmed Dead" [...] an 8/10, writing that it [...] "isn't a disappointing episode by any means but it definitely suffers from being a 'setup' episode for these four new characters" [...] and praising the new actors by writing that [...] "Leung does an adequate job of getting Miles' arrogant brand of confidence across while Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. [...] Fahey's Lapidus has exceptional screen presence that even overshadows the regular cast members to an extent." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad said that [...] "Watching 'Confirmed Dead' was like watching my dream episode of Lost [...] people asked direct questions for once... this episode was all about the Freighties." [...] A day after the original broadcast, BuddyTV's Dahl claimed that [...] " [...] on an epic journey, one that has been as entertaining and engrossing as any TV series has ever been". In contrast, TV Guides Michael Ausiello of [...] said that it [...] "was thirty-one flavors of awesome... the negatives outweighed the positives".

The climate of the city in A.D. 2019 is very different from today's. It is strongly implied that industrial pollution has adversely affected planet Earth's environment, i.e. global warming and global dimming. Real animals are rare in the Blade Runner world. In Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, animal extinction and human depopulation of the planet were consequent to the radioactive fallout of a nuclear war; Owls were the first species to become extinct.
