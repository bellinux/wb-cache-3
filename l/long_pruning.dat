40|$|Since 1998, the Ain-Karim Vineyard {{has been}} growing {{different}} grape varieties {{for the production of}} high-altitude tropical wines in the municipality of Sutamarchan, located in the Alto Ricaurte region of Boyaca (Colombia). Pruning is used to limit the number and length of branches, generating a suitable balance between plant vigor and production; thereby, regulating fruit quantity and quality and ensuring reserves for the subsequent production. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of three pruning types (short = two buds on two spurs; long = five buds on three spurs and mixed = combination of short and <b>long</b> <b>pruning</b> types) on the fruit quality of V. vinifera, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc varieties. To accomplish this, a completely randomized two-factor design was used. Physicochemical variables of fruit quality (fresh cluster weight, water content, total soluble solids (TSS), total titratable acidity (TTA), technical maturity index (TMI), and pH) were determined at harvest. The <b>long</b> <b>pruning</b> type presented the highest values for the fresh cluster weight and TSS of the fruits from both varieties and a higher TMI in the Cabernet Sauvignon variety. These results indicate that, under the conditions of the vineyard, <b>long</b> <b>pruning</b> is the most suitable...|$|E

Pruning is one of the practices that seek to improve the final quality of musts and wines. With the study, aimed to know the effect of three types of pruning (short, long and mixed) on the evolution of quality components during ripening of Vitis vinifera L. var. Sauvignon Blanc in Sutamarchán-Boyacá, Colombia. Every two weeks, since the beginning of veraison to maturity, 20 berries were collected randomly to determine the behavior of the total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TTA) and technical maturity index (TMI). With <b>long</b> <b>pruning</b> the highest sugar content (22. 76 ° Brix) was reached and higher TMI (3. 42), total titratable acidity (TTA) decreased with fruit development, resulting on time of harvest, accumulation of organic acids (6. 88 g L- 1). The <b>long</b> <b>pruning</b> presented the appropriate fruit values, in quality components (TSS, TTA, TMI) for tropical wines of Sauvignon Blanc, in the locality of the study...|$|E
40|$|Cytokinins play an {{important}} role in budburst, flowering and fruit set in table grapes. Rest-breaking treatments with hydrogen cyanamide and pruning practices modify budburst and reproductive development in table grapes, especially in regions with low and often inadequate winter chilling. The effect of these treatments on the xylem sap and bud Zeatin riboside (ZR) content was determined during late winter and budburst in 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavalleé' canes in a total of nine trials conducted between 1997 and 2001. Bud ZR levels of hydrogen cyanamide treated 'Sultanina' canes showed an earlier and increased cytokinin peak, in particular in the distal buds. Large ZR peaks before budburst and noticeable differences between distal and proximal buds were absent on non-sprayed canes. The xylary ZR content of long pruned 'Sultanina', 'Sunred Seedless', and 'Alphonse Lavaleé' canes showed a significantly higher and earlier cytokinin peak than in short pruned spurs. By contrast, the bud ZR content tended to be higher in spurs than canes. Pruning and rest-breaking treatments enhanced budburst and increased endogenous cytokinins in these experiments. <b>Long</b> <b>pruning</b> in 'Sultanina' and 'Sunred Seedless' (both parthenocarpic) is necessary for acceptable fruit set and yields. Possibly, in longer canes more cytokinin is available for reproductive development. 'Alphonse Lavaleé' (seeded) is sufficiently fruitful and produces adequate yields following spur pruning. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|E

As avaliações foram realizadas em duas safras fora de época (2008 e 2009), a partir do início da maturação das uvas até sete dias após a colheita. Foram utilizadas 20 plantas representativas de cada variedade. Para a evolução da maturação fenólica das uvas, foi determinado o teor de antocianinas e o índice de polifenóis totais (IPT) do mosto das bagas. Por ocasião da colheita, foi avaliado o teor de resveratrol do mosto das uvas. Para a 'Alicante', a média do teor de antocianinas foi de 55, 4 mg 100 g- 1, IPT de 474, 0 mg 100 g- 1 e teor de resveratrol de 7, 6 µg g- 1.

40|$|The Concord and {{grapes of}} this type and hardiness, which are the most widely grown in Iowa, require yearly pruning if the grower wishes to obtain heavy annual yields of large-sized {{high-quality}} fruit. Far too many home vineyards are left unpruned or are incorrectly pruned, {{with the result that}} they are unproductive and unsightly. There are many systems used in training the American grape, but the system which seems to be best adapted to Iowa conditions is the single-stem four-cane Kniffin system. The spur method of pruning, which has been employed to a considerable extent with the European grape, is still followed in many sections of Iowa. Unfortunately, this method is unsatisfactory with the Concord grape and, except with grapes trained on arbors, should not be used. The grapevines <b>pruned</b> by the <b>long</b> cane method and trained to the Kniffin system in certain Iowa tests have repeatedly outproduced those pruned by the spur method. The Concord produces the heaviest yield of fruit from approximately the fifth to ninth bud and the lowest yield from the first four buds on the cane. Therefore, {{it can be seen that}} with the spur method of pruning, when only the first two buds are left on each cane, the heaviest producing buds are removed. The characteristic bearing habit of the American grape explains why <b>long</b> cane <b>pruning</b> is more productive than the spur cane system...|$|R

40|$|Pattern {{discovery}} in long sequences {{is of great}} importance in many applications including computational biology study, con-sumer behavior analysis, system performance analysis, etc. In a noisy environment, an observed sequence may not accurately reflect the underlying behavior. For example, in a protein se-quence, the amino acid N is likely to mutate to D with little impact to the biological function of the protein. It would be desirable if the occurrence of D in the observation can be re-lated to a possible mutation from N in an appropriate manner. Unfortunately, the support measure (i. e., the number of occur-rences) of a pattern does not serve this purpose. In this paper, we introduce the concept of compatibility matrix as the means to provide a probabilistic connection from the observation to the underlying true value. A new metric match is also pro-posed to capture the &quot;real support &quot; of a pattern which would be expected if a noise-free environment is assumed. In addition, in the context we address, a pattern could be very <b>long.</b> The standard <b>pruning</b> technique developed for the market basket problem may not work efficiently. As a result, a novel algo-rithm that combines statistical sampling and a new technique (namely border collapsing) is devised to discover long patterns in a minimal number of scans of the sequence database with sufficiently high confidence. Empirical results demonstrate the robustness of the match model (with respect to the noise) and {{the efficiency of the}} probabilistic algorithm. 1...|$|R

A major limitation to {{the expansion}} of the pear culture cultivated under mild winter, as South of Brazil, is the cultivar adaptation. During the winter, the temperature fluctuation and low accumulation of cold have been reported by some authors as cause of floral button abortion. Moreover, the pear fruit satisfactorily when well managed, being the pruning and girdling one of the main fruiting techniques. This work aimed to evaluate the responses by pear cultivars to different cultural practices in order to increase the fruit an production and to evaluate the development of xylem vessels during dormancy. The work was carried out in two stages: the first in Brazil at the Federal University of Pelotas and the second in Italy, Faculty of Agriculture, in Pisa. In Garber cultivar, the treatments were: 1 - control 2 - short summer pruning 3 - arching of branches and <b>long</b> summer <b>pruning</b> and 4 arching of branches in the winter, 5 - winter pruning; 6 girdling of branches, 7 Promalin ?? and 8 - Biozyme * TF. For the cultivars Shinseiki and Housui, the treatments were: 1 - control, 2 - trunk girdling in April 3 - ringing branches in April. To Kousui, the treatments were: 1 trunk girdling, 2 - branch girdling + pruning 3 - pruning, 4 - branch girdling 5 -control. For the Conference, the healthy and intact branches of plants were marked and followed during the dormancy period, the continuity of vascular bundles between the branches and the buds were observed in the stereomicroscope and the histological evaluations were observed under a fluorescence microscope. All cultivars responded to the blinding technique. For the Garber the effective fruit is influenced by the treatments when assessed in different fruiting bodies. The fruiting body which showed the highest rates of fruit were brindila coronada and bourse. For the Shinseiki cv, the trunk girdling increased the effective fruiting and the production per trunk area. In the cultivar Housui, the branches girdling increased the fruiting but not the production. In the cultivar Kousui the treatments with blinding increased the effective fruiting, the maturation was anticipated and increased the soluble solid content. In the cultivar Conference, through the vascular connections, it can establish stages of dormancy during the bud flowers evolution, as well as to establish that 1, 000 chilling hours are needed to overcome endodormancy...|$|R
