500|$|A {{student in}} an {{adjacent}} classroom, Sanna Orpana, {{said that her}} class had heard [...] "shooting {{and a kind of}} a rumble like tables falling down." [...] Orpana believed {{at the time that the}} noise may have been coming from a toy gun, and two other students went to investigate the noise. Saari shot at them, and the remaining students in Orpana's classroom hid under a table before running upstairs. At some point between 10:45–11:00 Saari ran down a corridor and threw a petrol bomb into a <b>language</b> <b>laboratory.</b> He then shot out all of the windows in the school's main corridor, that extended through the building. It was during this time that he also took aim at Forsberg.|$|E
500|$|The College has {{a history}} of {{innovation}} in the field of education. In 1963, it was the first independent school to have a <b>language</b> <b>laboratory.</b> It is thought to be the first school in the country to have had a careers service. Under the direction of John Lewis, a former master, it pioneered [...] Nuffield Physics in the 1960s, Science in Society in the 1970s, and the Diploma of Achievement in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1990s, Malvern College {{became one of the first}} schools in Britain to offer the choice between the International Baccalaureate and A-Levels in the Sixth Form. The school was one of the first boys' public schools to become fully coeducational from the preparatory department all the way to sixth form.|$|E

2500|$|The typical {{structure}} of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and {{there was even a}} text book entitled ALM [...] ) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was [...] "pattern practice," [...] which were drills expecting [...] "automatic" [...] responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The teacher could have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the teacher could pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The <b>Language</b> <b>Laboratory</b> and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as [...] "mimicry-memorization." [...] 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. [...] 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.|$|E
