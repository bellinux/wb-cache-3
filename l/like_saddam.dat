2500|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way you get that compliance out of a thug <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair [...] for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E

40|$|More {{often than}} not when {{conversation}} turns to politics and politicians, discussion focuses on personalities. There is a certain fascination with analyzing political leaders. As a result, biographies on current political figures become best sellers and the triumphs {{as well as the}} tragedies of political leaders become newspaper headlines.

It is hard to conceive of giving people <b>like</b> Tony Blair, <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, or Boris Yeltsin a battery of psychological tests or having them submit to a series of clinical interviews.

5000|$|On May 29, 2004, Pachachi said, {{referring}} to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, [...] "The Americans thought they were marching into an underdeveloped country, expecting to face little resistance and be welcomed with flowers. The Americans quickly realized that the Iraqi is a patriot, one who defends his country, just as his ancestors have done for thousands of years. We are an educated people with a long history, and we are a cultured people. The Americans also did not expect the infrastructure they found in Iraq. They were surprised. They couldn't understand that a dictator <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein had invested {{a large share of}} oil revenues in infrastructure projects, such as highways, modern irrigation canals and industrial plants, which one doesn't find in just any country. The marines were confused by this new realization, as well as by their failure to achieve a swift victory and by the ongoing resistance. It also confounded the American concept, that is, if a sound and credible concept ever existed. No people in the world wishes to live with occupiers, and we Iraqis are no different." [...] Pachachi also commented on the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse [...] "What kind of reaction do you expect from the Iraqis? Regardless of age, profession and political affiliation, we are all horrified and furious about these atrocities. I had already heard about the brusque approach taken by the Americans during house searches early on. However, I was completely taken aback by the gruesome scope of the torture and human rights violations that have now come to light. Not just I, but all Iraqis demand a tough investigation and punishment of the perpetrators and the people behind them. We also need guarantees that such atrocities will cease once and for all.

40|$|The war is {{over and}} history is forgotten, says Simon Adams There are things we are not {{supposed}} to mention about the war in Iraq. Like the fact that our troops are participants in the most unpopular war in modern history. Even before a single shot was fired there were massive protests. And since March 20 literally {{millions of people around the}} world have marched against the US-led invasion. The Vietnam War was never this immediately and globally unpopular. Not even after years of napalm, not after My Lai, not ever. While the initial stage of the invasion, with tanks racing across the desert, facilitated a partial boost in approval of the ‘support our troops’ variety, even this has been undermined by the growing death toll of Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers. The shocking and awful missile barrage of Iraq’s cities, the ongoing ‘pockets of resistance’ which seem much deeper than anyone imagined, and the fact that the most powerful nation in history has so far been mightily unsuccessful in conquering a Third World country, has not helped either. Vietnam must have haunted the dreams of Bush and Rumsfeld in Washington this past week. When Bush the Elder fought the first Gulf War in 1991 he said it shattered forever America’s ‘Vietnam Syndrome’. What then, do we make of the quagmire that his son has now immersed America in? Call it the revenge of history. I’m old enough to remember when Saddam Hussein was our comrade in arms. I lived in America between 1979 and 1983. I recall the yellow ribbons we tied around trees at my school - a ribbon a day, for each of the 444 days the American hostages remained prisoners of fanatical Muslim students in Teheran. Old enough to recall when Ayatollah Khomeini was public enemy number one. Old enough to remember learning that we (meaning the Americans and I, a foreigner) had allies in the Middle East and that one of the greatest of these was the nation of Iraq whose armies were marching against the evil Iranians. When Iraq invaded Iran in 1980 Saddam was considered a potential ally in a treacherous region. His brutal regime was secular and his Ba’ath Party had wiped out the Iraqi Communist Party. <b>Like</b> the Americans, <b>Saddam</b> hated and feared Iran’s Islamic revolution. He seemed like the kind of guy Washington could do business with. The fact that Saddam’s regime brutalised and tortured its own people was a peripheral matter. Bigger issues of geopolitics and American hostages were at stake. In 1982 President Reagan removed Iraq from the US State Department’s list of states that supported terrorism. Throughout the Iran-Iraq War America was openly with Saddam against Iran. The links between Washington and Baghdad extended to the Americans sharing sensitive satellite intelligence with the Iraqi Army so they could wage war more effectively. The US Navy provided armed escorts for Iraqi oil tankers. And in December 1983 US President Ronald Reagan even sent a special envoy - a certain Mr Donald Rumsfeld - to meet Saddam Hussein and establish a closer relationship with the Iraqi dictator. No wonder Rummy claims such insight into the minds of Iraq’s brutal rulers - he’s supped with them as their guest! Not that you’ll hear him mention this on CNN. These days Rummy works for President Bush the Younger as Secretary of Defense. He speaks continually of ‘weapons of mass destruction’ and Saddam’s appalling human rights record. Maybe he really does know something that we don’t. Maybe Saddam took Rummy into his confidence all those years ago in Badghad? After all, the lines between trusted ally and evil tyrant were apparently a lot less clear then than they are today. Bush the Younger, in arguing in favour of an invasion of Iraq, sometimes recalls Iraq’s use of chemical weapons against the Kurds. Like the appalling incident in March 1988 when Iraqi forces gassed over four thousand Kurds in Halabja. Bush has called this an act of attempted genocide. The problem is that none of it is news. The American State Department and CIA were aware of the Iraqi military’s use of chemical weapons throughout the 1980 s while Iraq was a US ally. On 20 March 1984, for instance, US intelligence sources reported that they had ‘incontrovertible evidence that Iraq has used nerve gas in its war with Iran and has almost finished extensive site for mass-producing the lethal chemical agent’. And yet this did not stop the United States from re-establishing full diplomatic ties with Iraq in November that year. Nor did it stop the US from continuing to support Saddam’s war against Iran. Indeed when the US Senate, or the United Nations, attempted to constrain Iraq the Reagan administration intervened. In March 1986, for example, the UN Security Council proposed a declaration against Iraq’s use of chemical weapons. The United States voted against the declaration. Britain and Australia abstained. The war continued. As did the trade, according to a 1994 US Senate Committee Report, of materials used in manufacturing chemical weapons. From 1985 - 1989 about a dozen US companies were involved in exporting biological agents to the Iraqis, assisting them in making, among other things, deadly anthrax. The US Department of Commerce licensed this trade. That is, until the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the Cold War altered the structure of allegiance in the Middle East. The Iran-Iraq War continued until 1988, by which time a million people had been killed. It is now a matter of public record that the Reagan administration secretly traded weapons for hostages with the Iranians in the early 1980 s. What was largely overlooked in the resulting ‘Iran-Contra Scandal’, however, was the fact that Washington had therefore militarily supported both sides of the Iran-Iraq war, possibly prolonging the killing. One million dead. This is only a small part of the history not mentioned on CNN. And certainly not on FoxNews where the disgraced cold warrior Oliver North, the Pentagon’s ‘fallguy’ during the Iran-Contra Scandal, now works as a frontline reporter. This current war in Iraq is an elaborate exercise in political amnesia. No matter how long, or what new twists it takes, it remains morally wrong.

50|$|Richard Engel begins {{talking about}} graduating from Stanford {{and wanting to}} become a {{reporter}} but not your typical reporter, he wanted to focus on something more than the stock market so {{he moved to the}} middle east in 1996, when people <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, Gadhafi, and Mubarak were the big leaders. At this time under the big men the middle east was angry, oppressed and rotten to the core. He lived in Cairo where he talks about how different it is from the US such as having no privacy and not speaking to a woman for two years. Engel talks about how everything in the media was heavily censored when he worked for the Middle East Times. The first attack he saw was a bus shooting and burning in Tahrir Square one of the busiest parts of downtown Cairo, he saw people shot and melted into their bus seats. He counts this and the attack in Luxor the first Al-Qaeda-style attacks. He talks about Islam and its origins- Islam's message- all men are equal in prayer, humbled together in communal submission, rich and poor side by side. Mohammad asked for 5 daily prayers, a weekly gathering with a short sermon, partial fasting for a month each year, and a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage to Mecca, called the hajj, for those who could afford it. After World War I and the treaties and promises made by Europeans it left the middle east hopelessly divided. After World War II the US pretty much was the Middle East's guardian of stability. After 9/11 when Bush said he was launching a crusade many Muslims took that at face value. Engel started freelancing in 1998 for ABC, The World, and other news organizations. The hardcore Egyptian jihadists joined the holy wars in Afghanistan against the soviets then would return and get put in jail and murdered so they ran to the mountains where they would live and later form standing armies one of which is AL-Qaeda.|$|E
5000|$|Friedman {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that {{the establishment of}} a democratic state in the Middle East would force {{other countries in the region}} to liberalize and modernize. In his February 9, 2003, column for The Wall Street, Friedman also pointed to the lack of compliance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction: [...] "The French position is utterly incoherent. The inspections have not worked yet, says Mr. de Villepin, because Saddam has not fully cooperated, and, therefore, we should triple the number of inspectors. But the inspections have failed not because of a shortage of inspectors. They have failed because of a shortage of compliance on Saddam's part, as the French know. The way you get that compliance out of a thug <b>like</b> <b>Saddam</b> is not by tripling the inspectors, but by tripling the threat that if he does not comply he will be faced with a U.N.-approved war." [...] Since the invasion, Friedman has expressed alarm over the post-invasion conduct of the war by the George W. Bush administration. Nevertheless, until his piece dated August 4, 2006 (see below), his columns remained hopeful to the possibility of a positive conclusion to the Iraq conflict (although his optimism appeared to steadily diminish as the conflict continued). Friedman chided George W. Bush and Tony Blair for [...] "hyping" [...] the evidence, and stated plainly that converting Iraq to democracy [...] "would be a huge undertaking, though, and maybe impossible, given Iraq's fractious history". In January 2004, he participated in a forum on Slate.com called [...] "Liberal Hawks Reconsider the Iraq War", in which he dismisses the justification for war based on Iraq's lack of compliance with the U.N. Resolutions: [...] "The right reason for this war.. was to oust Saddam's regime and partner with the Iraqi people to try to implement the Arab Human Development report's prescriptions in the heart of the Arab world. That report said the Arab world is falling off the globe because of a lack of freedom, women's empowerment, and modern education. The right reason for this war was to partner with Arab moderates in a long-term strategy of dehumiliation and redignification.|$|E
