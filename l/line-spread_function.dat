(a) The point-spread function (PSF) {{is the image}} of a point source. (b) The image of a line {{is referred to as the}} <b>line-spread</b> <b>function,</b> in this case a vertical line. The <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> is directly proportional to the vertical integration of the point-spread image. The optical-transfer function (OTF) is defined as the Fourier transform of the point-spread function and is thus generally a two-dimensional complex function. Typically only a one-dimensional slice is shown (c), corresponding to the Fourier transform of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function.</b> The thick green line indicates the real part of the function, and the thin red line the imaginary part. Often only the absolute value of the complex function is shown, this allows visualization of the two-dimensional function (d); however, more commonly only the one-dimensional function is shown (e). The latter is typically normalized at the spatial frequency zero and referred to as the modulation transfer function (MTF). For completeness, the complex argument is sometimes provided as the phase transfer function (PhTF), shown in panel (f).|$|E
50|$|The {{two-dimensional}} Fourier transform of a {{line through}} the origin, is a line orthogonal to it and through the origin. The divisor is thus zero for all but a single dimension, by consequence, the optical transfer function can only be determined for a single dimension using a single <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> (LSF). If necessary, the two-dimensional optical transfer function can be determined by repeating the measurement with lines at various angles.|$|E
50|$|When the aberrations can {{be assumed}} to be {{spatially}} invariant, alternative patterns {{can be used to}} determine the optical transfer function such as lines and edges. The corresponding transfer functions are referred to as the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> and the edge-spread function, respectively. Such extended objects illuminate more pixels in the image, and can improve the measurement accuracy due to the larger signal-to-noise ratio. The optical transfer function is in this case calculated as the two-dimensional discrete Fourier transform of the image and divided by that of the extended object. Typically either a line or a black-white edge is used.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{geometrical}} {{characteristics of the}} Landsat- 4 and Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Multispectral Scanner (MSS), functions defining their spatial responses are derived, i. e., transfer <b>functions</b> (TF's) and <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> (LSF's). These design LSF's and TF's are modified based on prelaunch component and system measurements to provide improved estimates. The two MSS instruments were comparable at their temperatures of best focus; separate calculations were performed for bands 1 and 3, band 2, and band 4. The presample nadir effective instantaneous fields of view, based on the 0. 5 modulation transfer function (MTF) criteria, are 70 - 75 m in the track direction and 79 - 82 m in the scan direction. For the TM instruments, more extensive prelaunch measurements were available. LSF's derived from component measurements differed from the limited measured LSF data only in the ringing response/overshoot behavior...|$|R
40|$|A new scatter and {{attenuation}} correction {{method is}} presented in which Monte Carlo simulated scatter <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> for different depth and lateral positions are used. A reconstructed emission image is used as {{an estimate of the}} source distribution in order to calculate the scatter contribution in the projection data. The scatter contribution is then subtracted from the original projection prior to attenuation correction. The attenuation correction method uses density maps for the attenuation correction of projection data. Simulation studies have been done with a clinically realistic source distribution in cylindrical, homogeneous water phantoms of different sizes and with photon energies corresponding to 201 T 1, 99 mTc, and 111 In. The results show excellent quantitative results with an accuracy within +/- 10 % for most of the source positions and phantom sizes. It has also been shown that the variation in the event distribution within the source region in the images has been significantly decreased and that an enhancement in the contrast has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|Exploring the {{resolution}} limit of electron-beam lithography {{is of great}} interest both scientifically and technologically. However, when electron-beam lithography approaches its resolution limit, imaging and metrology of the fabricated structures by using standard scanning electron microscopy become difficult. In this work, the authors adopted transmission-electron and atomic-force microscopies to improve the metrological accuracy and to analyze {{the resolution}} limit of electron-beam lithography. With these metrological methods, the authors found that sub- 5 nm sparse features could be readily fabricated by electron-beam lithography, but dense 16 nm pitch structures were difficult to yield. Measurements of point- and <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> suggested that the resolution in fabricating sub- 10 nm half-pitch structures was primarily limited by the resist-development processes, meaning that the development rates depended on pattern density and/or length scale.

40|$|Using {{theoretical}} {{estimates of}} the optical-transfer function and <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> as image-quality criteria, we predicted {{the influence of the}} Stiles–Crawford effect (SCE) on both optical performance of the eye and subjective measurements of transverse aberrations when pupils are decentered. The SCE was modeled as a pupil apodization. The SCE appears to improve image quality by providing compensation for aberrations induced by pupil decentration, but this improvement is usually small. When a criterion of the placement of the image is used as the centroid of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function,</b> an average SCE reduces the influence of pupil decentration on subjective transverse chromatic aberrations (TCA's) for 5 -mm-diameter pupils by 30...|$|E
40|$|Employing {{asymmetric}} Bragg reflection at the monochromator we {{obtain a}} wide and practically parallel synchrotron‐radiation beam which, {{when combined with}} the use of a CCD detector, enables us to perform chemically specific, high‐speed and high‐resolution tomography. We present recent results obtained with this new method. The actual resolution achieved was determined from the measured <b>line‐spread</b> <b>function</b> of the complete detection system which includes the CCD, the fluorescent screen, and the lens used for optical magnification. The modulation‐transfer function (MTF) calculated from the <b>line‐spread</b> <b>function</b> shows that with only twofold magnification and at 3 % contrast detectability about 28 line pairs per mm are resolved. Extrapolating from this result we find that with an optical magnification of 7 : 1 about 100 line pairs per mm should be resolved. Ways to optimize the method further are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} contrast reduction by atmospheric haze developed for the 'two-halves' field of the earth's surface and other geometries of the earth's surface albedo. The model {{is based on a}} simplified solution of the equation of radiative transfer in two dimensions, resulting in a method for calculation of the upward zenith intensity in the atmosphere {{as a function of the}} distance from the border between the two half planes, for an unabsorbing atmosphere. The adjacency effect between two infinitesimal areas of different albedos is calculated; the resultant simplified solution is used to develop expressions for the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> of the atmosphere and the modulation transfer function. The <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> is used to calculate the point spread function, which can be used to compute the intensity above any surface with given spatial dependence of the reflectivity...|$|E
40|$|Single-photon {{emission}} {{computed tomography}} (SPECT) {{is important for}} imaging radioactivity distributions in vivo. Quantitative SPECT is limited due to attenuation and scatter contribution. Approximations such as constant attenuation and mono-exponential scatter functions will not be valid for non-homogeneous regions. A correction method is described where non-uniform density-maps {{are used in the}} attenuation correction. Correction for non-uniform scatter is made by a convolution technique based on scatter <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> (SLSF) calculated for different locations inside a clinically realistic, nonhomogeneous, computer phantom. Calculations have been made for a myocardiac source, a uniform source in the lungs and a tumor located in the lungs. Projections were simulated for photon energies corresponding to 201 Tl, 99 mTc, and 111 In. The results show that quantitative images can be obtained in nonhomogeneous regions. An increased contrast has also been demonstrated in the SLSF-corrected images. Comparison with measurements have been made to validate the Monte Carlo code and the scatter and attenuation method...|$|R
40|$|In {{transmitted}} optical microscopy, absorption {{structure and}} phase {{structure of the}} specimen determine the three-dimensional intensity distribution of the image. The elementary impulse responses of the bright field microscope therefore consist of separate absorptive and phase components, precluding general application of linear, conventional deconvolution processing methods to improve image contrast and resolution. However, conventional deconvolution can be applied {{in the case of}} pure phase (or pure absorptive) objects if the corresponding phase (or absorptive) impulse responses of the microscope are known. In this work, we present direct measurements of the phase point- and <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> of a high-aperture microscope operating in transmitted bright field. Polystyrene nanoparticles and microtubules (biological polymer filaments) serve as the pure phase point and line objects, respectively, that are imaged with high contrast and low noise using standard microscopy plus digital image processing. Our experimental results agree with a proposed model for the response functions, and confirm previous theoretical predictions. Finally, we use the measured phase point-spread function to apply conventional deconvolution on the bright field images of living, unstained bacteria, resulting in improved definition of cell boundaries and sub-cellular features. These developments demonstrate practical application of standard restoration methods to improve imaging of phase objects such as cells in transmitted light microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo programs, {{like the}} SIMIND program, have become {{increasingly}} used to simulate imaging systems like the scintillation camera and SPECT systems. Up to now, {{it has not been}} able to simulate a pinhole-imaging device with SIMIND. The aim of this work was to develop a routine for pinhole-imaging consisting of a knife-edge collimator and a conical shielding. The routine tracks the path of each photon through the pinhole-collimator and scores if photons either i) pass geometrically through the pinhole ii) penetrate through the edges of the pinhole or iii) being scattered in the collimator. This allows for calculation of fractions of geometrical, penetrating and scattered photons that contribute to an image. Variance reduction is implementing by forcing the photon, emitted from the last interaction point (or from the initial decay location), into a direction towards the center of the pinhole. Characteristic x-ray emissions from photon interactions are included. Results from simulations were compared to results from experimental studies using a SPECT system with a physical pinhole-collimator. The parameters compared were here the sensitivity (cps/MBq) and the shape of <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> as function of distance. Comparisons were also made with results from previously published Monte Carlo simulations of pinhole collimators for different radionuclides. Results from our simulations mostly showed a good agreement but for some cases we found differences especially in the values of the fraction of geometrical, penetrating and scattered photons when comparing to previously reported results. Our conclusion is, however, that the routine provides accurate pinhole collimator simulations...|$|R
40|$|Monte Carlo {{simulations}} {{have been}} performed to {{determine the influence of}} collimator-scattered protons from a 150 MeV proton beam on the dose distribution behind a collimator. Slit-shaped collimators with apertures between 2 and 20 mm have been simulated. The Monte Carlo code GEANT 3. 21 has been validated against one-dimensional dose measurements with a scintillating screen, observed by a CCD camera. In order to account for the effects of the spatial response of the CCD/scintillator system, the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> was determined by comparison with measurements made with a diamond detector. The <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> of the CCD/scintillator system is described by a Gaussian distribution {{with a standard deviation of}} 0. 22 mm. The Monte Carlo simulations show that protons that hit the collimator on the entrance face and leave ii through the wall of the aperture make the largest scatter contribution. Scatter on air is the major contribution to the extent of the penumbra. From the energy spectra it is derived that protons with a relative biological effectiveness greater than I cause at most 1 % more damage in tissue than what would be expected from the, physical dose...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a simple and}} biologically plausible model of how mammalian visual systems could detect and identify features in an image. We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as 'lines' and 'edges' are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points 'local energy' is maximal. Local energy {{is defined as the}} square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90 degrees: one filter type has an even-symmetric <b>line-spread</b> <b>function,</b> the other an odd-symmetric <b>line-spread</b> <b>function.</b> For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Large {{aperture}} spectra provide greater signal, {{but small}} aperture spectra have higher resolution (smaller <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> (LSF) wings). The simple method presented here can convert large aperture spectra {{to the resolution}} of small aperture spectra by removing {{the wings of the}} LSF without significant noise being added to the continua. In addition, this method/algorithm allows spectra taken through different apertures to be placed upon a common baseline for increased signalto-noise (S/N). In marginal S/N cases, such as QSO absorption studies, this method is a particularly promising archive mining tool. 1...|$|E
40|$|We present new {{observations}} of PKS 2155 - 304 with the Chandra Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG), using the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). We confirm {{the detection of}} an absorption line plausibly identified as O VIII Lyα from a warm-hot intergalactic medium associated {{with a small group}} of galaxies along the line of sight, as originally reported by Fang and coworkers. Combining the previous observations by Fang and coworkers with five new long observations on the same target, we increase the total exposure time by a factor of 3 and the total counts per resolution element by a factor of 5. The measured line equivalent width is smaller than that observed by Fang and coworkers, but still consistent at 90 % confidence. We also analyze the XMM-Newton observations on the same target, as well as observations using the combination of the Chandra LETG and the High Resolution Camera (HRC). These observations have been used to challenge our reported detection. While no line is seen in either the XMM-Newton or the Chandra LETG+HRC data, we find that our result is consistent with the upper limits from both data sets. We attribute the nondetection to (1) the higher quality of the Chandra LETG+ACIS spectrum and (2) the rather extended wings of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>functions</b> of both the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) and the Chandra LETG+HRC. We discuss the implication of our observation on the temperature and density of the absorber. We also confirm the detection of z ~ 0 O VII absorption, and, comparing with previous Chandra analysis, we obtain much tighter constraints on the line properties...|$|R

The linearity of the system has been investigated varying the impinging photon flux up to paralyzation. The ratio between detector counts and number of impinging photons, {{as a function of}} energy and discriminator thresholds, has been measured. The pixel noise has been evaluated and the result compared with the theoretical Poisson model. Eventually, the spatial resolution has been evaluated by measuring the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> at different energies and discriminator thresholds...|$|E
40|$|The design, fabrication, and {{performance}} of optics for X-ray astronomy and laboratory applications are described and illustrated with diagrams, drawings, graphs, photographs, and sample images. Particular attention {{is given to the}} Wolter I telescope developed for spectroscopic observation of 8 - 30 -A cosmic X-ray sources from a rocketborne X-ray Objective Grating Spectrometer; this instrument employs three nested paraboloid-hyperboloid mirrors of 5083 Al alloy, figured by diamond turning and covered with a thin coating of acrylic lacquer prior to deposition of a 40 -nm-thick layer of Sn. In calibration tests at NASA Marshall, the FWHM of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> at 1. 33 nm was found to be 240 microns, corresponding to 21 arcsec.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the overall point-spread function (PSF) of multispectral scanner systems was studied using real scene data and known geometric {{structures in the}} scene. A direct solution to an approximate form of the PSF was made along with a method using the derivative of an estimated edge response. Both results agreed closely. The TM scanner system specifications are given in <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> width and these values are listed with the experimental results in terms of meters. The estimated values are very reasonable, considering the number of factors which could be influencing the result. The atmosphere will have a blurring effect on the overall PSF {{as well as on}} cubic convolution resampling effects and possible electronic effects not accounted for in the specification. Also, the specific definition of the LSF specification is not known nor is the actual altitude at the instant the data were acquired. Thus the nominal overall PSF half-amplitude width of 39 m is reasonable; however, a greater sample of scene objects should be evaluated to furthur verify this result...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{two ways}} in which the Fourier transforms of images that consist solely of randomly distributed electrons (shot noise) can be used to compare the relative performance of different electronic cameras. The principle is to determine how closely the Fourier transform of a given image does, or does not, approach that of an image produced by an ideal camera, i. e. one for which single-electron events are modeled as Kronecker delta functions located at the same pixels where the electrons were incident on the camera. Experimentally, the average width of the single-electron response is characterized by fitting a single Lorentzian function to the azimuthally averaged amplitude of the Fourier transform. The reciprocal of the spatial frequency at which the Lorentzian function falls to a value of 0. 5 provides an estimate of the number of pixels at which the corresponding <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> falls to a value of 1 /e. In addition, the excess noise due to stochastic variations in the magnitude of the response of the camera (for single-electron events) is characterized by the amount to which the appropriately normalized power spectrum does, or does not, exceed the total number of electrons in the image. These simple measurements provide an easy way to evaluate the relative performance of different cameras. To illustrate this point we present data for three different types of scintillator-coupled camera plus a silicon-pixel (direct detection) camera. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|Aims. We {{provide an}} easy-to-use full-spectrum fitting package and explore its {{applications}} to (i) {{the determination of}} the stellar atmospheric parameters and (ii) the study of the history of stellar populations. Methods. We developed ULySS, a package to fit spectroscopic observations against a linear combination of non-linear model components convolved with a parametric line-of-sight velocity distribution. The minimization can be either local or global, and determines all the parameters in a single fit. We use chi 2 maps, convergence maps and Monte-Carlo simulations to study the degeneracies, local minima and to estimate the errors. Results. We show the importance of determining the shape of the continuum simultaneously to the other parameters by including a multiplicative polynomial in the model (without prior pseudo-continuum determination, or rectification of the spectrum). We also stress the benefice of using an accurate <b>line-spread</b> <b>function,</b> depending on the wavelength, so that the line-shape of the models properly match the observation. For simple models, i. e., to measure the atmospheric parameters or the age/metallicity of a single-age stellar population, there is often a unique minimum, or when local minima exist they can unambiguously be recognized. For more complex models, Monte-Carlo simulations are required to assess the validity of the solution. Conclusions. The ULySS package is public, simple to use and flexible. The full spectrum fitting makes optimal usage of the signal. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figures, submitted to A&A Package available at: [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{modulation}} {{transfer function}} (MTF) {{of a medical}} imaging display is typically determined by measuring its response to square waves (bar patterns), white noise, and/or line stimuli. However, square waves and white noise methods involve capture and analysis of multiple images and are thus quite tedious. Measurement of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> (LSF) offers a good alternative. However, as previously reported, low-frequency response obtained from the LSF method {{is not as good}} as that obtained from measurement of edge-spread function (ESF). In this paper, we present two methods for evaluating the MTF of a medical imaging display from its ESF. High degree of accuracy in the higher frequency region (near the Nyquist frequency of the system) was achieved by reducing the noise. In the first method, whichis a variant of the Gans' original method, the periodic raster noise is reduced by subtracting a shifted ESF from the ESF. The second method employs a low-pass differentiator (LPD). A novel near maximally flat LPD with the desired cut-off frequency was designed for this purpose. Noise reduction in both the methods was alsoachieved by averaging over large portions of the image data to form the ESF. Experimental results show that the MTF obtained by these methods is comparable to that obtained from the square wave response. Furthermore, the MTFs of rising and falling edges of a cathode ray tube (CRT) were measured. The results show that the rising and falling vertical MTFs are practically the same, whereas the rising horizontal MTF is poorer than the falling horizontal MTF in the midfrequency region...|$|E
40|$|Stellar spectra {{depend on}} the stellar {{parameters}} and on dozens of photospheric elemental abundances. Simultaneous fitting of these N∼ 10 - 40 model labels to observed spectra has been deemed unfeasible, {{because the number of}} ab initio spectral model grid calculations scales exponentially with N. We suggest instead the construction of a polynomial spectral model (PSM) of order O for the model flux at each wavelength. Building this approximation requires a minimum of only N+OO calculations: e. g. a quadratic spectral model (O= 2) to fit N= 20 labels simultaneously, can be constructed from as few as 231 ab initio spectral model calculations; in practice, a somewhat larger number (∼ 300 - 1000) of randomly chosen models lead to a better performing PSM. Such a PSM can be a good approximation only over a portion of label space, which will vary case by case. Yet, taking the APOGEE survey as an example, a single quadratic PSM provides a remarkably good approximation to the exact ab initio spectral models across much of this survey: for random labels within that survey the PSM approximates the flux to within 10 ^- 3, and recovers the abundances to within ∼ 0. 02 dex rms of the exact models. This enormous speed-up enables the simultaneous many-label fitting of spectra with computationally expensive ab initio models for stellar spectra, such as non-LTE models. A PSM also enables the simultaneous fitting of observational parameters, such as the spectrum's continuum or <b>line-spread</b> <b>function.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, ApJL (Accepted for publication- 2016 May 9...|$|E
40|$|Multiple-crystal, multidetector, single-photon {{emission}} tomo graphic (SPECT) {{systems have}} recently been introduced for cross-sectional imaging of the head (1 â€” 4). The high sensitivity shown by these systems, when compared with SPECT systems using a rotating camera, {{is due to the}} more effective design of fo cusing collimators and the ability to move the detectors close to the organ being imaged. The shortcoming of the collimators in corporated in these non-Anger devices is the inability to produce contiguous transverse sections without axially translating the device or patient. The ability to sample contiguous sections is particularly important for rapid studies such as regional mea surements of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with Xe-l 33. Patient repositioning is practical for static imaging studies when the lo calization of the radiopharmaceutical is stable with time. Figure I is a schematic of the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> for a system that pro vides transverse sections simultaneously. * Note that two complete sections of information are missed by the present collimator (ar rows). The clinical significance of missing data from 2 -cm gaps is obvious. This problem is exemplified in Fig. 2.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{successful}} science verification phase of a new observing mode at the Keck interferometer, which provides a <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> width and sampling of 150 km/s at K'-band, at a current limiting magnitude of K'~ 7 mag with spatial resolution of lam/ 2 B ~ 2. 7 mas and a measured differential phase stability of unprecedented precision (3 mrad at K= 5 mag, which represents 3 uas on sky or a centroiding precision of 10 ^- 3). The scientific potential of this mode is demonstrated by the presented observations of the circumstellar disk of the evolved Be-star 48 Lib. In addition to indirect methods such as multi-wavelength spectroscopy and polaritmetry, the here described spectro-interferometric astrometry provides a new tool to directly constrain the radial density structure in the disk. We resolve {{for the first time}} several Pfund emission lines, in addition to BrGam, in a single interferometric spectrum, and with adequate spatial and spectral resolution and precision to analyze the radial disk structure in 48 Lib. The data suggest that the continuum and Pf-emission originates in significantly more compact regions, inside of the BrGam emission zone. Thus, spectro-interferometric astrometry opens the opportunity to directly connect the different observed line profiles of BrGam and Pfund in the total and correlated flux to different disk radii. The gravitational potential of a rotationally flattened Be star is expected to induce a one-armed density perturbation in the circumstellar disk. Such a slowly rotating disk oscillation has been used to explain the well known periodic V/R spectral profile variability in these stars, as well as the observed V/R cycle phase shifts between different disk emission lines. The differential line properties and linear constraints set by our data lend support to the existence of a radius-dependent disk density perturbation.

40|$|In {{this series}} of two papers we {{describe}} a project with STIS on HST to measure the line-of-sight velocities of stars in the central few arcsec of the dense globular cluster M 15. This first paper focuses on the observations and reduction of the data. We `scanned' the central region of M 15 spectroscopically by consecutively placing an 0. 1 arcsec slit at 18 adjacent positions. Careful and complicated data reduction and analysis were required. The spectral pixel size exceeds the velocity dispersion of M 15, which puts the project at the limit of what is feasible with STIS. We applied corrections for the following effects: drifts in the STIS wavelength scale during an HST orbit; the orbital velocity component of HST along the line-of-sight to the cluster, and its variations during the HST orbit; and the apparent wavelength shift that is perceived for a star that is not centered in the slit. To make these corrections we present a detailed study of the HST/STIS point-spread function and <b>line-spread</b> <b>function.</b> We also present a catalog with positions and U, B and V magnitudes of 31, 983 stars in M 15, created from existing HST/WFPC 2 data. We extract 19, 200 one-dimensional spectra from the STIS data, each for a different position in M 15, and each with a velocity scale accurate to better than 2. 5 km/s. We develop an algorithm that co-adds the spectra for individual apertures {{and use it to}} extract spectra of individual stars with minimum blending and maximum S/N. In Paper II we use these spectra to extract the line-of-sight velocities of individual stars.

40|$|The Fourier {{transform}} is {{a convenient}} tool for analyzing {{the performance of}} an image-forming system, but must be treated with caution. One of its major uses is turning convolutions into products. It {{is also used to}} transform a problem that is more naturally thought of in terms of frequency than time or space. We define the point-spread function and modulation transfer function in a two-dimensional linear system as analogues of the one-dimensional impulse response and its Fourier transform, the frequency response, respectively. For many imagine devices, the point-spread function is rotationally symmeteric. Useful tranforms developed for the special cases of a "pill box,", a gaussian blob, and an inverse scatter function. Fourier methods are appropriate in the analysis of a defocused imaging system. We define a focus function as a weighted sum of high frequency terms in the spectrum of the system. This function will be a maximum when the image is in focus, and we can hill-climb on it to determine the best focus. We compare this function against two others, the sum of squares of intensities, and the sum of square of first differences, and show it to be superior. Another use of the Fourier transform is in optimal filtering, that is, of filtering to separate additive noise from a desired signal. We discuss the theory for the two-dimensional case, which is actually easier than for a single dimension since causality is not an issue. We show how to consumerist a linear, shift-invariant filter for imaging systems given only the input power spectrum and cross-power spectrum of input versus desired output.

40|$|We present medium-resolution (lambda/Delta lambda {{similar to}} 20 000) {{ultraviolet}} spectra covering the 1155 - 1760 angstrom spectral {{range of the}} Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509 obtained using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Our observations were obtained simultaneously with a Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer observation using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and {{they are part of}} a multiwavelength campaign in September through December 2009 which also included observations with XMM-Newton, Swift, and INTEGRAL. Our spectra are the highest signal-to-noise observations to date of the intrinsic absorption components seen in numerous prior ultraviolet observations. To take advantage of the high S/N, we describe special calibrations for wavelength, flat-field and <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> corrections that we applied to the COS data. We detect additional complexity in the absorption troughs compared to prior observations made with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on HST. We attribute the UV absorption to a variety of sources in Mrk 509, including an outflow from the active nucleus, the interstellar medium and halo of the host galaxy, and possible infalling clouds or stripped gaseous material from a merger that are illuminated by the ionizing radiation of the active nucleus. Variability between the STIS and COS observation of the most blue-shifted component (# 1) allows us to set an upper limit on its distance of < 250 pc. Similarly, variability of component 6 between FUSE observations limits its distance to < 1. 5 kpc. The absorption lines in all components only partially cover the emission from the active nucleus with covering fractions that are lower than those seen in the prior STIS observations and are comparable to those seen in spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Given the larger apertures of COS and FUSE compared to STIS, we favor scattered light from an extended region near the active nucleus as the explanation for the partial covering. As observed in prior X-ray and UV spectra, the UV absorption has velocities comparable to the X-ray absorption, but the bulk of the ultraviolet absorption is in a lower ionization state with lower total column density than the gas responsible for the X-ray absorption. We conclude that the outflow from the active nucleus is a multiphase wind...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} a measurement method {{for evaluating the}} resolution properties of CT imaging systems across reconstruction algorithms, dose, and contrast. METHODS: An algorithm was developed to extract the task-based modulation transfer function (MTF) from disk images generated from the rod inserts in the ACR phantom (model 464 Gammex, WI). These inserts are conventionally employed for HU accuracy assessment. The edge of the disk objects was analyzed to determine the edge-spread function, which was differentiated to yield the <b>line-spread</b> <b>function</b> and Fourier-transformed to generate the object-specific MTF for task-based assessment, denoted MTF(Task). The proposed MTF measurement method was validated against the conventional wire technique and further applied to measure the MTF of CT images reconstructed with an adaptive statistical iterative algorithm (ASIR) and a model-based iterative (MBIR) algorithm. Results were further compared to the standard filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm. Measurements were performed and compared across different doses and contrast levels to ascertain the MTF(Task) dependencies on those factors. RESULTS: For the FBP reconstructed images, the MTF(Task) measured with the inserts {{were the same as}} the MTF measured from the wire-based method. For the ASIR and MBIR data, the MTF(Task) using the high contrast insert was similar to the wire-based MTF and equal or superior to that of FBP. However, results for the MTF(Task) measured using the low-contrast inserts, the MTF(Task) for ASIR and MBIR data was lower than for the FBP, which was constant throughout all measurements. Similarly, as a function of mA, the MTF(Task) for ASIR and MBIR varied as a function of noise [...] with MTF(Task) being proportional to mA. Overall greater variability of MTF(Task) across dose and contrast was observed for MBIR than for ASIR. CONCLUSIONS: This approach provides a method for assessing the task-based MTF of a CT system using conventional and iterative reconstructions. Results demonstrated that the object-specific MTF can vary as a function of dose and contrast. The analysis highlighted the paradigm shift for iterative reconstructions when compared to FBP, where iterative reconstructions generally offer superior noise performance but with varying resolution as a function of dose and contrast. The MTF(Task) generated by this method is expected to provide a more comprehensive assessment of image resolution across different reconstruction algorithms and imaging tasks...|$|E
