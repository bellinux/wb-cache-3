Our analysis relates the role of <b>leading</b> <b>indicator</b> variables to {{the duration of the}} manager's incentive contract. With short-term contracts, <b>leading</b> <b>indicator</b> variables are essential in mitigating a hold up problem resulting from the fact that investments are sunk {{at the end of the}} first period.
