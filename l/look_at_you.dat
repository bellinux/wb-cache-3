500|$|... "It's All Too Much" [...] was remixed for {{inclusion}} on the Yellow Submarine album on 16 October 1968. The vocals and handclaps were processed using automatic double tracking, so allowing these parts to be split across the stereo image. For this version, {{the song was}} edited down from the original eight minutes to a running time of 6:28, making it the longest officially released Beatles track written by Harrison. The edit was achieved by cutting a 35-second portion from around the three-minute mark, thereby removing the third chorus and the fourth verse (the last of which, beginning with the line [...] "Time for me to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and {{you to look at}} me", had appeared in the film), and by fading out before the final minute of the coda.|$|E

[...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'".

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the hearings, McCarthy and Senator Stuart Symington (D-Missouri) sparred {{over the}} {{handling}} of secret files by McCarthy's staff. [...] McCarthy staff director Frank Carr testified that everyone who worked on McCarthy's staff had access to classified files regardless of their level of security clearance. [...] Symington hinted that some members of McCarthy's own staff might themselves be subversive and signed a document agreeing to take the stand in the hearings to reveal their names in return for McCarthy's signature on the same document agreeing to an investigation of his staff. But McCarthy, after calling Symington [...] "Sanctimonious Stu", refused to sign the agreement, claiming it contained false statements, and called the accusations an [...] "unfounded smear" [...] on his men. He then rebuked Symington by saying [...] "You're not fooling anyone!" [...] But Symington retaliated with a prophetic remark of his own: [...] "Senator, the American people have had a <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> now for six weeks; you're not fooling anyone, either." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, during the Regency {{of the future}} King George IV, the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George Beau Brummel. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form. [...] The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight {{trousers}} to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on {{the form of the}} body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, [...] "If people turn to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> in the street, you are not well dressed." [...] This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes. [...] Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} figures {{provide a}} visual illustration {{of how the}} Fourier transform measures whether a frequency is present in a particular function. The depicted function [...] oscillates at 3Hz (if [...] measures seconds) and tends quickly to 0. (The second factor in this equation is an envelope function that shapes the continuous sinusoid into a short pulse. Its general form is a Gaussian function). This function was specially chosen {{to have a real}} Fourier transform that can easily be plotted. The first image contains its graph. In order to calculate [...] we must integrate [...] The second image shows the plot of the real and imaginary parts of this function. The real part of the integrand is almost always positive, because when [...] is negative, the real part of [...] is negative as well. Because they oscillate at the same rate, when [...] is positive, so is the real part of [...] The result is that when you integrate the real part of the integrand you get a relatively large number (in this case [...] ). On the other hand, when you try to measure a frequency that is not present, as in the case when we <b>look</b> <b>at</b> , <b>you</b> see that both real and imaginary component of this function vary rapidly between positive and negative values, as plotted in the third image. Therefore, in this case, the integrand oscillates fast enough so that the integral is very small and the value for the Fourier transform for that frequency is nearly zero.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is officially}} {{considered}} as the founding father of now famous Barça-Ajax school of football (also known as 'Barçajax school'), with a distinctive footballing philosophy and predominant style of play, that {{was born in}} Barcelona but has roots in the 1970s Dutch (Amsterdam) school of Total Football. La Masia, Barça's youth academy and talent factory, was among Cruyff's lasting legacy. It {{was the brainchild of}} Cruyff. In 1979, he wanted to establish a copy of the Ajax Youth Academy in Barcelona. His proposal was accepted by president Josep Núñez. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. On 11 July 2010, Spain won the World Cup final with eight players from Barcelona; seven were from La Masia, and six of them were in the starting line-up: Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, and Pedro. This set a record for the most players to be provided by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. On 10 January 2011, La Masia achieved a record breaking honour becoming the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year, with Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi. On 25 November 2012, {{for the first time in}} the club's history, away at Levante's Estadi Ciutat de València, Barcelona played with eleven players formed at La Masia. In an English biography of Pep Guardiola, Guillem Balagué writes, [...] "Cruyff introduced some passing drills into Barça's 'arterial' system. And since then, the rondos have been not just a method but a symbol of the club's playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. Cruyff blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy – the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of Barcelona had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with Real Madrid, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishment," [...] and adding, “Xavi Hernández describes the style in its purest form: 'I pass the ball and move, or I pass the ball and stay where I am. I make myself available to help you; I <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b> I stop, I keep my head up and look, and, above all, I open up the pitch. Whoever has the ball is running play. That comes from the school of Johan Cuyff and Pep Guardiola. This is Barça.'" [...] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, former Barcelona manager Guardiola stated, [...] "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] And one of the most famous La Masia graduates, Xavi, said, [...] "He [...] changed the idiosyncrasy of the club. He introduced the philosophy to keep the ball, to play in triangles, to attack. That philosophy remains true to this day. We're all students of Cruyff and his school of thought." ...|$|E
