40|$|International audienceBy {{applying}} nanosecond current pulses {{to narrow}} superconducting Nb strips, we have observed the induced resistive states expected for quasi 1 -D transport, namely localized phase-slip centres (PSC) and hot spots (HS). The current-controlled drive discriminates stable-in-time PSC structures near Tc from expanding HS at lower temperatures. HS-PSC exchange and return towards equilibrium are studied by using two-step current pulses. Remarkably, {{it appears that}} a hot spot never forms unless a PSC has first been nucleated. Then from a plot of the threshold currents Ic(T) and Ih(T), corresponding to PSC and HS, respectively, one can predict the response to current, temperature, or <b>luminous</b> <b>excitation,</b> {{as well as the}} effect of an applied magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{specular}} reflection, background color and specimen thickness {{on the color}} of four commercial denture resins was studied by reflection spectrophotometry. Higher values of <b>luminous</b> reflectance and <b>excitation</b> purity were obtained with a white than with a black background, whereas dominant wavelength was lowered slightly...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} thickness, {{background}} color, specular reflection, and surface roughness {{on the color}} of five commercial restorative resins were studied by reflection spectrophotometry. As thickness increased, values of <b>luminous</b> reflectance and <b>excitation</b> purity increased for a black background but decreased for a white background. Opacity increased dramatically as thickness increased from 1. 3 to 3. 9 mm...|$|R
40|$|The color {{stability}} of seven commercial composite resins, an unfilled resin, and three glazes was studied {{under conditions of}} accelerated aging by reflection spectrophotometry and visually with Munsell color tabs. After aging for 900 hours, most of the resins had lower values of <b>luminous</b> reflectance and <b>excitation</b> purity and higher values of dominant wavelength and contrast ratio compared to values at baseline...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of CO(1 - 0) emission in the strongly lensed high-redshift quasars IRAS F 10214 + 4724 (z= 2. 286), the Cloverleaf (z= 2. 558), RX J 0911 + 0551 (z= 2. 796), SMM J 04135 + 10277 (z= 2. 846), and MG 0751 + 2716 (z= 3. 200), using the Expanded Very Large Array and the Green Bank Telescope. We report lensing-corrected CO(1 - 0) line luminosities of L'(CO) = 0. 34 - 18. 4 x 10 ^ 10 K km/s pc^ 2 and total molecular gas masses of M(H 2) = 0. 27 - 14. 7 x 10 ^ 10 Msun for the sources in our sample. Based on CO line ratios relative to previously reported observations in J>= 3 rotational transitions and line excitation modeling, {{we find that the}} CO(1 - 0) line strengths in our targets are consistent with single, highly-excited gas components with constant brightness temperature up to mid-J levels. We thus do not find any evidence for <b>luminous</b> extended, low <b>excitation,</b> low surface brightness molecular gas components. These properties are comparable to those found in z> 4 quasars with existing CO(1 - 0) observations. These findings stand in contrast to recent CO(1 - 0) observations of z~ 2 - 4 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs), which have lower CO excitation and show evidence for multiple excitation components, including some low-excitation gas. These findings are consistent with the picture that gas-rich quasars and SMGs represent different stages in the early evolution of massive galaxies.
