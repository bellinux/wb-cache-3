40|$|A {{variety of}} undoped (nonintrinsic) {{hydrogenated}} amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin films was studied in greater detail using steady-state photoconductivity, σph, subband-gap absorption, α(hν), steady-state photocarrier grating (SSPG), and electron-spin-resonance (ESR) techniques both in the annealed and stabilized <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> states. The experimental results were self-consisiently modeled using a detailed numerical analysis. It was found that large differences in the optoelectronic properties of device quality a-Si:H thin films can only be explained using a gap slate distribution which consists of positively charged D+ defect states above the Fermi level, the neutral D 0 defect states, and the negatively charged D- defect states below the Fermi level. There are large differences both in the densities of neutral and charged defect states and R ratios in different a-Si:H films in the annealed state. The densities of both neutral and charged defect states increased, however, R ratios decreased in the stabilized <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> state. Very good agreement was obtained between the densities of neutral defect states measured by ESR and those derived from the numerical analysis in the stabilized <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> state. The kinetics of the Staebler-Wronski effect was also investigated. There was no direct correlation between the decrease of steady-state photoconductivity and increase of subband-gap absorption. The self-consistent fits to wide range of experimental results obtained with the three Gaussian distributions of charged defect states imply that this model is much better representation of the bulk defect states in undoped {{hydrogenated amorphous silicon}} thin films...|$|R

5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, scan speed, <b>light</b> <b>soaking,</b> biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from forward-bias to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, filling of trap states, [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the effects of intense <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> at room {{temperature}} (RT) and at 77 K on the defect density in hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). It is found that at short light-soaking times, <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> at RT is more efficient in creating metastable defects than at 77 K. With increasing light-soaking time, however, 77 -K <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> causes the defect density to increase at a higher rate than does RT <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> There are signs that the saturated value of the defect density for 77 -K <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> is larger than that for RT <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> Qualitatively, a correlation exists between the increase in the defect density and the decrease in the photoconductivity; however, an inverse proportionality is not observed between the photoconductivity and defect density. For a given defect density, the photoconductivity is smaller for 77 -K <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> than for RT <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> The defects generated by 77 -K <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> are found to be stable at 77 K. However, significant annealing of defects occurs after raising the sample temperature to RT. Light-induced annealing of defects is also observed. We explain our results by adopting the views that there is a broad distribution of defect-annealing activation energies and that the defects with small annealing activation energies are more effective recombination centers than those with large annealing activation energies. We show that many other related experimental results can also be accounted for by the above views. © 1994 The American Physical Society...|$|E

The effects of the disorder and defect states can be observed in the a(hn) spectrum. For this goal, dual beam photoconductivity technique (DBP) has been established and applied to the hydrogenated amorphous silicon, (a-Si:H), thin films prepared by different deposition systems, both in the annealed and <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> states. In the annealed state, the effects of the native defect states in a-Si:H films were studied using dark conductivity, steady state photoconductivity and the DBP technique. The samples showed different dark and photoconductivity values. The a(hn) spectrum obtained from the DBP measured at different bias light intensities shows three regions. At high energies, parabolic extended state absorption dominates. As energy decreases below the bandgap, the exponential valence band tail absorption appears. At energies below 1. 4 eV, the subgap absorption due to the midgap defect states exhibits a shoulder in the spectrum. Absorption coefficient at a (1. 2 eV) showed variation among the films. Photoconductivity and subgap absorption values could not be correlated directly. This implies that more than one type of native defects is present in a-Si:H. In the <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> state, samples were left under a white light source of a few sun intensity. All the samples showed the Staebler-Wronski effect. However, the magnitude of degradation in photoconductivity is different for all the samples and is not directly proportional to the increased subgap absorption. It is inferred that both measurements are not controlled by the same defect states. As a summary, the DBP technique established in this thesis was found to be a reliable characterization tool to study amorphous and microcrystalline silicon films. The DBP results with those of photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) and constant photocurrent method (CPM) techniques showed very good agr eement, implying that DBP is a reliable spectroscopic tool for future investigations...|$|R

In this thesis to obtain reliable information about the native and light induced defect states present in a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various germanium concentrations SSPC, DBP, transmission spectroscopy and PDS techniques have been used. A procedure based on Ritter Weiser optical formulation {{has been applied to}} calculate fringe free absolute absorption coefficient spectra of a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various Ge% from the yield DBP and simultaneously measured transmission signals for the first time. The results have been compared with those independently measured by PDS method. In the annealed state the effects of native defect states in a-SiGe:H alloy thin films of various Ge% have been investigated. For the a-SiGe:H alloy films with Ge concentration in the range of 10 % to 30 %, hntn-products for the photogenerated free electrons is the highest, therefore they serve as the best photoconductive absorber layer in the multijunction solar cells. The effect of Ge content in amorphous silicon network clearly indicates a systematic decrease in the bandgap with increasing Ge content. The E 0 v values are almost constant around 55 meV for alloying up to 40 % Ge. Finally the changes in the defect density present in the bandgap of alloy films are inferred from the α(1. 0 eV) measured by both PDS and low bias light DBP spectrum. The difference between PDS and low bias DBP spectra is attributed to the underlying physics of these methods. The best film with lowest defect density can be prepared with alloying Ge in the range from 10 % to 40 % Ge. In the <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> state, samples were left under white light illumination (15 suns) for determined time intervals.

The method for energy yield prediction based on performance surfaces under development at the ESTI laboratory uses the module temperature and incident irradiance as independent variables and has proved successful in prediction of real energy production for crystalline Si modules. However, the determination of an energy rating of CIS modules is more complex and it was found to be difficult to accurately predict the module performance based on simulator measurements. The Energy Rating procedure is based on determining the maximum power point Pmax {{as a function of the}} irradiance and the ambient temperature using pulsed simulator measurements. Short and long term outdoor measurements have been performed in order to test the method's accuracy. It has been observed that the power measured on the simulator is in general lower than that measured outdoors and this is a significant cause of the difficulties in making accurate energy predictions.

40|$|Light-induced {{degradation}} (LID) is {{a well-known}} problem faced by p-type Czochralski (Cz) monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si) wafer solar cells. In mono-Si material, the physical mechanism has been traced {{to the formation of}} recombination active boron-oxygen (B-O) complexes, which can be permanently deactivated through a regeneration process. In recent years, LID has also been identified to be a significant problem for multicrystalline silicon (multi-Si) wafer solar cells, but the exact physical mechanism is still unknown. In this work, we study the effect of LID in two different solar cell structures, aluminium back-surface-field (Al-BSF) and aluminium local back-surface-field (Al-LBSF or PERC (passivated emitter and rear cell)) multi-Si solar cells. The large-area (156 mm x 156 mm) multi-Si solar cells are <b>light</b> <b>soaked</b> under constant 1 -sun illumination at elevated temperatures of 90 degrees C.

An important finding of this work is that Al-BSF solar cells can also achieve almost complete regeneration, which has not been reported before. The maximum degradation in Al-BSF cells is shown to reduce from 2 % (relative) to an average of 1. 5 % (relative) with heavier phosphorus diffusion. (C) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{experimental}} investigation {{on the performance}} of Ruthenium-based Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) at different irradiance levels, incident wavelengths and hours of illumination. In particular, the measurements have been aimed at studying the performance variation due to <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> effect since this phenomenon has noteworthy practical implications, such as stability tests of DSSCs. Our results show that the short circuit current density, the open circuit voltage and the conversion efficiency η increase with the hours of <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> Finally, the observed phenomenon is reversible, and thus the performance decreases again when the cell is kept in the dark...|$|E
40|$|Microcrystalline silicon {{solar cells}} {{deposited}} by VHF-PECVD {{with or without}} HWCVD grown p/i interface buffer layer were investigated. We studied long-term stability under storage in ambient atmosphere and performed <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> experiments. Cells with i-layers covering {{a wide range of}} crystalline volume fractions were studied. All cells were stable or degraded slightly after storage for 2 years in air, regardless of crystalline volume fraction or presence of p/i buffer interface. Upon <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> all cells show efficiency degradation to more or less extent depending on crystal volume fraction of the i-layer and the presence of the buffer layer: the solar cell with high crystal volume fraction are nearly stable, cells with high amorphous volume fraction degrade by up to 20 %. The solar cell with HWCVD buffer layer shows better stability in the high efficiency range of relative efficiency degradation typically less than 10 % after 1000 h AM 1. 5 <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> The efficiency degradation is mainly caused by Voc and FF deterioration while Jsc is almost stable.

40|$|This study {{reports a}} {{doubling}} of the effective minority carrier lifetime under <b>light</b> <b>soaking</b> conditions, observed in a boron-doped p-type Czochralski grown silicon wafer passivated by a phosphorus-doped silicon nitride thin film. The analysis of capacitance-voltage curves revealed that the fixed charge in this phosphorus-doped silicon nitride film was negative, which was unlike the well-known positive fixed charges observed in traditional undoped silicon nitride. The analysis results revealed that the enhancement phenomenon of minority carrier lifetime {{was caused by the}} abrupt increase in the density of negative fixed charge (from 7. 2 x 10 (11) to 1. 2 x 10 (12) cm(- 2)) after <b>light</b> <b>soaking.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

40|$|Light {{was found}} to be the most {{important}} factor affecting its seed germination. Under <b>light</b> conditions, <b>soaking</b> the seed for 30 min. in 50 ppm GA and 40 �C hot water enhanced germination rate significantly. Under dark conditions, the seeds treated with KNO were the only ones germinating effectively. 3 The results suggest that Hypericum perforatum seeds exhibit both exogenous and endogenous dormancy. To over come former originating from a chemical inhibitor in exudate from capsule, washing with water, 40 �C hot water and 50 ppm GA treatments; to over come later related with absence of light, 0. 01 mol KNO 3 treatment were recommended...|$|R
40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in the {{important}} areas of stability, advanced deposition techniques, efficiency, the back contact, no-contact film diagnostics (photoluminescence) and Cd waste control. The progress in stability has been in both the demonstration of devices maintaining at least 90 % of the initial efficiency for over 19, 000 hours of continuous <b>light</b> <b>soak</b> and the development of methods which can accurately predict long term behavior based on the first 5, 000 [...] 10, 000 hours of life. Experiments were conducted to determine if device behavior could be accelerated with thermal or voltage stresses. Notable achievements in deposition technology include depositing CdTe on a 3, 600 cm{sup 2 } substrate at 600 torr and designing and fabricating a new deposition feed system with a remote semiconductor source. The efficiency has been increased on small area devices to 13. 3 % by decreasing the thickness of the CdS and of the glass substrate. Work also focused on using a high resistivity SnO{sub 2 } buffer layer between the TCO and thin CdS to help preserve the open-circuit voltage while increasing the current-density. The back contacting process has been simplified by replacing the wet post-deposition etch with a vapor Te deposition step on small area devices. Results show that the devices perform comparably in efficiency but better in stability under light-soaking and open-circuit conditions. Preliminary studies of the correlation between CdS photoluminescence after the chloride treatment and the final device efficiency have shown a positive correlation which may be applicable for in-line quality control. The final area of progress was through the successful demonstration of preventing at least 99. 9 % of all incoming Cd from leaving in an uncontrolled manner through the land, air or water...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the Phase 1 effort {{concerned}} further development of ZnO buffer layers. This work included further optimization of the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) growth process and investigations of the interaction of zinc and oxygen with the absorber layers. Although {{much of the work}} had been done with Siemens' CIS material prior to this reporting period, a process for growing ZnO buffer layers on Siemens' CIGSS absorber had not been developed. The authors determined that a two-step procedure involving raising the substrate temperature to 250 C in nitrogen and then growing the buffer layer at 100 C works well with CIGSS material. Through collaboration with the Institute of Energy Conversion (IEC), completed cells with efficiencies in the 11 % to 12 % range were fabricated with the following structure: RF n-ZnO/i-ZnO/CIGSS. Cells with this structure were included as part of the Transient team studies. Cells were subjected to dark storage at 80 C, followed by a <b>light</b> <b>soak</b> at 40 C at IEC. Illuminated I-V curves taken at each stage of the study determined that these cells do not degrade under dark-storage conditions, which had been observed for Siemens cells with CdS buffer layers. To understand the reaction of zinc and oxygen with the absorber layers, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) depth concentration profiles were obtained for i-ZnO/CIS structures through collaboration with Angus Rockett at the University of Illinois. SIMS profiles were obtained for ZnO films grown on polycrystalline CIS and epitaxial CIS films grown on GaAs. Comparison of the profiles strongly suggests that zinc and oxygen diffuse into the CIS along grain boundaries during the MOCVD growth process. It is also proposed that excess zinc along grain boundaries may result in the grain boundaries being n-type, which can result in enhanced loss currents. This model is consistent with the apparent requirement that cell structures with MOCVD buffer layers must undergo an aging process in air before efficient cells can be obtained. Future studies will investigate processes that allow the aging step to be eliminated...|$|R
