The music was {{recorded}} at Rome's Forum Studio in July 1980, and was fraught with difficulties — the studio was not <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his orchestra, and room noise made by the players and their equipment affected the tracks.|$|E
5|$|The {{printing}} equipment was also delivered in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from Hahnemühle; it was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> four notes to be printed on each sheet. Production of counterfeit notes started in January 1943; {{it took a}} year for production {{to return to the}} levels achieved in Operation Andreas.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminal}} has {{stands for}} 24 aircraft, of which eight of sixteen at Terminal A have jetbridges. Four stands (two at each terminal is size code D (<b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> an Airbus A330 or a Boeing 757), while 20 are for size category C (<b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737). Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30–37), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25–29) {{are used for}} domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42-49). The Air Force has six stands for military freight planes up {{to the size of}} a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy (code F), although one is permanently used for deicing.|$|E

5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids. It was classified as a dwarf planet in 2006 when {{the definition of a}} planet was created.|$|E
5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence {{is that he}} has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles has put upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E

5|$|The Mao {{family lived}} in a clay-brick {{farmhouse}} which had been constructed in 1878, although Yichang oversaw its extension during Zedong's boyhood. They occupied the eastern wing of their house, with the neighboring Zou family living in the western half. The building was <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Zedong to be allocated his own bedroom; a rarity at the time. In {{front of the house}} was a pond and a rice paddy, while pine and bamboo groves grew behind the building.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Moore {{created an}} edition of 10 working models (LH 504) {{for a new}} two-piece sculpture. The Tate Gallery in London {{acquired}} a small working model in 1963. Other working models are in the collections of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, the Didrichsen Art Museum in Helsinki, the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York, and the Kunsthaus in Zurich. Moore planned the full-size sculpture to be over 10 feet high, <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a person to walk between the two elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{escape route}} led {{up through a}} fan vent; the prisoners removed the fan and motor, {{replacing}} them with a steel grill and leaving a shaft <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> a prisoner to enter. Stealing a carborundum abrasive cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill. In their beds, they placed papier-mâché dummies made with human hair stolen from the barbershop. The escapees also constructed an inflatable raft over many weeks from over 50 stolen raincoats, which they prepared {{on the top of}} the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. They escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1960s, Beth El's synagogue was {{no longer}} <b>large</b> <b>enough,</b> {{particularly}} <b>for</b> its religious school, which had become overcrowded. A committee's proposal to expand the synagogue building included a larger social hall, additional classrooms, and a room for youth groups. The expansion plan was approved in 1967.|$|R
5|$|The hotel {{had its own}} railway platform, Track 61, {{that was}} part of the New York City Subway and was {{connected}} to the Grand Central Terminal complex. The platform was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt, James Farley, Adlai Stevenson, and Douglas MacArthur, among others. The platform was also used for the exhibition of American Locomotive Company's new diesel locomotive in 1946. In 1948, Filene's and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad also staged a fashion show on the platform. An elevator <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Franklin D. Roosevelt's automobile provides access to the platform. However, it is rarely opened to the public.|$|E
5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her to need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became {{a key part of}} Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

5|$|Common loons {{are mainly}} Nearctic, and breed from 48° N to the Arctic Circle, locally south to 40° N and north to 78° N. During their {{breeding}} season {{in spring and}} summer, most common loons live on lakes and other waterways in the northern United States and Canada, {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland, in Iceland, in Svalbard, in Jan Mayen, and in Bear Island in Norway; and in Alaska, to the west, and very rarely in Scotland, to the east. Their summer habitat ranges from wooded lakes to tundra ponds. The lakes must be <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> flight take-off, and provide a large population of small fish. Deep lakes with warm surface waters, relatively low biological productivity and low turbidity where their fish prey are easy to see are habitats where breeding loons are more successful in raising young. For protection from predators, common loons favour lakes with islands and coves. They are rare visitors to the Arctic coast. They are known to exhibit high breeding site fidelity.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} 1887; it took {{six years and}} cost £15million (equivalent to about £1.65billion in 2011). When the ship canal opened in January 1894 {{it was the largest}} river {{navigation}} canal in the world, and enabled the newly created Port of Manchester to become Britain's third busiest port despite the city being about 40 miles (64km) inland. Changes to shipping methods and the growth of containerisation during the 1970s and 80s meant that many ships were now too big to use the canal and traffic declined, resulting in the closure of the terminal docks at Salford. Although able to accommodate a range of vessels from coastal ships to inter-continental cargo liners, the canal is not <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> most modern vessels. By 2011 traffic had decreased from its peak in 1958 of 18million long tons (20million short tons) of freight each year to about 7million long tons (7.8million short tons). The canal is now privately owned by Peel Ports, whose plans include redevelopment, expansion and an increase in shipping from 8,000 containers a year to 100,000 by 2030 as part of their Atlantic Gateway project.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, exports totalled 90,000 barrels, but by 1964 {{had grown}} to 300,000 barrels. By 1959, sales in Ghana had grown <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> Guinness to {{establish}} a joint venture {{in the country with}} the United Africa Company. By 1962, Nigeria had become the largest export market for Guinness, with around 100,000 barrels exported to the country every year. This led the company to build a brewery in Ikeja in western Nigeria to supply the demand; it was only the third brewery in the company's history. The brewery cost over £2 million, had a 150,000 barrel capacity, and was 60 per cent owned by Guinness Nigeria, 25 per cent by the United Africa Company with the remaining shares held by local Nigerian interests. Breweries followed in Malaysia (1965), Cameroon (1970) and Ghana (1971), whilst licences were granted to other companies to brew Guinness under contract in other African countries and the West Indies. Historically a small proportion of Guinness production, it was this success, especially in Africa but also in Asia, that allowed FES to grow into a 4.5 million hectolitre brand.|$|E

30|$|In effect, {{this study}} raises the {{on-going}} challenge for investigations of PWD, {{that is the}} difficulty in recruiting sufficiently <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> samples <b>for</b> meaningful investigation. The triangulation of research methods in the current work produced a detailed set of results, but, the recruitment situation explains why there is a paucity of research in this particular area.|$|R
5|$|Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected {{enormous}} amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{assigned}} Belcourt to Pembina, North Dakota as {{a missionary}} to the Chippewa and Métis of the Pembina River basin, a tributary to the Red River of the North. Upon arrival at Pembina, Belcourt constructed a small log cabin of 20 feet long by 30 feet wide, {{which was not}} <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> all of his congregation. On August 14, 1848, the missionary baptised his first person in Pembina, and held a Holy Communion class consisting of 92 Native Americans. Needing more resources, Belcourt wrote to the Archbishop of Quebec for money for food and building supplies. He also asked for another Canadian priest well-versed in both French and the Chippewa language, as he noted there were more Métis than Chippewa in the Pembina area. Belcourt described the original territory of the Chippewa in the Pembina district as several hundred miles north to south, and east to west - {{much larger than the}} small reservation to which they were later assigned.|$|E
5|$|There {{remained}} a bottleneck at Finchley Road where the fast and slow tracks converged into one pair {{for the original}} M tunnels to Baker Street. In 1925, a plan was developed for two new tube tunnels, <b>large</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the Met rolling stock that would join the extension line at a junction north of Kilburn & Brondesbury station and run beneath Kilburn High Street, Maida Vale and Edgware Road to Baker Street. The plan included three new stations, at Quex Road, Kilburn Park Road and Clifton Road, but did not progress after Ministry of Transport revised its Requirements for Passenger Lines requiring a means of exit in an emergency {{at the ends of}} trains running in deep-level tubes – compartment stock used north of Harrow did not comply with this requirement. Edgware Road station had been rebuilt with four platforms and had train destination indicators including stations such as Verney Junction and Uxbridge.|$|E
