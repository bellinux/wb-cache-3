25|$|The PW-4 {{was built}} for U.S. Navy Specification No. 96, calling for a carrier-based light fighter. This {{specification}} was eventually revealed as a cover for the Navy's actual desire for an airship fighter, the Curtiss XF9C. The XFA was a single-bay biplane with an all-metal fuselage and metal <b>laminate</b> <b>skin.</b> The construction of its fuselage was innovative in that instead of using lap jointing, the edges of each panel were bent inwards, with the rivets fastening them on the inside, instead of being visible on the surface. It had a gull-type upper wing which was fabric covered. The prototype was ordered in 1930, but the company was engaged in another reorganization, which delayed its work. Delivered for evaluations in 1932, it showed poor flying characteristics, including longitudinal instability and over-sensitive controls. General Aircraft increased {{the area of the}} tail surfaces and made other changes, then returned the prototype for more testing; but now the stability problems were worse. The plane would nose up with more throttle, but then drop its nose when the throttle was reduced. After another round of modifications, and some close calls, the plane was finally classed as unsafe and testing was abandoned.|$|E

A sandwich material consisting of E-glass/vinyl ester <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> and balsa wood core was environmentally aged in hot (70 °C) and humid (85 % relative humidity) conditions for an increasing period up to and exceeding the saturation time. The face skins displayed Fickian diffusion behaviour in the absorption of water whereas the core exhibited significant mass loss due to water causing hydrolysis of bioorganic compounds in the wood. Water absorption decreased the fire structural resistance of the sandwich composite under tensile loading. The saturated sandwich composite exposed to fire failed at lower tensile stresses and within shorter times compared to the dry composite.

The influence of fibre orientation on the time-to-failure and failure mechanism during fire exposure is investigated. Experimental testing reveals that the structural performance of the sandwich composite deteriorates rapidly with increasing fibre offset angle due to glass transition softening of the polymer matrix becoming more dominant, and the fibre properties being less important as the <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> thermally soften and decompose.

The design strategy that we propose is a numerical optimisation procedure that does not make any simplifying assumption to obtain a true global optimum configuration of the system. To face the design of the sandwich structure at both meso and macro scales, we use a two-level optimisation strategy: at the first level we determine the optimal geometry of the unit cell of the core together with the material and geometric parameters of the <b>laminated</b> <b>skins,</b> while at the second level we determine the optimal skins lay-up giving the geometrical and material parameters issued from the first level. The two-level strategy relies both {{on the use of the}} polar formalism for the description of the anisotropic behaviour of the laminates and on the use of a genetic algorithm as optimisation tool to perform the solution search. To prove its effectiveness, we apply our strategy to the least-weight design of a sandwich plate, satisfying several constraints: on the first buckling load, on the positive-definiteness of the stiffness tensor of the core, on the ratio between skins and core thickness and on the admissible moduli for the <b>laminated</b> <b>skins...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the effect of temperature on the static behavior of an hybrid structure consisting of adhesively bonded Fiber Metal <b>Laminate</b> <b>skin</b> to a composite stiffener. This hybrid structure was tested using stiffener pull-off tests, which is a typical set-up used to simulate the structural behaviour of full-scale components subject to out-of-plane loading. The failure mechanism is very similar at the three temperatures tested: - 55 C, Room Temperature and + 100 C. The damage initiates at the central noodle of the composite stiffener. Unstable delamination then propagates from the noodle to the tip of the stiffener foot, preferably through the stiffener foot plies. However, the maximum load and corresponding displacement increase significantly with temperature. At + 100 C the maximum load increases approximately 15 % to 30 % when compared to RT. At - 55 C the maximum load decreases approximately 50 % to 60 % when compared to RT. No influence of the adhesive was observed in the maximum load values, since no damage occurs at the adhesive bondline. This research identifies that the composite stiffener is the weakest link of the hybrid bonded structure metal-skin-to-composite-stiffener and not the adhesive bondline. This holds for static loading in a wide temperature range. Aerospace Structures and MaterialsAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|Lightweight, high strength, high {{stiffness}} fiber reinforced polymer {{composite materials}} are leading contenders {{to improve the}} efficiency and sustainability of many forms of transport. They offer immense scope for incorporating multifunctionality due to their hierarchical internal architecture. One limiting factor in their wider exploitation is relatively poor performance under impact loading, a crucial aspect of any safety critical design, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} strength, stiffness and stability. This results in conservative design and higher mass structures. Self-healing has the potential to mitigate damage resulting from impact, thereby improving design allowables or offering other benefits such as reduced maintenance and inspection schedules. The work presented in this paper shows that either compartmentalised hollow-fiber or continuous vascular network self-healing approaches can be used for the repair of advanced composite structures. In the nearer term, the specific placement of self-healing plies or individual fibers to match a critical damage threat has been shown to repair internal matrix cracking and delaminations throughout the thickness of a laminate when assessed in both a flexural and compressive loading state. In the longer term, integration of a pervasive, circulatory vascular network within the foam core of a composite sandwich structure has also been shown to offer a marked benefit. The network has negligible influence on structural performance whilst being able to provide reattachment of the foam core and <b>laminate</b> <b>skin</b> after impact damage. In the case studied, a sizeable recovery in flexural and compression after impact strength, and restoration of primary failure mode was observed. Such systems offer significant potential for restoring structural integrity to a composite component during service and prolonging residual life after a damage event.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of sustainable Wind Energy (WE) {{to the global}} energy scenario has been steadily increasing over the past decades. In the process, Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) became the most widespread and largest WE harvesting machines. Nevertheless, significant challenges still lie ahead of further expansion of HAWT, namely concerning systemrobustness and cost-of-energy(COE) competitiveness. This dissertation studies aHAWT design concept termed modern Active Stall Control (ASC). With this concept HAWT power regulation is achieved using flowcontrol actuators to trim the aerodynamic loads across the operational envelope. The underpinning idea is that as the aerodynamic loads are trimmed by flowcontrol actuatorswithout pitching the blades, the pitch system may be mitigated. In turn, this might lead to decreased failure-rates and down-time, and thus eventually present a more cost-effective solution than state-of-the art HAWTs. Going specifically into ASC, if aerodynamic load trimming is performed {{it is necessary to}} employ a flow control actuator. From different flow control actuator types, since the aim is to reduce the maintenance and operational costs of ASC machines, actuators with few mechanical parts become more interesting. As such the present research also focuses on the Alternating Current Dielectric Barrier Discharge (AC-DBD) plasma actuator, owing among other things to its absence of moving parts, negligible mass and virtually unlimited bandwidth of actuation. A preliminary study on the feasibility of active stall control to regulate HAWT power production in replacement of the pitch system is conducted. By taking the National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5 MWturbine as reference, a simple blade element momentum code is used to assess the required actuation authority. Considering half of the blade span is equipped with actuators, the required change in the lift coefficient to regulate power is estimated in ¢Cl Æ 0. 7. Concerning actuation technologies, three flow control devices are investigated, namely Boundary Layer Transpiration, Trailing Edge Jets and Dielectric Barrier Discharge plasma actuators. Results indicate the authority of the actuators considered is not sufficient to regulate power, since the change in the lift coefficient is not large enough. Especially if a pitch-controlledmachine is used as baseline case. Active stall control of Horizontal AxisWind Turbines appears feasible only if the rotor is re-designed from the start to incorporate active-stall devices. Regarding AC-DBD plasma actuators, three specific topics are investigated. The different studies aim at DBD performance characterization, namely at the influence of external flow on DBD plasma momentum transfer and on the frequency response of actuator flow region characteristic of DBD pulse operation. Both these topics are important {{to bridge the gap between}} academic-laboratory employment of DBD and large-size industrial applications. Finally regarding DBD plasma actuator modeling, a method is developed to describe plasma actuation effects in integral boundary layer formulation, and coupled to a viscous-inviscid panel code (similar to XFOIL), while an experimental campaign is carried to validate the predictions. The three DBD plasma studies are further described below. Addressing cross-talk effects between DBD plasma actuators and external flow, a study is carried out in which an actuator is positioned in a boundary layer operated in a range of free stream velocities from 0 to 60 m/s, and tested both in counter-flow and co-flow forcing configurations. Electrical measurements and a CCD camera are used to characterize the DBD performance at different external flow speeds, while the actuator thrust is measured using a sensitive load cell. Results show the power consumption is constant for different flow velocities and actuator configurations, while the plasma light emission is constant for co-flow forcing but increases with counter-flow forcing for increasing free stream velocities. The measured force is constant for free stream velocities larger than 20 m/s, with same magnitude and opposite direction for the counter-flow and co-flow configurations. In quiescent conditions the measured force is smaller due to the change in wall shear force by the induced wall-jet. In addition to the experimental study, an analytical model is presented to estimate the influence of external flow on the actuator force. It is based on conservation of momentum through the ion-neutral collisional process while including the {{contribution of}} the wall shear force. Model results compare well with experimental data at different external flow velocities, while extrapolation to larger velocities shows variation in actuator thrust of at least 10 % for external speedU Æ 200 m/s. Concerning the response of DBD actuator region flow to pulsed operation, a methodology is provided to derive the local frequency response of flow under actuation, in terms of the magnitude of actuator induced velocity perturbations. The method is applied to an AC- DBD plasma actuator but can be extended to other kinds of pulsed actuation. For the derivation, the actuator body force termis introduced in the Navier-Stokes equations, from which the flow is locally approximated with a linear-time-invariant (LTI) system. The proposed semi-phenomenologicalmodel includes the effect of both viscosity and external flow velocity, while providing a system response in the frequency domain. Experimental data is compared with analytical results for a typical DBD plasma actuator operating in quiescent flow and in a laminar boundary layer. Good agreement is obtained between analytical and experimental results for cases below the model validity threshold frequency. These results demonstrate an efficient yet simple approach towards prediction of the response of a convective flow to pulsed actuation. Future application of the methodology might include actuation scheduling design and optimization for different flow control scenarios. The third study specifically addressing DBD plasma actuators presents a methodology to model the effect of DBD plasma actuators on airfoil performance within the framework of a viscous-inviscid airfoil analysis code. The approach is valid for incompressible, turbulent flow applications. The effect of (plasma) body forces in the boundary layer is analyzed with a generalized form of the von Kármán integral boundary layer equations. The additional terms appearing in the von Kármán equations give rise to a new closure relation. The model is implemented in a viscous-inviscid airfoil analysis code and validated by carrying out an experimental study. PIV measurements are performed on an airfoil equipped with DBD plasma actuators over a range of Reynolds number and angle of attack combinations. Balance measurements are also collected to evaluate the lift and drag coefficients. Results show the proposed model captures the magnitude of the variation in IBL parameters from DBD actuation. Additionally the magnitude of the lift coefficient variations (¢Cl) induced by plasma actuation is reasonably estimated. As such, this approach enables the design of airfoils specifically tailored for DBD plasma flow control. Transitioning into ASCrotor design, and building on the previously presented, a methodology is introduced for designing airfoils suitable to employ actuation in a wind energy environment. The novel airfoil sections are baptized WAP (Wind Energy Actuated Profiles). A genetic algorithm based multiobjective airfoil optimizer is formulated by setting two cost functions, one for wind energy performance and the other representing actuation suitability. The wind energy cost function considers ’reference’ wind energy airfoils while using a probabilistic approach to include the effects of turbulence and wind shear. The actuation suitability cost function is developed for HAWT active stall control, including two different control strategies designated by ’enhanced’ and ’decreased’ performance. Two different actuation types are considered, namely boundary layer transpiration and DBD plasma. Results show that using WAP airfoils provides much higher control efficiency than adding actuation on reference wind energy airfoils, without detrimental effects in non-actuated operation. The WAP sections yield an actuator employment efficiency that is 2 to 4 times larger than obtained with reference wind energy airfoils. Regarding geometry, WAP sections for decreased performance display an upper surface concave aft-region compared to typical wind energy ’reference’ airfoils,while retaining common sharp nose and S-tail (characteristic aft-loading) features. Results show there is much to gain in designing airfoils from the beginning to include actuation effects, especially compared to employing actuation on already existing airfoils, which ultimately might pave theway for novelHAWT control strategies. Finally addressing the complete rotor planform design, an optimization study tailors a HAWT rotor to ASC operation, in a aero-structural-servo formulation. The study considers the aerodynamic and structural loads are in static equilibrium, and as such no unsteady effects are taken into account. The optimization includes planformgeometry design but also actuation scheduling, rated rotational speed and spanwise <b>laminate</b> <b>skin</b> thickness. Results show that, compared to variable-pitch turbines, ASC planform displays increased chord at inboard stations with decreased twist angle towards the tip, resulting in increased AOA. Actuation is employed to trim the (static) loads across the operational wind speed envelope and hence reduce load overshoots and associated costs. Comparing with state-of-the-art pitch machines, the expected COE of the ASC rotor does not indicate a significant decrease, but appears to be at least competitive with pitch-controlled HAWTs if the pitch system is effectively mitigated. Additionally, and though not explicitly considered in the present work, it is foreseen ASC might become interesting if the actuation system allows for further OM cost reduction via fatigue load-alleviation, since the actuation trimming load system is anyhow included in an ASC machine.

The thickness of the polyurethane foam was optimized to meet both strength and serviceability requirements for gravity loading. Deflection ultimately was the controlling factor in the design, as the stresses in the composite materials remained relatively low. The CFRP sandwich panel was then subjected to combined gravity and lateral loading, which included seismic loads from a fictitious 5 -story office building located in a region of high seismic risk. The results showed that CFRP sandwich panels are a viable option for use with floors, possessing sufficient strength and stiffness for meeting code prescribed design loads, while providing significant benefits over traditional construction materials...|$|R

This allows for the reduction or elimination of sound absorbing materials and mastics in the conventional noise solution. With laminated metal, {{the result is a}} noise, vibration, harshness improvement without adding weight and cost. However, the marked difference between the stiff steel <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> and the soft laminate adhesive core requires a three-layer mesh to capture the resulting through-thickness shearing. A finite element preprocessor, DAMP®, eases the design process by creating the three-layer representation, directly from a sheet metal mesh. DAMP ® utilizes both MSC. Patran [1] and MSC. Nastran [2] parameters in the mesh generation process. DAMP ® is demonstrated here with the design of a front floor panel. The laminated panel is analyzed to determine its proper gauge to maintain the stiffness of the sheet metal original. A modal test is also simulated to demonstrate the reduced vibrations associated with the Quiet SteelÒ design...|$|R
40|$|The work {{describes}} {{the development and}} application of a low cost Thermal NDT set-up to investigate the influence of delamination defects on thick glass fibre reinforced composite laminates simulating typical hull monolithic GRP panels. Two active thermographic techniques have been implemented in particular: a pulsed thermography and a step heating scheme. A 12 mm thick cross-ply panel has been manufactured and delamination defects simulated in two different ways: by embedding patches of folded Teflon sheets, and by drilling flat bottomed back holes. A number of defects was then positioned at three different depths form the scanned surfaces, measuring ¼, ½ and ¾ of the laminate thickness. A reflection set-up was adopted, with an external heat source consisting of 1500 W halogen lamps. Results have evidenced the possibility to use the proposed cheap thermographic set-up, suitable to operate also in boatyard environments, to detected non-visible delamination type defects in thick GRP <b>laminate</b> <b>skins.</b> A fine tuning of the operational parameters is though essential {{in order to better}} identify defects features and to discern the influence of other factors such as surface finish...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the mechanical behaviour of a class of sandwich structures widely employed in marine constructions, constituted by fiber-glass <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> over PVC foam or polyester mat cores. In detail, a systematic experimental study and numerical simulations have shown that the theoretical prediction of the strength and the actual failure mechanism of these sandwich structures can be affected by significant errors, specially in the presence of prevalent shear loading. Moreover, because of the low shear stiffness and the elastic constants mismatch of the skins and core material, failure modes and strength are strongly influenced by eventual stresses orthogonal to the middle plane of the sandwich. In particular, for the sandwich structures with a PVC foam core, such a stress interaction leads to early skin-core delamination failure, whereas for those with a polyester core it leads to core shear-cohesive failure. By means of accurate non-linear simulations, accurate failure criteria, that can be used at the design stage in the presence of complex loading, have also been developed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This works {{deals with}} the problem of the optimum design of a {{sandwich}} plate composed of CFRP faces and Al honeycomb core. The proposed design strategy is a multi-scale numerical optimization procedure that does not make use of any simplifying assumption to find a global optimum configuration of the system. The goal of such a procedure consists in simultaneously optimizing the shape of the unit cell of the honeycomb core (meso-scale) and the geometrical as well as the material parameters of the CFRP <b>laminated</b> <b>skins</b> (meso and macro scales). To prove its effectiveness, the multi-scale optimization strategy is applied to the problem of the least-weight design of a sandwich panel subject to constraints of different nature: on the positive-definiteness of the stiffness tensor of the core, on the admissible material properties of the laminated faces, on the local buckling load of the unit cell of the core, on the global buckling load of the panel and geometrical as well as manufacturability constraints linked to the fabrication process of the honeycomb core...|$|R

The models differed in internal structure and postcure temperatures of the <b>laminated</b> Fiberglass <b>skin.</b> Tests were made at various stagnation temperatures between 440 F and 625 F.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of waves in axisymmetric structures can be modelled using a wave/finite element (WFE) approach. A small, rectangular {{segment of the}} structure is modelled using conventional finite element methods, typically using a commercial package. Periodicity conditions are then applied. An eigenvalue problem results, the solutions of which yield the dispersion relations. In this paper the WFE method is applied to cylindrical shells modelled using ANSYS. The circumferential order of the wave can be specified in order to define the phase change a wave experiences as it propagates across the element in the circumferential direction. The resulting eigenproblem then relates the axial wavenumber and frequency. The method is described and illustrated by application to cylinders of different constructions. First a thin, isotropic shell is considered - for this case analytical solutions are available from which the accuracy and efficiency of the method can be demonstrated. A steel cylinder filled with water comprises the second example. The third example concerns a sandwich cylinder with a foam core and orthotropic, <b>laminated</b> <b>skins,</b> for which analytical solutions are not available. The method is seen to be simple in application and provide accurate results with very little computational cost...|$|R
40|$|Failure modes for {{sandwich}} {{beams of}} GFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> and Nomex honeycomb core are investigated. Theoretical models using honeycomb mechanics and classical beam theory are described. A failure mode map for loading under 3 -point bending, is constructed, showing {{the dependence of}} failure mode and load on the ratio of skin thickness to span length and honeycomb relative density. Beam specimens are tested in 3 -point bending. The effect of honeycomb direction is also examined. The experimental data agree satisfactorily with the theoretical predictions. The results reveal {{the important role of}} core shear in a sandwich beam's bending behaviour and the need for a better understanding of indentation failure mechanism. High order sandwich beam theory (HOSBT) is implemented to extract useful information about the way that sandwich beams respond to localised loads under 3 -point bending. 'High-order' or localised effects relate to the non-linear patterns of the in-plane and vertical displacements fields of the core through its height resulting from the unequal deformations in the loaded and unloaded skins. The localised effects are examined experimentally by Surface Displacement Analysis of video images recorded during 3 -point bending tests. A new parameter based on the intrinsic material and geometric properties of a sandwich beam is introduced to characterise its susceptibility to localised effects. Skin flexural rigidity is shown to {{play a key role in}} determining the way that the top skin allows the external load to pass over the core. Furthermore, the contact stress distribution in the interface between the central roller and the top skin, and its importance to an indentation stress analysis, are investigated. To better model the failure in the core under the vicinity of localised loads, an Arcan- type test rig is used to test honeycomb cores under simultaneous compression and shear loading. The experimental measurements show a linear relationship between the out-of-plane compression and shear in honeycomb cores. This is used to derive a failure criterion for applied shear and compression, which is combined with the high order sandwich beam theory to predict failure caused by localised loads in sandwich beams made of GFRP <b>laminate</b> <b>skins</b> and Nomex honeycomb under 3 -point bending loading. Short beam tests with three different indenter's size are performed on appropriately prepared specimens. Experiments validate the theoretical approach and reveal the nature of pre- and post-failure behaviour of these sandwich beams. HOSBT is used as a compact computational tool to reconstruct failure mode maps for sandwich panels. Superposition of weight and stiffness contours on these failure maps provide carpet plots for design optimisation procedures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis work {{deals with}} the problem of the optimum design of a {{sandwich}} panel. The design process is based on a general two-level optimisation strategy involving different scales: the meso-scale for both the unit cell of the core and the constitutive layer of the <b>laminated</b> <b>skins</b> and the macro-scale for the whole panel. Concerning the meso-scale of the honeycomb core, an appropriate model of the unit cell able to properly provide its effective elastic properties (to be used at the macro-scale) must be conceived. To this purpose, in this first paper, we present the numerical homogenisation technique as well as the related finite element model of the unit cell which makes use of solid elements instead of the usual shell ones. A numerical study to determine the effective properties of the honeycomb along with a comparison with existing models and a sensitive analysis in terms of the geometric parameters of the unit cell have been conducted. Numerical results show that shell-based models are no longer adapted to evaluate the core properties, mostly {{in the context of an}} optimisation procedure where the parameters of the unit cell can get values that go beyond the limits imposed by a 2 D model...|$|R
