These features appear when the objective of such public aid programs is to restore the ex ante distribution of wealth or property values within a blighted neighborhood, while equilibria exhibiting deficient levels of private investment and blight itself can arise when residents accurately anticipate the potential provision of public aid to an affected neighborhood and ex ante investment in private insurance diminishes neighborhood eligibility for such aid. Examples of antipodal equilibria in which urban renewal programs entirely crowd out <b>local</b> <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> or in which neighborhood residents invest in efficient levels of private mitigation illustrate these results, which stand in direct contrast to both traditional explanations of urban blight and to the new “social-interaction” models of neighborhood divergence.

The impact of government expenditures on <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> is explained on two hands. On the one hand, an increase in government expenditures due to high government borrowing requirements displaces the <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> This indicates the “crowding out” hypothesis. Hence, the high level of government expenditures crowds out <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> On the other hand, since public investments enhance the marginal productivity of private capital, this increases the level of <b>private</b> <b>investment</b> (Mamatzakis, 2001) In the literature there are two types studies and all studies found different results on the effects of government expenditures on <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> The contrasting results from different studies gave rise to several studies try to investigate the impact of government expenditures on <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> Aschauer (1989); Mamatzakis (2001); Pereira (2001); Ghali (1998) Apergis (2000); Laopodis (2001); Karagol (2004) and Pereira (2001) used a disaggregate analysis in order to explain the relationship between disaggregate measures of government expenditures and <b>private</b> <b>investment.</b> On the other hand, only a few studies used an aggregate analysis. Lin (1994) states that increased in government expenditures made <b>private</b> <b>investments</b> costly because of competing the private sector in financing.
