5000|$|Some {{rear track}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> have {{threaded}} devices ("chaintugs") {{to aid in}} setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye {{at the end of}} a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of [...] "axle creep" [...] on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.|$|R
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> [...] fork-end, or forkend is a slot in {{a bicycle}} frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout {{is a type}} of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain.|$|R

50|$|Track bicycle frames have track <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> {{on which}} the opening faces rearwards. Because {{they do not have}} dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the {{sprocket}} before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> instead of dropouts.|$|R

40|$|The {{nature of}} failure in a Turn buckle is investigated. It {{was found that}} the {{fracture}} had occured at the rivet hole close to the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Electron microscope study of the fracture surface showed that the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the turn buckle had failed by a fatigue initiated fracture and that the fatigue could have originated due to excessive clearance in this region...|$|R
60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by 'spirits,' leaving only the <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth. In fact, Hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
50|$|Panic Attack turned X-Terminator 2 over, {{and due to}} a spike {{that was}} {{attached}} to the front, it couldn't self-right. Panic Attack pressed the pit button, and rolled X-Terminator back on its wheels. X-Terminator 2 then drove on top of Panic Attack's <b>lifting</b> <b>forks,</b> and Panic Attack slowly pushed X-Terminator into the pit. Winner: Panic Attack.|$|R

50|$|Although the American robot was heavier, Panic Attack easily {{turned it}} over with its <b>lifting</b> <b>forks</b> {{repeatedly}} but Rammstein was invertible and ran away. After a while though, Rammstein started to lose power as its batteries were designed for three minutes battle rather than the UK's five, so Panic Attack picked it up once more and dropped it into the pit.|$|R

50|$|Lifting {{equipment}}, {{also known}} as lifting gear, is a general term for any equipment {{that can be used}} to lift loads. This includes jacks, block and tackle, vacuum lifts, hoists, rotating screws, gantries, A frames, gin poles, shear legs, sheerleg, windlasses, <b>lifting</b> harnesses, <b>fork</b> <b>lifts,</b> hydraulic lifting pads, air lift bags, and cranes.|$|R
50|$|The TZR125R SP {{is based}} on the 4DL Series 1 but is {{recognised}} by the black Deltabox frame, swing-arm, rims, <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> and a long expansion chamber stinger.|$|R
50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R
50|$|The {{source is}} near Penkun, {{from which the}} river flows both to the North and to the South. The {{southern}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with its confluence to the Welse river, the northern <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with the confluence with the Uecker only a few kilometers before reaching the Oder Lagoon. The swampy Randow valley is known as Randowbruch, the historical crossing of the Randowbruch swamps are at its narrowest point in LÃ¶cknitz. The river lent {{its name to the}} former district of Uecker-Randow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, also to the historical Landkreis Randow of the Province of Pomerania.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{a modern}} bicycle frame {{intended}} for derailleur gears {{will have a}} vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forks {{have been}} made from steel, {{aluminum}}, carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, and various combinations. For example, a fork may have carbon fiber blades with an aluminum crown, steer tube, or <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{wheel axle}} fits into <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> {{in the frame}} and fork. A pair of wheels may be called a wheelset, {{especially}} {{in the context of}} ready-built [...] "off the shelf", performance-oriented wheels.|$|R

5000|$|The was (Egyptian w3s [...] "power, dominion") sceptre is {{a symbol}} that {{appeared}} often in relics, art, and hieroglyphics associated with the ancient Egyptian religion. It appears as a stylized animal head {{at the top of}} a long, straight staff with a <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} the fork, also called spacing, is {{measured}} colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for through axles have 110 mm spacing.|$|R
50|$|This trail {{begins at}} Amram's Pillars and leads up Mount Amir, where it forks in two toward either the Israel National Trail {{or through a}} canyon with copper mines. Both <b>forks</b> <b>end</b> near Black Canyon. The trail does not loop, and takes {{approximately}} 4 hours to complete.|$|R
50|$|Manual pallet jacks {{have existed}} {{since at least}} 1918. Early types <b>lifted</b> the <b>forks</b> and load only by {{mechanical}} linkages. More modern type uses a hand pumped hydraulic jack to lift.|$|R
25|$|With {{a design}} team {{consisting}} of Russell Bruce, Kent Ivor and James Charles he patented significant {{improvements to the}} invention of the modern day <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> truck which has {{had a significant impact on}} international commerce through palletised container movements. In particular, Dolphin proposed a design of the lifting carriage of a masted <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> truck which applies a downward thrust to counteract the bending moment produced on the mast by the load on the load support The team also patented a solution to prevent <b>fork</b> <b>lift</b> trucks having to keep repositioning to lift loads by designing a horizontally movable slide.|$|R
25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R
