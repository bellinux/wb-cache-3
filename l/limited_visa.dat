25|$|Much of the state’s {{economic}} activity {{is related to}} its border with the United States state of Arizona. People from both countries regularly cross the border to shop. The border crossings are essential {{to many of the}} communities that straddle the border, not only in the main crossings in Nogales and Agua Prieta, but also in the smaller ones such as Naco. On each side of the border, there is a fifteen km strip, which is designated as a commercial trade zone, where both Mexicans and United States citizens can enter with <b>limited</b> <b>visa</b> requirements. Many Arizonans travel and cross one of the crossings to eat and shop, mostly to experience something different from doing the same at home. Most spend only the day. The most popular of these border crossings is Nogales, which is just over an hour south from Tucson by highway. The main shopping street in Nogales is Avenida Obregón, which is crowded with pharmacies with lower prices than in the United States, stores selling knock offs of designer names such as Louis Vuitton, Cuban cigars, tequila, cheaper cigarettes and Mexican handcrafts, including some of the best work from artisans from Puebla, Guadalajara, Michoacán and Oaxaca. Although these stores cater mostly to Americans crossing the border, it is still possible to negotiate prices. Many of these communities on the Mexican side also have bars close to the port of entry, taking advantage of Mexico’s lower drinking age of 18.|$|E

40|$|How do {{diverse groups}} of women in Canada define sexual harassment? To answer this ques-tion {{requires}} incorporating race and citizenship into the analysis of sexual harassment. The authors use data from seven focus groups of Canadian women. The white women with full cit-izenship rights most easily identify with existing legal understandings of sexual harassment and believe {{they have the right}} to report their harassment. For women of color and women without full citizenship rights, issues of racialized sexual harassment emerge as central fac-tors in their harassment experience. Black women with full citizenship rights call into ques-tion whether the term sexual harassment captures their experiences. Filipinas working as live-in caregivers on <b>limited</b> <b>visas</b> demonstrate how racism and lack of citizenship changes definitions of sexual harassment. Their experiences of harassment combine elements of iso-lation due to their lack of citizenship, racialized sexual harassment, and abuse. The authors argue that intersectional analyses are needed to understand women’s harassment experi-ences and their ability to complain and seek legal recourse...|$|R
