25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} screw base (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E

50|$|Panasonic {{was founded}} in 1918 by Kōnosuke Matsushita as a vendor of duplex <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets.</b> In 1927, it began {{producing}} bicycle lamps, the first product which it marketed under the brand name National.|$|R
50|$|Wiring {{devices such}} as light switches, {{receptacle}} outlets, and <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets</b> were either surface-mounted, suspended, or flush-mounted within walls and ceilings. Only in the last case were metal boxes always used to enclose the wiring and device.|$|R
50|$|The center contact of {{the bulb}} {{typically}} {{connects to the}} medium-power filament, and the ring connects to the low-power filament. Thus, if a 3-way bulb is screwed into a standard light socket that has only a center contact, only the medium-power filament operates. In {{the case of the}} 50 W / 100 W / 150 W bulb, putting this bulb in a regular <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> will result in it behaving like a normal 100W bulb.|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Reuben Berkley Benjamin, and filed its first patent for an {{electric}} <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> in 1898. The company went on to manufacture various other electrical products. One of Benjamin's most notable products was their series of non-contact fire alarm horns, introduced in the early 1920s. They were available in flush-mount, single, and double projector versions, in either red or gray. These horns were mainly used by IBM, and later SimplexGrinnell up until the 1960s. In 1958, Benjamin was bought out by Thomas Industries, Inc.|$|E

50|$|Working in the {{basement}} of his home on Orchard Street in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Diehl invented a lamp that was different from Thomas Edison's incandescent electric lamp, which was patented in 1879. Diehl's lamp had no lead-in wires. In 1882 Diehl obtained the first patent on this induction incandescent lamp. The base of the lamp contained a wire coil that coupled with a primary coil in the <b>lamp</b> <b>socket,</b> causing current to flow through the lamp without the need for lead-in wires. Two additional patents were granted in 1883, followed by patents for electrical lighting systems in 1885 and 1886.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} screw <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> {{has only}} two electrical contacts. In {{the center of the}} bottom of a standard socket is the hot contact (contact one in photo), which typically looks like a small metal tongue bent over. The threaded metal shell is itself the neutral contact (contact three in photo). When a standard bulb is screwed into a standard socket, a matching contact {{on the bottom of the}} bulb presses against the metal tongue in the center of the socket, creating the live connection. The metal threads of the bulb base touch the socket shell, which creates the neutral connection, and this is how the electrical circuit is completed.|$|E
50|$|A lamp harp is the {{component}} of a lamp to which the lamp shade is attached. It typically comes in two separate parts, a saddle which is fastened under the <b>lamp</b> <b>socket,</b> and the harp itself which consist of a lightweight frame attached to the saddle at its lower end and extending upwards to a point above the bulb. At {{the top of the}} harp is a threaded rod. The shade's internal frame (known as a spider) mounts on this rod and is secured in place by a lamp finial. Common materials for harps include brass and nickel. The most common thread size is 1/4-27.|$|E
25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light bulbs grew {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 general lighting service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets</b> existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|R
50|$|Lightbulb <b>sockets,</b> light <b>sockets</b> <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets</b> or lampholders provide {{electrical}} {{connections to the}} lamps and support it in the lighting fixture. The use of <b>sockets</b> allows <b>lamps</b> to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for these lampholders, created by de facto and by various standards bodies. A general coding system is a letter or abbreviation followed by a number. Some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to wires; some reflector lamps have screw terminals for wire connections.|$|R
50|$|Products {{the factory}} made {{included}} headlights, taillights, and interior light shells, reflectors, and <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets.</b> Five hundred men working two shifts {{at the plant}} could produce half a million headlights a month.

The Flat Rock plant which produced head- and taillights, continued to produce these during the war, but for army trucks, Jeeps, tanks, the universal carrier, and the armored car. The Flat Rock plant also manufactured junction boxes for the B-24 bomber.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes a 3-way 2-circuit switch is {{incorporated}} {{together with a}} regular socket, {{to be used as}} the main <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> in a lamp with a night light. In this configuration, the switched lamp one live terminal for the night light socket is exposed externally on the base of the socket, to be wired to the remote candelabra socket. Hence, this type of socket has a Hot terminal, a Neutral terminal, and a switched Hot terminal. This creates a confusing situation in which a keyed 3-way socket (which has a 3-contact socket at the top of it) has only two terminal screws, while a night-light socket (which does not have a 3-contact socket at the top) has three terminal screws on the base.|$|E
5000|$|The Van de Graaff {{generator}} was developed, starting 1929, by physicist Robert J. Van de Graaff at Princeton University with a fellowship, {{with help}} from colleague Nicholas Burke. The first model was demonstrated during October 1929. The first machine used an ordinary tin can, a small motor, and a silk ribbon bought at a five-and-dime store. After {{that he went to}} the chairman of the physics department requesting a hundred dollars to make an improved version. He did get the money, with some difficulty. By 1931 he could report achieving 1.5 million volts, saying [...] "The machine is simple, inexpensive, and portable. An ordinary <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> provides the only power needed." [...] According to a patent application, it had two 60-cm-diameter charge-accumulation spheres mounted on borosilicate glass columns 180 cm high; the apparatus cost only $90 during 1931.|$|E
5000|$|That same year, Electric Engineering & Supply Company were {{manufacturers}} and dealers in electric lighting and street railway supplies and specialized {{in the manufacture}} of switchboards, cut outs and [...] "all special designs."

They were located at 308 and 310 West Jefferson Street. The manager was H. J. Gorke. and Jesse Lorenzo Hinds was superintendent and former mechanic for the firm.|$|R
50|$|Early {{experimental}} {{incandescent lamps}} had their wire leads connected to screw terminals, {{but this was}} inconvenient for commercial use. The Edison organization used simple wooden receptacles with copper strips inside them, when putting lamps on the commercial steamship Columbia (owned and operated by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company). These sockets included key switches, but were only useful for upright installations of the bulb. The Edison organization developed a screw-base in 1880, initially also of wood but later made with plaster of Paris. Many competitive designs of <b>lamp</b> <b>sockets</b> flourished in the early era of incandescent lighting, using mutually incompatible electrical contact and mechanical fixing arrangements.|$|R
5000|$|Lampholder {{failures}} {{are usually}} caused by mechanical abuse or by overheating. A socket {{with a built-in}} switch is {{far more likely to}} fail in normal use as the switch parts wear out. Insulation failures are usually caused by impacts or by difficulty inserting or removing a <b>lamp.</b> <b>Sockets</b> used outdoors or in damp areas often suffer from corrosion which can cause the lamp to [...] "stick" [...] in the socket and attempts to change a lamp can result in breakage of either the lamp or the lampholder. The corrosion is not only environmentally produced but may be a result of the current flowing through the parts when there is appreciable resistance between the parts. Fixtures in such environments may require gaskets or other waterproofing methods to prevent buildup of moisture in the socket area.|$|R
50|$|In filmmaking, a skypan {{is used by}} the {{director}} of photography for lighting scenery that lies outside a set's window or door. Skypans are circular with an upraised ridge around the outside (when laid flat they resemble a frying pan without a handle). It is made up of a reflective white pan that has a detachable heavy-duty <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> rigged in front of the pan by being clamped to the lip. This is positioned to keep the lamp filament {{in the middle of the}} reflector. The skypan is used mainly when raw power is required, spreading a bright light that allows large-scale coverage of a background set. Either 2K or 5K bulbs are generally used. A skypan is usually confined to studio work and rigged up to a scaffold or ceiling-mounted pipe grid. When regularly spaced, they are also useful for lighting green and blue screens.|$|E
40|$|The past 40 {{years have}} seen {{industrial}} robots establish their superiority over humans in most areas of manufacturing requiring endurance or repeatability. One important application domain, however, has so far lagged behind the industry’s expectations: mechanical assembly. As fast, precise and dependable as they are, traditional industrial robots just don’t seem able to perform certain assembly operations {{as well as a}} skilled human worker. A task as simple as screwing a light bulb into a <b>lamp</b> <b>socket</b> shows why. Applying the right amount of force and turning the bulb at just the right time, at exactly the right angle, is something a human does intuitively. How can a robot be programmed to do this? For robots to successfully emulate humans on an assembly line, they need to have force-sensing capability and exhibit compliance. They must be able to direct forces and moments in a controlled way, and react to contact information. New robot force control technology from ABB shows how...|$|E
