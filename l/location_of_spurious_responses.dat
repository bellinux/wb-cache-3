40|$|Abstract- We {{present the}} {{analysis}} and measurement <b>of</b> <b>spurious</b> <b>responses</b> generated {{at the ends of}} interdigital transducers (IDT). Filters fabricated on LiNb 03 show an un-wanted pass band ripple whose period indicates additional generation of acoustic waves at the IDT end. As this ef-fect cannot be explained by methods of analysis based on the infinite array approximation, an exact analysis of the complex-valued, frequency-dependent electric charge distri-bution on the finite IDT structure is required. Utilizing the method of moments our analysis is based on a Green's function concept and a spectral domain representa-tion. Three effects are shown: The first is the charge accumulation on grounded guard fingers located closely to the IDT end, resulting in unwanted end radiation. The second is acoustic end reflections in split-finger IDT's, occurring at the transi-tion from the periodic finger structure to the free substrate. The third is the finger charge induced by the metallic ground plane when the transducer is driven unbalanced to ground. Computer simulations based on our method agree well with measurements. I...|$|R

The first technique used a gated channeltron detector for resonant laser-induced multiphoton photoionization detection of trace organic vapors in a supersonic molecular beam. The channeltron was gated using a relatively simple circuit to generate a negative gate pulse with a width of 400 ns (FWHM), a 50 ns turn-on (rise) time, a 1. 5 {mu}s turn-off (decay) time, a pulse amplitude of {minus} 1000 Volts, and a DC offset adjustable from zero to {minus} 1500 Volts. The gated channeltron allows rejection <b>of</b> <b>spurious</b> <b>responses</b> to UV laser light scattered directly into the channeltron and time-delayed ionization signals induced by photoionization of residual gas in the vacuum chamber. Detection limits in the part-per-trillion range have been demonstrated with the gated detector. The second technique used arrays of surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices coated with various chemically selective materials (e. g., polymers, self assembled monolayers) to provide unique response patterns to various chemical analytes. This work focused on polymers, formed by spin casting from solution or by plasma polymerization, {{as well as on}} self assembled monolayers. Response from coated SAWs to various concentrations of water, volatile organics, and organophosphonates (chemical warfare agent simulants) were used to provide calibration data. A novel visual empirical region of influence (VIERI) pattern recognition technique was used to evaluate the ability to use these response patterns to correctly identify chemical species. This investigation shows how the VERI technique can be used to determine the best set of coatings for an array, to predict the performance of the array even if sensor responses change due to aging of the coating materials, and to identify unknown analytes based on previous calibration data...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{auditory}} steady-state response (ASSR) to air-conduction (AC) stimuli {{has been}} widely incorporated into audiological test-batteries for the pediatric population. The current understanding of ASSR to bone conduction (BC) stimuli, however, is more limited, {{especially in the case}} of infants and children. There are few reports on ASSR thresholds to BC stimuli in infants and young children, and none for infants or children with hearing loss. The objective of this study was to investigate BC ASSR thresholds in young children with normal hearing and various types and degrees of hearing loss. METHODS: AC and BC ASSR thresholds are reported for 48 young children (mean age SD = 2. 8 - 1. 9 years; age range = 0. 25 — 11. 5 years; 23 female). Hearing status was classified by assessing all children with a comprehensive test battery including tympanometry, diagnostic distortion-product otoacoustic emissions, click-evoked AC auditory brainstem response, AC and BC ASSR thresholds, and an otologic examination. The subjects were assigned to the categories normal hearing, conductive loss, and sensorineural loss (mild-to-moderate or severe-to-profound), for group analysis. AC and BC ASSR stimuli (carrier frequencies: 0. 25 — 4 kHz; 67 — 95 Hz modulation rates; 100 % amplitude and 10 % frequency modulated) were presented using the GSI Audera system. RESULTS: : Minimum levels at which spurious BC ASSR occur were established in the group of children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (25, 40, 60, 60 and 60 dB for 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively). Children with normal hearing presented mean (1 SD) BC ASSR thresholds of 19 (9), 18 (7), 16 (11), 24 (7), and 26 (8) dB HL at 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz, respectively. Significantly lower thresholds (p < 0. 0001) were obtained for 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 kHz than for 2 and 4 kHz. At 0. 25 kHz, 39 % of thresholds were at the minimum level <b>of</b> <b>spurious</b> <b>response</b> occurrence. More than half (54 %) of the BC thresholds in the group with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss were recorded at or above the minimum levels at which <b>spurious</b> <b>response</b> occurred. In children with conductive hearing loss, the average BC ASSR thresholds corresponded closely to those in the normal hearing group except at 1 kHz and revealed an air-bone gap. CONCLUSIONS: Spurious bone conduction ASSR responses limit the intensity range for which the technique may be employed in infants and children, especially at lower frequencies. Consequently, the 0. 25 kHz stimulus is not recommended for clinical use. In infants and young children, sensorineural hearing loss of a moderate or greater degree in the high frequencies (1 — 4 kHz), and of a mild or greater degree in the low frequencies (0. 5 kHz), cannot be quantified using BC ASSR. This is due to the presence of the stimulus artifact. In cases of conductive hearing loss, BC ASSR can effectively quantify sensory hearing between 0. 5 and 4 kHz, but interpretations must be made cautiously within the limitations of stimulus artifact occurrence across frequencies...|$|R

In this paper, the double resonance vibrators using two modes of the plate mentioed above are mainely discussed from the viewpoint of the capacitance ratio in resonance modes and the easiness of adjusting two resonant frequencies, and moreover some vibrators suitable or not suitable for construction of the electro-mechanical filters and having needs of some contrivances for practical use are related. It is consequently pointed out that the vibrators, using two same modes in the secondary resonance of bending vibration and in the primary resonance of contour vibration, may be most suitable for practical use. The resonant frequencies of these vibrators are easily adjusted by the side length ratio or cutting off corners of a square plate. The experimental results of the filters consisting of these vibrators, moreover, are also expressed. 　Secondly, the multiple mode vibrators using two or three modes of a triangular plate are described.
