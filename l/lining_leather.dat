40|$|As a tanning {{material}} alum salt has similar {{properties of the}} basic chromium sulphate. It is, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} research is to exchange chromium tannage with alum tannage in pretanning for the vegetable tanned <b>lining</b> <b>leather.</b> In doing such a way the chromium pollution may be eliminated, whereas the alum pretanned <b>lining</b> <b>leather</b> output must be fulfill the physical and chemical requirements as that one of the chrome pretanned. In pretanning the use of alum tannage varied from 2, 5 %, 3, 0 %, 3, 5 % and 4, 0 %. Afterwards the subsequent process was vegetable tanning using 30 % of mimosa powder. The <b>lining</b> <b>leather</b> output from the research was physical and chemical tested. The practical meaning of this research is that for pretanning the vegetable tanned <b>lining</b> <b>leather</b> it is possible to use 2, 5 % alum salt. The values of the physical and chemical test obtained are that the degree of tannage is 94, 54, tensile strength is 174, 24 kg/cm 2, and strength is 22 %. Water absorption for 2 hours is 133, 01 % and for 24 hours is 134, 48 %. Whereas the flexural endurance is unbreak condition...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{characterization}} and the antimicrobial properties of nano silver (nAg) coating on leather were investigated. For this purpose, turbidity, viscosity and pH of nAg solutions {{prepared by the}} sol-gel method were measured. The formation of films from these solutions was characterized according to temperature by Differential Thermal Analysis-Thermogravimetry (DTA-TG) equipment. The surface morphology of treated leathers was observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The antimicrobial performance of nAg coatings on leather materials to the test microorganisms as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Aspergillius niger was evaluated by the application of qualitative (Agar overlay method) and quantitative (percentage of microbial reduction) tests. According to qualitative test results {{it was found that}} 20 &# 956;g/cm 2 and higher concentrations of nAg on the leather samples were effective against all microorganisms tested. Moreover, quantitative test results showed that leather samples treated with 20 &# 956;g/cm 2 of nAg demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against E. coli with 99. 25 % bacterium removal, whereas a 10 &# 956;g/cm 2 concentration of nAg on leather was enough to exhibit the excellent percentage reduction against S. aureus of 99. 91 %. The results are promising for the use of colloidal nano silver solution on <b>lining</b> <b>leather</b> as antimicrobial coating...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the technological process for manufacturing a low-cut footwear product (type shoe) for women, for casual use, in an IL system. The paper {{begins with a}} general presentation of the technological process of manufacturing the product, and follows with a case study which details the characteristic operations, {{as well as the}} common ones, which take place during the process. Depending on the structure of the model and the characteristics of the raw and auxiliary materials, the technological process used in the manufacture workshops will be laid-out. Product manufacture begins with cutting the materials, in our case the parts being cut from full grain leather, and the lining from <b>lining</b> <b>leather.</b> After the pieces for {{the upper part of the}} shoe are cut according to the guides, they will be assembled using different methods such as: stitching, gluing or fastening. The guides are processed in order to thin out the edges evenly or in a slant, or to decorate them by bending, burning or painting. For stitching the parts a simple two-thread stitch is used, with one or two seams and back-stitches, and the gluing can be temporary or permanent. In the process the time and production quotas are presented, which are influenced by the qualification level of the workers, as well as the performance of the machines used...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} determining {{the effectiveness of}} the Tingi bark’s extract as vegetable tanning material and the optimum formulations of Tingi extract for <b>lining</b> <b>leather</b> tanning, when combined with alum and mimosa. The research variables included the solution compositions of alum, Tingi extract, and mimosa, as well as the process sequences in which the hides were exposed to each aforementioned solution. There were 8 (eight) different treatments performed in this research; those are alum (4 %) -Tingi, alum (6 %) -Tingi, alum (4 %) -Tingi-mimosa (5 %), alum (6 %) -Tingi-mimosa (5 %), Tingi-alum (4 %),Tingi-alum (6 %), Tingi-mimosa (5 %) -alum (4 %), and Tingi-mimosa (5 %) -alum (6 %). Characterization methods included chemical and physical tests. The results show that the Tingi extract can be used as vegetable tanning material, and the optimum properties were obtained when the alum (4 %) was added after the Tingi extract {Tingi-alum (4 %) }. The optimum properties were shrinkage temperature of 86 oC; total ash content of 0. 73 %; water soluble matter of 0. 89 %; pH of 3. 78; degree of tannage of 96. 37 %; tensile strength of 370. 65 kg/cm 2; elongation at break of 36. 52 %; rubfastness of 5 (dry); and 4 (wet). The resulting leather also meet the requirements of Ethiopian Standard 1185 : 2005, Leather-Lining leather-Specification...|$|E
