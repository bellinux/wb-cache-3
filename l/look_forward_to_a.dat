500|$|Throughout his {{political}} career Roosevelt championed the cause of human rights. In his annual State of the Union address to Congress of January 6, 1941, which was delivered {{at a time when}} Nazi Germany occupied much of Western Europe, he asked the American citizens to support war efforts in various ways. He stated his vision of a better future, founded upon four freedoms: [...] "In the future days which we seek to make secure, we <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> world founded upon four essential human freedoms," [...] some traditional and some new ones: freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.|$|E
500|$|Olivia goes to {{meet her}} father in prison, and upon exiting the farmer who had {{arranged}} the marriage between Olivia and Thornhill appears and gasps in shock. The vicar explains that Olivia is his daughter, and the farmer reveals {{his role in the}} plot, but that out of hatred for Thornhill he procured the services of a real priest to officiate at the wedding. The farmer heads to Thornhill's house and reveals that the marriage was in fact legitimate. Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, forces him to take responsibility for his actions and beg Olivia's forgiveness. Olivia accepts Thornhill's apology and the couple embrace and kiss. Although not in the surviving print, the synopsis concludes with [...] "Sir William then discloses his identity and asks for the hand of Sophia [...] The vicar is released from prison, and he and his family <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> future of happiness and plenty." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{official}} statement, Sega of America chairman David Rosen expressed {{satisfaction with the}} settlement. [...] According to Rosen, [...] "This settlement is a satisfactory ending to what was a very complex set of issues. Not only are we pleased to settle this case amicably, we've also turned a corner in our association with Accolade and now <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> healthy and mutually beneficial relationship in the future." [...] Accolade's Alan Miller expressed more excitement with the settlement and the opportunities it presented for the company, saying in his statement, [...] "We are {{very pleased with the}} settlement, and we're excited about the new markets it opens to Accolade. Accolade currently experiences strong demand for its Sega Genesis products in North America and Europe. We will now be able to publish our products on the Sega Genesis and Game Gear systems throughout the world." [...] Despite the settlement, however, Accolade had lost somewhere between $15 million and $25 million during the injunction period, according to Miller.|$|E

500|$|Even {{after the}} {{investiture}} dispute, the King {{continued to play}} a major role in the selection of new English and Norman bishops and archbishops. Henry appointed many of his officials to bishoprics and, as historian Martin Brett suggests, [...] "some of his officers could <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mitre with all but absolute confidence". Henry's chancellors, and those of his queens, became bishops of Durham, Hereford, London, Lincoln, Winchester and Salisbury. Henry increasingly drew on a wider range of these bishops as advisors – particularly Roger of Salisbury – breaking with the earlier tradition of relying primarily on the Archbishop of Canterbury. The result was a cohesive body of administrators through which Henry could exercise careful influence, holding general councils to discuss key matters of policy. This stability shifted slightly after 1125, when Henry began to inject a wider range of candidates into the senior positions of the Church, often with more reformist views, and the impact of this generation would be felt in the years after Henry's death.|$|E
500|$|The Cold War allegory and the whodunit {{aspects of}} the film were less {{positively}} received. Mary Boson of the Sydney Morning Herald considered the comparisons to real-world situations timely, and praised the plot for exploring the reactions {{of those who have}} invested themselves in a life of belligerence. David Sterritt of The Christian Science Monitor felt that the film veered away from the intriguing Cold War allegory premise to unsatisfying results. Instead of maintaining suspense, The Washington Timess Gary Arnold noted the Rura Penthe sideplot offered [...] "scenic distraction without contributing significantly to the whodunit crisis [...] The crime itself has a promising 'closed-room' aspect that never gets elaborated adequately [...] You <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cleverly fabricated solution." [...] Arnold felt that instead of developing this mystery, the filmmakers defused the potential for suspense by shifting away from the search of the Enterprise. Brian Lowry of Variety felt Rura Penthe dragged down the film's pace, and that Meyer paid so much attention to one-liners that {{there was a lack of}} tension in the film, a complaint echoed by John Hartl of the Seattle Times.|$|E
500|$|Having {{claimed the}} {{election}} was entirely without irregularities, the United States government hailed Diệm as a new hero of the [...] "free world". Senator Mike Mansfield (D-MT) claimed the referendum [...] "was a reflection of their [...] search for a leader who would respond to their needs... they sensed that Diệm could provide that kind of leadership." [...] Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators. Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the negative image created by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion. The US State Department spokesman said [...] "the people of Viet-Nam have spoken, and we, of course, recognise their decision". An official congratulatory statement from the department said [...] "The Department of State is gratified that according to reports the referendum was conducted in such an orderly and efficient manner and {{that the people of}} Viet-Nam have made their choice unmistakably clear... we <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> continuation of the friendly relations between the Government of Viet-Nam and the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|Santos {{was under}} {{contract}} with Warrior's Boxing Promotions for one year, his contract ended when he abandoned the promotion. On April 26, 2005, Don King Productions {{announced that the}} company had acquired the exclusive rights to promote Santos' fights. At the moment of the announcement Don King stated that: [...] "Daniel is another proud Puerto Rican world champion and I'm excited to have him with me, Junior middleweight is a solid division and there are many fights we can make for this great champion. Viva Puerto Rico!." [...] Santos said that this event held significance in his life because:"I want to fight all the best fighters and by being with the best promoter, I know I will get those fights and make good money. I <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> long and happy relationship with Don King." [...] When interviewed about Santos' signing, Félix Trinidad Sr. said that he was impressed by Santos' performance against Antonio Margarito and said that a fight between him and Félix Trinidad seemed plausible at the moment. On December 3, 2005 Santos was scheduled to defend the light middleweight championship against Sergiy Dzindziruk. In the eight round of the competition Dzinziruk [...] scored a knockdown. The three judges gave the fight a score of 115–112 in favor of Dzinziruk [...] thus making him the new WBO champion.|$|E
500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly having the time of their lives.|$|E

Neulinger's vision was of a society where non-leisure activities form a minimal part of our day, where work would be carried out with meaning and without coercion, freely chosen, self-rewarding, and intrinsically motivating. In his final publication, Neulinger advocated for a societal transformation to that of a [...] "universal leisure society instead of more centuries of useless destruction and worldwide conflicts".|$|E
