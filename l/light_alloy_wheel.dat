5000|$|From 1960, Velocette {{produced}} the Venom (and the Viper) in a Clubman racing version, fitted with TT Amal carburettors, a manually controlled BTH racing magneto (in {{place of the}} Lucas unit) and a close-ratio gearbox, with the compression ratio raised to 9.3 to 1. The Venom Clubman dispensed with the glass fibre enclosure and instead made a feature of highly polished crankcase and gearbox castings. Supplied with [...] "rearset" [...] controls, lowered handlebars and a steering damper, the Clubman also had a range of optional accessories including a [...] "megaphone" [...] exhaust silencer, a rev counter and <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>wheel</b> rims. Although they could be difficult to start - an entire section in the owners handbook was dedicated to starting technique - experienced Clubman riders found them easy to maintain and fast, as the Venom Clubman could achieve over 100 mph. In 1966 the Venom was upgraded to the Mk II, which had the Thruxton front forks fitted with rubber gaiters, a twin leading shoe front brake and narrowed mudguards, combined with a new exhaust design giving it a more modern sports motorcycle look.|$|E
50|$|The Pininfarina Style Centre has {{transformed}} the original car, a Ferrari 458 Spider, into this roadster car with calculations and tests in the wind tunnel of Grugliasco to optimize aerodynamic performance. In particular, new bodywork has been realized, full carbon, with a weight savings of approximately 10% {{in relation to the}} bodywork original aluminum, all to the benefit of acceleration and recovery. Compared to the original car, the new elements that have been included include <b>light</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>wheel</b> rims by monodado by that are 21 ', with a unique and specific design, and a hub derived from Ferrari 458 Challenge. The aerodynamics have allowed us to achieve more interesting results, starting with the creation of a virtual windshield. The elimination of the windshield would, in fact, the arrival of a stream of air pressure increasing with the speed on the head of the driver and the passenger. The engineers and designers at Pininfarina have designed, built and tested an airfoil placed in a shape of the bonnet, which produces a double deflection of the flow of air entering the passenger compartment. The first deviation is made from the wing itself, the second from the air that accelerates the channel created between the airfoil and the corresponding shape of the molding in the trunk. The result is that, thanks to the virtual windshield, the air passes above the heads of the driver and the passenger, greatly increasing the comfort. This effect also contributes to increase the aerodynamic downforce on the front axle of the car. The virtual windscreen is already effective from 50 km/h.|$|E

5000|$|A sizable {{selection}} of <b>alloy</b> <b>wheels</b> (sometimes called [...] "mags"—see below) {{are available to}} automobile owners who want lighter, more visually appealing, rarer, and/or larger wheels on their cars.Although replacing standard steel wheel and tire combinations with <b>lighter</b> <b>alloy</b> <b>wheels</b> and potentially lower profile tyres can result in increased performance and handling, this doesn't necessarily hold when increasingly large wheels are employed. Research by Car and Driver conducted using a {{selection of}} differently sized <b>alloy</b> <b>wheels</b> from [...] all outfitted with the same make and model of tires showed that both acceleration and fuel economy suffered with larger wheels. [...] They also noted that ride comfort and noise were negatively affected by the larger wheels.The allure of larger wheels is that they signify luxury, sportiness, or wealth.|$|R
