With {{the onset of the}} Depression, she returned to Hollywood and began teaching voice, counting the actors Ramón Novarro and Frances Drake among her pupils. Subsequent theatrical performances on Broadway and on tour included supporting parts in Enter Madame, Night of Love, Claudia, and <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>Behold.</b> During the 1940s/50s, her voice mellowed to that of a mezzo-soprano and she enjoyed modest success on the concert recital circuit, singing occasionally on radio. On tour, many of her costumes were designed by her friend and patroness, heiress Natalie Hays Hammond, daughter of the real adventurer who discovered King Solomon's Mines.|$|E

[...] With 18 second left in the game, Wisconsin had the ball at its own 35-yard line and needed to gain 65 yards for a score. [...] A Wisconsin player caught a pass {{and appeared to be}} heading to a game-winning touchdown.

Once {{when he was on}} the opposite bank of a river, Sankara who was on the other side called him, and Padmapadacharya, without even thinking that he might be drowned in a swollen river began walking <b>and</b> <b>lo!</b> <b>behold</b> ! a lotus appeared on every step that he would take and hold his feet from drowning - and that is why he came to be known as Padma-Pada - Lotus - Feet. His devotion exemplifies the hoary relationship of Guru and Shishya.|$|R

Among DiLello's comments, he described [...] "No Time or Space" [...] as [...] "a pottage of space music" [...] and said of [...] "Under the Mersey Wall": [...] "in a mounting vortex of decibels, there came to pass a wrecked chord of environmental sound that went beyond the genre of hashish cocktail music. The bass line had been milked through the Moog machine <b>and,</b> <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> high, we <b>behold</b> electronic music …" [...] The inside sleeve included a quotation attributed to [...] "Arthur Wax": [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} around, making a lot of noise; here's some more." ...|$|R

500|$|Tim Ferguson met Richard Fidler busking on {{the streets}} of Canberra in 1984, while they were both {{attending}} university. Ferguson recalls: [...] "Richard was playing the guitar—something from Cat Stevens—one day and I walked up to him and we did 'Wild Thing'. I sang a few lyrics and jumped about like a mad thing. <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold</b> we made a stack of money in ten minutes." [...] The two began performing together and joined with another friend, Robert Piper, to form the Doug Anthony All Stars. They derived their name from Doug Anthony, a former Country Party leader and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. According to Fidler, during their earlier gigs in clubs and as street performers, Ferguson was [...] "a bit of an explosive hippie" [...] while Fidler and Piper were more reserved. Robert Piper left the group in 1985 due to other commitments. Piper has gone on to a successful career with the United Nations and in March 2013 was named Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at the time and I brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien premiered on June 1, 2009, with The Max Weinberg 7 now {{expanded}} to eight {{and referred to}} as Max Weinberg and the Tonight Show Band. [...] Andy Richter was back as an announcer, making Weinberg's role as a foil a little uncertain. [...] Gradually Weinberg and the band's roles in the comic aspects of the show began to assert themselves. On June 25, Weinberg departed The Tonight Show temporarily for four weeks to join Springsteen and band part-way through their European leg; this was conveyed on the show via a comedy bit that had his drum riser turn into a float that took him outside the studio and purportedly to the airport. [...] Weinberg returned to the show on August 3, after flying back from a Springsteen show that had ended early into the same morning in Spain. [...] Of being Tonight Show bandleader, he said, [...] "I {{think one of the}} biggest thrills in my life was seeing my name in the same sentence as Doc Severinsen, who, in my view, is the gold standard for 'Tonight Show' bandleaders. There's never been anyone who did it quite near the class and the brilliance of Doc Severinsen in the original Tonight Show Band. I used to think when I was a kid what a great job that must be – you know, same place, every time, everyday. <b>Lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> here I am 40 years later, doing it. That sounds deep, deep, deep, deep, deeply satisfying to me." [...] On September 25, Weinberg left The Tonight Show again for two months, to join Springsteen and band for the final, American portion of the Working on a Dream Tour. [...] The same drum-riser-to-float comedy bit was used, except this time the float was [...] "hit" [...] and demolished by a truck just outside the studio (and airing of the segment was delayed a few days due to O'Brien legitimately injuring himself during the same show). [...] The tour wrapped on November 22, 2009, in Buffalo, New York; Weinberg was back on The Tonight Show the next day. [...] With no E Street Band projects in sight {{for at least the next}} year or two, Weinberg was left to concentrate on his bandleader role.|$|E
5000|$|Harem Scarem were an Australian blues {{rock group}} which formed in 1982. They issued two studio albums, Pilgrim's Progress on Au Go Go Records (1986) <b>and</b> <b>Lo</b> & <b>Behold</b> on Citadel Records (1988) before {{disbanding}} in 1989. The early line-up was fronted by Christopher Marshall on lead vocals and included his brother, Charles Marshall first on bass guitar, then rhythm guitar and, when fronting the group from 1987, {{was also on}} lead vocals. By September 1985 they had been joined by Peter Jones on drums and percussion; Barry Palmer on lead guitar; Glen Sheldon first on rhythm guitar and then on bass guitar; and Chris Wilson on harmonica and saxophone. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt that [...] "Few alternative bands of the day could ever hope to match that line-up for muscular bravado and sheer instrumental firepower". On 18 May 2012 Peter Jones died of brain cancer, aged 45.|$|R

They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew what I had to do and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The kiss between Zoe and Kelly {{received}} criticism. Lesbian news site AfterEllen.com branded it a [...] "gratuitous ratings-stunt" [...] {{and said}} [...] "The writers bottled {{out and the}} two young women dismissed it as a one-off, assuring each other that neither of them was 'like that,' leaving lesbian and bisexual viewers feeling cheated. This was a wasted opportunity, a chance to explore an emotionally complex situation between best friends that became just another exploitive TV moment instead." [...] In an interview about homosexual television characters in The Guardian, scriptwriter Daran Little criticised lesbians in British soaps: [...] "Most lesbian characters are so lipstick. They start off straight and, <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> they just can't resist it. You can see the straight fantasy at work behind the character". Journalist Paul Flynn stated that Zoe {{was an example of}} this, describing her as a [...] "tabloid-friendly 18-year-old—who [...] brushed with lesbianism for all of five minutes." [...] Kinsella defended the kiss in an interview, commenting, [...] "It's not a gratuitous ratings getting move, it's not some kind of big lesbian kiss. It's the way two best friends who have a lot of love for each other show their emotions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Giving {{the order}} to start {{production}} in spring 1962, Fellini signed deals with his producer Rizzoli, fixed dates, had sets constructed, cast Mastroianni, Anouk Aimée, and Sandra Milo in lead roles, and did screen tests at the Scalera Studios in Rome. He hired cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo, among key personnel. But apart from naming his hero Guido Anselmi, he still couldn't decide what his character did for a living. The crisis {{came to a head}} in April when, sitting in his Cinecittà office, he began a letter to Rizzoli confessing he had [...] "lost his film" [...] and had to abandon the project. Interrupted by the chief machinist requesting he celebrate the launch of 8½, Fellini put aside the letter and went on the set. Raising a toast to the crew, he [...] "felt overwhelmed by shame… I was in a no exit situation. I was a director who wanted to make a film he no longer remembers. And <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> at that very moment everything fell into place. I got straight {{to the heart of the}} film. I would narrate everything that had been happening to me. I would make a film telling the story of a director who no longer knows what film he wanted to make".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} few weeks at Carlisle, when the Lakota and Dakota greatly outnumbered all other tribes, it was {{discovered}} that Cheyennes and Kiowas were learning to speak Lakota and Dakota. After that, English was the only language permitted on the campus. Dormitory rooms held three or four each, and no two students from the same tribe were permitted to room together. The plan helped in the rapid acquirement of English, and although some were hereditary foes, Pratt believed the Indian students to be less inclined to quarrel than most white children. However, there were consequences. In 1879, Chief Blue Horse's son Baldwin Blue Horse, age 12, was in the first group of Oglala Lakota students to arrive at Carlisle. In 1888, Chief Blue Horse met with Baldwin at a performance of Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and spoke through an interpreter. Later Luther Standing Bear was called to the superintendent's office and asked him if {{it was a good idea}} to get some Indian boys from the reservation and put them in school with white boys, expecting that the Indian boys would learn faster by such an association. Luther agreed that it might be a good plan, so a permit was received from Washington. Sixty boys from Pine Ridge were mixed with 60 European-American boys. Teachers had hoped the Indians would learn the English language faster by this arrangement. [...] "But <b>lo</b> <b>and</b> <b>behold,</b> the white boys began learning the Sioux language." [...] The program was discontinued. Some Native Americans are angry about painful Indian boarding school experiences and Pratt's Progressive Reformist views on assimilation have been condemned.|$|E
