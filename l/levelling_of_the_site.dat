2500|$|When {{work was}} nearing completion, the Government called for tenders {{to erect a}} fourth-class station {{building}} and stationmaster’s house. [...] The contract was let to W. H. Ridler for the sum of £1,778. [...] This contract also possibly included the erection of the goods shed on a siding 12 chains (240 metres) {{to the north of}} the station (the goods shed was demolished in 1882). [...] A separate contract for the sum of £1,514 was let to Messrs. Fraser and Lyon for the construction of an access road to the station and the <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> for the station and house.|$|E
2500|$|Demolition of {{the ground}} {{commenced}} in April 2012. By the end of June 2012, demolition of the structure was almost complete: the pitch had been removed, all four stands demolished {{and three of the}} floodlight pylons levelled. [...] Work on rubble removal and <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> was ongoing. In early July 2012, Barratt Homes began publicising details of the development to potential purchasers, stating that the first homes on the site would be available for occupancy in Autumn 2012. The final floodlight pylon - and last remaining Saltergate structure - was levelled on 13 July. Initial construction of the roads and first plots began at the end of July 2012.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{included}} {{cutting a}} new channel over 1,000 yards {{long for the}} River Calder south of the original, <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> with over 1 million cubic yards of infill, the re-construction and extension of a road bridge at {{the east end of}} the site near Horbury Bridge, the construction of three railway bridges over the River Calder, and diversion of gas and electricity mains.|$|E

50|$|This project proved {{beneficial}} in alleviating some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stresses upon the fort. In 2011, the Watch Hill Fire Department placed railings along <b>the</b> top edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main building. They also placed steel covers blocking the steps, preventing access to <b>the</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b>|$|R
50|$|The area also {{features}} bradyseismic phenomena, which are most evident at <b>the</b> Macellum <b>of</b> Pozzuoli (misidentified as a temple of Serapis), as geologists puzzled over bands of boreholes left by marine molluscs on marble columns, showing that <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{in relation to}} sea level had varied.|$|R
50|$|At Seokjang-ri, {{an archaeological}} site near Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do Province, {{artifacts}} {{that appear to}} have an affinity with Lower Paleolithic stone tools were unearthed in <b>the</b> lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> Bifacial chopper or chopping-tools were also excavated. Hand axes and cleavers produced by men in later eras were also uncovered.|$|R
50|$|The Ateliers et Chantiers de France (ACF) {{company was}} officially founded on 6 July 1898 by a {{consortium}} of six shipping brokers, the Dunkirk chamber of commerce and the state.The state asked that the shipyard {{be able to build}} steamships and also four-masted barques and clippers with metal hulls.The state ceded the public land within the fortifications of Dunkirk to the east of the channel, and undertook <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and excavation of a launching basin.The work proceeded smoothly.Six slipways were built on a site of 11 ha to the east of the city.The new facility was the first in France to power its machinery with electricity.|$|E
5000|$|The new {{lighthouse}} {{was designed}} by William Douglass and built {{under the supervision of}} James Kavanagh. Construction started in 1897 with the <b>levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> and the first of 2,047 Cornish granite dovetailed blocks was laid in June 1899. As well as these blocks, weighing 4,300 tons in total and with a volume of , a further [...] of granite was used to fill the inside of the tower up {{to the level of the}} entrance floor 58 ft above high-water mark. A small steamship, the Ierne, was specially constructed for carrying the blocks out to the island, and Kavanagh personally set every stone, which weighed between 1¾ and 3 tons. The new lighthouse entered service on 27 June 1904 having cost nearly £90,000.|$|E
50|$|The RAF's 1930s {{expansion}} plan included {{a requirement for}} a station to provide anti-submarine and anti-shipping patrols off the South-west coast of England. The site at St Eval was chosen as a Coastal Command airfield and work started in 1938. Five widely dispersed cottages, two houses and portions of two farms were acquired by compulsory purchase; the village of St Eval was completely demolished {{in order to build}} the airfield. <b>Levelling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> by G Wallace Ltd involved the removal by bulldozers of many Cornish dry stone walls and three ancient tumuli. One householder tried to hold out against the authorities and refused to leave his cottage for several days. Only the church survived which the RAF adopted as their station church and it still stands today. The work progressed well and RAF St Eval opened on 2 October 1939.|$|E
50|$|In July 2005 the Federal Law on the Special {{economic}} zones # 116 {{was passed}} {{and by that}} time <b>the</b> Minister <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Economical Development <b>of</b> Russian Federation German Gref arrived to <b>the</b> <b>site</b> to check <b>the</b> development <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and <b>the</b> availability <b>of</b> existing infrastructure to allocate new industrial factories.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> {{is about}} 1 acre in size, {{and was at}} <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1973 survey {{partially}} overlaid by a sporting camp, which had disturbed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> Outside these areas, <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is well preserved, and shows signs of deep stratification, with layering suggesting dating from the Archaic Period (c. 4000 BCE) to historic times.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Gordon Willey and Albert Norweb {{excavated}} <b>the</b> Cruz <b>site</b> (named after <b>the</b> Cruz Hacienda), on the North East part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. This <b>site</b> {{is important}} because it produced nearly 30,000 sherds, most of which belonged to the Late Polychrome Period. <b>The</b> upper <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> produced <b>the</b> diagnostic ceramic types which came to define the Late Polychrome Period for <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rivas area. Pieces were also found from the San Jorge phase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zoned Bichrome Period (Healy, 1980).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>site</b> was {{excavated}} by <b>the</b> British Institute <b>of</b> Archaeology at Ankara, under <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> David French, from 1978 to its flooding by the Atatürk Dam in 1990. Surface pottery suggests <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{was first}} occupied {{in the fourth}} millennium BC, but large-scale excavation was restricted to the Medieval, Classical and Iron Age <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> A small step-trench recovered Iron Age and Bronze Age pottery in 1980; a more substantial trench was cut into <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound in the last season and reached Late Bronze Age levels.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> lower <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> {{featured}} {{large amounts}} of Ubaid pottery and associated kilns. Evidence for Ubaid period pottery manufacture has also been observed on <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> <b>The</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface scatter indicates that pottery production was a specialized craft, and this confirms finds from other Ubaid <b>sites</b> like Eridu. <b>The</b> <b>site</b> also yielded a cemetery and some finds from the Jemdet Nasr period. <b>The</b> temple <b>of</b> Ninhursag at <b>the</b> summit was on a cleared oval similar to that at Khafajah. The wall surrounding the temple was built by Shulgi <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ur III Empire.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> four acre <b>site</b> {{runs along}} <b>the</b> eastern edge <b>of</b> Birmingham Snow Hill station, which marks <b>the</b> western {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site.</b> To <b>the</b> north, <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is bounded by Great Charles Street Queensway and St. Chad's Circus on the Inner Ring Road, and to <b>the</b> east <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is bounded by Snow Hill Queensway. To <b>the</b> south <b>the</b> <b>site</b> is bounded by Colmore Circus. It is located between the City Core and the Gun and Jewellery Quarters. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> drops significantly from Colmore Circus to St. Chad's Circus and also drops from Snow Hill Queensway to the railway station.|$|R

Welfare measures of site closures differ in varying ways depending on <b>the</b> familiarity <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> in question. ...|$|R
50|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{remarkable}} finds at <b>the</b> Ubaid <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> were fragments <b>of</b> two pottery boat models, excavated in 1991. The models represented long, narrow canoes with pointed sterns. The boats were probably made of reed coated with bitumen {{to make them}} waterproof. The findings strongly suggest that people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Khabur region had already made use of boats for transport and fishing by c. 5000 BC, if not before. Similar models have been unearthed from other Ubaid sites such as Eridu, Ubaid, Uqair and Abada.|$|R
