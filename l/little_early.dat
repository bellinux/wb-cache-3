5|$|The Norman conquest {{introduced}} northern French artistic styles, {{particular in}} illuminated manuscripts and murals, {{and reduced the}} demand for carvings. In other artistic areas, including embroidery, the Anglo-Saxon influence remained evident into the 12th century, and the famous Bayeux Tapestry {{is an example of}} older styles being reemployed under the new regime. Stained glass became a distinctive form of English art during this later medieval period, although the coloured glass for these works was almost entirely imported from Europe. <b>Little</b> <b>early</b> stained glass in England has survived, but it typically had both an ornamental and educational function, while later works also commemorated the sponsors of the windows into the designs. English tapestry making and embroidery in the early 14th century were of an especially high quality; works produced by nuns and London professionals were exported across Europe, becoming known as the opus anglicanum. English illuminated books, such as the Queen Mary Psalter, were also famous in this period, featuring rich decoration, a combination of grotesque and natural figures and rich colours. The quality of illuminated art in England declined significantly in the face of competition from Flanders in the 14th century, and later English illuminated medieval pieces generally imitated Flemish styles.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, winemakers found <b>little</b> <b>early</b> {{success with}} Nebbiolo {{as many of}} the {{earliest}} plantings were in sites {{that turned out to be}} too warm for the grape. Research into cooler climate sites lead to some favorable examples coming from the marginal climate of Victoria's King Valley. Further studies have indicated that the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria and the Margaret River area of Western Australia have similar amounts of rainfall, relative humidity and sunshine hours as the Langhe region of Piedmont. Victoria's Bendigo, South Australia's Clare Valley and the Mudgee, New South Wales's are also currently being explored for their potential with Nebbiolo.|$|E
25|$|Anaximander was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to consider the Sun as a huge mass, and consequently, to realize how far from Earth it might be, {{and the first to}} present a system where the celestial bodies turned at different distances. Furthermore, according to Diogenes Laertius (II, 2), he built a celestial sphere. This invention undoubtedly made him the first to realize the obliquity of the Zodiac as the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder reports in Natural History (II, 8). It is a <b>little</b> <b>early</b> to use the term ecliptic, but his knowledge and work on astronomy confirm that he must have observed the inclination of the celestial sphere in relation to the plane of the Earth to explain the seasons. The doxographer and theologian Aetius attributes to Pythagoras the exact measurement of the obliquity.|$|E

25|$|Medieval England {{produced}} art in {{the form}} of paintings, carvings, books, fabrics and many functional but beautiful objects. A wide range of materials were used, including gold, glass and ivory, the art usually drawing overt attention to the materials utilised in the designs. Stained glass became a common form of English art during this period, although the coloured glass for these works was almost entirely imported from Europe. <b>Little</b> <b>early</b> stained glass in England has survived, but it typically had both an ornamental and educational function, while later works also commemorated the sponsors of the windows into the designs.

25|$|In the 18th century, {{the time}} of day or night in Paris was largely {{announced}} by the church bells; in 1789 there were 66 churches, 92 chapels, 13 abbeys and 199 convents, all of which rang their bells for regular services and prayers; sometimes a <b>little</b> <b>early,</b> sometimes a little late. A clock had also been installed in a tower of the palace on the Île de la Cité by Charles V in about 1370, and it also sounded the hour. Wealthy and noble Parisians began to have pocket watches, and needed a way to accurately set the time, so sundials appeared around the city. The best known-sundial was in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. In 1750, the Duke of Chartres had a cannon installed there which, following the sundial, was fired precisely at noon each day.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{marketing}} {{has been}} criticized for not advertising it as a musical. Michael Halberstam of the Writers' Theatre said, [...] "By de-emphasizing the score to the extent they did in the trailer, it is possible the producers were condescending to us – a tactic which cannot ultimately end in anything but tears." [...] In the UK, a number of audience members walked out of the film on realizing it was a musical, and complaints that advertisements for the film were deliberately misleading were made to both the Advertising Standards Authority and Trading Standards agency. The studios involved opted for a low-key approach to their marketing. Producer Walter Parkes stated, [...] "All these things that could be described as difficulties could also be the movie's greatest strengths."

[...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a <b>little</b> <b>early</b> to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E

[...] He praised the Dead Executives produced tracks and concluded the review by writing that [...] "apparently there aren't even enough bearable moments in Duff's recording career to fill one CD". Gabriel Leong of MTV Southeast Asia started the review by writing [...] "A greatest hits album seems a tad flagrant when you've only had two albums so far. So let's call this one a compilation album instead." [...] Leong noted that the title fitted the album perfectly and that it proves [...] "its innocuous appeal of infectious bubblegum pop." [...] David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented that it was [...] "a <b>little</b> <b>early</b> in the career" [...] to release a greatest hits album and that it showcased that [...] "Duff is more product than talent." [...] Aidin Vaziri of San Francisco Chronicle also commented that it was premature as {{it was too early}} in Duff's career to release a greatest hits compilation. He commended the new tracks produced by the Dead Executives writing that they [...] "help alleviate the feeling that this is a total cash grab."

We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new."

The Los Angeles Angels came to Citizens Bank Park for a two-game series on May 13–14.

In game one, Devin Mesoraco hit a three-run home run and the Reds' pitching shut out the Phillies; despite a quality start, Kendrick had another loss. After two straight shutouts the Phillies scored 12 runs in the next game, defeating Cincinnati 12–1 for Hamels' 100th career win; Domonic Brown had a home run and five RBIs, Asche had three RBIs and César Hernández hit his first major-league home run. The Phillies took the rubber match of the series, winning 8–3 with four home runs (by Rollins, Asche, Byrd and Wil Nieves) and a solid start from Lee (his last before joining the 15-day disabled list May 21 with to a left-elbow strain; the team recalled Ruf, who returned from injury). After a day off the Phillies played the Marlins in Miami, their second meeting of the season.

2500|$|Skinner {{advocated}} {{the use of}} teaching machines for {{a broad range of}} students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. [...] "Unison" [...] is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a <b>little</b> <b>early</b> or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, [...] "learning by doing." ...|$|E
