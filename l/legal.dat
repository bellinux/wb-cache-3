5|$|According to Scientology {{general counsel}} Elliot Abelson, {{the bulk of}} Moxon's <b>legal</b> work is Scientology-related. In {{addition}} to his office with his law firm, as of 1997 Moxon also kept a <b>legal</b> office in the Church of Scientology's headquarters at Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Moxon has also served as <b>legal</b> advisor to the Scientology-affiliated organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR). According to a CCHR press release from 2001, Moxon represented CCHR International as its Commissioner.|$|E
5|$|Before {{custodial}} interrogations, {{police are}} required to give suspects a Miranda warning that informs suspects of their <b>legal</b> rights during interrogation. However, Alvarado was not given a Miranda warning {{at any time during}} questioning. This would form part of the basis for Alvarado's <b>legal</b> defense.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} <b>legal</b> questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a <b>legal</b> animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a <b>legal</b> person and a <b>legal</b> animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} is {{a branch}} of jurisprudence that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions {{about the history of}} <b>legal</b> and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their <b>legal</b> rights.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern <b>legal</b> scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist <b>legal</b> scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or <b>legal</b> interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.|$|E
5|$|From 1981 {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 2003, Miskovsky worked for Kirkland & Ellis, where he specialized in environmental law. In 1989, Miskovsky helped establish the Archdiocesan <b>Legal</b> Network, a free <b>legal</b> clinic run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington. The clinic aided people with non-criminal <b>legal</b> issues such as bankruptcy, evictions, suspended licenses or delayed social security checks. Miskovsky was originally tasked with recruiting other lawyers for the clinic, but was eventually promoted to chairmen of the clinic's board.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{justice is}} costly to provide and many <b>legal</b> systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak <b>legal</b> institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high <b>legal</b> costs {{and the lack of}} <b>legal</b> aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E
5|$|Governor Stanley {{signed the}} school {{segregation}} and <b>legal</b> business bills into law on September 29, 1956. The funding cut-off bill and <b>legal</b> business bills {{went into effect}} immediately, while the remaining school segregation bills took effect 90 days later.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign saw {{significant}} <b>legal</b> changes, {{particularly in}} England and Normandy. By {{the middle of}} the 12th century, England had many different ecclesiastical and civil law courts, with overlapping jurisdictions resulting from the interaction of diverse <b>legal</b> traditions. Henry greatly expanded the role of royal justice in England, producing a more coherent <b>legal</b> system, summarised {{at the end of his}} reign in the treatise of Glanvill, an early <b>legal</b> handbook. Despite these reforms it is uncertain if Henry had a grand vision for his new <b>legal</b> system and the reforms seem to have proceeded in a steady, pragmatic fashion. Indeed, in most cases he was probably not personally responsible for creating the new processes, but he was greatly interested in the law, seeing the delivery of justice as one of the key tasks for a king and carefully appointing good administrators to conduct the reforms.|$|E

5|$|Jersey law {{has been}} {{influenced}} by several different <b>legal</b> traditions, in particular Norman customary law, English common law and modern French civil law. Jersey's <b>legal</b> system is therefore described as 'mixed' or 'pluralistic', and sources of law are in French and English languages, although since the 1950s the main working language of the <b>legal</b> system is English.|$|E

5|$|Shakespeare Quiney died at {{six months}} of age. Richard and Thomas Quiney were buried within nine days of each other, 21 and 19 years old respectively. The deaths of all of Judith's {{children}} resulted in new <b>legal</b> consequences. The entail on her father's inheritance led Susanna, along with her daughter and son-in-law, to make a settlement using a rather elaborate <b>legal</b> device for the inheritance of her own branch of the family. <b>Legal</b> wrangling continued for another thirteen years, until 1652.|$|E
5|$|The 39-story Secretariat Building was {{completed}} in 1952. It houses offices for the Secretary General, the Under-Secretary-General for <b>Legal</b> Affairs and United Nations <b>Legal</b> Counsel, the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs and Office of Disarmament Affairs, and the Department for General Assembly and Conference Management (DGACM).|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice is {{responsible}} for handling <b>legal</b> matters for the government. Its responsibilities include providing <b>legal</b> advice, criminal prosecution, civil representation, <b>legal</b> and policy drafting and reform and international <b>legal</b> co-operation between different jurisdictions. Apart from prosecuting criminal cases, lawyers of the Department of Justice act {{on behalf of the}} government in all civil and administrative lawsuits against the government. As protector of public interest, the department may apply for judicial reviews and may intervene in any cases involving the greater public interest. The Basic Law protects the Department of Justice from any interference by the government when exercising its control over criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The English law <b>legal</b> system, {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law <b>legal</b> systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, the <b>legal</b> system of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate <b>legal</b> system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of <b>legal</b> precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E

5|$|The {{provisions}} {{set forth}} in the Leges can be traced to laws of Cnut and various Anglo-Saxon codes. Some of the Anglo-Saxon codes used may have been subsequently lost. Also, certain <b>legal</b> terms used in the Leges, whether in their original English language or rendered into Latin, cannot be found in any extant <b>legal</b> code, and may be another example of preserving now-lost <b>legal</b> codes or provisions. It also draws upon non-English sources, including Isidore of Seville and Ivo of Chartres, as well as <b>legal</b> codes such as Frankish and canon law. Other sources include the Vulgate edition of the Bible and Roman law codes, although the debt to those sources is small.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} gained <b>legal</b> aid {{to launch}} the judicial review and argued that there were flaws in the planning process. The review took place on 18–19 December 2012 in Manchester {{to decide whether the}} council's planning process was <b>legal.</b> The judge reserved his decision for a month, but decided to reject RURA's claim to quash the planning permission. The final <b>legal</b> action from RURA came to an end after an unsuccessful challenge was made to the Court of Appeal in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|The total {{fertility}} rate (TFR) was estimated for 2013 at 1.86 births per woman. Adoption in the United States is common and relatively easy from a <b>legal</b> {{point of view}} (compared to other Western countries). In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for {{nearly half of the}} total number of adoptions worldwide. Same-sex marriage is <b>legal</b> nationwide and it is <b>legal</b> for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.|$|E
5|$|With the {{differentiation}} of <b>legal</b> and physical custody, {{it is possible}} for a court to make separate determinations of whether to grant joint <b>legal</b> custody, joint physical custody, or both. In many states, the determination of whether or not to grant joint or sole custody is made separately for <b>legal</b> and physical custody.|$|E

25|$|The <b>legal</b> {{memorandum}} is {{the most}} common type of predictive <b>legal</b> analysis; it may include the client letter or <b>legal</b> opinion. The <b>legal</b> memorandum predicts the outcome of a <b>legal</b> question by analyzing the authorities governing the question and the relevant facts that gave rise to the <b>legal</b> question. It explains and applies the authorities in predicting an outcome, and ends with advice and recommendations. The <b>legal</b> memorandum also serves as record of the research done for a given <b>legal</b> question. Traditionally, and to meet the <b>legal</b> reader's expectations, it is formally organized and written.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legal</b> {{drafting}} creates binding <b>legal</b> text. It includes enacted law like statutes, {{rule and}} regulations; contracts (private and public); personal <b>legal</b> documents like wills and trusts; and public <b>legal</b> documents like notices and instructions. <b>Legal</b> drafting requires no <b>legal</b> authority citation and generally is written without a stylised voice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legal</b> {{writing is}} a type of {{technical}} writing used by lawyers, judges, legislators, and others in law to express <b>legal</b> analysis and <b>legal</b> rights and duties. <b>Legal</b> writing in practice is used to advocate for or to express the resolution of a client's <b>legal</b> matter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legal</b> retainer- Lawyers {{in certain}} {{countries}} often require that a <b>legal</b> retainer be paid upfront {{and held in}} trust {{until such time as}} the <b>legal</b> work is performed and billed to the client, this serves as a minimum guarantee of remuneration should the client become insolvent. However, strict <b>legal</b> ethical codes apply to the use of <b>legal</b> retainer trusts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Legal</b> {{writing is}} of two, broad categories: (i) <b>legal</b> {{analysis}} and (ii) <b>legal</b> drafting. <b>Legal</b> analysis is two-fold: (1) predictive analysis, and (2) persuasive analysis. In the United States, in most law schools students must learn <b>legal</b> writing; the courses focus on: (1) predictive analysis, i.e., an outcome-predicting memorandum (positive or negative) {{of a given}} action for the attorney's client; and (2) persuasive analysis, e.g., motions and briefs. Although not as widely taught in law schools, <b>legal</b> drafting courses exist; other types of <b>legal</b> writing concentrate upon writing appeals or on interdisciplinary aspects of persuasion.|$|E
25|$|More specifically, {{sociology}} of law consists of various {{approaches to the}} study of law in society, which empirically examine and theorize the interaction between law, <b>legal,</b> non-legal institutions and social factors. Areas of socio-legal inquiry include the social development of <b>legal</b> institutions, forms of social control, <b>legal</b> regulation, the interaction between <b>legal</b> cultures, the social construction of <b>legal</b> issues, <b>legal</b> profession, and the relation between law and social change.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s {{up to the}} 1980s, the {{four-year}} law program consisted of one-hundred-twenty-two (122) units which emphasize the eight bar subjects listed in the Revised Rules of Court: civil law, criminal law, remedial law, <b>legal</b> ethics and <b>legal</b> forms, commercial law, political law, tax law, labor law, public corporation and public officers, and international law. The program also included non-bar subjects such as <b>legal</b> history, <b>legal</b> bibliography, statutory construction, jurisprudence, trial techniques, thesis and <b>legal</b> research, <b>legal</b> medicine, and practice court.|$|E
25|$|As an approach, {{it focuses}} on the {{cultural}} aspects of law, <b>legal</b> behaviour and <b>legal</b> institutions and, thus, has affinity with cultural anthropology, <b>legal</b> pluralism, and comparative law.|$|E
