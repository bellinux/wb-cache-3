The experiment was repeated twice. The F 2 populations were grown in the ordinary condition. The average 1, 000 -grain weight was largest in the dry plot followed by spikelet thinned, control, <b>leaf</b> <b>cut,</b> and wet plots. The 1, 000 -grain weight was predominantly controlled by the additive genes. The dominance effect was also significant. The large grain weight was controlled by the overdominant genes. Epistasis among the genes controlling the 1, 000 -grain weight was significant, but the maternal effect was absent. In the F 1 diallel, heritability was 0. 3 ~ 0. 6 and 0. 2 ~ 0. 5 in a broad and a narrow sense, respectively. In the F 2 diallel, it was 0. 9 and 0. 6 in a broad and a narrow sense, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sales of {{smokeless}} tobacco products {{have increased in}} the USA. More than one in eight males in the 12 th grade are current users of {{smokeless tobacco}}. Surveillance data examining nicotine levels of smokeless tobacco subsequent to 2006 have not {{been reported in the}} literature. METHODS: Data on nicotine levels and design features (eg, pH, moisture content, <b>leaf</b> <b>cut</b> and flavour) of smokeless tobacco products sold in Massachusetts were obtained from manufacturers between 2003 and 2012. Design features, levels and temporal trends in unionised (free) nicotine and nicotine content of smokeless tobacco products were analysed overall and by manufacturer and product type. RESULTS: The annual total number of moist snuff products increased from 99 in 2003 to 127 in 2012. The annual total number of reported snus products increased from 4 in 2003 to the highest level of 62 in 2011, before decreasing to 26 in 2012. Overall, mean unionised (free) nicotine remained relatively stable (beta= 0. 018 (95 % CI - 0. 014 to 0. 050) mg/g dry weight/year) from 2003 to 2012. However, both levels and temporal trends of mean free nicotine varied significantly among manufacturers (p CONCLUSIONS: The number of smokeless tobacco products increased in the Massachusetts market. Further, mean unionised (free) nicotine levels in smokeless tobacco products of several manufacturers continued to rise despite decreasing levels from other manufacturers. The current success in tobacco control is very likely undermined without government surveillance, regulation and widespread public disclosure of nicotine levels in these products...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial leaf blight of {{eucalyptus}} is initially characterized by water soaked, angular, amphigenous and interveinal lesions, concentrated {{along the main}} vein, at the edges or scattered on the leaf blade. As the disease progresses, the lesions become brown to pale, and when young leaves are infected <b>leaf</b> <b>cut</b> areas at the edges or perforations {{at the center of}} the lesions may appear due to abortion of the necrotic area. Eventually, necrosis may be found on petiole and twigs. Leaf fall commonly occurs on highly susceptible genotypes due to the early senescence of diseased leaves. Precise diagnosis is accomplished by bacterial exudation from leaf sections placed in a water drop under light microscope (200 x). Twenty-five bacterial isolates from Amapá (2), Bahia (4), Minas Gerais (2), São Paulo (9), Pará (3), Mato Grosso do Sul (1), and Rio Grande do Sul (4) States, which induced hypersensitive reaction (HR) in non-host plants and were pathogenic to eucalyptus, when inoculated by inoculum injection, were identified by biochemical assays, using carbon sources (MicroLogTM BIOLOG) and sequence analysis (16 S rDNA). Ten isolates were identified as Xanthomonas axonopodis, four as X. campestris, four as Pseudomonas syringae, two as P. putida, two as P. cichorii, one as Erwinia sp., and two were similar to bacterial genera of Rhizobiaceae. When spray inoculated on intact plants {{of eucalyptus}}, only X. axonopodis, P. cichorii and isolates of the Rhizobiaceae family induced typical symptoms of the disease and were considered pathogenic.

40|$|Background: Moist snuff and snus are {{smokeless}} tobacco {{products that are}} marketed toward smokers for use at times smoking is prohibited. Little information is available about the nicotine content and design features of these products, particularly snus. Methods: Data on free nicotine levels and design features (pH, total nicotine content, tobacco <b>leaf</b> <b>cut</b> and flavor) of {{smokeless tobacco}} products were obtained from manufactures’ annual reports to Massachusetts Department of Public Health between 1997 and 2010. Descriptive statistics were provided overall, and by manufacturer and product type. Results: Mean level of free nicotine in moist snuff remained relatively constant {{within the range of}} 3 to 5 mg/g between 1997 and 2010, although this varies by manufacturer, brand, and design characteristics. Mean free nicotine was higher in snus than in moist snuff and increased over time. Average free nicotine content of Swedish Match snus increased sharply since 2003 and reached 3 ̆e 6 mg/g in 2010 while that of American brands of snus decreased from 2. 9 mg/g in 2001 to 1. 7 mg/g in 2010. Swedish Match snus had significantly higher pH than American brands of snus and moist snuff, and experienced a sharp increase from 7. 3 in 2003 to 8. 3 in 2010. Wide variations in nicotine and pH levels were present among manufacturers. Free nicotine level was associated with pH level of both snus and moist snuff products, and with tobacco leaf-cut for moist snuff. The number of sub-brands of both snus and moist snuff products increased during the study period. Conclusion: There was notable increasing trend in free nicotine concentration in Swedish Match snus that are marketed to US consumers. The increase in number sub-brands suggests greater marketing efforts by the manufacturers in recent years. Continued surveillance of smokeless tobacco products in MA is {{an important component of the}} State’s control effort...|$|E

Os sais e vitaminas do meio MS foram acrescidos de mio-inositol (100 mg. L- 1), sacarose (30 g. L- 1), ágar (6 g. L- 1) e adicionados de 1, 6 µM ácido naftalenoacético (ANA). Foram utilizados frascos com capacidade para 150 mL com 6 mL de meio de cultura. Os explantes foram obtidos de plantas cultivadas in vitro, em fase de multiplicação, 45 dias após a repicagem, e se constituíram de finos fragmentos da parte mediana de folhas, cortados no sentido transversal (comprimento de 8 a 10 mm) ou longitudinal (comprimento de 10 a 12 mm), ambos com largura aproximada de 1 mm. A porcentagem de regeneração, a intensidade de formação de calo e o número de brotos por explante foram avaliados aos 45 dias de cultivo. A partir dos resultados obtidos concluiu-se que a expressão do potencial morfogenético dos fragmentos delgados de folhas cortados no sentido transversal é maior do que o daqueles cortados no sentido longitudinal, e o seu cultivo em meio de cultura com 4, 54 µM de TDZ, propicia, simultaneamente, elevada porcentagem de regeneração, maior número de brotos e menor intensidade de calo.
