5|$|Sadler {{graduated}} from Battle Creek College in 1894 and subsequently worked for John Kellogg's brother, William K. Kellogg as a health-food salesman. Sadler, a skilled salesman, persuaded William Kellogg to market his products through demonstrations in retail stores. In 1894, he oversaw {{the establishment of}} <b>Life</b> <b>Boat</b> Mission, a mission that Kellogg founded on State Street in Chicago. Sadler operated the mission and published <b>Life</b> <b>Boat</b> Magazine; its sales were intended to provide funds for Kellogg's Chicago Medical Mission. Sadler also contributed articles to other Adventist publications, including the Review and Herald. Around 1895, Sadler attended Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois, where he trained to be an evangelist, ultimately becoming an ordained minister in 1901.|$|E
5|$|A {{cargo ship}} picked up {{eight of the}} {{aforementioned}} survivors from the Doña Marilyn; eleven other survivors were found on Maripipi Island and on a nearby inlet, ten were discovered on Sambawan Island, and four others were found floating in the water. In Almagro, 137survivors washed onshore on October25, 120ofwhom reached shore by either a life jacket or a <b>life</b> <b>boat.</b> Eighteen other survivors were buried in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors were buried, but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two were found on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E
5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged and paying his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a <b>life</b> <b>boat</b> {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E

Her only <b>life</b> <b>boat</b> {{ended up}} on the four-masted steel barque Moshulu which was also briefly owned by Charles Nelson Co., and as late as 1947 the boat was still seen on the barque, displaying the name of its original ship. The cabin clock from the Minnie A. Caine ended up installed on the three-masted schooner C.A. Thayer, and was still intact in 1958 when the schooner made its last voyage and was preserved at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} oversights of the entire system {{was the lack of}} {{adequate}} air-sea rescue organisation. The RAF had started organising a system in 1940 with High Speed Launches (HSLs) based on flying boat bases and at a number of overseas locations, but it was still believed that the amount of cross-Channel traffic meant that {{there was no need for}} a rescue service to cover these areas. Downed pilots and aircrew, it was hoped, would be picked up by any boats or ships which happened to be passing by. Otherwise the local <b>life</b> <b>boat</b> would be alerted, assuming someone had seen the pilot going into the water.|$|E

500|$|The {{squadron}}'s first combat {{mission was}} flown on 21 September 1944, when it picked up two downed Navy fliers. In November 1944, the squadron began operating from the Philippines. [...] Initially the Army {{was unable to}} support its OA-10s, and for several months, they were supported by the Navy's seaplane tenders, [...] and [...] [...] This support continued even after {{the arrival of the}} squadron's ground echelon. [...] During the last four months of the war, the squadron began to operate Boeing SB-17 Dumbos, which were equipped with a 27 foot long <b>life</b> <b>boat</b> with survival equipment that could be dropped to downed aircrews, in addition to its Catalinas. [...] This permitted the rescue of crews who were downed in seas that were too high for the Catalinas to land and pick them up. [...] The Dumbos would frequently accompany strike aircraft, orbiting off the coast during the attack, so as to be in position to accompany distressed aircraft on the return flight. [...] If needed, the <b>life</b> <b>boat,</b> whose engines gave it a range 500 miles, could be dropped to crews that ditched or bailed out of their aircraft. The squadron also provided courier service, carried supplies and messages, evacuated allied prisoners and wounded personnel, and occasionally provided reconnaissance.|$|E

In the end, every passenger and crew member from the Zam Zam was saved and only a few had been injured in the attack.|$|R

2500|$|In the Fall of 1964 the Blatchford sailed from Morehead City, NC to Rota, Spain {{fully laden}} with Marines from the 2nd Marine Air Wing (home based at MCAS Cherry Point).

The return was via the Canary Islands for liberty. During the return crossing of the Atlantic the ship passed through the final track of four former hurricanes. The seas became so rough that the troops were confined below decks and <b>life</b> <b>boat</b> drills were simulated in place.
