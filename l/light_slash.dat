This paper evaluates the accuracy of successive estimates of site disturbance using two ground survey methods. The results from the point transect and grid point transect and grid point intercept methods were compared with the results from an intensive 1 x 1 m grid survey over a 4 ha study area. The point transect method, using a transect spacing of 30 m, provided the most accurate and consistent estimate {{of disturbance}} in the study area. Following the harvest, approximately half of all treated area was disturbed to varying levels. Intact forest floor (undisturbed) and <b>light</b> <b>slash</b> were the dominant surface conditions, covering an average of 70 % of harvested area. The results indicate that shallow disturbances (litter left in place or removed) were more frequent than deep disturbances (topsoil removed, subsoil exposed, or rut exposed) ...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} assess a visual method for estimating organic matter and slash biomass residues following a typical feller-buncher/grapple-skidder clearcut harvest. A 20 by 20 meter grid was established in six 20 -year-old loblolly pine plantations, each of which was 3. 2 ha in size. Pre-harvest biomass was estimated using biomass equations developed by Baldwin (1987). Post harvest slash and litter biomass remaining was measured across the grid network by making visual estimates of percent coverage for each of 4 size classes and relating that to biomass using simple linear regression. Harvest slash and litter were collected from 4 m 2 plots and weighed to estimated biomass as a function of percent cover for each size class. Heavy slash (> 2. 5 cm) on the wet harvest sites had a biomass of 2. 49 kg/m 2, compared to 1. 89 kg/m 2 on the dry harvest sites. The amount of <b>light</b> <b>slash</b> (c 2. 5 cm) was also signifi-cantly greater on the wet harvest sites, 2. 47 kg/m*, compared to that on the dry-harvested sites at 1. 99 kg/m 2. Litter biomass,- 2. 4 kg / mZ, and piles, 0. 7 kg/m*, were not significantly different between sites. Visual estimation procedures provide a rough but useful estimate of biomass remaining after harvest (Pi * = 0. 42 to 0. 67), an extensive spatial estimate that is difficult to ascertain in any other way. The method reveals a certain amount of homogeniza-tion after harvesting. Harvesting sites when dry compared to wet results in a larger amount of displacement from the interior of a logging site. These estimates can be used to judge whether harvesting disturbance on organic residues affects stand p r o d u c t i v i t y...|$|E

50|$|The {{big news}} at Cadillac in 1949 {{centered}} on engineering, {{with the release}} of a new overhead valve V8 engine. This 331 inÂ³ engine produced 160 hp (119 kW). Only minor appearance changes were seen. They included a more massive grille treatment with grooved extension panels housing the front parking <b>lights</b> and chevron <b>slashes</b> below the taillamps on the coupes. Once again the cars in this line lacked front fender gravel shields and rocker panel moldings and had plainer interior trim. A larger luggage compartment lid was seen on all sedans except early production units. Standard equipment now included twin back-up lamps mounted on the deck lid latch panel.|$|R

The one was a man with yellow flowing beard and very long hair of the same tint drooping over his shoulders; his dress of good Norwich cloth and his assured bearing marked him as a man of position, while the sombre hue of his clothes and the absence of all ornament contrasted with the flash and glitter which had marked the king's retinue. By his side walked a woman, tall and slight and dark, with lithe, graceful figure and clear-cut, composed features. Her jet-black hair was gathered back under a light pink coif, her head poised proudly upon her neck, and her step long and springy, like that of some wild, tireless woodland creature. She held her left hand in front of her, covered with a red velvet glove, and on the wrist a little brown falcon, very fluffy and bedraggled, which she smoothed and fondled as she walked. As she came out into the sunshine, Alleyne noticed that her <b>light</b> gown, <b>slashed</b> with pink, was all stained with earth and with moss upon one side from shoulder to hem. He stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with parted lips, for this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature that mind could conceive of. Such had he imagined the angels, and such he had tried to paint them in the Beaulieu missals; but here there was something human, were it only in the battered hawk and discolored dress, which sent a tingle and thrill through his nerves such as no dream of radiant and stainless spirit had ever yet been able to conjure up. Good, quiet, uncomplaining mother Nature, long slighted and miscalled, still bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children.|$|R
