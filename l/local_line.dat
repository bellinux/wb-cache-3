25|$|As {{travel by}} rail became more popular and rail traffic grew, {{pressure}} mounted {{to have an}} additional <b>local</b> <b>line.</b> Also, the Gauge Act of 1846 decreed that George Stephenson's (narrower) standard gauge should be the standard used for all railways across the country.

25|$|The Kilmarnock and Troon Railway was a <b>local</b> <b>line,</b> and as larger {{concerns}} {{extended their}} area of influence, the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK) leased {{the line from}} 1846, and built connecting lines so that it became {{an integral part of}} their network. The alignment at the second Laigh Milton Viaduct was still unsatisfactory and in 1865 a third viaduct was built further south.

2500|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{considered to}} be part of the Midland Line, the Ross Branch was almost wholly operated as a separate route from Greymouth. The 1906 timetable showed 2 or 3 passenger trains a day. [...] Locomotive depots were established in both Ross and Hokitika, and when the Otira Tunnel linking the West Coast to Canterbury opened in 1923, the section to Hokitika began to increase in importance. [...] Carriages from the Christchurch-Greymouth express were attached to mixed trains and conveyed to Hokitika while the extension to Ross operated more like a <b>local</b> <b>line</b> with two mixed trains daily. [...] The introduction of small Leyland diesel railbuses in August 1936 to convey copies of the Christchurch Press newspaper to the West Coast led to the establishment of a direct service between Christchurch and Hokitika, as well as local services between Hokitika and Greymouth and briefly Reefton. [...] By the early 1940s, the Vulcan railcars had replaced the Leylands and they ran all the way through from Christchurch to Ross, operating twice daily, with a Greymouth-Hokitika return service at mid-day, Monday to Friday[...] In 1955, the 88 seater railcars entered service in New Zealand, and on 20 February 1956, they began operating the services from Christchurch to Ross via Greymouth, significantly reducing the use of the Vulcans. [...] They were augmented by two daily mixed trains to Ross, and these services lasted until 11 September 1967. [...] The railcars operated for a few years more, but as of 9 October 1972, they ceased to run past Greymouth, removing the final passenger service on the line.|$|E
