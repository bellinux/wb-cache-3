40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, state, and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. State and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, state and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with state and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials. Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances. Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a security clearance. These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among law enforcement stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to {{the state and local level}}, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state and <b>local</b> <b>law</b> enforcement officials.
