5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> signal and try {{to determine if they}} heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were too far to the left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} live {{in groups}} typically of 10â€“30 members, called pods, but group size varies from single {{individuals up to}} more than 1,000. Their diets consist mainly of forage fish. Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools, but they also hunt individually. Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation, which is similar to sonar. They emit clicking sounds and <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items, including potential prey. Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication, including squeaks and whistles, as well as sounds emitted through body movements, such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface.|$|E
25|$|How Tiresias {{obtained}} {{his information}} varied: sometimes, like the oracles, he would receive visions; {{other times he}} would <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> songs of birds, or ask for a description of visions and pictures appearing within the smoke of burnt offerings, and so interpret them. Pliny the Elder credits Tiresias with the invention of augury.|$|E

25|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} {{are required by}} symmetry considerations to be also piezoelectric and pyroelectric.

25|$|Journalist and {{historian}} Peter Hennessy {{has made an}} assertion, {{in one of his}} books, that a test that the commander of a British nuclear-missile submarine must use to determine whether the UK has been the target of a nuclear attack (in which case he has sealed orders which may authorise him to fire his nuclear missiles in retaliation), is to <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> presence of Today on Radio 4's frequencies. If a certain number of days (said to be three) pass without the programme being broadcast, that is to be taken as evidence that the orders must be executed. The true conditions are of course secret, and Hennessy has never revealed his sources for this story, leading Paul Donovan, author of a book about Today, to express some scepticism about it. However, the longwave signal of Radio 4 is capable of penetrating to surface depths where submarines can rise, although it does not have the range required to be heard at this depth far from the UK's coastal waters.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people who remember the seminal experience of hiding behind the sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must <b>Listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after he}} kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The {{first time he}} raped her, {{she was still in}} handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who {{sometimes}} brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost {{a month and a half}} after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the [...] "demon angels" [...] let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called [...] "runs", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> voices he said he could hear from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of God. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics, recognizing {{it as one}} of the most powerful intros to a hip-hop album in years. In her review of the album, Erika Ramirez of Billboard said of the song: [...] "Drake is aware of his greatness, and makes sure listeners are just as aware from the jump." [...] Andrew Unterberger of Popdust commended the song for being a strong opener, similar to his other album opener's; [...] "Fireworks" [...] and [...] "Over My Dead Body". Unterberger praised the use of the Whitney Houston sample, and finished his review as saying: [...] "How much time is Drake spending on the intro? As much time as he goddamn pleases, and if he wants to go an hour on the beat, weâ€™ll <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> whole thing and not check our watch once." [...] Writing for Spin, Brandon Soderberg included [...] "Tuscan Leather" [...] as one of the [...] "Rap Songs of the Week", calling it [...] "expertly conceptualized" [...] and praised it as properly introducing the album. Will Lavin of Gigwise gave the song a positive review, noting Drake's in depth discussions about his label, his friends, and his peers. Lavin went on to say: [...] "For Drake, when it comes to album openers, his track record is thought provokingly flawless." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} device {{tested by}} the group was the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD).

Combined with the use of sonobuoys to <b>listen</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sounds of a submarine, MAD provided a high probability of conducting a successful attack. [...] The group conducted its first operation using MAD on 13 July 1942 and located a submarine which had been damaged in a previous attack.|$|E
