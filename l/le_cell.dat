40|$|During implantation, uterine luminal {{epithelial}} (<b>LE)</b> <b>cells</b> first {{interact with}} the blastocyst trophectoderm. Within 30  hr after the initiation of attachment, <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> surrounding the blastocyst in the implantation chamber (crypt) disappear, allowing trophoblast cells to make direct physical contact with the underneath stroma for successful implantation. The mechanism for the extraction of <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> {{was thought to be}} mediated by apoptosis. Here, we show that <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> in direct contact with the blastocyst are endocytosed by trophoblast cells by adopting the nonapoptotic cell-in-cell invasion process (entosis) in the absence of caspase 3 activation.

50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} studies of learning and memory using nociceptors in the sea hare, Aplysia.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that 17 beta-estradiol (E 2) increases vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) gene {{expression in the}} rat uterus, resulting in increased microvascular permeability, and that this involves the simultaneous recruitment of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF 1) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR 1) to the Vegfa gene promoter. Both events require the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. However, those {{studies were carried out}} using whole uterine tissue, and while most evidence indicates that the likely site of E 2 -induced Vegfa expression is luminal epithelial (<b>LE)</b> <b>cells,</b> other studies have identified stromal cells as the site of that expression. To address this question, the pathway regulating Vegfa expression was reexamined using <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> rapidly isolated after E 2 treatment. In addition, we further characterized the nature of the receptor through which E 2 triggers the signaling events that lead to Vegfa expression using the specific ESR 1 antagonist ICI 182, 780. In agreement with previous results in the whole uterus, E 2 stimulated Vegfa mRNA expression in <b>LE</b> <b>cells,</b> peaking at 1 h (4 - to 14 -fold) and returning to basal levels by 4 h. Treatment with E 2 also increased phosphorylation of AKT in <b>LE</b> <b>cells,</b> {{as well as of the}} downstream mediators FRAP 1 (mTOR), GSK 3 B, and MDM 2. The alpha subunit of HIF 1 (HIF 1 A) was present in <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> before E 2 treatment, was unchanged 1 h after E 2, but was > 2 -fold higher by 4 h. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that HIF 1 A was recruited to the Vegfa promoter by 1 h and was absent again by 4 h. The E 2 activation of the PI 3 K/AKT pathway, HIF 1 A recruitment to the Vegfa promoter, and Vegfa expression were all blocked by ICI 182, 780. In summary, the rapid E 2 -induced signaling events that lead to the expression of Vegfa observed previously using the whole uterus occur in <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> and appear to be initiated via a membrane form of ESR 1...|$|R
2500|$|The modern period, {{beginning}} in 1920, saw major developments in {{research into the}} cause and treatment of discoid and systemic lupus.

40|$|Closure of an {{epithelium}} opening is {{a critical}} morphogenetic event for development. An excellent example for this process is the transient closure of embryonic eyelid. Eyelid closure requires shape change and migration of epithelial cells {{at the tip of}} the developing eyelids, and is dictated by numerous signaling pathways. Here we evaluated gene expression in epithelial cells isolated from the tip (leading edge, LE) and inner surface epithelium (IE) of the eyelid from E 15. 5 mouse fetuses by laser capture microdissection (LCM). We showed that the <b>LE</b> and IE <b>cells</b> are different at E 15. 5, such that IE had higher expression of muscle specific genes, while LE acquired epithelium identities. Despite their distinct destinies, these cells were overall similar in expression of signaling components for the "eyelid closure pathways". However, while the <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> had more abundant expression of Fgfr 2, Erbb 2, Shh, Ptch 1 and 2, Smo and Gli 2, and Jag 1 and Notch 1, the IE cells had more abundant expression of Bmp 5 and Bmpr 1 a. In addition, the <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> had more abundant expression of adenomatosis polyposis coli down-regulated 1 (Apcdd 1), but the IE cells had high expression of Dkk 2. Our results suggest that the functionally distinct <b>LE</b> and IE <b>cells</b> have also differential expression of signaling molecules that may contribute to the cell-specific responses to morphogenetic signals. The expression pattern suggests that the EGF, Shh and NOTCH pathways are preferentially active in <b>LE</b> <b>cells,</b> the BMP pathways are effective in IE cells, and the Wnt pathway may be repressed in <b>LE</b> and IE <b>cells</b> via different mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Dorsal closure (DC) is a {{developmental}} {{process in which}} two contralateral epithelial sheets migrate to seal a large hole in the dorsal ectoderm of the Drosophila embryo. Two signaling pathways act sequentially to orchestrate this dynamic morphogenetic process. First, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling activity in the dorsal-most leading edge (<b>LE)</b> <b>cells</b> of the epidermis induces expression of decapentaplegic (dpp). Second, Dpp, a secreted TGF-β homolog, triggers cell shape changes in the adjacent, ventrally located lateral epidermis, that guide the morphogenetic movements and cell migration mandatory for DC. Here we uncover a cell non-autonomous requirement for the Epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) pathway in the lateral epidermis for sustained dpp expression in the LE. Specifically, we demonstrate that Egfr pathway activity in the lateral epidermis prevents expression of the gene scarface (scaf), encoding a secreted antagonist of JNK signaling. In embryos with compromised Egfr signaling, upregulated Scaf causes reduction of JNK activity in <b>LE</b> <b>cells,</b> thereby impeding completion of DC.

40|$|In ruminants, {{prostaglandin}} F 2 alpha (PGF 2 ?) {{is released}} from the endometrium in a pulsatile pattern {{at the time of}} luteolysis. The luteolytic PGF 2 ? pulses are transported from the uterus to the corpus luteum (CL) through the utero-ovarian plexus (UOP) to cause luteolysis. At the time of establishment of pregnancy, interferon tau (IFNT) secreted by the conceptus suppresses the pulsatile release of PGF 2 ? and thereby rescues the CL and maintains its secretion of progesterone. However, basal concentrations of PGF 2 ? are higher in pregnant ewes than in cyclic ewes. The pulsatile release of PGF 2 ? likely requires selective carrier-mediated transport and cannot be supported by a simple diffusion mechanism. The molecular and functional aspects of carrier mediated transport of PGF 2 ? from the uterus to the ovary through the utero- ovarian plexus (UOP) at the time of luteolysis and recognition/establishment of pregnancy are largely unknown ruminants. Results indicate that intrauterine inhibition of (PGT) prevents the pulsatile release of PGF 2 ? independently of spatial expressions of estrogen receptor (ESR- 1) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) proteins by the endometrium at the time of luteolysis in sheep. PGT protein is expressed in the UOP during the estrous cycle and pharmacological inhibition of PGT prevents transport of luteolytic PGF 2 ? pulse through the UOP in sheep. IFNT activates novel JAK-SRC-EGFR-RAS-RAF-ERK 1 / 2 -EGR- 1 signaling modules in endometrial luminal epithelial (<b>LE)</b> <b>cells</b> and regulates PGT- mediated release of PGF 2 ? through these novel cell-signaling pathways. IFNT stimulates ERK 1 / 2 pathways in endometrial <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> and inhibition of ERK 1 / 2 inhibits IFNT action and restores spatial expression of OXTR and ESR- 1 proteins in endometrial <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> and restores endometrial luteolytic pulses of PGF 2 ? in sheep. Collectively, {{the results of the present}} study provide the first evidence to indicate that transport of endometrial luteolytic PGF 2 ? pulses from the uterus to the ovary through the UOP is controlled by a PGT-mediated mechanism in sheep, new mechanistic insight into molecular mechanisms regulating cellular and compartmental transport of PGF 2 ? at the time of luteolysis, and new mechanistic understanding of IFNT action and release of PGF 2 ? from the endometrial <b>LE</b> <b>cells</b> and thus opens a new arena of research in IFNT signaling and PGT function...|$|R

40|$|Dorsal closure (DC) in the Drosophila embryo {{requires}} the coordinated interaction {{of two different}} functional domains of the epidermal cell layer—the leading edge (LE) and the lateral epidermis. In response to activation of a conserved c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling module, the dorsal-most layer of cells, which constitute the LE of the stretching epithelial sheet, secrete Dpp, {{a member of the}} TGFβ superfamily. Dpp and other LE cell-derived signaling molecules stimulate the bilateral dorsal elongation of cells of the dorsolateral epidermis over the underlaying amnioserosa and the eventual fusion of their LEs along the dorsal midline. We have found that flies bearing a Shark tyrosine kinase gene mutation, shark 1, exhibit a DC-defective phenotype. Dpp fails to be expressed in shark 1 mutant <b>LE</b> <b>cells.</b> Consistent with these observations, epidermal-specific reconstitution of shark function or overexpression of an activated form of c-Jun in the shark 1 mutant background, rescues the DC defect.

Surprisingly, we found that cis-regulatory sequences that activate {{the third round of}} dpp dorsal ectoderm expression are found in the dpp disk region. We also show that the activation of this round of dpp expression is dependent upon prior Dpp signals, the signal transducer Medea, and possibly release from dTCF-mediated repression. Our results demonstrate that a second round of Dpp signaling from the dorsal ectoderm to the mesoderm is required to pattern the developing heart and that this round of dpp expression may be activated by combinatorial interactions between Dpp and Wingless...|$|R
