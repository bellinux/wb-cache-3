40|$|AbstractDistributed <b>loop</b> <b>{{networks}}</b> are networks with {{at least}} one ring structure. They are widely used in the design of local area networks, multimodule memory organizations, data alignments in parallel memory systems, and supercomputer architecture. In this paper, we give a systematic and unified method of solutions in the design and implementation of these networks. We show that doubly linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks</b> with transmission delay {{less than or equal to}} (1 +ε) √ 3 N can be constructed asymptotically for sufficiently large N, the number of nodes in the network. This is close to the optimal value within a number which is small as compared to N. We then give several infinite classes of values of N for which optimal doubly linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks</b> can be actually designed. The method is then generalized to obtain a new upper bound for possible transmission delays in multiply linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks.</b> Routing and rerouting algorithms are designed for the optimal <b>loop</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R

In this article, Gibbs’ stochastic network model is utilized in order to achieve a dendritic network that corresponds to a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> in terms of the peak of the runoff hydrograph at the outlet. A synthetic catchment with a drainage network composed of 8 × 8 grids is introduced to investigate the behavior of a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> for a given rainfall event using the Storm Water Management Model. Dendritic networks are generated from the Gibbsian model for a given value of the parameter, β. The results showed that the shape of the hydrograph and the peak flow of a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> are heavily dependent on the catchment slope. Moreover, the results showed {{that it is possible to}} find the corresponding dendritic networks generated by the Gibbsian model that match the fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> depending on the catchment slope in terms of peak flows.

We also find a d + 2 lower bound for the optimal triple loop graphs, these are the graphs with maximum number of nodes given a diameter d.

Accordingly, in 1983 URE applied to the Home Office to move to the pretty much clear and unoccupied channel of 319 meters (963 kHz). The unauthorised broadcaster Radio Caroline had the same idea and also promptly did so too. Because it was anchored just off the coast of Frinton-on-Sea (just a few miles from URE) it pretty much decimated any reception for the station. URE moved back to 999 kHz, and took 1602 kHz transmission off air at the same time.|$|E

40|$|Studying {{optimization}} {{and decision}} for opening electromagnetic <b>loop</b> <b>networks</b> {{plays an important}} role in planning and operation of power grids.

40|$|AbstractCongestion and {{emissions}} are two problems in traffic. In general, they have conflict with each other. Tradable credits scheme is proved an effective method in Environmental Science. Now {{more and more}} scholars introduce it into traffic. Because it possesses the advantages that other methods do not have in alleviating congestion and reducing emissions. In this paper we indicate there always exists a tradable credits scheme that induces a traffic flow distribution with minimum emissions. We proved a given target feasible link flow pattern can be decentralized into user equilibrium by a tradable credits scheme, and sought tradable credits schemes for Pareto-efficient control and management of both traffic congestion {{and emissions}} on road networks. There are two models which could describe the Pareto-efficient problem between alleviating congestion and reducing emissions, i. e., bi-level congestion pricing model and weighting problem model. When the emission function is an increasing function, any Pareto-efficient flow pattern can be supported as an user equilibrium by the tradable credit scheme. If the emission function is a non-monotonic function, we divided the network into two cases: loops-free <b>network</b> and <b>loops</b> <b>network</b> which satisfies Gallager's sense. In a loop-free road network, any feasible link flow pattern can be decentralized into user equilibrium by a tradable scheme.
