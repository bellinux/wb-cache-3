5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{school in the}} market square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E

5|$|As the war {{drew to a}} close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having {{believed}} {{the federal government had}} limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Brunner {{was born}} in April 1821 in Oxford. When he was fifteen, he began to learn {{architecture}} and surveying. In 1841, he joined the New Zealand Company in its venture to establish a settlement {{in the north of}} the South Island of New Zealand, to be called Nelson. As well as working as an apprentice surveyor and laying sections and roads for the new settlement, he explored the interior, seeking pastoral <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> growing colony. In 1846 he undertook extensive journeys with Charles Heaphy and a Māori named Kehu towards and along the West Coast.|$|E

She was too overcome to speak and John Makini Kapena, one of her brother's minister, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, {{in the name of}} her brother, Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects. She also convinced the governmental board of health to set aside <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> leprosy hospital at Kakaʻako. She made a second visit to the settlement with Queen Kapiolani in 1884.|$|E

5|$|On 15 September 1891, {{a general}} meeting {{took place at}} Royal Street Hall, near Everton Valley.

5|$|On arrival {{the ship}} was {{unloaded}} and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal—in either case, there was now no means of escape. The island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers—uninhabited, virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water and fertile <b>land.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> while, mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Isabella; a son, Thursday October Christian, was born, as were other children. Christian's authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.|$|E
5|$|Smythe {{continued}} to own horses through the 1930s, but he sold them in 1940, {{when he made}} plans {{to fight in the}} Second World War. He did not re-enter the racing business until 1954. In 1951, Smythe bought <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> farm in Caledon, Ontario, originally looking for a new location for a gravel pit. At first he kept only cattle, but in 1954 he decided to get back into owning race horses, in partnership with Larkin Maloney, and an area was set aside to keep horses. Smythe learned about the business and went into breeding, buying mares in foal from top thoroughbred lines, and hiring future Hall of Fame trainer Yonnie Starr.|$|E
5|$|The DAP also {{focused on}} landholding issues. Chong Chieng Jen, the {{director}} of the DAP's by-election campaign, pointed out that those who decided not to renew their 60-year land leases would have their land returned to the government without compensation, and that even if the government approved requests to have leases renewed, landholders would have to pay large premiums. Chong said that the DAP on the other hand wanted the current state land code to be amended to allow for the automatic and unconditional renewal of all leased <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of 99 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{governors}} remained {{without an}} official residence until 1919 {{when the state}} purchased a home located at 101 East 27th St., Indianapolis, for $65,000 and furnished it for an additional $20,000. It was built by Henry Kahn in 1908 and had the design of an English country house. The home had a Gothic interior with high, beamed ceilings and luxurious Wilton carpeting. After a brief renovation, the home was inhabited by the governor starting in 1919 and remained so until 1945. The building was sold {{by the state to}} the Marott Hotel, which intended {{to turn it into a}} clubhouse, but eventually demolished it in 1962 to clear <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> parking lot.|$|E

It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.|$|E

5|$|Tyldesley's wealth as an {{industrial}} town resulted in outlets for the entertainment of its population, including cinemas and public houses. Films were shown in Tyldesley Miners' Hall from 1908. Three cinemas {{were built in}} the town, the Theatre Royal in John Street opened in 1909, the Carlton on Johnson Street in 1911, and the Majestic in Castle Street in 1923. In 1902 the council acquired <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> public park on Astley Street. A public library was built in 1908 with the aid of an Andrew Carnegie grant, {{on the site of the}} old Temperance Hall and Mechanics Institute on Stanley Street built in 1851.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, WMATA {{had decided}} on the current routing and stations, except for the {{extension}} beyond Rockville to Shady Grove. Montgomery County officials opposed ending the Red Line in downtown Rockville, saying it would cause congestion {{in the area and}} use scarce vacant <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> storage yard. Metro decided to propose to extend the red line one more station to Shady Grove and the U.S. Department of Transportation conditionally approved funding for the extension on July 26, 1975. Construction on the Red Line began with a groundbreaking ceremony on December 9, 1969. Construction proved difficult because the National Park Service prohibited a bridge across Rock Creek and required that the Red Line tunnel under that valley, the tunnel in turn caused both the Dupont Circle and Woodley Park stations to be built further underground. The Red Line was proposed to tunnel under Yuma Street from Connecticut Avenue to Wisconsin Avenue, but local residents sued and that court case delayed construction of the tunnel for two years, then WMATA finally won the right to build the tunnel there.|$|E
5|$|Davis, an {{advocate}} of a southern transcontinental route, persuaded Pierce to send rail magnate James Gadsden to Mexico to buy <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> potential railroad. Gadsden was also charged with re-negotiating {{the provisions of the}} Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo which required the U.S. to prevent Native American raids into Mexico from New Mexico Territory. Gadsden negotiated a treaty with Mexican President Antonio López de Santa Anna in December 1853, purchasing a large swath of land to America's southwest. Negotiations were nearly derailed by William Walker's unauthorized expedition into Mexico, and so a clause was included charging the U.S. with combating future such attempts. Congress reduced the Gadsden Purchase to the region now comprising southern Arizona and part of southern New Mexico; the price was cut from $15million to $10million. Congress also included a protection clause for a private citizen, Albert G. Sloo, whose interests were threatened by the purchase. Pierce opposed the use of the federal government to prop up private industry and did not endorse {{the final version of the}} treaty, which was ratified nonetheless. The acquisition brought the contiguous United States to its present-day boundaries, excepting later minor adjustments.|$|E
