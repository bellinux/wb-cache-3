5|$|Some {{of the key}} {{principles}} {{associated with}} the thin conception {{of the rule of}} law include judicial independence, natural justice, the availability of judicial review, and the accessibility of justice. Judicial independence in Singapore is safeguarded by various constitutional provisions and <b>legal</b> <b>rules,</b> though some commentators have highlighted certain events as suggesting a lack of judicial independence. One incident in the 1980s involving the transfer of the Senior District Judge to the Attorney-General's Chambers following a decision he made which was favourable to an opposition politician was investigated by a commission of inquiry and found not to be due to executive interference. In Singapore, natural justice is generally regarded as a procedural rather than a substantive concept. The process of judicial review involves the review of executive actions for compliance with administrative law rules, and of executive and legislative acts for unconstitutionality in light of the doctrine of constitutional supremacy. The state of the courts and legal processes in Singapore are largely seen as making justice accessible for the citizenry.|$|E

However, this [...] "source test" [...] ignores many situations where decisions are not dependent on <b>legal</b> <b>rules</b> laid down by the State.

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} principles of South African law is expressed by the maxim ubi ius ubi remedium: Where there is a right, there is a remedy. This means that the existence of a <b>legal</b> <b>rule</b> implies the existence of an authority with the power to grant a remedy if that rule is infringed. A <b>legal</b> <b>rule</b> will be deficient if there is no means of enforcing it, and if no sanction attaches to a breach of that rule.

According to Hart, any rule that complies with the rule of recognition is a valid <b>legal</b> <b>rule.</b> For example, if the rule of recognition were [...] "what Professor X says is law", then any rule that Professor X spoke would be a valid <b>legal</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|R

500|$|The Court of Appeal {{clarified}} in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), that customary {{international law}} cannot be read into the Constitution for two reasons. First, {{in order for a}} {{customary international law}} rule to have legal effect in Singapore, it has to be incorporated into domestic law. The incorporation can occur either by enactment in a statute or by a court declaration that the rule forms part of the common law. The Court felt it would be incorrect to incorporate customary international law rules into the meaning of law in Article 9(1) as this would cloak the common law with the constitutional status to nullify a statute, thus reversing the usual hierarchy of <b>legal</b> <b>rules.</b> Secondly, the term law is defined in Article 2(1) to include the common law only [...] "in so far as it is in operation in Singapore". However, a court cannot treat rules of customary international law as having been incorporated into Singapore common law if they are inconsistent with existing statutes. Furthermore, if there is a conflict between such a rule and a domestic statute, the latter prevails.|$|E
500|$|Other decided cases {{also do not}} {{indicate}} whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation will be developed {{in the way it}} has been developed in the UK. In Siah Mooi Guat, another argument the applicant raised was that she had a legitimate expectation to continue to reside in Singapore until the expiry of her re-entry permit. Sinnathuray J. distinguished Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983), a Privy Council case on appeal from Hong Kong, from the case at hand. In the Privy Council case there had been an express promise made to Ng by the Government of Hong Kong which had created a substantive legitimate expectation. In the present case, no promise had been made to be applicant that her stay in Singapore was to be conditioned by any considerations other than those provided in the Immigration Act and related regulations. No substantive legitimate expectation arose in the applicant's favour, following the dictum of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in the GCHQ case that legitimate expectation arises [...] "either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue". Thus, the judge did not discuss the detailed <b>legal</b> <b>rules</b> to be applied to determine when an aggrieved person may be said to have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right.|$|E
500|$|Coke's {{jurisprudence}} centres on {{the hierarchy}} of the judges, the monarch, and Parliament in making law. Coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law, followed by Parliament, and that the monarch was bound to follow any <b>legal</b> <b>rules.</b> This principle was justified by the idea that a judge, through his professional training, internalised what political historian and theorist Alan Cromartie referred to as [...] "an infinity of wisdom", something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to the complexity of the law. Coke's Commentary on Littleton has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse, with his aim being to write what Cromartie called [...] "a sort of anti-textbook, a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised. The original edition could not be used for reference purposes, as Coke had published it without an index... It is a book to be 'read in' and lived with, rather than consulted, a monument to the uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind". This theory – that judges were the natural arbiters of the law – is known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable.|$|E
