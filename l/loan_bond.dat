The legal term [...] "debenture" [...] originally referred to a document that either creates a debt or acknowledges it, but in some countries the term is now used interchangeably with bond, loan stock or note. A debenture is thus like a certificate of loan or a <b>loan</b> <b>bond</b> evidencing {{the fact that the}} company is liable to pay a specified amount with interest and although the money raised by the debentures becomes a part of the company's capital structure, it does not become share capital.

A credit default swap represents the price at which two parties exchange this riskthe protection seller takes the risk of default of the credit in return for a payment, commonly denoted in basis points (one basis point is 1/100 of a percent) of the notional amount to be referenced, while the protection buyer pays this premium and in the case of default of the underlying (a <b>loan,</b> <b>bond</b> or other receivable), delivers this receivable to the protection seller and receives from the seller the par amount (that is, is made whole).|$|E

In particular, we have analyzed balance sheet and macroeconomic data from various sources 18, relative to the nineteen European Union’s Member States belonging to the EMU. Our analysis is based on two categories of variables: i) network variables, i.e., the financial exposures via <b>loan,</b> <b>bond,</b> and equity contracts, through which the euro area sectors are tied to each other; and ii) macroeconomic variables, i.e., i) private and public consumption, ii) private and public investment, iii) Gross Domestic Product (GDP), iv) Harmonised Unemployment Rate (HUR), and v) Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The combination of the network variables and macroeconomic variables allows us to shed light on the implications of QE both in terms of stimulation of the real economy and financial stability.

The data were collected from 1999 and 2000 Audited Financial Statement and 2001 (1 st half) Unaudited Financial Statement. Based on accounting approach, financial performance of PT DSFI Tbk was still below its competitor, PT Bahtera Adimina Samudra Tbk (PT BAS Tbk).

According to the analysis, this study recommended PT DSFI Tbk to improve its performance by: 1. Focus to its main business as an integrated fish processing company. 2.

40|$|We {{identify}} {{global and}} regional fluctuations in international private debt flows to emerging {{and developing countries}} using data on cross border loans and international bond issuance over 1993 - 2009. We estimate the effects of individual borrower characteristics as well as macroeconomic conditions {{on the cost of}} foreign borrowing and test whether these effects differ across phases of the lending cycle. We find that public and financial institutions benefit from lower spreads compared to private and nonfinancial firms and that lenders may differentiate the risk associated with the borrower’s industrial sector between good and bad times. The <b>loan</b> (<b>bond)</b> rating has an equally robust spread reduction effect across credit cycle phases. The results also suggest that international reserve holdings and investment ratios {{have a significant effect on}} reducing credit spreads for loans, while higher reserve holdings and longer maturities matter more for bond spreads.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the case for}} mortgage covered bonds {{as an alternative to}} the originate-to-distribute mortgage funding model. It argues that the economic incentives provided to market participants under the covered bonds model are less susceptible to moral hazard even while retaining the key benefits of securitization such as capital market funding and flexibility in risk allocation. Notwithstanding these advantages, however, limited market size and the greater pro-cyclicality of mortgage loan quality in the United States - potentially reflecting borrower incentives under the personal bankruptcy framework - impose limits on the benefits ensuing from this model. The analysis underscores the need for a comprehensive legal-regulatory framework to underpin market development and discusses a number of ways in which the current draft legislation may be further strengthened. A potential strategy to hasten market development within the current institutional framework is identified.
