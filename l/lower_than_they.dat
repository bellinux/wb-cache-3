25|$|In any event, this {{migration}} {{was achieved}} during the closing {{stages of the}} Pleistocene epoch, when sea levels were typically much <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> are today. Repeated episodes of extended glaciation resulted in decreases of sea levels by some 100–150 m. The continental coastline therefore extended much further out into the Timor Sea than it does today, and Australia and New Guinea formed a single landmass (known as Sahul), connected by an extensive land bridge across the Arafura Sea, Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres Strait.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of {{navigation}} and the decay of the lock structures, water levels are considerably <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> once were. The whole of the canal, together with parts of the old channel of the River Lud, the Black Dike, the Poulton Drain and the Waithe Dike, which feeds into the Mother Drain before it joins the canal, are designated as main rivers, and are {{the responsibility of the}} Environment Agency. The land drainage functions for the low-lying land surrounding the lower reaches of the canal are the responsibility of the Lindsey Marsh Internal Drainage Board (IDB). This was formed in November 2000, when the Louth IDB, the Alford IDB, and the Skegness District IDB amalgamated. The Lindsey Marsh IDB maintains five pumping stations which pump into the canal, and because of the lower water levels, a number of drains which discharge into the canal by gravity.|$|E
25|$|The {{source of}} the Poulter is {{in a region where}} the {{underlying}} geology is an extensive water-bearing porous rock structure called the Magnesian Limestone aquifer. Magnesian limestone is named because if contains quantities of the mineral Dolomite, which is rich in Magnesium. Where this rock reaches the surface, springs often occur, and the Poulter starts at such a spring. Further to the east, the Magnesian Limestone is covered by a layer of porous rock called the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone aquifer, which is the major geological component of the area. Continuing eastwards, both are covered by a layer of Mercia mudstone. The groundwater levels in these aquifers affect whether they supply water to the river system, or take water from it, and levels are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> have historically been, {{as a result of the}} extraction of groundwater, particularly for public water supply, and by fracturing of the aquifers as a result of subsidence caused by deep coal mining.|$|E

25|$|Users of {{the canal}} felt that the tolls, which had not altered since 1770, were too high, as the volume of traffic using the {{navigation}} had increased. In order to rectify the situation, a new Act of Parliament was obtained in 1828, which reduced the tolls and formalised the 99-year lease of 1777. In 1847, the East Lincolnshire Railway Company obtained an Act which allowed them to purchase the lease of the Louth Navigation, and later the same year, the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR) obtained another Act allowing them to purchase or lease the East Lincolnshire Railway and Canal. They held it for the remaining 29 years, as a tactical move to prevent opposition from the existing leaseholders. When the lease came to an end, the General Manager of the GNR {{reported that they had}} kept the tolls as high as was legally possible, but suggested that they refrain from renewing the lease. The commissioners were unable to find anyone wanting to bid for the tolls, and collected them themselves until a bidder was found three months later. Although the tolls were <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> had been under railway ownership, income was satisfactory into the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would have been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the US oil {{marketing}} hub at Cushing {{was flooded}} with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to {{take it from there}} to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast.|$|E

500|$|Circumstantial factors {{helped to}} offset the smog's {{potential}} strength and health damage. The event began over the long Thanksgiving weekend, not the workweek, meaning that many factories were closed and far fewer people were in traffic than normally would be. The warm weather meant the demand for central heating was also lower than usual. On November 25, the high of 64°F (18°C) broke the previous record high for that date, leading the reporter Homer Bigart to describe the apartment-heating restrictions as [...] "no problem."

But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> already were. In July 1646, a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince Lu's Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian. Zhu Yujian was caught and summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October. His adoptive son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet. Finally in November, the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing.|$|E
500|$|Restored to health, Waugh {{returned}} to work and finished Officers and Gentlemen. In June 1955 the Daily Express journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview.

Late in 1956, {{the family moved to}} the manor house in the Somerset village of Combe Florey. In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain–Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the Express and Spain.

500|$|The kickoff for the Rose Bowl was {{originally}} scheduled for [...] on January 1, 1924, {{but the night}} before the game, a meeting of the Rose Bowl organization rescheduled the kickoff time to [...] the same day.

Navy admiral Samuel Shelburne Robison received an admiral's salute from Navy's band when he took his seat. The Navy band and the color guard of the marines performed the National Anthem, then the marine color guard hoisted the U.S. flag over the field. Both teams' mascots were walked around the field before the kickoff.

500|$|The {{results of}} the test shows, which were never {{intended}} for broadcast and shown to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969, were [...] "generally very positive". The researchers found that children learned from the shows, that the show's appeal was high, and that children's attention was sustained over the full hour. However, they found that, although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered when there were only humans on screen. The producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused, and had recommended that human actors and Muppets not be shown together. As {{a result of this}} decision, the appeal of the test episodes was <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would have liked, so the show's producers knew they needed to make significant changes, including defying the recommendations of their advisers and show the human and Muppet characters together.

500|$|Then, as OPEC members grew {{weary of}} a multi-year supply contest with {{diminishing}} returns and shrinking financial reserves, the organization finally attempted its first production cut since 2008. Despite many political obstacles, a September 2016 decision to trim approximately 1 {{million barrels per}} day was codified by a new quota agreement at the November 2016 OPEC conference. The agreement (which exempted disruption-ridden members Libya and Nigeria) covered the first half of 2017 – alongside promised reductions from Russia and ten other non-members, offset by expected increases in the US shale sector, Libya, Nigeria, spare capacity, and surging late-2016 OPEC production before the cuts took effect. Indonesia announced another [...] "temporary suspension" [...] of its OPEC membership, rather than accepting the organization's requested 5 percent production cut. Prices fluctuated around US$50/bbl, and OPEC in May 2017 decided to extend the new quotas through March 2018, with the world waiting to see if and how the oil inventory glut might be fully siphoned-off by then. Longtime oil analyst Daniel Yergin [...] "described the relationship between OPEC and shale as 'mutual coexistence', with both sides learning to live with prices that are <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>they</b> would like." ...|$|E
500|$|During Sesame Streets {{development}} in 1968, the producers followed {{the recommendation of}} child psychologists, who advised them to not allow the direct interaction of the human actors and Muppets because the experts were concerned it would confuse and mislead young children.
