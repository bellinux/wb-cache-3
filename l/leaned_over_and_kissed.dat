6000|$|He <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{her behind}} the drawn curtains. [...] "I will, Alice! I will indeed! I won't keep {{anything}} from you after this." ...|$|E
60|$|His hand rested for {{a moment}} upon her shoulder. He drew her a little towards him. She {{suddenly}} laughed, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him on both cheeks, and jumped up. The trim little parlourmaid was {{at the door with}} tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{want to come}} in for {{a little}} while, an' are willin' to pay you for it," [...] Joe repeated, and the old lady shook her head doubtfully as she <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> the princess {{squarely}} on the mouth.|$|E
60|$|As {{she made}} her promise she turned her sweet face up to his, <b>and</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} bright with triumph. She <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{him on the}} lips. Then she sprang lightly to her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good night,' <b>and</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> her <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her forehead, in a grave {{grateful}} {{way that}} brought the tears into her eyes as he silently departed.|$|R
60|$|The {{streets of}} New York {{were covered with}} a thin, powdery snow as the very luxurious car of Mrs. Delarey drew up outside {{the front of the}} Leeland Hotel, a little after midnight. Ella <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her hostess.|$|E
60|$|She <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him. The {{sun came}} bright-footed over the water, leaving a shining print on Siegmund's face. He lay, with half-closed eyes, sprawled loosely on the sand. Looking at his limbs, she {{imagined}} {{he must be}} heavy, like the bounders. She sat over him, with her fingers stroking his eyebrows, that were broad and rather arched. He lay perfectly still, in a half-dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} do {{anything}} you don't like," [...] he answered, and he <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, and at this her passion burst in a violent sobbing, and when she could speak she made him solemnly promise {{that he would not}} regard her in the least, but would do whatever was wisest and best with the play, for otherwise she should never be happy again.|$|E
500|$|One of Sunny's most {{high-profile}} storylines was a <b>kiss</b> between herself <b>and</b> female character, Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie). The kiss occurs after Donna {{discovers that}} Sunny {{has been writing}} the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is then shocked when Donna <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kisses</b> her on the lips and steals her first kiss. Lee said [...] "For days, all Sunny's been able to think about is {{what it would be}} like to kiss Zeke. Now Donna's gone and stolen the moment – and Sunny's not happy, to say the least..." ...|$|R
60|$|Stephanie rose {{slowly to}} her feet, <b>leaned</b> {{gracefully}} <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her hostess on both cheeks, and submitted {{her hand to}} the Prince, who raised it to his lips. Then she turned to Dominey.|$|R
5000|$|Paige Collins (Rachel McAdams) and {{her husband}} Leo (Channing Tatum) {{come out of a}} movie theater. On their way home, at a stop sign, Paige unbuckles her {{seatbelt}} to <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kiss</b> Leo. At that very moment, a truck rams their car from behind and Paige crashes through the windshield. Both of them are rushed to the emergency room, and as Leo, in a voice-over talks about how [...] "moments of impact help in finding who we are" [...] the movie cuts to how Paige and Leo first met. The scenes of how they courted, proposed and married at the Art Institute of Chicago <b>and</b> share a <b>kiss</b> under the Cloud Gate are interwoven with the present.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{thought you}} prayed for me--and I could {{see you and}} hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so sorry that I took and wrote {{on a piece of}} {{sycamore}} bark, 'We ain't dead--we are only off being pirates,' {{and put it on the}} table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying there asleep, that I thought I went and <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> you on the lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Makely bustled up to {{the bedside}} with her energetic, patronizing cheerfulness. [...] "Ah, Mrs. Camp, I am {{glad to see you}} looking so well this morning. I've been meaning to run over for several days past, but I couldn't find a moment till this morning, and I knew you didn't object to Sunday visits." [...] She took the invalid's hand in hers, and, with the air of showing how little she felt any {{inequality}} between them, she <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, where Mrs. Camp sat propped against her pillows. She had a large, nobly moulded face of rather masculine contour, {{and at the same time}} the most motherly look in the world. Mrs. Makely bubbled and babbled on, and every one waited patiently till she had done, and turned and said, toward the Altrurian: [...] "I have ventured to bring my friend, Mr. Homos, with me. He is from Altruria." [...] Then she turned to me and said: [...] "Mr. Twelvemough you know already through his delightful books"; but, although she paid me this perfunctory compliment it was perfectly apparent to me that in the esteem of this disingenuous woman the distinguished stranger was a far more important person than the distinguished author. Whether Mrs. Camp read my perception of this fact in my face or not I cannot say, but she was evidently determined that I should not feel a difference in her. She held out her hand to me first, and said that I never could know how many heavy hours I had helped to lighten for her, and then she turned to the Altrurian and took his hand. [...] "Oh!" [...] she said, with a long, deep-drawn sigh, as if that were the supreme moment of her life. [...] "And are you really from Altruria? It seems too good to be true!" [...] Her devout look and her earnest tone gave the commonplace words a quality that did not inhere in them, but Mrs. Makely took them on their surface.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old wooden}} {{clock in the}} kitchen began to strike, and she rose briskly {{to her feet and}} went and laid the books she had been holding in her lap on the table beside Mrs. Camp's bed. [...] "We must really be going," [...] she said, as she <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> the invalid. [...] "It is your dinner-time, and we shall barely get back for lunch if we go by the Loop road; and I want very much to have Mr. Homos see the Witch's Falls on the way. I have got two or three of the books here that Mr. Makely brought me last night--I sha'n't have time to read them at once--and I'm {{smuggling}} in one of Mr. Twelvemough's, that he's too modest to present for himself." [...] She turned a gay glance upon me, and Mrs. Camp thanked me, and a number of civilities followed from all sides. In the process of their exchange, Mrs. Makely's spirits perceptibly rose, and she came away in high good-humor with the whole Camp family. [...] "Well, now, I am sure," [...] she said to the Altrurian, as we began the long ascent of the Loop road, [...] "you must allow that you have seen some very original characters. But how warped people get living alone so much! That is the great drawback of the country. Mrs. Camp thinks the savings-bank did her a real injury in taking a mortgage on her place, and Reuben seems to have seen just enough of the outside world to get it all wrong. But they are the best-hearted creatures in the world, and I know you won't misunderstand them. That unsparing country bluntness--don't you think it's perfectly delightful? I do like to stir poor Reuben up, and get him talking. He is a good boy, if he is so wrong-headed, and he's the most devoted son and brother in the world. Very few young fellows would waste their lives on an old farm like that; I suppose, when his mother dies, he will marry and strike out for himself in some growing place." ...|$|E

[...] "Knowest thou also, Swanhild, {{that when}} last night my life came back again in Atli's hall, methought that Atli's wife <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> me <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> {{me on the}} lips? That was an ill dream, Swanhild." ...|$|R
60|$|Barry <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> the bed, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her, <b>and</b> then crept {{out of the}} room, {{and down}} the stairs, with the tears {{streaming}} down his red cheeks; and skulked {{across the street to}} his own house, with his hat slouched <b>over</b> his face, <b>and</b> his handkerchief held across his mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] said Otto, [...] "I see her {{sometimes}} in my dreams, {{and her face}} always shines so bright that I know she is an angel; for brother John has often seen the dear angels, and {{he tells me that}} their faces always shine in that way. I saw her the night thy father hurt me so, for I could not sleep and my head felt as though it would break asunder. Then she came <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> me <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> my forehead, <b>and</b> after that I fell asleep." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As {{the great}} day drew nearer, {{there was more}} singing in the slave {{quarters}} than usual. It was bolder, had more ring, and lasted later into the night. Most of the verses of the plantation songs had some reference to freedom... Some man {{who seemed to be}} a stranger (a United States officer, I presume) made a little speech and then read a rather long paper—the Emancipation Proclamation, I think. After the reading we were told that we were all free, and could go when and where we pleased. My mother, who was standing by my side, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her children, while tears of joy ran down her cheeks.

5000|$|Booker T. Washington, {{as a boy}} of 9 in Virginia, {{remembered the}} day in early 1865: As the great day drew nearer, there was more singing in the slave {{quarters}} than usual.

60|$|Arthur, after {{gazing at}} her for a moment with a beating-heart, for the mysterious actions of the old farmer had made him fear the worst, softly {{approached}} the couch and knelt beside the girl he loved, thanking; God in his inmost heart for her escape.

500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal to lots of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a <b>kiss</b> between herself <b>and</b> fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>kisses</b> her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the <b>kiss</b> between Sunny <b>and</b> Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|R
60|$|She raised herself, <b>leaned</b> <b>over</b> him tenderly, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> him. She was sad to wake him. After a few moments, {{she kissed}} him again. But he did not stir. The darling, he was so deep in sleep! What a shame {{to take him out}} of it. She let him lie a little longer. But he must go--he must really go.|$|R
5000|$|That night, {{alone with}} Miles, Miss Giddens presses {{him to talk}} about the ghosts, and then about why he was {{expelled}} from school. Initially, and as usual, Miles is glib and evasive, but he eventually admits that he frightened the other boys with violence and vulgar language. Miss Giddens enjoins him to say who taught him this language and behaviour. Miles suddenly begins yelling obscene insults and laughing maniacally, and Peter Quint's face appears in the window behind him, joining in the boy's laughter. Miles then runs outside; Miss Giddens follows, calling that {{all he has to do}} is [...] "say his name" [...] and it will all be over. Quint appears on the hedge nearby, but Miles does not seem to see him and screams that she is insane. He finally shouts Quint's name, then the hand of Quint appears. Miles grows still and falls to the ground. Miss Giddens cradles him and assures him that he is free. She then realises that Miles is dead. Sobbing in horror, she <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> him <b>and</b> <b>kisses</b> him on the lips.|$|R
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, <b>lean</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> deeply <b>kiss</b> the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that it (thinks it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zoe and Madison {{break into}} the county morgue. Madison {{says she wants to}} repay Zoe by {{bringing}} Kyle back to life, she stole a spell. Madison opens his body bag and finds he's in pieces. Madison suggests they take the best [...] "boy parts", and attach them to Kyle's head to make the perfect boyfriend. Madison and Zoe stitch together Kyle using new parts. Madison begins the spell and they both breathe in the smoke from her potion. She cuts Zoe's hand to complete the spell from Azazel, Lord of the Underworld. They chant over Kyle's stitched together body. Madison finishes her chanting with [...] "arise!" [...] Nothing happens, so Madison leaves. Zoe stays behind, saying she has to find her phone. When Madison sees a car pull up, she bails on Zoe. Zoe apologizes to Kyle for letting him get in the accident. She <b>leans</b> <b>over</b> Kyle's body <b>and</b> <b>kisses</b> him. A coroner (Ben Matheny) comes into the morgue and finds Zoe, out of nowhere Kyle wakes up. He starts beating the man, until Zoe shouts at him to stop. Zoe drives Kyle home. He's not right, doesn't understand what's going on and cannot speak. Suddenly, Misty pops up from the backseat. Zoe drew her out with her magic. She directs them to her home on the swamp. There, she spackles Kyle together with swamp mud and alligator dung. She explains how Zoe's magic called to her as she listens to [...] "Rhiannon". She explains that she believes Stevie Nicks to be a white witch. Misty offers to heal Kyle and says he'll be right when Zoe comes back.|$|R
60|$|The mate sprang at her, but she dodged {{round the}} table. He <b>leaned</b> <b>over,</b> <b>and,</b> {{catching}} {{her by the}} left arm, drew her towards him; then, with her flushed, laughing face close to his, he forgot everything else, <b>and</b> <b>kissed</b> her.|$|R
