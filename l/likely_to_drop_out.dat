40|$|The {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> is {{a dangerous}} one for the student. The purpose of this quantitative {{study was to examine}} the relationship between student mathematics achievement as measured by the New York State Education Department (NYSED) Grade 4 Mathematics Test (G 4 MT), Grade 8 Mathematics Test (G 8 MT), and Integrated Algebra Mathematics Test (IAMT) and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of high school in a medium-size school district in the Lower Hudson Region of New York. Furthermore, the study examined to what extent the New York State mathematics tests served as predictors of students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of high school. The 680 research participants were students who first entered Grade 9 in the 2006 - 2007 school year. There was no statistically significant relationship between students’ mathematics achievement and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of high school. However, there was a statistically significant relationship between student taking the NYSED G 4 MT, G 8 MT, and IAMT and <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of high school. Taking the NYSED G 8 MT and IAMT contributed significantly to the prediction of students <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of high school.

25|$|Other {{factors that}} explain the {{relative}} underrepresentation of Bedouin {{women in the}} labor force were discrimination in the labor market, inferior quality of education in Bedouin towns, and a lack of suitable jobs nearby. While all of these factors could also apply to explaining the lack of Bedouin men {{in the labor force}}, they are especially acute for women. Discrimination in the labor market affects Bedouin men as well as women. However, Bedouin women must also contend with the cultural expectation that women should not work outside of the home. While a lack of education is problematic for employment in general (male as well as female), education is a bigger obstacle to entry into the labor market for women than it is for men. Bedouin girls are much more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school than their male peers, and women are less likely to seek higher education. Finally, Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. Therefore, travelling long distances to work is not an option.This effectively limits women's employment possibilities to those in the immediate geographic vicinity. When women are employed, they generally earn much less than men.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interest}} of the family, rural females are sent to find urban employment over male counterparts, mainly to supplement familial income at home and to support the males, who are more likely to attend college. The male standard of education in China is higher, particularly when a family is under financial stress, females are more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school to generate income for the family. Because females have lesser impact on the family's long-term financial stability, their rights for opportunities development are consequently unequal. This inequality also reinforces emotional motivations for migration. Many women migrate to find personal fulfillment. Stereotypes in China that developed as a result of globalization portray rural women as [...] "‘backward’" [...] and urban women as [...] "‘modern’". Many people associate modernity with maturity, so rural women migrate to cities to be perceived as mature. Migrant women also appreciate the knowledge they obtain (including political- and self-awareness) while living in cities. Some women even report desiring to leave villages as a result of boredom with rural life. Ideas perpetuated due to globalization simultaneously increased women's intentions to become independent; many migrant workers desire lives separate from those of their families’.|$|E

There is no consensus about what “intense” aphasia therapy entails, or how intense therapy should be to yield the best outcomes. Overall, treatment is considered more intense when total therapy hours per week are increased, and on average, research suggests more intense therapy leads to better outcomes. [...] For example, one study found that patients who were treated for 8.8 hours a week for 11.2 weeks progressed more than patients who were treated 2 hours a week for 22.9 weeks. Results of another study corroborate these findings. The researchers found that patients who received intensive therapy of 100 treatment hours over 62 weeks scored higher on language measures than the control group who received less intensive therapy. However, a Cochrane review of speech and language therapy for people with aphasia revealed a more nuanced finding.

2500|$|Research {{has found}} {{that there is a}} high risk of {{educational}} underachievement for children who are from low-income housing circumstances. This is often a process that begins in primary school for some less fortunate children. Instruction in the US educational system, as well as in most other countries, tends to be geared towards those students who come from more advantaged backgrounds. As a result, children in poverty are at a higher risk than advantaged children for retention in their grade, special deleterious placements during the school's hours and even not completing their high school education. Advantage breeds advantage. There are indeed many explanations for why students tend to drop out of school. One is the conditions of which they attend school. Schools in poverty-stricken areas have conditions that hinder children from learning in a safe environment. Researchers have developed a name for areas like this: an urban war zone is a poor, crime-laden district in which deteriorated, violent, even war-like conditions and underfunded, largely ineffective schools promote inferior academic performance, including irregular attendance and disruptive or non-compliant classroom behavior.

While the existing literature has, qualitatively, iden-tified important mechanisms leading to early high school exit in Nunavut communities, our data allows us to quantify the relative importance of the various factors influencing high school dropout rates for youth living in Nunavut. The variable most associated with youth in school thinking about <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> of school is alcohol consumption- a student who drinks is 25 % more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> think of <b>dropping</b> <b>out</b> relative <b>to</b> a student who does not drink.

This study aims to assess and compare the medication persistence between unipolar depression (UD) and bipolar depression (BD). Methods: A total of 146 UD and 187 BD patients were recruited at their first index prescription. Time to lack of persistence with pharmacological treatment (defined as a gap of at least 60  days without taking any medication) was calculated, and clinical characteristics were collected. Final diagnosis was made {{at the end of}} 1 -year follow-up. Results: A total of 101 (69. 2 %) UD and 126 (67. 4 %) BD patients discontinued the treatment, with a median duration of 36  days and 27  days, respectively. No significant difference was found between UD and BD in terms of time to lack of persistence with pharmacological treatment. The highest discontinuation rate (> 40 %) occurred in the first 3  months for both groups of patients. For UD patients, those with a higher risk of suicide (odds ratio [OR] = 0. 696, P= 0. 035) or comorbidity of any anxiety disorder (OR = 0. 159, P< 0. 001) were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> prematurely <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (<b>drop</b> <b>out</b> within the first 3  months), while those with onset in the summer (OR = 4. 702, P= 0. 049) or autumn (OR = 7. 690, P= 0. 012) were more <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> prematurely <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> than those with onset in the spring (OR = 0. 159, P< 0. 001). For BD patients, being female (OR = 2. 250, P= 0. 012) and having a history of spontaneous remission or switch to hypomania (OR = 2. 470, P= 0. 004) were risk factors for premature <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> while hospitalization (OR = 0. 304, P= 0. 023) and misdiagnosis as UD (OR = 0. 283, P< 0. 001) at the first index prescription were protective factors.

Using the reports [...] of students in 1980 and 1982, the percentage of continuously handicapped students was estimated at 4 % for the senior cohort and 6 % for the sophomore. To examine explanations for inconsistency between student responses at the two times, student self-identification as handicapped was examined in relationship to cognitive tests, maintenance in school in 1982, and self reported grades.

Children’s perception of the degree of social hierarchical structuring and social prominence in their class was determined by peer nominations. 432 children participated in the follow-up either 2 or 4 years after baseline aged 10 - 11 (year 6) and completed a bullying questionnaire.
