50|$|David Savir, a mathematician, {{was given}} the task of proving the symbol could be printed and would meet the {{reliability}} requirements, and was most likely unaware of Baumeister’s equations. He and Laurer added two more digits to the ten for error correction and detection. Then they decided to add odd/even parity {{to the number of}} units filled with bars in each side. Odd/even parity is a technique used to detect any odd number of bit errors in a bit stream. They decided to use odd on one half and even on the other. This would provide additional indication of which half ticket was being read. This meant that every bar width had to be read accurately to provide a good reading. It also meant every space would also be known. Requiring every bit width to be read precisely basically nullified the Delta C advantage except for the Delta C reference measurement. Only the strange character set {{and the size of the}} label remains as a shadow of the Delta C code. The size was still that calculated for pure Delta C. If the <b>label</b> <b>size</b> had been properly recalculated, taking into account the required bar width measurements the label would have been far too large to be acceptable.|$|E

Most recently, they released [...] "Bodycrash" [...] under their Buy Now alias, sampling the 1978 disco hit [...] "Let's All Chant" [...] by the Michael Zager Band. The track was first played by Pete Tong on his Radio 1 show in late 2007. Eventually, the Dirty South remix of the tune leaked out onto the Internet in January 2008. The track has since received a much larger release via Positiva Records, also including the Laidback Luke remix.He has produced with Eric Prydz under the name A&P Project. Also, he has created a track with his friend Axwell under the name Supermongo, later renamed Supermode. They made a cover of an old Bronski Beat track, calling it [...] "Tell Me Why". This was released via Ministry of Sound's Data Records imprint in summer 2006.Steve Angello's productions can mainly be classified as house ("Summer Noize"), progressive ("Yeah"), Tech house ("Partouze") and electro house ("Raining Again").

40|$|Considering label {{as one of}} the {{important}} map component, this paper is an attempt to provide empirical evidence of <b>label</b> <b>size</b> design rules and frames which is based on the design aesthetics and efficiency. Determining the ‘best’ legible <b>label</b> <b>size</b> is critical concern involves testing design aspect and needs. Both aesthetics and efficiency can set the design frames for better perception and legibility. Aesthetics was calculated by determining users´ preference of different use of label sizes, whereas efficiency was calculated by measuring time to locate targets of different. Both areal and point data were involved in the study to determine the combination of the two measurements of <b>label</b> <b>size</b> design. Digital maps were designed and presented to users as they were firstly asked about their preference of different use of <b>label</b> <b>size,</b> and secondly they were asked to locate different <b>label</b> <b>size.</b> The intersection between the first test and the second one attributes the frames for <b>label</b> <b>size</b> design.

In this paper, we considered the <b>label</b> <b>size</b> maximization problem for points with axes-parallel rectangular labels that correspond to character strings and have different widths based on the number of characters. We propose an algorithm for computing the optimum size for the <b>label</b> <b>size</b> maximization problem in the 2 -position model and a polynomial time algorithm for the problem in the 4 -position model. Our algorithm cannot obtain the maximum value in the 4 -position model because the <b>label</b> <b>size</b> maximization problem in the 4 -position model is NP-hard. However, our algorithm is efficient in practice, as shown by computational experiments. Further, computational results for JR trains, subways and major private railroads in Tokyo are presented. key words: label {{placement problem}}, node label placement, <b>label</b> <b>size</b> maximization, rectangular label 1...|$|E
