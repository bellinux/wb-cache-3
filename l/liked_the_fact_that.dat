5|$|Oppenheimer {{submitted}} {{his resignation}} as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone {{with both a}} solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
5|$|Molyneux was {{impressed}} with the creature's navigation code: he stated that it is the largest piece of code, and that players could change the map repeatedly and creatures will still find routes to their destinations. Molyneux also <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the game adapts to the player, enabling the choice of the preferred methods and strategies, and stated that his favourite part of the game is how the player digs out rather than build up, meaning the player has heavy involvement in building the level. He stated that he was proud of Dungeon Keepers concept, but remarked that doing original things takes time. He also liked that people were unable to describe Dungeon Keeper in any particular way. Molyneux disliked the user interface, saying the team overdid the control panel, and commented that it was a reminder that the player was playing a video game. This was a key reason the user interface of his next video game, Black & White, did not feature panels, buttons, or icons.|$|E
25|$|During Griffin's junior season, the Oklahoma Christian {{basketball}} team was moved down to Class 2A from Class 3A. As {{he began his}} third season with the Saints, he was quickly developing as a player, as he led them to a third straight state championship. He scored 22 points, grabbed 9 rebounds, and recorded 6 blocks in the finals as Oklahoma Christian defeated Washington High School, 57–40. He was named the state tournament MVP, and the Saints finished the season 27–1, with Griffin averaging 21.7 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 4.9 assists. For his efforts, he was named The Oklahoman Player of the Year and to the Tulsa World Boys All-State First Team. His play {{attracted the attention of}} the new basketball head coach for Oklahoma, Jeff Capel, who first heard of him through his brother, Taylor. That spring, Capel saw him play {{for the first time and}} was quickly impressed. Capel <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Griffin had not yet become a household name among recruiters and felt he was exactly the player he needed to rebuild the Oklahoma men's basketball program with. Griffin had been considering Duke, Kansas, North Carolina and Texas, but his brother eventually sold him on joining Oklahoma when he raved about the direction of the Sooners and the chance to play together again for his home state.|$|E

500|$|Film Fodder's Mac Slocum {{said that}} he was glad that the show [...] "downshifted this week into a far more {{reasonable}} gear". He felt that an upside to the downshifting was the [...] "return to characters", and thought that there was no better representation of character than Hurley. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad wrote that although he heard [...] "that this episode would be mostly filler", he did not [...] "think that's true". He <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there was more revelations of Hurley's background, and enjoyed the [...] "awesome reveals from the other half of downed Oceanic 815". TelevisionWithoutPity.com graded the episode with a [...] "B-".|$|E
500|$|Rhys {{tries to}} make things up to Elaine by taking her to the {{hospital}} to meet his colleagues, but when she questions his motives for [...] "going public" [...] and admitting who she is, Rhys has to look at himself and his attitude towards her. In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap's Jason Herbison, Barber said he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Rhys' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character's background. He expressed his wish of having Rhys' father introduced in the future, saying [...] "Rhys doesn't have a good relationship with him, as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger. It would certainly create a lot of interesting dilemmas".|$|E
500|$|Maxtone-Graham has {{similarly}} {{said that while}} he thinks these type of openings [...] "are kind of funny", they may be best avoided. However, Scully <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the staff included a comment in the episode on its [...] "screw you" [...] beginning by having Homer say [...] "I'll bet you didn't see that coming!" [...] to the viewers when he decides to get the tennis court. The writers {{had a number of}} alternate endings to [...] "Tennis the Menace" [...] before deciding on the one eventually used. For instance, at one point, the family was to return home to watch the match in which Serena and Sampras faced off against Venus and Agassi on television. The staff changed it to the final one because they did not want it to feel like the episode petered out.|$|E
5000|$|Reese's inner demons {{are what}} {{attracted}} Shahi {{to play the}} character. Specifically she said, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she has a dark side and she has some demons {{that she needs to}} overcome." ...|$|R

500|$|It was {{followed}} the same year by House of Sand and Fog, a drama {{based on the novel}} by Andre Dubus III. She portrayed Kathy Nicolo, an abandoned wife whose inherited house is sold at auction to the Iranian emigre and former colonel Massoud Amir Behrani (Ben Kingsley). After reading the script, Connelly said: [...] "(the story is) moving and beautifully written. I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> there is no good guy and bad guy. I found it really compelling that both sides do things that are morally questionable, because life is often like that." [...] Producer Michael London said about Connelly's portrayal: [...] "I think she understood Kathy and knew in her bones that she could take this character and give her the kind of dimension that she had. I don't think there is another actress who could have played Kathy with such power and grace." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{war ended}} on 14 August 1945, Oppenheimer {{informed}} Groves of his intention to resign {{as director of the}} Los Alamos Laboratory, but agreed to remain until a suitable replacement could be found. Groves wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Norris Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis. Groves announced this at a meeting of division leaders on 18 September. Parsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy, which awarded him the Legion of Merit for his wartime services. He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain. On 16 October 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the Army-Navy [...] "E" [...] Award, and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory's second director the following day.|$|E
500|$|At the film's release at the Sundance Film Festival, {{film critic}} Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News {{compared}} {{the effect of}} Reservoir Dogs {{to that of the}} 1895 film L'Arrivée d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat, whereby audiences supposedly saw a moving train approaching the camera and ducked. Bernard said that Reservoir Dogs had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of The New York Times enjoyed the cast and the usage of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he did not often use close-ups in the film. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times also enjoyed the film and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said [...] "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect." [...] Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the film on its [...] "deadpan sense of humor".|$|E

50|$|Director Alexander Mitta {{expressed}} {{support of}} the return of Crimea to Russia; however, Mitta also said <b>that</b> he didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it {{was used as a}} way to distract the Russian population of the internal problems Russia was facing.|$|R
500|$|Upon first listen, Kirsten Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that}} she was [...] "semi-horrified" [...] at the song, but since it was a Max Martin-produced track she [...] "gave it another chance", and commented: [...] "It’s {{definitely}} a Max Martin song. It has a good beat and cheesy, yet catchy lyrics." [...] However, Coachman said that the song should have been sung by Mark Salling (Puck) and Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) rather than Monteith and Michele. Coachman <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> this song and [...] "Get It Right" [...] fit in with the episode, and wrote, [...] "I think both songs are pretty good anthems, and hopefully they do speak to the audience. She stated, however, that she [...] "probably won’t be singing along to them in my car anytime soon". In an album review giving Glee: The Music, Vol. 5 a total of two out of five stars, Andrew Leahey of Allmusic said that the new Glee songs [...] "aren’t good enough to make much of a difference". Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the song four stars for its lyrics, but said that the tune [...] "sucked".|$|E
500|$|The actress {{noted that}} Jo matures during her hiatus between {{the second and}} fifth season. Having found {{out the hard way}} that [...] "banter doesn't always work", she becomes quieter and [...] "not as mouthy". The {{character}} [...] "called the shots" [...] in her final appearance, and was the [...] "bigger person" [...] by forcing everyone to accept the reality of the situation. After years of hunting together, the relationship between Jo and Ellen also develops; Tal came to view them more as equals rather than daughter and mother. Although Jo's feelings for Dean remain the same, Tal <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she does not easily give in to Dean's advances in [...] "Abandon All Hope...". She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave it a little more meaning". When asked about the kiss that Dean gives to Jo when she is dying, Tal explained that she interpreted the kiss as Dean [...] "really seeing [...] and thanking [...] and appreciating [...] For him, at that particular moment, {{there was no other way}} to express it but with a kiss." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{recognisable}} aspects of My Bloody Valentine's music is Shields' guitar sound, which [...] "use texture more than technique to create vivid soundscapes." [...] During the late 1980s, Shields began customising the tremolo systems for his Fender Jaguars and Jazzmasters; extending the tremolo arm and loosening it considerably, {{to allow him to}} manipulate the arm while strumming chords, which resulted in excessive pitch bending. Shields used a number of alternate and open tunings that together with his tremolo manipulation achieved [...] "a strange warping effect that makes the music wander in and out of focus", according to Rolling Stone. Shields' most notable effect is reverse digital reverb, sourced from a Yamaha SPX90 effects unit. Together with the tremolo manipulation and distortion, he created a technique known as [...] "glide guitar". Shields effects rig, which is composed largely of distortion, graphic equalizers and tone controls, consists of at least 30 effects pedals and is connected to a large amount of amplifiers, which are often set to maximum volume to increase sustain. During live performances, and in particular the closing song [...] "You Made Me Realise", My Bloody Valentine perform an interlude of noise and excessive feedback, known as [...] "the holocaust", which would last for half an hour and often reached 130db. Shields later remarked [...] "it was so loud it was like sensory deprivation. We just <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we could see a change in the audience at a certain point." ...|$|E

500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when I finally got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
500|$|Slezak {{described}} the duet of [...] "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" [...] as [...] "really pretty", and Chaney said that [...] "Lea Michele ... sang this Jackson love {{song in the}} loveliest possible fashion with Cory Monteith". Votta wrote that [...] "Finn sounds the best he's sounded", and Futterman noted that Finn held [...] "his own against Rachel, vocally"—she <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it was Finn singing to Rachel {{instead of the usual}} other way around and was [...] "grateful to the Glee team for assigning plot-relevant songs". Lynch felt that the song [...] "seemed to slow down the otherwise wonderfully paced episode" [...] and would have preferred it if they had cut the song and [...] "kept the Warblers' version of 'I Want You Back' instead". He was more enthusiastic about [...] "Black or White", which he characterized as [...] "musically awesome but dramatically confusing" [...] and graded an [...] "A−". Futterman said that [...] "Artie once again nails the MJ impression", and Goldberg declared that the [...] "chorus with Santana leading charge and Artie's rap" [...] were [...] "spot on". Bell agreed that the song showed that [...] "Artie is still New Directions' go-to rapper", but noted that she did not feel that New Directions had successfully demonstrated that they [...] "knew the true meaning of Michael Jackson". Chaney was unenthusiastic and gave the song a [...] "C", while Flandez had more negative opinion than hers: [...] "Sebastian Smythe got our reaction right: a slow-handed clap".|$|E
500|$|The techno soundtrack {{and general}} audio were also praised by critics. Robinson {{recognised}} that techno music featured {{played an important}} part in the Wipeout series, opining that the entire game is set to a [...] "now-standard thumping soundtrack". Additionally, Robinson enjoyed how the music was filtered out each time the player an airborne jump. Roper similarly acknowledged that soundtracks have always been {{an integral part of the}} Wipeout franchise, and said that the music tracks in Wipeout HD [...] "work perfectly in line" [...] with both visuals and the overall racing experience by blending into the background. Regarding the sound effects, Roper noted that [...] "there aren't too many", although he appreciated the few ones that are in the game. Cocker felt that the game's soundtrack was enjoyable for fans of electronica, although he <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> players could import their own playlists to the game, an aspect he thought that introduced more variation. In cohesion with other critics, Cocker recognised that music was important to the franchise, and commended the mix of techno, dubstep, and drum and bass soundtracks. Orry stated that the game featured a [...] "brilliant" [...] soundtrack, and also commended its integrated custom soundtrack support. Goyon praised the electro-orientated music, stating that the sound [...] "sticks well" [...] to the futuristic universe of Wipeout, and also enjoyed the idea of playing customised music if the player did not like the standard soundtrack. Although Davis noted the lack of [...] "huge acts" [...] like The Prodigy, Daft Punk, or The Chemical Brothers (all of whom were featured in Wipeout 2097), he did acknowledge that there were still [...] "plenty of chilly synths" [...] and [...] "thumping backbeats" [...] to listen to.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell enjoyed Raiden's role, commenting {{that his}} {{interactions}} with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake's character. His introduction was given an award for [...] "Biggest Surprise" [...] by GameSpot in 2001, while Dave Meikleham from GamesRadar listed his appearance {{as one of the}} biggest plot twists in a video game since the trailers did not show him. Meikleham also called Raiden a [...] "surprisingly likeable character" [...] and found his dynamic with Solid Snake appealing. Den of Geek listed Raiden {{as one of the most}} sexually appealing video game characters noting his body appealing despite disappointing responses from Metal Gear characters. Before joining Kojima Productions Ryan Payton stated that he was not disappointed by Raiden's introduction, and <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Metal Gear Solid 2 team kept his identity a secret. Raiden's English voice actor Quinton Flynn was surprised by fans' response to the character, but commented that it also attracted new fans to the series. Regarding response about Raiden replacing Snake as the main character, Flynn thought that fans were angry at the idea that Raiden would replace Snake for all subsequent games. Raiden's relationship with Rosemary was also listed as the most awkward part of the Metal Gear series by 1UP.com, with writer Scott Sharkey speculating about Hideo Kojima's life since the director claimed the relationship was autobiographical. PLAY editor Nick Jones listed the scene in which Raiden is nude as his fourth most favorite moment of the franchise, calling it the [...] "one of the funniest moments in gaming history." [...] Lisa Foiles of The Escapist included him on her 2014 list of top five katana wielders, noting [...] "this is not a popularity contest and Raiden qualifies" [...] even in MGS2 where [...] "he was whiny, an emo, and kind of a bitch." ...|$|E
500|$|Roxas' {{character}} {{has received a}} positive critical response from both fans and video game publications. During February 2010, Roxas was twenty-eighth in a Famitsu poll featuring the most popular video game characters from Japan. In another poll, Roxas was voted the second most popular Kingdom Hearts character with his fight against Sora ranked as the best scene from the series. His fighting sequences from the first game's secret ending were {{called one of the}} best video game cinematic moments by GameSpy. While reviewing Kingdom Hearts II Jeff Haynes of IGN said that Roxas was a [...] "likable kid". Ron Fahey of Eurogamer had a similar view, calling him a [...] "likeable enough young chap who just happens to be troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn't even know". His playable position in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players who are new to the franchise. Cavin Smith of PSX Extreme also called Roxas a likable character and stated that the revelation regarding his existence in Kingdom Hearts II is [...] "a shocker of a revelation for any RPG!" [...] The New York Times <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the player controls Roxas in Kingdom Hearts IIs introduction instead of the protagonist Sora, avoiding the continuation of Sora's search for his friends. Additionally, the reviewer found the switch from Roxas' story to Sora's after a few hours [...] "a little jarring". Andrew Reiner from Game Informer emphasizes his role as a [...] "troubled boy," [...] calling his story arc [...] "an amazing chain of events," [...] particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a [...] "devilish yet remarkable plot twist" [...] which may impact the player in a way that he [...] "may not want Sora back". On the other hand, UGO Networks commented that due to the game's initial focus on Roxas, gamers would have to wait until playing as Sora to experience the most exciting parts of the title.|$|E

It could be many things, and this album, to me, {{was sort of a}} collection of many different emotions." [...] The artwork's typography bears the dictionary entry of [...] "Emotion" [...] as a noun.|$|E
