5|$|There {{are fewer}} {{recorded}} bites from this species {{compared to other}} venomous species such as cobras and vipers as it is <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> and tends to avoid humans. If they do bite, it is usually in self-defense when accidentally grabbed. Most sea snake bites occur when fishermen attempt to untangle the snakes from their fishing nets.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are capable}} of killing humans. Mistaken identity leading to an attack is always possible, especially in or near cloudy waters. American alligators are often <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards humans than larger crocodile species, a few of which (mainly the Nile and Saltwater crocodiles) may prey on humans with some regularity. American alligator bites are serious injuries due to the reptile's sheer bite force and risk of infection. Even with medical treatment, an American alligator bite may still result in a fatal infection.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E

5000|$|Jagged Thoughts is {{the third}} album by Oakland punk band American Steel. It was {{released}} in 2001 by Lookout Records. The album is a departure from their earlier releases, focusing <b>less</b> on <b>aggressive</b> ska-punk and showing a larger Clash influence.|$|R

5|$|In general, {{people with}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} are at roughly seven times {{the risk of}} kidney cancer compared to the unaffected population. Estimates of the incidence among people with the disease range from 14%–34%. Rarely, it is associated with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. If it develops in someone with BHD, renal cell carcinoma occurs later in life and has a poor prognosis. Though the types of tumor typically associated with BHD are considered <b>less</b> <b>aggressive,</b> cases of advanced or metastatic kidney cancer have been observed in people with the syndrome. Both benign and cancerous tumors can reduce kidney function over time as they grow larger.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely stunted by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E

Kassing and Avtgis (1999) found an individual who is more argumentative and <b>less</b> verbally <b>aggressive</b> is prone to use articulated dissent. On the other hand, an individual who lacks argumentative skills will resort to using a less direct and more aggressive strategy, latent dissent.|$|R
5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> than mallards. Domestic ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the genes of the domestic duck.|$|E
5|$|The GHMix2.0 mode {{allows one}} to {{precisely}} create songs up to 10 min, and includes pre-defined sample tracks that can be modified on a note-by-note basis as desired. The new Jam mode lets the players select one of several standard pre-set rhythms and then play along with it on the instrument controllers in a free-form mode; however, players can then capture any segment of this music and move it to the Mix mode to compile a song. User songs are then uploaded and downloaded through the GHTunes mode of the Music Studio. While songs that violate copyright will still {{be removed from the}} service, Neversoft will be <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> about this and will rely more on user feedback on such issues. The PS2 version does not support this feature.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E

5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he tried to make a comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.|$|E

Electing more women could have an effect on whether liberal democracies take a more aggressive approach on certain issues (Gat 606- 607).|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{anticipated}} {{tax planning}} as an underlying source of value creation for acquirers’ shareholders. We hypothesize that merger announcement returns for acquirers reflect their shareholders’ {{beliefs about the}} future tax planning performance of the merged firm. Our analyses show that, in acquisitions of more tax <b>aggressive</b> targets by <b>less</b> tax <b>aggressive</b> acquirers, acquirers’ merger announcement abnormal returns decrease as the tax aggressiveness of the acquirer decreases relative {{to that of the}} target. For acquisitions of <b>less</b> tax <b>aggressive</b> targets by more tax aggressive acquirers, acquirers’ merger announcement abnormal returns increase as the tax aggressiveness of the acquirer increases relative to that of the target, but is only observable when omitting deals in either extreme decile of the targets’ tax aggressiveness. These findings suggest that the market expects the target to adopt the acquirer’s tax planning rather than benefiting from the more aggressive planning of either party, and that the anticipated tax planning changes are positively associated with acquirer returns. Further, the results suggest that the merged firm’s overall tax planning is easier to reduce than increase through the acquisition...|$|R
50|$|African American {{women have}} been shown to have better {{survival}} outcomes compared to whites for vulvar cancer even though they present with cancer at a significantly younger age. This has been explained by African American's higher rate of human papilloma virus HPV infection. Research reveals that African American women have a higher frequency of HPV-associated vulvar cancers than white women. HPV-positive vulvar cancer is associated with early age onset, <b>less</b> overall <b>aggressive</b> behavior, and better patient prognosis.|$|R
25|$|The second-generation Ford Taurus SHO was {{launched}} in 1992, along with the Taurus. Unlike the first generation, this SHO contained <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> body cladding, {{as well as a}} unique front end using parts largely borrowed from the Mercury Sable. Like the Taurus and Sable, the SHO's drivetrain was carried over from the first generation. The only major change came in 1993, when an automatic transmission became optional. Automatic equipped cars got a slightly bigger engine with equal horsepower due to <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> camshafts.|$|E
25|$|Females {{exercise}} mate choice, rejecting unwanted and unfit males by cannibalizing them. Mate choice often correlates size with fitness level; smaller males {{tend to be}} <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> {{and display}} low level of fitness; smaller males are therefore eaten more often because of their undesirable traits. Males perform elaborate courtship dances to display fitness and genetic advantage. Female orb-web spiders (Nephilengys livida) tend to cannibalize males displaying <b>less</b> <b>aggressive</b> behavior and mate with males displaying more aggressive behavior, showing a preference for this trait, which, along with large body size that indicates a strong foraging ability, displays high male quality and genetic advantage.|$|E

General Lee reprimanded Magruder, but the fault for the lost opportunity must be shared equally with the poor staff work at Lee's own headquarters and a <b>less</b> than <b>aggressive</b> performance by Jackson.|$|R
5|$|Schmid spent 19 {{seasons as}} the head coach at UCLA, accumulating a record of 322–63–33(wins–losses–draws), and {{reaching}} 16 consecutive playoffs between 1983 and 1998.

40|$|Taxes {{represent}} a significant {{cost to the}} firm and shareholders, and it is generally expected that shareholders prefer tax aggressiveness. However, this argument ignores potential non-tax costs that can accompany tax aggressiveness, especially those arising from agency problems. Firms owned/run by founding family members are characterized by a unique agency conflict between dominant and small shareholders. Using multiple measures to capture tax aggressiveness and founding family presence, we find that family firms are <b>less</b> tax <b>aggressive</b> than their non-family counterparts, ceteris paribus. This result suggests that family owners are willing to forgo tax benefits {{in order to avoid}} th...|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} formula for PDMS is CH3Si(CH3)2OnSi(CH3)3, where n {{is the number}} of repeating monomer SiO(CH3)2 units. Industrial synthesis can begin from dimethyldichlorosilane and water by the following net reaction:The polymerization reaction evolves hydrochloric acid. For medical and domestic applications, a process was developed in which the chlorine atoms in the silane precursor were replaced with acetate groups. In this case, the polymerization produces acetic acid, which is <b>less</b> chemically <b>aggressive</b> than HCl. As a side-effect, the curing process is also much slower in this case. The acetate is used in consumer applications, such as silicone caulk and adhesives.|$|R
