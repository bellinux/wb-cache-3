50|$|Avian sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> {{virus is}} {{characterized}} by a wide range of tumors, the most common of which are lymphomas. Lymphoid <b>leukosis</b> is {{the most common form of}} this disease and with typical presentation of gradual onset, persistent low mortality, and neoplasia of the bursa. The disease is also characterized by an enlarged liver due to infiltration of cancerous lymphoid cells. In addition, other abdominal organs and the bursa of Fabricius are often infected.|$|E
5000|$|... 1908: Vilhelm Ellerman and Olaf Bang, University of Copenhagen, first {{demonstrated}} that avian sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> virus could be transmitted after cell-free filtration to new chickens, causing leukemia.|$|E
5000|$|Direct {{interaction}} of diseases {{occurs in the}} case of genetic recombination among different pathogens, for instance between Avian sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> virus and Marek's disease virus (MDV) in domestic fowl. Both cancer-causing viruses are known to infect the same poultry flock, the same chicken, and, even the same anatomic cell. In coinfected cells, the retroviral DNA of the avian <b>leukosis</b> virus can integrate into the MDV genome, producing altered biological properties compared to those of the parental MDV. The frequency of gene reassortment among human pathogens is less clear than it is the among plant or animal species but of concern as animal diseases adapt to human hosts and as man new diseases comes into contact.|$|E
50|$|Lymphoid <b>leukosis</b> was {{eradicated}} {{in primary}} breeders in the 1980s and 1990s which dramatically reduced {{the incidence of}} the disease in commercial laying hens. Commercial broilers are still struggling with ALV-J virus in many countries. Both layers and broilers may still become infected, especially if there are contaminated vaccines.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct repeat}} 1 (dr1) element is an RNA element {{commonly}} found in the 3' UTR of Avian sarcoma, Rous sarcoma and Avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses (Alpharetroviruses and Avian type C retroviruses). dr1 is required for efficient viral replication and {{is thought to be}} involved in genomic RNA packaging although this may not be its only role.|$|E
5000|$|Avian sarcoma <b>leukosis</b> virus (ASLV) is an {{endogenous}} retrovirus that infects {{and can lead}} to cancer in chickens; experimentally it can infect other species of birds and mammals. [...] ASLV replicates in chicken embryo fibroblasts, the cells that contribute to the formation of connective tissues. Different forms of the disease exist, including lymphoblastic, erythroblastic, and osteopetrotic.|$|E
50|$|In general BLV causes only {{a benign}} mononucleosis-like disease in cattle. Only some animals later develop a B-cell leukemia called {{enzootic}} bovine <b>leukosis.</b> Under natural conditions {{the disease is}} transmitted mainly by milk to the calf. Infected lymphocytes transmit the disease from the donor to the recipient. Virus particles are difficult to detect and not used for transmission of infection.|$|E
50|$|Stull also {{described}} a subspecies, Python curtus brongersmai, a commercially harvested snake of the Malay peninsula. She conducted research {{in a variety}} of other areas, most notably into the physiology and distribution of snakes.

She was later employed as an agent of the USDA to investigate the diseases of poultry and avian <b>leukosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Virus insertional {{mutagenesis}} is possible with both replication competent virus and the self-inactivating vectors that {{are commonly used}} in gene therapy. The virus inserts a gene (known as a viral onocogene) normally near the cellular myc (c-myc)gene. The c-myc gene is normally turned off in the cell; however when it is turned on {{it is able to}} push the cell into the G1 phase of the cell cycle and cause the cell to begin replication, causing unchecked cell proliferation while allowing the viral gene to be replicated. After many replications where the viral gene stays latent tumours begin to grow. These tumours are normally derived from one mutated/transformed cell (clonal in origin). Avian <b>leukosis</b> virus {{is an example of a}} virus that causes a disease by {{insertional mutagenesis}}. Newly hatched chicks infected with Avian <b>leukosis</b> virus will begin to form tumours that will begin to appear in their bursa of fabricus (like the human thymus). This viral gene insertion is also known as a promoter insertion as it drives the expression of the c-myc gene. There is an example of an insertional mutagenesis event caused by a retrotransposon in the human genome where it causes Fukuyama-type muscular dystrophy.|$|E
50|$|Key {{clinical}} signs {{as well as}} gross and microscopic features that are most useful for differentiating Marek’s disease from lymphoid <b>leukosis</b> and reticuloendotheliosis include (1) Age: MD can affect birds at any age, including <16 weeks of age; (2) Clinical signs: Frequent wing and leg paralysis; (3) Incidence: >5% in unvaccinated flocks; (4) Potential nerve enlargement; (5) Interfollicular tumors in the bursa of Fabricius; (6) CNS involvement; (7) Lymphoid proliferation in skin and feather follicles; (8) Pleomorphic lymphoid cells in nerves and tumors; and (9) T-cell lymphomas.|$|E
50|$|Although none of Mary's {{writings}} have survived, some quotations {{credited to}} her {{are found in}} hermetic writings. The most notable of these are found in The Dialogue of Mary and Aros on the Magistery of Hermes, which is an extract made by an anonymous Christian philosopher. Operations are described in this document which would later become the basis of alchemy, such as <b>leukosis</b> (whitening) and xanthosis (yellowing). The document describes, for the first time, an acid salt and other acids. There are also several recipes for making gold from plants (mandragora, for example).|$|E
50|$|Avian Sarcoma and <b>Leukosis</b> Viruses (ASLV) {{have ten}} subgroups (A through J). The {{envelope}} glycoprotein of subgroup A is called EnvA and its env gene codes for precursor protein known as Pr95. This precursor is cleaved by host cell enzymes to yield the surface protein subunit, gp85, and the transmembrane protein subunit, gp37, which heterodimerize and then form a trimer. The virus cannot infect cells before {{the processing of}} the envelope precursor protein is completed. For the virus to penetrate the cytosol of a host cell, a low pH is necessary.|$|E
50|$|Several {{immunosuppressive}} agents are encountered by birds including viruses, bacteria, parasites, toxins, mycotoxins, chemicals and drugs. The most common immunosuppressive viruses are Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV), Avian <b>Leukosis,</b> Marek’s Disease (MD) and Hemorrhagic Enteritis Virus (HEV). Concurrent immunosuppressive infections are an emerging {{concern in the}} poultry industry whereby early infection with IBDV causes the MD virus {{to come out of}} dormancy and contribute to active disease. New studies show that stress is the number one cause of immunosuppression in birds. Stressors leave birds more susceptible to infectious agents and therefore, new poultry management guidelines need to be endorsed.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of nodules {{on the internal}} organs may also suggest Marek's disease, but further testing is required for confirmation. This is done through histological demonstration of lymphomatous infiltration into the affected tissue. A range of leukocytes can be involved, including lymphocytic cell lines such as large lymphocyte, lymphoblast, primitive reticular cells, and occasional plasma cells, as well as macrophage and plasma cells. The T cells {{are involved in the}} malignancy, showing neoplastic changes with evidence of mitosis. The lymphomatous infiltrates need to be differentiated from other conditions that affect poultry including lymphoid <b>leukosis</b> and reticuloendotheliosis, as well as an inflammatory event associated with hyperplastic changes of the affected tissue.|$|E
50|$|Karen Beemon is an American {{molecular}} biologist whose research focuses primarily on viruses, RNA, and the genetic causes of cancer. She determined {{the size of}} retroviral genomes {{as a graduate student}} and subsequently helped characterize the Src oncogene of Rous sarcoma virus, the first tyrosine kinase. Her work on retroviral RNA processing has included mapping m6A modification sites in retrovirus genomes and determining a consensus sequence (RGACU). She also identified a Negative Regulator of Splicing sequence and an RNA-stability element that prevents nonsense-mediated decay of viral and cellular RNAs. Recently, Beemon identified tumor-promoting genes whose expression is altered by integration of the Avial <b>Leukosis</b> Virus (ALV) into the genome, such as the telomerase catalytic subunit, TERT.|$|E
5000|$|In Europe {{attempts}} were made to eradicate the virus by culling infected animals. The first country considered to be free of infection was Denmark. Soon the United Kingdom followed. Like the North American states, those of the Eastern block in Europe did not try {{to get rid of the}} virus. But the Eastern Europe states started to become <b>leukosis</b> free after the political changes at the end of the last century. A quote from a USDA fact sheet, [...] "The high individual animal prevalence of BLV reported in the Dairy 1996 study suggests that testing and culling seropositive animals may not be a cost effective method to control the disease. Instead, preventing disease transmission by implementing preventive practices would likely be more cost-effective." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{retroviral}} glycoproteins are oligomeric complexes {{that are}} composed of SU-TM heterodimers, which {{are made in the}} endoplasmic reticulum after the translation of the glycosylated Env precursor. The arrangement of these heterodimers determines the 3D structure of the knobbed spike on the viral surface. The Env proteins of the Avian Sarcoma and <b>Leukosis</b> virus (ASLV) and the Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) are both trimers of SU-TM heterodimers. The Env protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) also has a trimeric structure of heterodimers. It is believed that the intracellular transport of the nascent protein depends, to some extent, on the oligomerization of Env precursors, which allows hydrophobic sequences to be buried inside the protein structure. This oligomerization has also been implicated in fusion initiation with the membrane of the target cell.|$|E
40|$|Salmonella typhimurium was {{invariably}} {{isolated from}} our J strain murine <b>leukosis.</b> Immunization of D 103 mice with either inactivated Salmonella typhimurium or the cell-free extract of <b>leukosis</b> inhibited the transplantation of <b>leukosis.</b> The adoptive immunization of D 103 mice with spleen cells of Strong A mice immunized with either Salmonella or the cell-free extract of <b>leukosis</b> inhibited the transplantation of <b>leukosis.</b> The addition of either Salmonella or the cell-free extract of <b>leukosis</b> inhibited {{the migration of}} macrophages of <b>leukosis</b> spleen in tissue culture. Strong A mice is non-susceptible to J strain <b>leukosis.</b> However, inoculation of neonatal Strong A mice with the cell-free extract of <b>leukosis</b> produced a susceptibility to the transplantation of <b>leukosis.</b> These results suggest that both a filtrable agent and Salmonella typhimurium are present in cells of this <b>leukosis</b> and might be etiologically related to the <b>leukosis.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Osteochondrosarcoma {{developed}} in a chicken inoculated with <b>leukosis</b> of Strain 2. In successive passages made by intramuscular implantation of tumor tissue deriving from this chicken there occurred (a) osteochondrosarcoma free from <b>leukosis,</b> or (b) <b>leukosis</b> free from osteochondrosarcoma, or (c) osteochondrosarcoma in association with <b>leukosis.</b> The malignant sarcoma cells of this strain have the morphological characteristics of osteoblasts. Implantation of tumor tissue from chickens with lesions (a) and (c) yielded both osteochondrosarcoma and <b>leukosis.</b> Successive passages made by intravenous and intramuscular injections with blood from chickens with <b>leukosis</b> yielded <b>leukosis</b> only. Hence it is very probable that Strain 12 consists of a mixture of an osteochondrosarcoma-producing agent and the agent of <b>leukosis</b> of Strain 2. Strain 12 is readily transmitted by material containing the living malignant osteoblasts but transmission is seldom successful with virus freed from living cells. This virus produces neoplasms only when brought in contact with bone or cartilage...|$|E
40|$|All known causative {{agents of}} <b>leukosis</b> and sarcoma of {{chickens}} stimulate either a single type of cell or several closely related types of cells to unrestricted multiplication (1, 2). The association of sarcoma with <b>leukosis</b> was noted by us in 1930 among chickens inoculated with our <b>leukosis</b> Strain 1 {{and also as}} a spontaneous disease (3); but the etiological relationship of these two diseases was not determined. There {{was no evidence that}} the agent of <b>leukosis</b> Strain 1 is capable of producing both sarcoma and <b>leukosis.</b> McIntosh (4) has shown recently that treatment with tar is followed by the development of neoplasms that are transmissible by filterable viruses. This finding suggests that viruses that produce neoplasms are widespread among chickens. Oberling and Gu~rin (5) described an agent that in their opinion is capable of producing both <b>leukosis</b> and sarcoma, and probably also carcinoma. They suggest that the common agent of <b>leukosis</b> ma...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{samples of}} 126 mature cows with “persistent” {{hematological}} status from two <b>leukosis</b> herds and a <b>leukosis</b> free control herd were collected for determining hematological status and estimation of replicating lymphocytes. To quantitate {{the number of}} DNA synthesizing cells, the blood was incubated with tritiated thymidine in vitro followed by autoradiography. Classification of animals according to lymphocytosis status did not reveal clearly {{whether or not a}} difference existed between the two <b>leukosis</b> herds. The estimation of DNA synthesizing lymphocyte counts showed that the animals from the two <b>leukosis</b> herds did not differ from each other while differing significantly from control herd animals. The study suggests that the similarities between the two <b>leukosis</b> herds, while ambiguous on lymphocyte counts alone, become clear when DNA synthesizing cell counts are compared. Thus the animals of the two <b>leukosis</b> herds belonged to the same “leukosis” population...|$|E
40|$|Bovine <b>leukosis</b> {{virus is}} an {{exogenous}} retrovirus (Retroviridae, Oncovirinae) that infects lymphocytes of cattle. Infection with bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus and the concomitant antibody response are lifelong. Infection {{can result in}} several outcomes, including production of antibodies against bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus without other evidence of infection, inversion of the T:B lymphocyte ratio, persistent lymphocytosis, and clinical lymphosarcoma. The prevalence of an infection in a population of animals is {{the proportion of the}} group infected at any given time. Surveys have shown the prevalence of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus infection in cattle populations ranging from 0 to nearly 100 %. This wide range of prevalence levels is likely due to variations in risk factors such as husbandry practices, insect vectors, and genetic resistance. For example, prevalence tends to be higher in dairy than beef cattle and in cattle in Southern vs Northern states. The relative importance of the known modes of transmission of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus has not been established in beef cattle. Also, the economic impact of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus infection in beef cattle has not been examined. However, the presence of cattle infected with bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus in a herd drastically reduces opportunities to export cattle and/or semen to many countries. Excluding an early transient viremia, the virus locates in lymphocytes as a DNA provirus. Because of its ceil-associated nature, transmission is believed to occur by movement of infected lymphocytes to susceptible animals. Intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intravenous inoculation of as little as one microliter of blood or intracutaneous inoculation of 2, 500 lymphocytes from an infected animal (equivalent to. 5 microliter of blood) results in transmission of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus. Transmission of an infectious agent in this manner is a form of horizontal transmission. Other means of horizontal transmission have been investigated, including casual contact in common housing; animal husbandry procedures such as dehorning without sanitizing the dehorner between cattle, tattooing with common pliers, rectal palpations with common sleeves, and injections with common needles; and blood feeding arthropods. In addition, transmission from the dam to calf, termed vertical transmission, has also been shown to occur with bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus. The purpose of these studies was threefold: 1) to characterize the bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus status of the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center cattle population, 2) to investigate the extent and significance of vertical transmission of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus in the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center cow herd, and 3) to investigate the role of specific management practices in horizontal transmission of bovine <b>leukosis</b> virus in the U. S. Meat Animal Research Center cattle herd...|$|E

The detached, dead cells contained more unintegrated viral DNA than the attached cells. These results confirm the hypothesis that cell killing after infection with a cytopathic avian <b>leukosis</b> virus is associated with accumulation of large amounts of unintegrated viral DNA. No accumulation of large amounts of integrated viral DNA was found in cells infected with cytopathic avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses...|$|E
30|$|The avian <b>leukosis</b> virus (ALVs), which {{belong to}} the genus alpha {{retrovirus}} of the Retroviridae family, cause neoplastic diseases and other reproduction problems in the poultry industry worldwide (Gao et al. 2012). According to the host range, the antigen structure of glycoproteins on the virus envelope and the interference between different strains in cell culture, avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses are divided into 10 subgroups (A-J), with six subgroups (A, B, C, D, E and J) existing in chickens (Dai et al. 2015; Reinisova et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2011). The subgroups A, B and J are mainly exogenous avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses that cause avian tumors, while subgroup E is a non-pathogenic or low pathogenic endogenous avian <b>leukosis</b> virus (Dai et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of manifest <b>leukosis</b> has, by now, {{been studied}} in considerable detail. On the other hand, the morphology of prc-leukotic changes and latent <b>leukosis</b> has remained untouched. The necessity {{of being able to}} give an early morphological diagnosis of <b>leukosis</b> became evident during the work of the Leulrosis Research Group at the State Veterinary Medical Institute. The structures most commonly involved in <b>leukosis,</b> the lymph nodes, offer considerable difficulties for study since they undergo a dynamic physiological variation which can obscure preleukotic or latent leukotic changes. Instead, one can take advantage of several possible sites outside the lymphatic organs which are often involved in leulrosis-the subserous tissues (peritoneum, pleura, pericardium), mucous membranes (abomasum, intestine, uterus), and the heart. In fact, practically all tissues of the body can be involved although rarely the skin or respiratory organs (DOBBERSTEIN and SEIFRIED, 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Sera from hamsters bearing tumours {{induced by}} the Schmidt-Ruppin strain of Rous sarcoma virus (sR-RSV) contain {{antibodies}} to the avian <b>leukosis</b> group specific antigen and an antigen of chick origin. The 'chick embryo antigen ' is found in chick embryos infected and uninfected with avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses and in chicken tumours induced by avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses; for example, Rous sarcoma wing web tumour and plasma from avian myeloblastosis virus infected chickens. The 'chick embryo antigen' has been detected in sR-RSV hamster tumour cells. Cultured chick fibro-blasts do not contain the ' chick embryo antigen ' and thus the avian-leukosis group specific antigen can be specifically detected by complement fixation using SR-RSV tumour-bearing hamster sera. This COFAL test is as sensitive as the Rubin interference t st (RIF test) and unlike the RIF test will detect all known avian <b>leukosis</b> viruses. 2...|$|E
40|$|The major group-specific antigen (gs-a) of avian leukoviruses was {{detected}} by radioimmunoassay in extracellular medium of all embryonic ultures prepared from infected chickens. Embryos of birds not carrying an avian]eukosis virus infection and of chickens from a leukosis-free flock could thus clearly be dis-tinguished from infected ones. Release of group-specific antigen into the extra-cellular medium was independent of subgroup or strain of avian <b>leukosis</b> or Rous sarcoma virus. The radioimmunoassay of the group-specific antigen seems to be well suited to complement the COFAL (complement fixation avian <b>leukosis)</b> and RIF (resistance inducing factor) tests in the detection of <b>leukosis</b> virus in infected material...|$|E
