If the interface is implemented, the functionality {{will be available for}} the language. <b>Language</b> <b>services</b> are implemented on a per-language basis. The implementations can reuse code from the parser or the compiler for the language. <b>Language</b> <b>services</b> can be implemented either in native code or managed code.
