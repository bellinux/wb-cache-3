5000|$|Detection of cryptococcal antigen (capsular material) by {{culture of}} CSF, sputum and urine {{provides}} definitive diagnosis. [...] Blood cultures may be positive in heavy infections.

50|$|Various other {{specialized}} tests {{may be used}} {{to distinguish}} between different types of meningitis. A <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>test</b> may be positive in meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli and group B streptococci; its routine use is not encouraged as it rarely leads to changes in treatment, but it may be used if other tests are not diagnostic. Similarly, the limulus lysate test may be positive in meningitis caused by Gram-negative bacteria, but it is of limited use unless other tests have been unhelpful. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a technique used to amplify small traces of bacterial DNA in order to detect the presence of bacterial or viral DNA in cerebrospinal fluid; it is a highly sensitive and specific test since only trace amounts of the infecting agent's DNA is required. It may identify bacteria in bacterial meningitis and may assist in distinguishing the various causes of viral meningitis (enterovirus, herpes simplex virus 2 and mumps in those not vaccinated for this). Serology (identification of antibodies to viruses) may be useful in viral meningitis. If tuberculous meningitis is suspected, the sample is processed for Ziehl-Neelsen stain, which has a low sensitivity, and tuberculosis culture, which {{takes a long time to}} process; PCR is being used increasingly. Diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis can be made at low cost using an India ink stain of the CSF; however, testing for cryptococcal antigen in blood or CSF is more sensitive, particularly in people with AIDS.|$|E

Evaluate the usefulness of C-reactive protein (CRP) level in rotavirus diagnosis and the possible effect of age and gender in CRP level. METHODS: Detection of viral antigen in faecal samples via ELISA and <b>Latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests.</b> CRP detected in (80) children serum samples. RESULTS: The range of CRP level was (6 - 96 mg/dl). ELISA more Sensitive (84. 62 %) than <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> (61. 11 %) in the diagnosis of rotavirus, although the specificity of <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> was 90. 91 % versus (74. 07 %) in ELISA. Both tests give identical accuracy (77. 5 %) in the detection of rotavirus. Moderate agreement reported between ELISA and <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> in the diagnosis of rotavirus (kappa value = 0. 534). A significant difference and inverse correlation between male; female and CRP level were detected. Age significantly correlated with <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> results (p = 0. 013). CRP level inversely correlated with <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> and ELISA results (p = 0. 000). ELISA results inversely correlated with <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> (p = 0. 000). CONCLUSIONS: Although ELISA {{appears to be more}} sensitive in rotavirus diagnosis, <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> has the same accuracy and can be used in an emergency (take into consideration the false positive results) as an alternative method for rotavirus diagnosis. <b>Latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> results affected by age which is an important drawback.

40|$|Rapid <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> assays for {{identifying}} tryptophanase, glutamate decarboxylase, and glucuronidase from Escherichia coli cell lysates {{were developed by}} using rabbit polyclonal antibodies elicited to commercial E. coli enzyme preparations. The <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> had sensitivities of 77 % for tryptophanase, 83 % for glutamate decarboxylase, and 70 % for glucuronidase. Specificities were 61 % for tryptophanase, 57 % for glutamate decarboxylase, and 82 % for glucuronidase. The sensitivities and specificities were too low to warrant continued development of the assays;Development of the <b>latex</b> <b>agglutination</b> <b>tests</b> required extensive studies in attempts to reduce or eliminate nonspecific agglutination reactions. The effects {{of a wide variety}} of assay conditions on assay performance were studied. Latex particles of different affinities and with different surface charges, different blocking agents, assay buffers of different compositions, pH values, and ionic strengths, chaotropic agents, and different antibody preparations were all examined. A combination of 0. 22 [mu]m diameter latex particles sensitized with both 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/ml immunoglobulin and blocked with a [beta]-casein and glycerol mixture resulted in the production of the best reactive latex reagents. Immunoglobulin adsorption studies yielded valuable information that was used to optimize the binding of the antibodies to the latex particles. Four different antibody purification methods had no significant effect in the elimination of nonspecific agglutination reactions. Antibody characterization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Ouchterlony immunodiffusion, enzyme immunoassays, and Western blot analysis revealed that the antibody preparations were heterologous and reacted with many different proteins.
