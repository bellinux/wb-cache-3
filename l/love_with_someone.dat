Unofficially, however, Love thought of the relationship as [...] "queer", both in respect to the player's gender and in respect to *Emilia as [...] "a confused adolescent falling in <b>love</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> she's not supposed to"; Love has stated that this did not come across as strongly as she intended.
