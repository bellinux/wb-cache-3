40|$|Abstract. This review {{examines}} {{arguments and}} evidence {{pertaining to the}} question: why have children in settings where the net economic costs of children are clearly substantial? The review is organized around three themes: biological predispositions, environment (social coercion) and rational choice. Specifically, we explore the argument that evolution has produced sets of genes that predispose persons to childbearing by making sex and parenthood pleasurable. We review sociological arguments regarding the pronatalism/antinatalism of societal institutions. Finally, we discuss arguments that stress the rationality of childbearing decisions by appealing to biological predispositions and the economic and non-economic values of children. The authors speculate that while a modern social structure and rationale supportive of childbearing could be constructed, such changes are not inevitable and may be difficult {{in the face of}} competing interests. Moreover, future social and technological change could alter the context of childbearing substantially. This uncertainty complicates policy recommendations. Morgan, P. et King, R., 2001.

40|$|The major {{arguments}} used {{to support}} the legalization of euthanasia are that {{such a move would}} increase autonomy both for individuals and for society as a whole, and would diminish suffering. This paper examines these two points from several angles, and concludes that, from the standpoint of society as a whole, the legalization of euthanasia would be likely to achieve the complete opposite: a reduction in autonomy and an increase in overall suffering. The involvement of doctors in euthanasia is seen as a separate debate. The medical ethic of beneficence and its importance are discussed, together with the consequent dilemmas produced if this ethic is to be retained {{at the same time as}} requesting doctors to perform euthanasia. Consequences for the doctor-patient relationship in terms of loss of trust are described. To resolve these dilemmas it is suggested that, if euthanasia were legalized, initial assessment should be by two lawyers, and the act itself performed by a technician, suitably vocationally trained.

40|$|Purpose – Class action (CA) {{has long}} been used in {{practice}} (mainly in the USA) and studied by academics especially in the shareholder protection area. This paper aims to apply the same practice within the current financial meltdown context. Design/methodology/approach – The paper faces the issue by comparing ex ante regulation with an ex post regulatory system, basically dependent on {{the action of the}} consumer who can sue firms that behave unfairly. The arguments are provided by the law and economics (LE) approach. Findings – According to LE, pure economic loss is a private loss that is not socially relevant but simply implies a redistribution of wealth. Consequently, wrongful behavior that induces reallocation of costs and benefits with no consequences on social welfare is not considered socially harmful, so is not necessarily subject to compensation. Since pure economic loss is very often financial, the above reasoning also applies to financial markets. However, the same <b>LE</b> <b>arguments</b> suggest that in financial markets, the policy of internalizing pure economic loss by means of CAs can be more far-sighted than simply compensating the victims: the liability system has the particular feature of producing deterrence and driving the market towards an efficient outcome. Originality/value – The paper maintains that CA intended as a complementary ex post regulatory device can {{play a significant role in}} addressing a failure that ex ante regulation has not in financial markets. This is coherent with the LE tradition that interprets tort law remedies as a solution for internalizing externalities and providing the correct incentive to the markets.

40|$|Le Poidevin has {{recently}} presented {{an argument that}} {{gives rise to a}} serious problem for relationist theories of space. It appeals to the simple geometrical fact that if A, B and C are three points lying in a straight line, then AB and BC together entail AC.

I argue that the problem that Le Poidevin raises for relationism should be rejected, because the thesis of supervenience is false. The latter rests upon what Le Poidevin refers to as ‘The explanatory principle’, a principle which he claims to be a natural extension of the truthmaker principle.

The survey presented is based on a mixed methodology : the making of monograph from “whistleblowers” associations and analysis of their public discourses. Although it was well-known, this threat becomes more apparent, its visibility and its permanence now jeopardize the practice across the island. The forced defection of the spots led to a growing concern : a crisis begins in the surfing community. To understand this crisis one must know in what extend the shark threat was normal before 2011 and how it led surfers to fishing sharks. This activity generated a controversy that we will study in two ways : first by looking how surfers introduce themselves in order to legitimize their discourse and then by analyzing the functions of conflict in this crisis. The methods {{to reduce the risk of}} shark attacks do not fit in with the values promoted by the whistleblowers. We propose to analyze the arguments expressed in order to make them socially accept. The study of the controversy about methods of risk prevention can finally make understand the conditions for resumption of the nautic activities. We will illustrate this with an original repossession process based on free-divers (called “lookouts”). Cet article se propose de montrer dans quelles mesures la construction puis la gestion du risque requin révèlent les évolutions dans la pratique du surf à la Réunion. L’article s’appuie sur une enquête de terrain à la méthodologie mixte (observation participante et entretiens). Bien que connue de longue date, la permanence de la menace requin en 2011 compromet la pratique du surf à l’échelle de l’île. La désertion forcée des sites de pratique amorce une crise sans précédent dans la communauté surf réunionnaise.

It is argued that the kibbutz society offers more similar roles for both genders than outside the kibbutz and therefore the gender differences in LE should be reduced in comparison to what is expected, given the very high LE of kibbutz members. Statistical data of the kibbutz population between the years 1975 - 1980 are analyzed and the results support the following conclusions: female members have higher LE but the difference is much less than expected {{on the basis of}} a regression analysis of data from 73 societies; the difference is smaller due to the relatively higher gain in LE by males; the gender differences are even smaller at age 50 compared to LE differences at birth.

40|$|The choice {{agenda is}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} most prominent in public policy. One of its main architects, Julian Le Grand, has used the metaphors of knights, knaves, pawns and queens to characterise changing attitudes to questions of motivation and behaviour among public servants and service users. He has said, for example, that, in the immediate postwar period, public servants were perceived as public-spirited altruists (or knights), whereas service users were seen as passive (or pawns). It was only in the mid- 1980 s that public servants came to be seen as essentially self-interested (knaves) and service users came to be regarded as consumers (queens). However, this highly influential model has undergone remarkably little critical scrutiny to date.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the course}} of development, {{children}} make their way through successive transitory stages that exhibit internal coherence. This phenomenon can be observed {{at all levels of}} linguistic analysis, but the gradual assembling of verbal constructions (Goldberg 2006, Tomasello 2003) is of special interest for linguistic theory. Children appear to match characteristics of the input quite closely, and the arguments they produce for a given verb do not differ markedly from those they hear (Morgenstern & Parisse, 2012). However, they do not always produce all of the arguments typically found in the adult patterns. In particular, children have difficulties producing forms with multiple arguments, especially three-argument constructions, and often undergo a progression from incomplete to complete patterns (Bloom 1990, Valian 1991). Previous studies suggest children's ability to learn verbal constructions is highly sensitive to the input (Choi 1999). Verbs must appear frequently {{in a wide range of}} semantically accessible contexts and with a wide range of possible arguments for children to learn to use them (Slobin 1985). Theakston et al. (2001) have demonstrated that the sentential frames mothers use with a particular verb is a clear predictor of those used by their children. This study examines the development of constructions based on the verb give, often cited in the literature as prototypical of verbs appearing in the ditransitive construction (Goldberg 2006). We analyze spontaneous language data from three English-speaking children aged 1; 06 to 3; 06, taken from the Providence Corpus (CHILDES), focusing on how children learn to express multiple arguments. After presenting some theoretical background and a survey of the literature, we introduce the data and methodological approach. Results of our analyses are then discussed and compared with previous studies. Au début du processus d’acquisition des constructions verbales, les enfants ne produisent pas tous <b>les</b> <b>arguments</b> des verbes qu’ils utilisent, en particulier quand il s’agit de verbes à trois arguments. Selon certains auteurs, l’enfant est particulièrement sensible au langage adulte qui l’entoure et produit les constructions en fonction de la fréquence des structures entendues (Choi 1999; Slobin 1985; Theakston et al. 2001). Afin de tester cette hypothèse, nous avons analysé les productions des constructions en give (donner) de trois enfants américains (Naima, Will et Lily) dans des suivis longitudinaux de la base de données CHILDES. Notre analyse montre que les enfants ont besoin d’avoir atteint une certaine maturation cognitive et linguistique avant de produire des constructions à trois arguments et une exposition à un nombre d’occurrences suffisant pour traiter le langage entendu. Il y a de grandes différences individuelles dans les rythmes et les parcours d’acquisition des trois enfants, mais tout en étant sensibles aux productions adultes, les enfants deviennent capables de pratiquer leur propre analyse du langage entendu en assemblant de manière créative les constructions qui sont à leur disposition...|$|R

Interestingly, we also find that mergers foreclose potential entry in other product markets and reduce the number of firms in related product markets. Finally, our results confirm that postmerger changes in the equilibrium number of firms directly impact market prices...|$|R

This seems clear by Hitler and Mussolini's great interest for Gustave Le Bon's The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind (1895), translated in English one year later (Le Bon 2001). How does Le Bon describe the absence of control, the exceptional character and the radical alterity of this crowd or "multitude" (Le Bon, 2001 : 68) ? In his major book, Gustave Le Bon - father of social psychology, in late nineteenth century - builds a visual theory {{of the crowd and}} a visual politics of charismatic domination. Nevertheless, we can conclude that Le Bon formulated a false hypothesis, based on a false effective appearance. As we have seen, Le Bon explains throughout his treatise, what are the characteristics of the "crowds", why do they need to be commanded by a charismatic chief, and how shall this chief behave, purposely using the visual to give a political form to the crowd, and to maintain the multitude under his control. The efficacy of visual representation is the means through which the dominant class can maintain his power. My hypothesis is that, following the use made after The Crowd by early twentieth century men of industry, liberal western statesmen, and European dictators -, Le Bon's thesis has worked as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Le Bon produces a strange relationship between belief and behaviour, where the content of the first shapes the second. Making Le Bon's theory of charismatic leadership a self-fulfilling prophecy, means not distinguishing between from one side, the political and visual imagination of a crowd, and, from the other side, the shaping of a crowd. Formulating clearly this distinction seems to be a necessary act of critique. Le Bon captures the fact that an affective dynamics constitutes the charismatic relationship between a chief and a crowd, but then denies the very same fact: if, according to the sociological observation, crowds are strongly imaginative and imagining, and the leader projects images, why the nature of this relationship, as a power relationship, is occulted? Not distinguishing between imagination of crowds and crowd moulding: this is how <b>Le</b> Bon's <b>argument</b> fulfils itself, {{as if it were the}} formula of a prophetic authority. It has already been said how Le Bon's theory has been used for purposes of propaganda, but it has not been explained why and how his hypothesis have been so successful, why it really has produced charismatic regimes, despite the fact that Le Bon denies, in fact, the heart of the very same hypothesis he carries on. Actually, there is an opposition between the political interest undermined by <b>Le</b> Bon's <b>argument,</b> and the fact that it is a hypothesis, an observation. The hypothesis is false, and the political interest denied, that's why it is so important to stress on the distinction raised by Yves Cohen. In Le Siècle des chefs, he immediately points the political effect of not distinguishing, in producing a naturalization of hierarchy. Therefore, Cohen suggests distinguishing between the interest for the chief and the need for a chief. How do Le Bon's visually produces this ambiguity, between " the way the observation is formulated (vocabulary) " and the way the same observation is " elaborated (sociological thesis) "...|$|R

Most of the time, this right is clearly stated by police officers when they arrest a suspect before interrogating him. The purpose of the paper is to analyse the structure and the argumentation of two significant U. S. Supreme Court decisions dealing with {{the right to}} silence, Miranda v. Arizona (1966) and Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010), then to pick out the textual clues that enable the reader to find the different arguments used by the Justices to devise and implement the Miranda rules. The study, thus, aims at comparing the two legal decisions in order to determine if the privilege against self-incrimination has evolved in early 21 st century both in France and in the U. S. A. Aux États-Unis, le droit de garder le silence pour les personnes arrêtées et interrogées par les forces de police est bien connu. Il est, la plupart du temps, clairement énoncé par les policiers qui procèdent à l'arrestation du suspect en vue d'un interrogatoire. L'objet de cet article est d'analyser la structure et l'argumentation de deux arrêts majeurs relatifs à ce droit au silence, Miranda v. Arizona (1966) et Berghuis v. Thompkins (2010), puis de repérer les indices textuels permettant de retrouver <b>les</b> différents <b>arguments</b> employés par <b>les</b> juges pour instaurer les règles Miranda. Cette étude vise donc à comparer les deux arrêts susmentionnés afin de déterminer l'évolution du droit garantissant la protection contre l'auto-incrimination au début du XXIe siècle des deux côtés de l'Atlantique...|$|R
