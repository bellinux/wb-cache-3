In its simplest form spaces and places lead in very explicit ways: we follow corridors, climb stairs, open doors and cannot walk or talk through the walls. Self-service restaurants, streets, paths, airports and other public spaces lead people, too. The documentary film <b>Leadership</b> <b>in</b> <b>Spaces</b> and Places asks the question “how do spaces and places perform and construct leadership?” The film was shot in twelve different locations, ranging from Microsoft and a real estate agency to a church, a theatre and a historic dry-dock. In each of the places the question was: How do places lead? Today, leadership is not only attached to persons, but also to physical materiality: spaces, places, buildings, cities, materials and artefacts. People {{seem to know what}} to do even when there is no one telling them what to do. Places and spaces have that effect. Examples of questions we came across in these various spaces: What kind of images children might attach to a closet door that is left open when they go to bed?
