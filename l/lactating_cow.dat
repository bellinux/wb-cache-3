40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effect of the interaction between 2 constant ambient temperatures [thermoneutrality (TN; 15 °C) and high temperature (HT; 28 °C) ] and 2 levels of Na bicarbonate supplementation [calculated to provide diet Na contents of 0. 20 % DM (Na(-)) and 0. 50 % DM (Na(+)) ] on water partitioning in dairy cows. Treatments were compared on 4 dry and 4 mid-lactation Holstein cows according to 2 Latin squares (1 for each physiological stage) over the course of 4 periods of 15 d. Diets consisted of a total mixed ration based on maize silage. Dry cows were restricted to their protein and energy requirements, whereas <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> were fed ad libitum. The daily average temperature-humidity index was 59. 4 for TN and 73. 2 for HT. <b>Lactating</b> and dry <b>cows</b> had higher vaginal temperatures at HT than at TN, but the increase was more pronounced in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> (+ 1. 05 vs. + 0. 12 °C for vaginal temperature, respectively). Dry matter intake (DMI) of <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> decreased by 2. 3 kg/d at HT. Free water intake (FWI) and estimated volume of water lost to evaporation increased at HT in both lactating and dry cows; no interactions were observed between temperature and physiological stage. When expressed as a proportion of DMI, the increase in evaporation that occurred with increasing temperature was completely compensated for by an increase in FWI for both physiological stages. The urinary water excretion increased slightly at HT in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> but not in dry cows, which may be related to the low chloride content of the offered diet. High Na supplementation increased DMI slightly in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows,</b> but milk yield was not affected. Sodium supplementation did not limit the decrease in DMI observed in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> at HT; this observation is likely due to the high diet electrolyte balance of the offered diets. Sodium supplementation increased FWI in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> and urinary flow in both physiological states.

This may lead to rearrangement of the water stable isotope equilibrium in body fluids. We propose an approach to detect possible varia-tions in the isotope ratio in different body fluids {{on the basis of}} different homoeothermic ad-aptations in varying reproductive stages. Three different reproductive stages (pregnant heifer, primiparous <b>lactating</b> <b>cow,</b> and pluriparous <b>lactating</b> <b>cow)</b> of two dairy cattle breeds (Italian Friesian and Modenese) were studied in winter and summer. Blood plasma, urine, faecal water, and milk were sampled and the isotope ratios of H (2 H/ 1 H) and O (18 O/ 16 O) were determined. Deuterium excess and isotope-fractionation factors were calculated for each passage from plasma to faeces, urine and milk. The effects of the season, reproduc-tive stages and breed on δ 2 H and δ 18 O were significant in all the fluids, with few exceptions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Factorial {{determination}} of the sodium (Na) requirement of heat-stressed <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> is hindered by accurate estimates of the Na losses through sweat. Direct studies, therefore, may be needed requiring information on {{the time course of}} healthy animals to become Na depleted and the subsequent rate of repletion. The rate of Na depletion and subsequent rate of Na repletion with two levels of dietary Na to <b>lactating</b> dairy <b>cows</b> housed under tropical conditions were investigated using the salivary Na/K. RESULTS: The 12 <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> (salivary Na/K ratio 14. 6) rapidly developed clinical signs of Na deficiency, including pica, polyuria and polydipsia, reduced body weight and reduced milk yield when fed a low-Na ration (0. 33 gkg- 1 dry matter (DM)) for 3 weeks. Deficiency symptoms were associated with a rapid decrease in salivary Na/K ratio to - 1 DM for 5 weeks did not restore salivary Na/K ratio to values of > 6. CONCLUSION: A daily Na intake of heat-stressed <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> to a ration intake of 1. 6 g Na kg- 1 DM was insufficient to restore Na deficiency. One week was sufficient to deplete heat-stressed <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> of Na, allowing for rapid dose-response studies utilizing the salivary Na/K ratio as a parameter for Na status of cows under tropical conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the stage of {{lactation}} on blood redox homeostasis of bovine and buffalo cows was evaluated. The investigation was carried out on early lactating and mid-late <b>lactating</b> <b>cows,</b> reared in a farm located in Campania (southern Italy). Plasma concentration of α-tocopherol and ascorbate, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase activities were higher (P < 0. 01) in mid-late <b>lactating</b> <b>cows,</b> thus suggesting a higher consumption of antioxidants during early lactation. Plasma concentration of protein-bound carbonyls (PC) and nitrotyrosine (N-Tyr), {{and the level of}} lipid hydroperoxides (LPO) were higher (P < 0. 01) in early <b>lactating</b> <b>cows,</b> thus suggesting that lipid peroxidation and peroxynitrite production are crucial in determining oxidative modifications in plasma. TAC was positively correlated with ascorbate concentration (P < 0. 03), and negatively correlated with PC concentration (P < 0. 002), and ascorbate was negatively correlated with PC (P < 0. 03) in mid-late lactating group. These findings demonstrate that circulating ascorbate {{plays a major role in}} preventing protein modifications induced by carbonyls, and that ascorbate scavenging effect is impaired during early lactation. We calculated a protein oxidative stress index as the ratio (PC + N-Tyr) /TAC multiplied by 100, and we found that this parameter was higher (P < 0. 0001) in early <b>lactating</b> <b>cows.</b> Therefore, it could be useful for assessing the extent of protein oxidative damage in relation to the whole antioxidant status. Further, we suggest that the LPO/GPx ratio multiplied by 100 might be used as lipid oxidative stress index in <b>lactating</b> <b>cows.</b> This index was higher (P < 0. 0001) in early <b>lactating</b> <b>cows,</b> and might represent a standard parameter for evaluating the lipid damage depending on a deficiency of the enzymatic antioxidant defence.

40|$|The {{practice}} of transhumance of livestock herds to Alpine summer pasture has experienced pronounced changes over recent decades {{due to the}} general process of agricultural intensification in productive areas and abandonment of farming in marginal areas. Instead of moving <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> to summer pastures raising replacement heifers recently gained much importance. Here, we analysed {{the impact of these}} changes in dairy farming on butterfly diversity inhabiting Alpine summer pastures in the eastern Italian Alps. We sampled butterflies (Lepidoptera) in 16 Alpine summer pastures that were either grazed by <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> (n = 11) or replacement heifers (n = 5) at two distances from the farm building. Butterflies were classified according to their mobility. Our results showed a distance effect on total butterfly species richness only in pastures grazed by <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> indicating a stronger impact on vegetation structure and composition nearby the farm building. Abundance of butterflies was higher with increasing distance from the farm building. In contrast to mobile butterflies, sedentary species reacted more strongly to disturbance induced by grazing livestock. Moreover, butterfly composition differed slightly between pastures grazed by <b>lactating</b> <b>cows</b> and heifers. Our results indicate that the widespread adoption of heifer grazing induces a shift in butterfly diversity and composition likely caused by the different behaviour of grazing livestock.

Eight lactating goats were used in two 4 x 4 Latin-square experiments with 14 d experimental periods {{to examine the effects}} of calcium salts of CLA methyl esters (CaCLA) containing trans- 10, cis- 12 on milk fat synthesis. Experimental treatments consisted of incremental inclusion of 0, 30, 60 or 90 g of CaCLA/d (corresponding to 7. 47, 14. 9 and 22. 4 g/d of trans- 10, cis- 12 CLA) offered during the first 10 d of each experimental period that replaced maize grain in concentrates (Experiment 1) or calcium salts of palm oil fatty acids (Experiment 2). Relative to the control, inclusion of 30, 60 or 90 g CaCLA/d in the diet reduced milk fat yield by 19. 8, 27. 9 and 32. 3 % and 17. 5, 39. 0 and 49. 3 % in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively.
