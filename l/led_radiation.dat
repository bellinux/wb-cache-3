The aim {{of the present study}} was to explore the photodynamic action of LED-activated nanoscale photosensitizer- loading hypocrellin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Material/Methods: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line CNE 2 cells were subjected to photodynamic therapy with hypocrellinloaded nanophotosensitizer. The uptake of the nanophotosensitizer in the CNE- 2 cells was measured using a spectrophotometer and photodynamic toxicity was investigated 18 h after <b>LED</b> <b>radiation</b> treatment. Apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry with propidum iodine staining, and nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. Active caspase- 3 in the CNE 2 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry with phycoerythrin (PE) -conjugated anti-active caspase- 3 antibodies. Results: The cellular uptake of the nanophotosensitizer in the CNE- 2 cells reached optimal at 6 h. LED-activated nanophotosensitizer resulted in doseand light-dependent phototoxicity. Apoptotic rate 18 h after PDT increased to 34. 32 ± 1. 94 % under the light energy of 1 J/cm 2. Hoechest 33258 staining reinforced the findings above. Condensation of chromatin and nuclear fragmentations was found in many PDT-treated cells. The activated caspase- 3 in the CNE 2 cells significantly increased up to 43. 90 % when the CNE 2 cells were exposed to the nanophotosensitizer for 6 h and then 1 J/cm 2 irradiation.

In this work, the efficiency of two UV-A LEDs (ultraviolet-a light emitting diodes) photosystems as a low cost alternative to conventional UV lamps was tested. The efficiency of the two UV-A LEDs photosystems was compared to that of the most economical UV source—solar radiation. To this end, the oxidative discolouration of Reactive Black 5 (RB 5) aqueous solutions was studied using photocatalysis with different concentrations of TiO 2 (0. 5 – 1 g/L) and H 2 O 2 (1. 76, 4. 41, 8. 82 and 17. 64 mM), exposed to different radiation sources: UV-A LEDs and solar radiation. The use of H 2 O 2 increased the discolouration rate of RB 5; however, an excessive dosage reduced the yield of the treatment, and the best results were attained with a concentration of 8. 82 mM of H 2 O 2. Strong differences were observed between the use of UV-A LEDs (23 W/m 2) and solar radiation. In both cases total discolouration was observed, but the discolouration rate was considerably higher with solar radiation. However, the use of a more powerful UV-A LED photo-system (85 W/m 2) allowed the achievement of higher discolouration rates (k = 0. 284 min− 1) than those obtained with solar radiation (k = 0. 189 min− 1) using only 0. 5 g/L of TiO 2.

40|$|The goal of {{this one}} year LDRD was to improve the overall {{efficiency}} of InGaN LEDs by improving the extraction {{of light from the}} semiconductor chip. InGaN LEDs are currently the most promising technology for producing high efficiency blue and green semiconductor light emitters. Improving the efficiency of InGaN LEDs will enable a more rapid adoption of semiconductor based lighting. In this LDRD, we proposed to develop photonic structures to improve light extraction from nitride-based light emitting diodes (LEDs). While many advanced device geometries were considered for this work, we focused on the use of a photonic crystal for improved light extraction. Although resonant cavity LEDs and other advanced structures certainly have the potential to improve light extraction, the photonic crystal approach showed the most promise {{in the early stages of}} this short program. The photonic crystal (PX) -LED developed here incorporates a two dimensional photonic crystal, or photonic lattice, into a nitride-based LED. The dimensions of the photonic crystal are selected such that there are very few or no optical modes in the plane of the LED ('lateral' modes). This will reduce or eliminate any radiation in the lateral direction so that the majority of the <b>LED</b> <b>radiation</b> will be in vertical modes that escape the semiconductor, which will improve the light-extraction efficiency. PX-LEDs were fabricated using a range of hole diameters and lattice constants and compared to control LEDs without a photonic crystal.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{understand}} if cyanobacteria, grown on an Earth-like planet orbiting around the habitable zone of an M star can survive and use the light coming from the star in a fruitful way, in particular analyzing their gaseous by-products. The organisms chosen usually don't have photopigments capable to photosynthesize the NIR part of the radiation, but can modify their photosynthetic apparatus in order to adapt to different light conditions if exposed in NIR light conditions, producing chlorophyll d and f. The two bacteria highlighted for our purpose are Chlorogloeopsis fritschii and Cyanobacterium Aponinum. The first {{is known to be}} able to change its photosynthetic apparatus to cope with new radiation conditions. In particular is capable to generate chlorophyll d and f if exposed to NIR light (720 nm). This feature is call FarLip acclimation. The second bacterium is a well known bacterium but no one has ever tried to understand if it has the same capability. Efforts have been done in order to find the best culture medium and the best growth conditions of temperature and pH. In order to understand how photosynthetic life can handle different radiation doses we ideated and realized a novel and pioneering <b>LED</b> <b>radiation</b> source with dynamical features. Its wavelength intervals (365 nm- 940 nm) overlap the limits of photosynthetic pigment absorption range (280 - 850 nm) of most common photosynthetic bacteria. Our simulator is composed by an array of 25 different channels corresponding to 25 different wavelengths. Each channel can host a maximum of about 15 LEDs. This simulator has been built thinking to modularity. In fact it is endowed by a mosaic of circuit boards arranged in a pie-chart shape, on the surface of which will be welded the LEDs. This solution allows a rapid change of the damaged LEDs and an easy implementations with other wavelengths. This simulator is capable to reproduce the spectra of main sequence F, G, K and M stars as well as the most common commercial lamps within its wavelength intervals. The control system is composed by a Laptop which controls a LED box and an STS-VIS spectrograph from Ocean Optics with cosine corrector. The first system generate the best fit of the input spectrum and give information to the simulator on how to reproduce it. The spectrometer has the task to control the goodness of the fit and, by means of a closed loop system, to adjust it tuning the LED's power in real time. The stellar simulator bas been subjected to several tests. The power emanated from the radiation source has been estimated to be 106. 22 W while the thermal power has been calculated to be 434. 05 W. The stellar simulator have been characterized in flux, analyzing the radiation at different distances from the device, from the exit of the source up to 25 cm. Then uniformity measurements have been done, analyzing the flux on a distance of 6. 5 cm from the centre. Finally, I calculated the absorption of the optics of the radiation source analyzing the spectra coming out from the stellar simulator and compared it with respect to the spectrum of the single LEDs. In order to lodge the bacteria we built new concept incubator made of a stainless steel cell with the potential to flux a desired gaseous mixture inside it and fill the cell with the desired gas mixture. Four wedged optical windows opens on the lateral surface and needs to allow the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration inside by means of a Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) system. The cell is topped by a BOROFLOAT uncoated window to collect the light from the stellar simulator. The cell has been characterized in void and oxygen and carbon dioxide detecting limits have been found. During the experiment, bacteria have been grown in white light conditions at for 24 days at 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s and at 30 °C {{in order to understand the}} growth times and the behaviour in optimal conditions. After that, a new growth experiment have been performed by growing both cyanobacteria species at 30 °C and 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s and oxymetric measurements have been done after 6 days from the culture start, thus during their exponential growth phases. Then, for the main part of the experiment, eight samples have been used. Two samples of Cyanobacterium aponinum have been grown at 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s in white light for 6 days and then at 100 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for the residual 3 days in white light. Two samples of Chlorogloeopsis fritschii have been grown at 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for 6 days in white light and then at 100 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for the residual 3 days in white light. Two samples of Cyanobacterium aponinum have been grown at 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for 6 days in white light and then at 100 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for the residual 3 days using the radiation spectrum of an M 7 type star. Two samples of Chlorogloeopsis fritschii have been grown at 20 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for 6 days in white light and then at 100 micromol photons/m^ 2 /s for the residual 3 days using the radiation spectrum of an M 7 type star. The temperature has been kept at 30 °C for the samples not exposed to M 7 light and at a temperature oscillating from 35 °C to 38 °C for the samples exposed to M 7 light. The higher environmental temperature under the stellar simulator has been due to the over-heating of the LEDs.

The evolution of nectaries in late Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.|$|R
5000|$|Measurement of {{the effects}} of {{electromagnetic}} radiation became a field of study as early as the end of 18th century. Measurement techniques varied depending on the effects under study and gave rise to different nomenclature. The total heating effect of infrared radiation as measured by thermometers led to development of radiometric units in terms of total energy and power. Use of the human eye as a detector led to photometric units, weighted by the eye's response characteristic. Study of the chemical effects of ultraviolet <b>radiation</b> <b>led</b> to characterization by the total dose or actinometric units expressed in photons per second.|$|R
