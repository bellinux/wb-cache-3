Flinn said that Meyer [...] "was in an optimistic mood", and the director suggested that Kirk quote Peter Pan for the last lines: [...] "Second star to the right, and straight on till morning." [...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation. We raised a glass of champagne, but everybody was actually a little antsy." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{intended}} for release in October 2012, Richard delayed Goldenhearts release after signing a distribution deal with independent company Altavoz Distribution, which would release physical copies to retailers, {{and provide a}} wider marketing reach. The album's lead single, [...] "'86", was released as a digital download on September 26. Goldenheart was released in the United States on January 15, 2013. Richard released the album independently, as she felt record labels were [...] "taking a bit <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> want". It sold 3,000 copies in its first week and debuted at number 137 on the Billboard 200, number 2 on the Top Heatseekers Albums, and number 68 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums. The album also {{reached the top of}} the iTunes Store's R chart, which prompted music retailer f.y.e. to preemptively release its physical CD.|$|E

"Wind It Up", the album's lead single, {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics {{for its use}} of yodeling and an interpolation of The Sound of Music, but was moderately successful, peaking inside the top 10 in the US and the UK. The title track was well received and was a major success, reaching the top 10 in over 15 nations, including number two peaks in the US, Australia and the UK. To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; [...] "4 in the Morning", [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] which featured Damian Marley and [...] "Early Winter". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated {{that she had no}} plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, [...] "That was a moment in time... It went on a little <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> all thought it would, because it was inspired and you have to go with wherever you're at in that time in your life... But everything works out how it should." ...|$|E

It has taken way <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> would have ever imagined but we're just not done with it yet." [...] Additionally, he mentioned that the album was Mutemath's first album which involved collaboration among all four members of the band.|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2009, Charles Pratt, Jr., head {{writer of}} the series, was interviewed by TV Guide about the Reese and Bianca relationship. After saying {{he felt he had}} longer to tell the love story and {{that it could have been}} better told if not for Riegel {{temporarily}} departing as Bianca, Pratt was viewed by fans and critics as blaming Riegel for the failure of the storyline. [...] "I was led to believe we had her for <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> <b>we</b> really did — suddenly I got word that Eden is leaving now," [...] stated Pratt. [...] "We got to play everything we wanted to with Bianca and Reese but not in the time we’d hoped for — in my mind, it was a two-year story. I guess I could have rushed to the wedding earlier so that they’d have had more time together as a married couple and then had them break up, but I think the fans would have been even more unsatisfied with that." ...|$|E
