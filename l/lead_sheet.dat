25|$|A long Latin {{inscription}} of {{the first}} century BC, engraved in a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> and accompanying the sacrifice of a filly and the votive gift of a cauldron, was found in 1887 at Rom, Deux-Sèvres, the Roman Rauranum. Olmsted reads the inscription as invoking the goddess with an archaic profusion of epithets: Eponina 'dear little Epona', Atanta 'horse-goddess', Potia 'powerful Mistress' (compare Greek Potnia), Dibonia (Latin, the 'good goddess')", Catona 'of battle', noble and good Vovesia. However, Olmsted's interpretation has not been generally accepted by other scholars; Meid interprets the same inscription as an invocation of Dibona in vulgar Greek for aid in a romantic dispute.|$|E

25|$|This mound, called Knockinglaw on the 1896 OS, {{still exists}} in very poor condition, near Little Onthank. It was a tumulus in which urns had been found. It had a powder {{magazine}} built into it at one stage and was eventually effectively removed altogether. It {{is involved in}} one of the versions of the stories of the killing of Lord Soulis. He {{is said to have been}} killed here in 1444 after leading a band of English mercenaries into the Kilmarnock area and then subsequently suffering a rout at the hands of the Boyd's of Dean Castle. Dean Castle at one time belonged to the De Soulis family. A memorial stone, dating from at least 1609, to Lord Soulis is to be found set into a wall at the High Church, by the railway viaduct. A brass plaque with details of the De Soulis coat of arms used to be set into the road near this spot. The Soulis Cross was in Soulis Street, but is now housed in the Dick Institute. A notorious Lord Soulis is linked with the evil redcaps at Hermitage Castle in the Borders. He could only be bound by a three-stranded rope of sand, but they got over the problem of hanging him by binding him in a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> and boiling himn to death for the murder of the Laird of Branxholm. Robertson points out that the coat of arms of the De Soulis & De Morville families is identical and they may therefore have been related. The De Soulis family lost their lands due to their involvement in 'The Soulis Plot' to depose Robert the Bruce. The family were unsuccessful claimants to the throne of Scotland.|$|E

Despite his suggestion the previous day, all of the compositions used were brought by Ellington. For each piece, according to Roach, he and Mingus were given [...] "a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> that just gave the basic melody and harmony", plus a visual image described by the pianist: one example was, [...] "crawling around on the streets are serpents who have their heads up; these are agents {{and people who have}} exploited artists.

500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had a fine, natural understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. He did, however, learn to follow a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> during a performance by [...] "carefully following the patterns and groupings of notes arranged on the page" [...] and made his own notations to the music, using his ear to detect semi-tonal differences. Granata states that some of the most accomplished classically trained musicians soon noticed his musical understanding, and remarked that Sinatra had a [...] "sixth sense", which [...] "demonstrated unusual proficiency when it came to detecting incorrect notes and sounds within the orchestra". Sinatra was an aficionado of classical music, and would often request classical strains in his music, inspired by composers such as Puccini and Impressionist masters. His personal favorite was Ralph Vaughan Williams. [...] He would insist on always recording live with the band because it gave him a [...] "certain feeling" [...] to perform live surrounded by musicians. By the mid 1940s, such was his understanding of music that after hearing an air check of some compositions by Alec Wilder which were for strings and woodwinds, he became the conductor at Columbia Records for six of Wilder's compositions: [...] "Air for Oboe", [...] "Air for English Horn", [...] "Air for Flute", [...] "Air for Bassoon", [...] "Slow Dance" [...] and [...] "Theme and Variations". The works, which combine elements of jazz and classical music, were considered by Wilder to have been among the finest renditions and recordings of his compositions, past or present. At one recording session with arranger Claus Ogerman and an orchestra, Sinatra heard [...] "a couple of little strangers" [...] in the string section, prompting Ogerman to make corrections to what were thought to be copyist's errors. Critic Gene Lees, a lyricist {{and the author of the}} words to the Jobim melody [...] "This Happy Madness", expressed amazement when he heard Sinatra's recording of it on Sinatra & Company (1971), considering him to have delivered the lyrics to perfection.|$|E
2500|$|Power chords {{played on}} a heavily {{distorted}} and loudly amplified electric guitar are a foundational part of the sound and impact of heavy metal music and hardcore punk. Power chords are also used, though less commonly, on other instruments, such as Hammond organ in a traditional heavy metal genre (e.g., Deep Purple) or electric bass in heavy metal or grunge. In hard rock and heavy metal, in some cases where there are rapid chord changes in a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet,</b> these will be interpreted as power chords, {{even if they are}} not notated in [...] "C5"-style notation. For example, in the following chord progression, [...] "C ///|F///|G///|C B B A", if a fast tempo was played, many hard rock or heavy metal guitarists would play the [...] "C B Bb A" [...] measure as power chords. In other cases, a rock guitarist may decide to interpret a several bar reiteration of what appears notated on the <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> as a major or minor chord (e.g., C Maj or C min) as C5, for the raw, stark effect that a power chord provides.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{genres of}} popular music, {{including}} jazz, pop, and rock, a chord {{name and the}} corresponding symbol are typically composed {{of one or more}} parts.

2500|$|In 1930, he took {{a studio}} at 22 Minetta Lane, and a {{residence}} at 1 Washington Place, in Greenwich Village. [...] While in New York, he continued to innovate and developed a technique known as [...] "Beaten Lead" [...] which involved the creation of three-dimensional sculptures from one-quarter inch thick sheets of lead. His process involved suspending a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> from the ceiling with clamps, and using ball peen hammers to work {{both sides of the}} sheet simultaneously. During this year he also created his first beaten lead portrait from life, Portrait of Jolas, and had solo exhibitions at the Arts Club of Chicago, and the 56th Street Gallery in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stopping}} of {{the accompaniment}} creates a contrast for the listener. It can also enable the songwriter to do a modulation {{to a new}} key during the [...] "No Chord" [...] period, as the lack of chords and bassline can free the composer to shift to a different key. If the composer did not write [...] "No Chord", the chord-playing instrumentalists and the bassist might think that the last indicated chord should be continued, {{as one of the}} conventions of <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> writing is that if the same chord (often the tonic or [...] "I" [...] chord) is repeated for a number of measures, the arranger does not have to keep writing [...] "C Major" [...] in every bar.|$|E
2500|$|In {{popular and}} jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and {{characters}} indicating their qualities. For example, a <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. [...] In {{many types of}} music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with [...] "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval {{in relation to the}} bass. Typically, in the classical common practice period a dissonant chord (chord with tension) [...] "resolves" [...] to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between [...] "tense" [...] and [...] "relaxed" [...] moments.|$|E

50|$|A diminished triad {{consists}} of two superposed minor thirds, and thus contains a diminished fifth. In classical repertoire the usual symbol is the degree, °, as in vii°. In <b>lead</b> <b>sheets</b> and popular music books it is usually written Cdim or C°.|$|R
2500|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} jazz and blues is the {{extensive use of}} Seventh chords. In jazz, any chord indicated in a chord chart or fakebook may be interpreted with an added seventh, according to the discretion and musical instincts of the chord-playing musicians. For example, for a jazz song in the key of C, if the opening chord indicates [...] "C" [...] or [...] "C Major", a jazz guitarist accompanying the singer may add the major seventh. For jazz-style blues progressions, any major chords may be played as dominant seventh chords. For example, if a jazz musician sees the turnaround I VI/ii V written as C A/d min G in a fakebook, she will typically interpret this as C7 A7/d min7 G7. This typical interpretation means that if a composer wishes a jazz comping musician to play a simple triad (for artistic reasons or effect), this usually must be explicit in the <b>lead</b> <b>sheet</b> or part. For example, if a song in the key of C has a chord labelled [...] "G", if the composer wishes that a simple triad be played (the notes G, B, and D), she may write G (triad only) or G (no 7).|$|E
2500|$|Following the formalising of sovereignty, {{organised}} {{and structured}} flow of migrants from Great Britain and Ireland began. Government-chartered ships like the clipper [...] Gananoque and the Glentanner carried immigrants to New Zealand. Typically clipper ships left British ports such as London and travelled south through the central Atlantic to about 43 degrees south {{to pick up}} the strong westerly winds that carried the clippers [...] well south of South Africa and Australia. Ships would then head north once in the vicinity of New Zealand. The Glentanner migrant ship of 610 tonnes made two runs to New Zealand and several to Australia carrying 400 tonne of passengers and cargo. Travel time was about 3 to 3 1/2 months to New Zealand. Cargo carried on the Glentanner for New Zealand included coal, slate, <b>lead</b> <b>sheet,</b> wine, beer, cart components, salt, soap and passengers' personal goods. On the 1857 passage the ship carried 163 official passengers, most of them government assisted. On the return trip the ship carried a wool cargo worth 45,000 pounds. [...] In the 1860s discovery of gold started a gold rush in Otago. By 1860 more than 100,000 British and Irish settlers lived throughout New Zealand. The Otago Association actively recruited settlers from Scotland, creating a definite Scottish influence in that region, while the Canterbury Association recruited settlers from the south of England, creating a definite English influence over that region.|$|E
