5000|$|In May 1954, KOOL-TV {{took over}} <b>channel</b> <b>10</b> full-time, after Autry paid $200,000 for KOY-TV's {{share of the}} operation; {{it was the first}} time that a post-freeze shared-time {{arrangement}} was ended. It lost the ABC affiliation when KTVK (channel 3) signed on in February 1955, <b>leaving</b> <b>channel</b> <b>10</b> as an exclusive CBS affiliate; as a result, it was now able to feature Autry's show Gene Autry's Melody Ranch on its schedule. Tom Chauncey, who also owned the biggest Arabian horse ranch in Phoenix, was a minority partner with Autry. Over the years, KOOL-TV ran nearly the entire CBS schedule, along with some first-run syndicated shows and local shows including daily newscasts and the first bilingual kids' weekly TV show called [...] "Ninos Contentos" [...] hosted by Kathy Shayna Shocket for a decade, The hour show was replaced by Pee Wee Herman show when the station was sold by Tom Chauncey to Gulf Broadcasting.|$|R

40|$|Maize plants (Zea mays L. cv. NK Perform) {{were exposed}} to O 3 -enriched air, using a new field {{fumigation}} system. Transcriptional changes for three type II-metacaspase genes were studied in the <b>leaves</b> (ranks <b>10</b> and 12), using quantitative real-time PCR. Global metacaspase activity was measured using metacaspasespecific synthetic tripeptide Boc-GRR-AMC. Aging {{had little effect on}} mRNA accumulation whereas four to six-fold increases were observed for the most O 3 -responsive type II metacaspase genes, in the older <b>leaves</b> <b>10.</b> Global metacaspase activity increased by 257 % and 333 % in <b>leaves</b> 12 and <b>10,</b> respectively, in response to the highest cumulated concentration.
