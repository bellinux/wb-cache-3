5|$|By {{this time}} {{construction}} of the MR extension from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Aylesbury was underway, and on 1 July 1891 the MR absorbed the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway.

On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Verney Junction. The MR embarked on upgrading and rebuilding stations along the line.|$|E
5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant main-line termini in around 1840. Construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 Edward Watkin (1819–1901) was appointed its Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from Manchester via <b>London</b> <b>to</b> an intended Channel Tunnel and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations {{to take control of the}} A and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Aylesbury and the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a through route from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor: although still an extremely roundabout route, this scheme would have formed the shortest route from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic, and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did, however, receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.|$|E

He also proposed to extend a short rail branch which ran from the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway to the small town of Brill, known as the Brill Tramway, southwest to Oxford, and thus create a through route from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor, and although still an extremely roundabout route, had the scheme been completed it would have formed the shortest route from <b>London</b> <b>to</b> Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon.
