Minimum Hellinger {{distance}} and related {{methods have been}} shown to simultaneously possess first order asymptotic efficiency and attractive robustness proper-ties (Beran 1997; Simpson 1987, 1989 a; Lindsay 1994). It has been noted, however, that these minimum divergence procedures are generally associated with unbounded influence functions, a property considered undesirable in traditional robust procedures. Lindsay has demonstrated the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> function approach in this case. Following Lindsay’s outlier stability approach, we show in this paper that there exists a similar out-lier resistance property for the corresponding tests of hypotheses, and that this outlier resistance property leads to some useful and interesting results for the estimators and the corresponding tests of hypotheses for the generalized Hellinger divergence family (Simpson 1989 b; Basu et al., 1997) in discrete models...|$|R

The <b>limitation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> managers’ actions have in the organisational context is discussed. However, an important characteristic of the manager as a formal leader is also incorporated in this; leaders are able to reduce the equivocality of their followers and together with their followers they can construct new meanings by acting together. An important conclusion is that managers may become more effective in change processes when they are willing to step into the role of sensegivers...|$|R

Emerging research indicates that modifiable factors besides IOP may be associated with the presence of glaucoma.

Preliminary studies suggest that associations may exist between these non-inherent factors and glaucoma although research had significant <b>limitations.</b> The mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>influence</b> are unknown or understudied.

I have serious doubts, if a objectivism understood like that is possible at all, and if the scholars mentioned here do fulfill that requirement in their own research. In my own considerations I present arguments which incline such doubts. On the other hand I have no doubts, that secuarization might be and should be linked to rationalization and Weber’s approach is still a model worth to follow...|$|R

The scientific study of religion has important cultural consequences which can be seen as side effects of scientific research. Among them, one can point out changes of religiosity; disturbance of the balance between the institutionalized scientific-technological approach to the world and a tendency to search a deeper meaning of existence which realizes itself in religion; orientation towards instrumental values instead of ultimate ones; the main-tenance of the dominant focus on what is here and now instead of on transcendence.

[URL] United States’ {{experience}} with the Ebola virus in 2014 provides a window into US public health politics. First, the US provided {{a case study in}} the role of suasion and executive action in the management of public health in a fragmented multi-level system.

Second, the politics of Ebola in the US is a case study in the politics of partisan blame attribution. The outbreak struck in the run-up to an election that was likely to be good for the Republican party, and the election dominated interest in and opinions of Ebola in both the media and public opinion. Democratic voters and media downplayed Ebola while Republican voters and media focused on the outbreak. The media was a key conduit for this strategic politicization, as shown in the quantity, timing, and framing of news about Ebola. Neither fragmentation nor partisanship appears to be going away, so understanding the politics of public health crises will remain important...|$|R
5000|$|Part of the puzzlement here {{is because}} <b>of</b> the <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> imagination: <b>influenced</b> by his Princeton colleague, Saul Kripke, Nagel {{believes}} that any type identity statement that identified a physical state type with a mental state type would be, if true, necessarily true. But Kripke argues {{that one can}} easily imagine a situation where, for example, one's C-fibres are stimulated but one is not in pain and so refute any such psychophysical identity from the armchair. (A parallel argument does not hold for genuine theoretical identities.) This argument that {{there will always be}} an explanatory gap between an identification of a state in mental and physical terms is compounded, Nagel argues, by the fact that imagination operates in two distinct ways. When asked to imagine sensorily, one imagines C-fibres being stimulated; if asked to imagine sympathetically, one puts oneself in a conscious state resembling pain. These two ways of imagining the two terms of the identity statement are so different that there will always seem to be an explanatory gap, {{whether or not this is}} the case. (Some philosophers of mind have taken these arguments as helpful for physicalism on the grounds that it exposes a limitation that makes the existence of an explanatory gap seem compelling, while others have argued that this makes the case for physicalism even more impossible as it cannot be defended even in principle.) ...|$|R

DECD countries' pharmaceutical reimbursement systems achieve this task {{through a number of}} institutions some of which use Health Technology Assessment (HTA) including health economic analysis to inform decision-making. The reimbursement decisions influence the health outcomes of patients, produce signals of the demand curve to manufacturers and may have political consequences. The overall aim of this thesis is to examine the use of health economic analysis in DECD countries' reimbursement systems and the contribution of health economic analysis and other factors to decision-making. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of previous quantitative and qualitative studies examining the factors contributing to reimbursement decision-making in DECD countries. The review identified limited evidence for comparisons across DECD countries and outlined the methodological <b>limitations</b> <b>of</b> identifying <b>influence.</b> Chapters 3 and 4 categorise DECD reimbursement systems using a published framework. Application of the framework identified that Health Economic analysis is used by agencies operating in heterogeneous reimbursement systems with respect to the objectives, other institutions, processes, guidelines, interpretation and other factors considered alongside health economic analysis. Chapter 5 uses regression analysis to examine decisions by those agencies that similarly use clinical evidence and health economic analysis, and identifies common factors across four countries. Chapter 6 uses a qualitative methodology to match decisions for an agency using health economic analysis in comparison to one not and found evidence <b>of</b> the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> health economic analysis alongside other evidence and process factors.
