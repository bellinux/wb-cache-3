40|$|Namaqualand is a {{semi-desert}} area {{situated in}} the winter rainfall region of South Africa hosting the world’s richest succulent flora, {{and is one of}} only two arid areas to classify as a global hotspot of biodiversity. The Goegap Nature Reserve, east of Springbok, lies in the Upland Succulent Karoo. After all the livestock were removed and the reserve fenced in 1969, a long-term monitoring project was initiated to record possible vegetation changes under the reduced grazing pressure. The first monitoring was done in 1974 when two <b>line</b> <b>transects,</b> of 1 km each, were surveyed. These surveys have been repeated annually covering a period of more than 30 years. When the reserve was enlarged in 1990, five additional <b>line</b> <b>transects</b> were set out in highly degraded areas. The main aim of this study was therefore to determine whether any changes in the vegetation in terms of species composition, species richness and life form richness in the monitored <b>line</b> <b>transects</b> could be detected. Rainfall as possible force driving these changes was also examined. It was found that changes did indeed take place in the vegetation. The species composition revealed notable changes over the entire monitored period, specifically in the two longest established <b>line</b> <b>transects,</b> whereas {{in the case of the}} species richness changes were also detected, but to a lesser extent and not notable in terms of an overall increase or decrease in the number of species. These changes are referred to as fluctuations. Rainfall can be regarded as a definite environmental driving force, with the time, intensity and duration of importance, specifically to the annual species composition. Overall, the veld condition improved and continuous monitoring of the <b>line</b> <b>transects</b> on a regular basis should take place to improve our understanding of the complex dynamics of this ecosystem. Because the changes in species composition are reflected in changes in grazing capacity the results are of direct importance to the management of the wildlife on the reserve.

50|$|Lindeberg was son of {{a teacher}} at the Helsinki Polytechnical Institute and at an early age showed {{mathematical}} talent and interest. The family was well off and later Jarl Waldemar would prefer to be a reader than a full professor. Lindeberg's career centred on the University of Helsinki. His early interests were in partial differential equations and the calculus of variations but from 1920 he worked in probability and statistics. In 1920 he published his first paper on the central limit theorem. His result was similar to that obtained earlier by Lyapunov whose work he did not then know. However, their approaches were quite different; Lindeberg's was based on a convolution argument while Lyapunov used the characteristic function. Two years later Lindeberg used his method to obtain a stronger result: the so-called Lindeberg condition. His work on probability led to him becoming involved in applied fields. He developed what we know as Kendall's τ and he found the first two moments of its sampling distribution. Lindeberg used <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> methods in forestry, and when in 1926 determining the necessary number of transects to obtain a sufficiently precise confidence interval, he seems to have rediscovered Student's t-distribution.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Adaptive <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> {{sampling}} {{offers the}} pot,ential of improved population density estimation efficiency over conventional <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> sampling when populations are spatially clustered. In adaptive sampling, survey effort is increased when areas of high animal density are located, thereby {{increasing the number}} of observations. Its disadvantage is that the survey effort required is not known in advance. We develop an adaptive <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> methodology that, by varying the degree of adaptation, allows total effort to be fixed at the design stage. Relative to conventional <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> surveys, it also provides better survey coverage in the event of disruption in survey effort, e. g., due to poor weather. In analysis, sightings from the adaptive sections are downweighted in proportion to the increase in effort. We evaluate the methodology by simulation and report on surveys of harbor porpoise in the Gulf of Maine, in which the approach was compared with conventional <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> sampling.

After {{critically}} reviewing {{developments in}} <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> estimation theory to date, general likelihood functions are derived {{for the case}} in which detection probabilities are modelled as functions of any number of explanatory variables and detection of animals on the trackline (i. e. directly in the observer's path) is not certain. Existing models are shown to correspond to special cases of the general models. Maximum likelihood estimators are derived for some special cases of the general model and some existing <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> estimators are shown to correspond to maximum likelihood estimators for other special cases. The likelihoods are shown to be extensions of existing mark-recapture likelihoods {{as well as being}} generalizations of existing <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> likelihoods. Two new abundance estimators are developed. The first is a Horvitz-Thompson-like estimator which utilizes the fact that for point estimation of abundance the density of perpendicular distances in the population can be treated as known in appropriately designed <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> surveys. The second is based on modelling the probability density function of detection probabilities in the population.

40|$|By {{combining}} double-count and line-transect sampling data {{we obtained}} estimates of animal and group densities. The sample design consists of flying aerial surveys along elevational contours with two {{observers in the}} same platform searching the same region {{on one side of}} the airplane.

40|$|<b>Line</b> <b>transect</b> data {{obtained}} from 'platforms of opportunity' are useful for the monitoring of long term trends in dolphin populations which occur over vast areas, yet analyses of such data axe problematic due to violation of fundamental assumptions of <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> methodology. In this thesis we develop methods which allow estimates of dolphin relative abundance to be obtained when certain assumptions of <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> sampling are violated. Generalised additive models are used to model encounter rate and mean school size {{as a function of}} spatially and temporally referenced covariates. The estimated relationship between the response and the environmental and locational covariates is then used to obtain a predicted surface for the response over the entire survey region. Given those predicted surfaces, a density surface can then be obtained and an estimate of abundance computed by numerically integrating over the entire survey region. This approach is particularly useful when search effort is not random, in which case standard <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> methods would yield biased estimates. Estimates of f (0) (the inverse of the effective strip (half-) width), an essential component of the <b>line</b> <b>transect</b> estimator, may also be biased due to heterogeneity in detection probabilities. We developed a conditional likelihood approach in which covariate effects are directly incorporated into the estimation procedure. Simulation results indicated that the method performs well in the presence of size-bias. When multiple covariates are used, it is important that covariate selection be carried out. As an example we applied the methods described above to eastern tropical Pacific dolphin stocks. However, uncertainty in stock identification has never been directly incorporated into methods used to obtain estimates of relative or absolute abundance. Therefore we illustrate an approach in which trends in dolphin relative abundance axe monitored by small areas, rather than stocks...|$|E

Two survey methods were used: <b>line</b> <b>transects</b> during 5 d and strip transects during 15 d. The <b>line</b> <b>transects</b> were used to estimate the abundance of both species in the main channels of the Amazon at distances greater than 200 m from river banks and islands, and strip transects were used to estimate abundance {{in the remainder of}} the habitat. A total of 29 sightings was obtained using <b>line</b> <b>transects,</b> including 8 of Inia, 15 of Sotalia, and 6 with both species present. The total number of sightings made while using strip transects was 143, including 78 of Inia, 51 of Sotalia, and 14 with both species present. The distributions of sightings with respect to distance from the nearest bank were not significantly different between the two species.
