A {{sequential}} {{light and}} electron microscopic {{study of the}} <b>exorbital</b> and Harderian <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> was done on 2. 5 - to 15 -month-old Wistar rats exposed to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus. Typical coronaviral particles were readily demonstrated in cytoplasmic vesicles of Harderian and <b>exorbital</b> <b>glands</b> examined at 6 days post-inoculation. Lesions were seen in a relatively high percentage of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> in infected animals of all ages, with no obvious age-related variations in the incidence and extent of changes. Lesions frequently persisted for a longer interval post-exposure in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> than in salivary glands. The persistence of lesions commonly seen in Harderian glands was attributed, at least in part, to the cytotoxic effects of porphyrin-containing secretions released during the acute necrotizing stages of the disease. The persistence of lesions in some <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> indicates that they are useful tissues for microscopic examination for the retrospective provisional diagnosis of SDA. Persistent lesions also indicate that normal functions of these glands may be compromised for up to several weeks following outbreaks of SDA.

40|$|Androgens {{are known}} to {{regulate}} the level of secretory component (SC) in tears of male rats. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to explore the underlying mechanism of this hormone action by (i) identifying the ocular tissue(s) involved in SC production; and (ii) determining whether androgens increase SC production by this tissue. We also examined whether androgen administration influenced the concentration of SC in tears of female rats. Ocular tissues from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured in the presence or absence of cycloheximide in the incubation medium. Secretory component in the culture media was measured by an RIA which detects primarily free SC. Analysis of media obtained after incubation of <b>exorbital</b> (<b>lacrimal)</b> <b>glands,</b> 'lid' tissues, globes, and Harderian glands revealed that only <b>exorbital</b> <b>glands</b> released substantial amounts of SC. This <b>exorbital</b> <b>gland</b> production of SC, which was significantly greater in tissues from male rats, as compared to those of female rats, was reduced by approximately 50 % when cycloheximide was present in the culture medium. To determine whether SC production by <b>exorbital</b> <b>glands</b> was influenced by androgens, orchiectomized glands was influenced by androgens, orchiectomized rats were administered either saline or testosterone (2. 0 mg/day for 4 days), and <b>exorbital</b> <b>glands</b> were cultured 24 hr after the last injection. Testosterone treatment in vivo induced a significant, cycloheximide-sensitive increase in SC production in vitro, compared to the glandular SC output of saline-injected controls. It is interesting that similar androgen treatment of ovariectomized females also resulted in elevated tear SC concentrations and enhanced output of SC by their <b>exorbital</b> <b>glands</b> in vitro. These findings indicate that the <b>exorbital</b> <b>gland</b> is primarily responsible for SC production in the rat eye and that androgens may modulate the synthesis of SC in this gland...|$|R
40|$|The afferent nerves of {{the cornea}} and conjunctiva, efferent nerves of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland,</b> and the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> are a {{functional}} unit that works cooperatively {{to produce the}} aqueous component of tears.

No one mechanism is known to induce the changes that occur with aging, although multiple different mechanisms have been associated with aging. These fall into two theoretical categories: programmed theories of aging (immunological, genetic, apoptotic, and neuroendocrine) and error theories of aging (protein alteration, somatic mutation, etc). <b>Lacrimal</b> <b>glands</b> undergo structural and functional alteration with increasing age.

In vivo studies revealed that antibodies against VCAM- 1, Î± 4 integrin, PNAd, L-selectin, or LFA- 1 almost completely blocked lymphocyte migration from blood into inflamed <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> There was no inhibition of migration by antibodies against mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule- 1 or Î± 4 Î² 7 integrin. These results indicate that endothelial/lymphocyte adhesion cascades involving VCAM- 1 /Î± 4 Î² 1 integrin, PNAd/L-selectin, and LFA- 1 control the migration of lymphocytes into inflamed <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland.</b> These adhesion molecules offer potential therapeutic targets to block the development of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> inflammation and destruction...|$|R
30|$|<b>Lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> tumours are {{classified}} as epithelial and non-epithelial lesions. <b>Lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> epithelial tumours are similar to salivary gland tumours and constitute 40 â 50 Â % of all lacrimal masses. Half of these are benign mixed tumours (BMT), while the other half are malignant masses. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) {{is the most common}} <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> malignancy, followed by carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma, adenocarcinoma, and mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Lymphoma, inflammatory conditions, and non-carcinomatous metastases constitute the non-epithelial lesions.|$|R
40|$|Pleomorphic adenoma is {{the most}} common {{epithelial}} neoplasm of <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland.</b> A clear cell myoepithelial carcinoma arising in the background of pleomorphic adenoma is common in the salivary glands but very rare in the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>glands.</b> We report the case of a 27 year old man whose <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> pleomorphic adenoma recurred several times over a period of four years and ultimately evolved into a clear cell myoepithelial carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma...|$|R

Although many diseases that affect the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> and fossa are specifically diagnosed by imaging, it is frequently very difficult to differentiate each specific disease on the basis of image characteristics alone due to intrinsic similarities. In <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> epithelial tumors, benign pleomorphic adenomas are seen most commonly with a well defined benign appearance, and a malignant adenoid cystic carcinoma is seen with a typical invasive malignant appearance. However, a malignant myoepithelial carcinoma is seen with a benign looking appearance. Lymphomatous lesions of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> include a broad spectrum ranging from reactive hyperplasia to malignant lymphoma. These lesions can be very difficult to differentiate both radiologically and pathologically. Generally, lymphoma...|$|R
40|$|Lymphoma {{involving}} the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> is rare. Most {{of the cases}} are unilateral at presentation. In this case, we present the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with bilateral <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> lymphoma. At presentation, the patient had inferomedial eccentric proptosis of the right eye. The patient also had limitation in the upper and lateral gaze in this eye. On magnetic resonance imaging, a mass was detected {{not only in the}} right but also in the left eye corresponding to the area of the <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland.</b> Excisional biopsy was performed in the right eye with lateral orbitotomy approach. Histopathological examination revealed extranodal marginal zone lymphoma {{involving the}} <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland.</b> No concurrent systemic lymphoma was detected during systemic evaluation of the patient. The patient was directed to the oncology department for systemic treatment planning. In conclusion, bilateral involvement is rare in <b>lacrimal</b> <b>gland</b> diseases but it can show severe diseases like lymphoma...|$|R

Standard upper blepharoplasty and the hooding excision were performed in a female with blepharochalasis.
