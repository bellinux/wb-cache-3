The sinker log crane {{on the west side of}} the shed was sold in 1959 and was later used at Rankine's Peeramon Mill, near Lake Eacham on the Atherton Tablelands, where it currently resides. The disused White's Shed was subsequently leased to mining companies, perhaps as early as the 1960s. The shed was used to store copper concentrate from the Red Dome mine between 1993 and 1997, and was leased to the Dianne Copper Mine prior to this.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Benthic {{samples were}} {{collected}} during the summer, winter and spring seasons from upper Yaquina Estuary, a region used by Georgia- Pacific Corporation for log dumping and storage. Samples came from an active log dump and storage areas as well as areas not associated with <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> activity. The samples were analyzed for total macrofauna (> 1. 0 mm) and sediment parameters. One of the sediment parameters measured was total organic or volatile solids which {{was used as an}} indicator of bark deposits. Diversity indices were calculated on total macrofauna collected during the three sampling periods and on the polychaete and crustacean subgroups. A similarity index was also calculated for all combinations of summer sampling stations. Multiple regression analysis of diversity with seven sediment parameters and water depth was generally insignificant. The trends in total summer macrofauna and crustacean diversities showed an increase in diversity with increasing volatile solids. A similar increase was noted in the summer macrofauna density. Winter and spring macrobenthic diversities were not significantly correlated to any of the parameters measured. Although population densities generally declined during these two seasons there was a positive correlation of density with water depth. This indicates that organisms associated with the more saline bottom waters were protected from severe osmotic stresses caused by the overlying river water. The results of the summer similarity analysis showed four groups of highly similar stations. Two groups were in fairly coarse sandy sediment, while the other two were in finer sand and silt sediments, One group of the latter two was associated exclusively with the <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> areas. The results indicate that bark debris in Yaquina Estuary did not result in decreased diversity or density of macrofauna but seem to result somewhat in an altered species type.

Bark and wood properties were measured from discs collected at multiple heights from sampled trees and used to compute the whole-tree bark and wood properties. Significant regional variation was observed for both bark and wood properties. Bark thickness and bark percentage decreased with stem height and were positively correlated with proximity to the ocean (possibly related to temperature), tree age, and DBH. Bark and wood basic density showed an increasing trend from inland to coastal regions and vice versa for bark and wood MC.

However, users may still experience some overhead of an overloaded OpenStack caused by too many legitimate users. This situation might be representative of the fact that the supporting infrastructure is not properly dimensioned, which would fall outside of the scope of our solution. Regarding the proposed solution with respect to a larger number of users, the effectiveness and efficiency should be affected because more checks need to be performed during run-time, and these should affect the performance when mitigating an insider attack. Nevertheless, our experiments have shown that our solution based on self-adaptation is scalable since the response time has increased linearly with the number of users. Equally, since we employed a simple log analysis looking at each line of log, it is expected that the memory consumption to increase.

40|$|The study {{determined}} {{the performance of}} industrial firewood processing operations under the typical work conditions of Southern Europe. In particular, we surveyed five commercial operations processing 1 -m-long oak logs from coppice forests. Mean log volume was very small, {{in the range of}} 0. 01 to 0. 02 m 3 solid. Machine utilization was quite high, ranging from 70 to 80 percent. Mechanical availability was excellent, always exceeding 90 percent of the total worksite time. Productivity varied between 1. 4 and 4. 9 m 3 per scheduled machine hour (SMH), inclusive of all delays. Processing cost ranged from 26 to 44 €/m 3. The largest machine in the group offered significant productivity and cost benefits over all the others. Owing to their multiple <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> capacity, firewood processors designed for Southern Europe may be less sensitive to log volume, compared with Nordic machines. The energy balance was always very favorable. The ratio between output and input was never smaller than 220 and peaked at 327. That was much higher than recorded for small-scale firewood processors, and it may depend on the use of more efficient electric motors compared with diesel engines. However, the main advantage of industrial firewood processors is production capacity and operator comfort and safety. This allows business growth, {{in the face of a}} very large market and a decreasing availability of skilled labor.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{was to develop a}} gate-to-gate life cycle {{inventory}} for the production of framing lumber from logs in western Oregon and Washington. Dimension lumber and studs are used in the framing of residential structures. A large portion of this type of lumber is Douglas-fir or hemlock. The functional unit is the sawmill complex which produces planed dry lumber from logs. This includes <b>log</b> <b>handling,</b> sawing, drying, planing, and generating steam for the dryer. The system boundary begins with the logs entering the mill complex and ends with products (lumber) or co-products (chips, sawdust, shavings, bark, hog fuel) leaving the mill complex. The burdens for all substances and energy are allocated among the products and co-products based on dry mass. This report is intended for use in developing life cycle inventories for various construction practices in residential housing. Four mills which produced dimension lumber as a primary product were surveyed according to the CORRIM research guidelines. One of these produced only green lumber, one produced only dry lumber, and the other two produced a combination. The annual total production from these mills was 13 percent of the stud and dimension lumber volume produced in the survey region. The mills provided detailed data about the inputs and outputs to their operations for either calendar year 1999 or 2000. Over 99. 5 % of the material inputs and outputs were collected as primary data. An additional ten mills in the region were sampled to obtain steam production and drying data only.

40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken into storm runoff water quantity and quality, contaminant input to the receiving tidal waters from the Mt. Maunganui wharf, accumulation of potentially toxic resin acids in adjacent sediments, and the dilution of the wharf runoff in the receiving tidal waters, {{in order to}} assess the possible adverse environmental impact associated with the log operation at the Port of Tauranga Ltd. Based upon field data and rainfall records, about a half of the annual precipitation over the <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> areas is converted to surface runoff (117, 000 m³a⁻¹). Annual runoff volume per hectare of wharf surface is estimated as 7, 500 m³ha⁻¹a⁻¹ for the sealed area and 3, 700 m³ha⁻¹a⁻¹ for the gravelled area. The optical quality of the wharf runoff is degraded due to addition of bark and soil particles. The black disk visual clarity (0. 01 - 0. 02 m) was only 0. 5 - 1. 0 % of that in the receiving tidal waters. The wharf runoff appears very dark gray to yellowish brown in apparent colour (10 YR 1 / 3 to 10 YR 5 / 6 Munsell colour chart) and has a soluble yellow substance concentration of about 25 m⁻¹. Power relationships between the traditionally used parameters, for example, suspended solids and turbidity, were identified. The wharf surface pavement types had a significant influence on visual clarity, but little influence on yellow substance concentration. The potentially toxic resin acids in the wharf runoff have been determined with SIM GC-MS. The average total resin acid level (1, 030 ppb) is comparable to that of 1, 000 ppb reported at which acute toxicity is likely to be exhibited. A relationship of resin acids against volatile suspended solids was established. Tests undertaken suggest that conventional treatment methods of natural sedimentation and flocculation-sedimentation are able to remove the resin acids effectively. The levels of biological oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphorus and nitrogen in the wharf runoff are considerably higher than those of common urban runoff. However, the wharf runoff contributes little nitrate nitrogen and oil and grease to the receiving environment. About 87, 500 kg of suspended solids, 43, 000 kg of volatile suspended solids, 14, 200 kg of BOD, 500 kg of phosphorus, and 103 kg of resin acids are discharged to the Tauranga Harbour annually from runoff from the Mt. Maunganui wharf. Analyses show that the impact on adjacent sediments from the storm runoff is limited to a distance of about 100 m from the discharge points and the resin acid levels in the sediments within this distance are not significantly higher compared to that of the storm runoff. The net resin acid accumulation rate in the shipping channel (Stella Passage) beside the <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> areas was estimated to be in the range of 300 to 370 ppb per year. Based on field investigation and numerical simulations, the findings on dispersion and dilution of the wharf runoff in the receiving tidal waters are as follows: (i) the sea water around Stella Passage experiences an obvious natural salinity stratification, the extent of which depends greatly on the weather conditions; (ii) the wind drag stress and the pressure gradient caused by the addition of runoff had the greatest influence on the plume dynamics during the flood tide. The plumes basically remain within the top 2 - 3 m of the water column under different winds; (iii) the plume is unlikely to advect to the Whareroa Marae under strong (30 - 40 knots) easterly or northeasterly winds for a storm with a 5 -year return period. However, there is an obvious influence on the Whareroa Marae under 30 - 40 knot northerly winds; and (iv) the short duration and restricted region of the low dilution pulse of effluent around slack water may explain why there has been no reports of acute toxic events. Sealing the gravel covered wharf area, improving the sweeping efficiency, and extending the present outfalls to the sea floor might be potential options for mitigating the environmental impact associated with discharge of the wharf runoff...|$|E
40|$|Buoyancy {{differences}} between two water bodies can often dominate flows such as stormwater discharge or river plumes {{in the coastal}} environment. The buoyancy difference usually arises {{due to differences in}} salinity, temperature and suspended solids. These flows form plumes or ‘gravity currents’, which can also transport pollutants and nutrients around in the receiving water body. The plume consists of a bulbous head, a mixing region on the tail, and billows behind the head. The form of the head and the plume water properties dictate what kinds of instabilities develop, which in turn influence the degree and manner of mixing that occurs. Additionally, the mixing depends on the local hydrodynamics of the receiving water body. I report observations of the dynamics of a stormwater run-off plume in a strongly tidal estuary, with particular emphasis on investigation of dispersion and dilution processes. The field site for my thesis research is the barrier-enclosed basin of Tauranga Harbour adjacent to the Port of Tauranga wharf in Mount Maunganui. The Port of Tauranga is the largest timber export port in New Zealand. The area has about 20 storm water runoff pipes that discharge into the main tidal channel of the estuary. The <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> produces bark leachates and resin acids, which get discharged during and after rain events. The leachate is responsible for a serious discolouration of the water. Several surveys were undertaken during rain events to measure plume characteristics and these are compared with a similar undertaken during dry conditions. Based on these measurements and visual observations, the plume was estimated to disperse within around four hours as the freshwater was dispersed into a relatively strong tidal flow (maximum speeds of 0. 7 m/s). Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler data and conductivity-temperature-depth data indicated that the maximum across-channel extent of the plume was around 120 m and the maximum along channel extent was around 200 m (for the conditions observed). The plume stability decreases with distance from the source. The plume can be classified as a free buoyant jet or upstream intruding plume. This study will provide inputs into the toxicity assessment of the storm runoff, which will be investigated in a separate project using caged arrays of filter-feeding bivalves to determine the cumulative effects of resin acids and leachates on mussels...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Although one of {{the most}} common {{problems}} facing the forest manager is the determination of management regime, there has been little effort to explicitly recognize the effect of harvesting technology and topography in the analysis. This study introduces a unified theory in harvesting in mountainous terrain which brings together silvicultural method, harvesting technology, product yield, and product price to identify the optimal path through time for a forest stand managed for the objective of maximization of net present worth. Techniques for predicting harvesting costs as a function of the specific diameter distribution to be removed from the stand have not been available. The first part of the research fills this gap by the development of a harvesting simulator for mountainous terrain. Considerable detail is devoted to discussing the validity of model assumptions including log distributions, heuristic rules for log gathering, and cost sensitivity with respect to the shape of the diameter distribution. The harvesting simulator is tested against two detailed time studies of Douglas-fir thinning in mountainous terrain and is found to compare favorably with field observations. To develop the relative harvesting costs for illustration in the stocking level analysis, two skyline yarders typical of the range expected to be operating in second growth Douglas-fir are evaluated using the simulator. Analysis of the harvesting cost results indicates that over the range of values analyzed, the elasticity of harvest cost with respect to volume removed is constant for a given mean diameter of material removed. Costs from the harvest simulator are combined with a Douglas-fir growth model in a three descriptor dynamic programming structure. The potential effects of diameter growth acceleration are modeled through biometric relationships between the three descriptors; stand age, trees per acre, and basal area per acre. The optimal thinning regime and optimal rotation age are determined simultaneously for a medium site Douglas-fir example under a predetermined set of average conditions. The sensitivity of optimal stocking level to harvest technology variables of yarding direction, yarding distance, truck transport cost, and log gathering strategies is examined. Under assumed cost differentials between uphill and downhill yarding, bare land values for downhill yarding are lower than for uphill yarding and the optimal management intensity is lower with less frequent, heavier entries. Increases in yarding cost with distance indicate that optimal stocking levels not only depend on traditional concepts of prices and costs, but that management intensity is also spatially oriented. It is demonstrated that under certain conditions substantial increases in net present worth can be made by treating portions of the stand in the same skyline road and with the same rotation age with different thinning regimes. Haul costs are exogenous to the harvesting cost simulation. However, reductions in haul cost increase bare land values by at least the magnitude of the present value of the haul cost decrease and may increase the optimal level of management intensity. The sensitivity of management regime to log gathering technique is examined by formulating a prebunching model which stratifies the <b>log</b> <b>handling</b> activity into two components. Logs are first gathered into bunches along the skyline corridor, and then the bunches are forwarded up the corridor to roadside. Prebunching and forwarding under the model assumptions is found not only to increase bare land values but in some circumstances to reduce the cost of handling early thinnings sufficiently to justify noncommercial entries to accelerate diameter growth. Constraints eliminating noncommercial thinning opportunities are shown to reduce present value...|$|E
