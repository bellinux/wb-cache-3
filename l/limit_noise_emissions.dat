To exemplify the possible use of such wind schedules in the design of control laws, model-based controllers are formulated in this paper that are capable of performing power curve tracking throughout all wind speeds, in contrast with commonly adopted approaches that use switching controllers to cover the various operating regimes of the machine. The proposed regulation policies and control laws are demonstrated in a high fidelity simulation environment for a representative 3 MW machine...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Brake squeal impacts trains during station parking, {{generating}} over 110 dB at {{the wheel}} vicinity. This disturbance {{is a problem for}} commuters and employees working close to trains and limits exploitation times. The only adjustable parameter is here the brake pad, since it is the only part with frequent replacement regarding the railway equipment lifetimes. To improve current pad design to <b>limit</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> a numerical prototyping tool is required, providing noise level indicators post-treated from transient simulations of industrial brakes. Such realization is impossible without a relevant reduction strategy. The CMT (Component Mode Tuning) method integrated by SDTools makes this feasible. This model reduction is not only necessary to transient simulations but also to reduce the global computational cost of all intermediate operations. In the proposed approach, the pads must be kept unreduced to allow their interchangeability, but invariant brake parts can be reduced. A reduction basis is only relevant if it provides accurate results for various configurations of a reduced parametered model. A study of the system reduction basis sensitivity must be undertaken, which is this paper main objective. A sensitivity study methodology is then proposed and results in the form of reduced model convergence are eventually presented...|$|E

40|$|Improved {{methods for}} {{measuring}} curve squeal and braking noise {{have been proposed}} within the ACOUTRAIN project, intended as input to future standards. In this paper an outline of these methods is given and the underlying considerations are explained. The EU TSI regulation <b>limiting</b> <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of new rail vehicles does not yet specify limits for curve squeal or braking noise, which are both relevant noise sources but not easy to characterise reliably due to their variability. No ISO or EN standard exists for curve squeal. Braking noise {{is included in the}} current EN ISO 3095 noise type testing standard, but the procedure requires improvement in relation to measured quantities. For curve squeal, two methods are proposed, an occurrence test using on board measurements along a route with various curves, and a trackside test for curves or switches. The existing UIC trackside test is taken as basis using the percentage exceedance indicator L 10. For braking noise, improvements to the existing trackside measurement standard are proposed, taking the variety of potential noise sources and their variable position and operating condition into account. The measurement quantity, positioning and braking operation are the main topics. Without proposing limit values, some considerations are put forward that may be taken into account when applying the methods for compliance testing for curve squeal and braking noise...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a successful {{case study of}} noise assessment and abatement for a new racetrack in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The first races at the new facility generated widespread concern about noise. In the absence of applicable noise regulations, the county administration contracted for a noise study to evaluate the impact of racing noise in the adjacent rural community, and to examine appropriate noise abatement strategies. The owner desired a permit {{to increase the number}} of race days over what had been approved, and agreed to <b>limit</b> vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> and enforce the use of mufflers. The noise study evaluated expected community reaction based on Normalized DNL for existing conditions and future conditions with appropriate noise abatement. The study’s abatement recommendations were developed in coordination with the county and the owner, and included <b>noise</b> <b>limits</b> on individual vehicles and noise shielding around the track. The study projected significant average reduction in Normalized DNL in the surrounding community for the future conditions. The owner implemented noise abatement inexpensively, and the county employed noise monitors at two locations.

40|$|On {{high-volume}} roads {{cement concrete}} surfaces may be economically favourable {{in comparison to}} asphalt concrete. When a bypass for motorway E 4 in Uppsala (Sweden) was built, cement concrete was therefore selected as the wearing course. It {{is well known that}} noise characteristics of cement concrete surfaces may be poor unless a suitable texture is created. Earlier, the Swedish Road Administration has used the exposed aggregate technique to create a favourable surface texture on newly laid cement concrete on some motorways in Sweden, with both good and poor results. This time a special aggregate grading of the top layer was selected, attempting to combine the desire to have excellent durability against the wear of studded tyres in winter, and the desire to <b>limit</b> tyre/road <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> from the motorway. Being a bypass, this motorway at some locations run rather near to suburban areas where noise immission might become a serious issue. Noise measurements were made with the CPX method, using four test tyres. The results on the exposed aggregate cement concrete (EACC) were compared with similar measurements on SMA surfaces with the same maximum aggregate size. As a reference for comparison three SMA 0 / 16 were chosen since this is the surface type that would normally be used on a motorway of this kind. The results indicated approx. 2 - 3 dB(A) lower tyre/road <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> on the EACC than on the SMA 0 / 16 which was better than expected. In the paper the probable causes of the relatively low <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> are analyzed. The positive results suggest that with a suitable proportioning of the aggregate in the surface layer and high quality exposure technique, the EACC may be used as a standard technique for texturing of cement concrete...|$|R

This paper presents a review of wind farm noise assessment criteria and methodology with a focus on the South Australian guidelines. The results of this review indicate that the <b>noise</b> <b>limits</b> may not be appropriate for some locations which are characterised by very low background sound levels at night time. The assumption in the guidelines that background noise is capable of reducing annoyance from wind farm noise is also not necessarily borne out in reality. Measurements of the outdoor-to-indoor noise reduction for a typical dwelling, with the window open, show that the reduction is slightly lower than assumed by the guidelines, and varies significantly with frequency. Measured low frequency noise and infrasound complied with all criteria addressed in the literature with the exception of one. Reliable compliance measurements are often difficult to achieve for wind farm noise, therefore it seems appropriate to adopt a conservative approach in setting <b>noise</b> <b>limits</b> and predicting <b>noise</b> <b>emissions.</b> Kristy Hansen, Nicholas Henrys, Colin Hansen, Con Doolan and Danielle Morea...|$|R

Current European legislation aims to <b>limit</b> vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> since many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas. Vehicle pass-by noise is measured {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362 in Europe. More recent investigations of urban traffic have led to the proposal of a revised ISO 362 which includes a constant-speed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} pass-by noise value. In order to meet the legal pass-by noise requirements, vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must analyse and quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the development phase of the vehicle. In addition, predictive tools need to be available for the estimation of the final pass-by noise value. This thesis aims to contribute to the understanding of vehicle pass-by noise and of the characteristics of the vehicle noise sources contributing to pass-by noise. This is supported through an extensive literature review in which current pass-by noise prediction methods are reviewed as well. Furthermore, three vehicle noise sources are replicated experimentally under laboratory conditions. This involves an orifice noise source, represented by a specially designed loudspeaker on a moving trolley, shell noise, represented by a metal cylinder structure, and tyre cavity and sidewall noise, represented by an annular membrane mounted on a tyre-like structure. The experimentally determined directivity characteristics of the acoustically excited noise sources are utilised in the pass-by noise prediction method. The predictive results are validated against experimental measurements of the three vehicle-like noise sources made within an anechoic chamber...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{propulsion}} offers dramatic {{new vehicle}} mission capabilities, not possible with turbine or reciprocating engines; including high reliability and efficiency, low engine weight and maintenance, low cooling drag and volume required, very low noise and vibration, and zero emissions. The only penalizing characteristic of electric propulsion {{is the current}} energy storage technology level, which is set to triple over the next 5 - 10 years through huge new investments in this field. Most importantly, electric propulsion offers incredible new degrees of freedom in aircraft system integration to achieve unprecedented levels of aerodynamic, propulsive, control, and structural synergistic coupling. A unique characteristic of electric propulsion is that the technology is nearly scale-free, permitting small motors to be parallelized for fail-safe redundancy, or distributed across the airframe for tightly coupled interdisciplinary functionality without significant impacts in motor-controller efficiency or specific weight. Maximizing the potential benefit of electric propulsion is dependent on applying this technology to synergistic mission concepts. The vehicle missions with the most benefit include those which constrain environmental impact (or <b>limit</b> <b>noise,</b> exhaust, or <b>emission</b> signatures) are short range, or where large differences exist in the propulsion system sizing between takeoff and cruise conditions.

Since diamond grinding has been observed to affect tyre/pavement <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> favourably, the relationship among surface texture, concrete composition and <b>noise</b> <b>emission</b> of concrete pavement surfaces has been systematically investigated. The simulation program SPERoN was used in a parameter study to investigate the main factors which affect <b>noise</b> <b>emission.</b> Based {{on the results of}} the simulations, textured concrete surfaces were produced by using a laboratory grinding machine. As well as the composition of the concrete, the thickness and spacing of the diamond blades were varied.

The results for the N 256 motorway at Colijnsplaat in Zeeland in 2005 are in agreement with 2004 and show a discrepancy in measured and calculated <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> for all vehicle categories. At this site during rainfall the traffic <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> increased with approximately 1, 5 dBA.

Furthermore there is a large variation in vehicle <b>noise</b> <b>emissions</b> within the distinguished categories. In March of 2006, a small sample set of additional measurements was therefore carried out at the Amsterdamsestraatweg in Utrecht in order to gain further insight into these variations.
