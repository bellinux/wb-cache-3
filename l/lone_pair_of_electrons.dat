5|$|In this {{representation}} {{both the}} base, B, and the conjugate base, A−, are shown carrying a <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> and the proton, {{which is a}} Lewis acid, is transferred between them.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} a dinitrogen complex to be {{discovered}} was 2+ (see figure at right), and soon many other such complexes were discovered. These complexes, in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> to a central metal cation, illustrate how N2 might bind to the metal(s) in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process: these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and {{in the production of}} fertilisers.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> {{present on}} the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
50|$|Any solvent that {{contains}} both acidic hydrogen and <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> to accept H+ can undergo autoprotolysis.|$|R
50|$|In general, sulfur is very {{nucleophilic}} {{because of}} its large size, which makes it readily polarizable, and its <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> are readily accessible.|$|R
25|$|Water, , {{also has}} a {{tetrahedral}} structure, with two hydrogen atoms and two <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> around the central oxygen atoms. Its tetrahedral symmetry is not perfect, however, because the <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> repel more than the single O–H bonds.|$|R
25|$|The monoclinic form {{contains}} tetramers, Sn4F8, {{where there}} are two distinct coordination environments for the Sn atoms. In each case, there are three nearest neighbours, with Sn {{at the apex of}} a trigonal pyramid, and the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> sterically active. Other forms reported have the GeF2 and paratellurite structures.|$|E
25|$|After {{the carbon}} dioxide is split from the oxalosuccinate in the {{decarboxylation}} step (below right), the enol will tautomerize to the keto from. The formation of the ketone double bond is started by the deprotonation of that oxygen off the alpha carbon (C#2) by the same lysine that protonated the oxygen in the first place. The <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> moves down kicking off the lone pairs that were making the double bond. This <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> abstracts a proton off the Tyrosine that deprotonated the carboxyl group in the decarboxylation step. The reason that {{we can say that}} the Lys and Tyr residues will be the same from the previous step is because they are helping in holding the isocitrate molecule in the active site of the enzyme. These two residues will be able to form hydrogen bonds back and forth {{as long as they are}} close enough to the substrate.|$|E
25|$|Once all {{lone pairs}} are placed, atoms—especially the central atoms—may {{not have an}} octet of electrons. In this case, the atoms must form a double bond; a <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> is moved to form a second bond between the two atoms. As the bonding pair is shared between the two atoms, the atom that {{originally}} had the lone pair still has an octet; the other atom now has two more electrons in its valence shell.|$|E
50|$|Hydronium ions are acids {{according}} to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Brønsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as Lewis bases due to the <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.|$|R
50|$|Electron {{donating}} {{groups are}} generally ortho/para directors for electrophilic aromatic substitutions, while electron withdrawing groups are generally meta directors {{with the exception}} of the halogens which are also ortho/para directors as they have <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> that are shared with the aromatic ring.|$|R
5000|$|Third term (summing over torsions): {{represents}} the energy for twisting a bond due to bond order (e.g., double bonds) and neighboring bonds or <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> One bond {{may have more}} than one of these terms, such that the total torsional energy is expressed as a Fourier series.|$|R
25|$|The ammonia {{molecule}} has a trigonal pyramidal {{shape as}} {{predicted by the}} valence shell electron pair repulsion theory (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°. The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> The <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°. The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a lone electron pair, which makes ammonia a base, a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar. The molecule's polarity and, especially, its ability to form hydrogen bonds, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are protonated. Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of NH4+. The latter has {{the shape of a}} regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most amines, indole is not basic: {{just like}} pyrrole, the {{aromatic}} {{character of the}} ring means that the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> on the nitrogen atom is not available for protonation. Strong acids such as hydrochloric acid can, however, protonate indole. Indole is primarily protonated at the C3, rather than N1, owing to the enamine-like reactivity of {{the portion of the}} molecule located outside of the benzene ring. The protonated form has an pKa of −3.6. The sensitivity of many indolic compounds (e.g., tryptamines) under acidic conditions is caused by this protonation.|$|E
25|$|The fourth box is Step 3, {{which is}} the {{saturation}} of the alpha-beta unsaturated double bond between carbons 2 and 3. In this step of the reaction, Lysine deprotonates the oxygen off the alpha carbon and the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> on the oxygen of the alpha carbon comes down reforming the ketone double bond and pushing the lone pair (forming the double bond between the alpha and beta carbon) off, picking up a proton from the nearby Tyrosine amino acid. This reaction results {{in the formation of}} alpha-ketoglutarate, NADH + H+/NADPH + H+, and CO2.|$|E
50|$|ClF3 is {{approximately}} T-shaped, with one short bond (1.598 Å) and two long bonds (1.698 Å). This structure {{agrees with the}} prediction of VSEPR theory, which predicts <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> as occupying two equatorial positions of a hypothetic trigonal bipyramid. The elongated Cl-F axial bonds are consistent with hypervalent bonding.|$|R
5000|$|... conclusion: ionic {{counting}} {{indicates a}} molecule lacking <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons,</b> therefore its structure will be octahedral, as predicted by VSEPR. One {{might conclude that}} this molecule would be highly reactive - but the opposite is true: SF6 is inert, and it is widely used in industry because of this property.|$|R
30|$|Abdallah [11] {{also tested}} {{the effect of}} guar gum on carbon steel. It is {{proposed}} that it acts as a mixed type inhibitor. The mechanism of action of C steel by guar gum {{is due to the}} adsorption at the electrode/solution interface. Guar gum is a polysaccharide compound containing repeated heterocyclic pyrane moiety. The presence of hetero-oxygen atom in the structure makes its adsorption possible by coordinate type linkage through the transfer <b>of</b> <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electron</b> <b>of</b> oxygen atoms to the steel surface, giving a stable chelate five-membered ring with ferrous ions.|$|R
25|$|The {{nitrogen}} {{center of}} pyridine features a basic <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons.</b> Because this lone pair {{is not part}} of the aromatic ring, pyridine is a base, having chemical properties similar to those of tertiary amines. The pKa of the conjugate acid (the pyridinium cation) is 5.25. Pyridine is protonated by reaction with acids and forms a positively charged aromatic polyatomic ion called pyridinium. The bond lengths and bond angles in pyridine and pyridinium are almost identical. The pyridinium cation is isoelectronic with benzene. Pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (PPTS) is an illustrative pyridinium salt; it is produced by treating pyridine with p-toluenesulfonic acid.|$|E
25|$|Liquid ammonia is {{the best-known}} and most widely studied nonaqueous {{ionising}} solvent. Its most conspicuous property {{is its ability}} to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing solvated electrons. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH3 with those of water shows NH3 has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, viscosity, dielectric constant and electrical conductivity; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH3 and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH3 molecule has only one <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> compared with two for each H2O molecule. The ionic self-dissociation constant of liquid NH3 at −50°C is about 10−33 mol2·l−2.|$|E
25|$|The {{decarboxylation}} of oxalosuccinate (below center) {{is a key}} step in {{the formation}} of alpha-ketoglutarate. In this reaction, the lone pair on the adjacent Tyrosine hydroxyl abstracts the proton off the carboxyl group. This carboxyl group is also referred to as the beta subunit in the isocitrate molecule. The deprotonation of the carboxyl group causes the <b>lone</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> to move down making carbon dioxide and separating from oxalosuccinate. The electrons continue to move towards the alpha carbon pushing the double bond electrons (making the ketone) up to abstract a proton off an adjacent lysine residue. An alpha-beta unsaturated double bond results between carbon 2 and three. As you can see in the picture, the green ion represents either Mg2+ or Mn2+, which is a cofactor necessary for this reaction to occur. The metal-ion forms a little complex through ionic interactions with the oxygen atoms on the fourth and fifth carbons (also known as the gamma subunit of isocitrate).|$|E
25|$|Ethers are {{slightly}} polar. The C–O–C bond angle in the functional group is about 110°, and the C–O dipoles do not cancel out. Ethers are more polar than alkenes {{but not as}} polar as alcohols, esters, or amides of comparable structure. The presence <b>of</b> two <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> on the oxygen atoms makes hydrogen bonding with water molecules possible.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hydrogen}} bond is effectively a strong {{example of an}} interaction between two permanent dipoles. The large difference in electronegativities between hydrogen and any of fluorine, nitrogen and oxygen, coupled with their <b>lone</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> cause strong electrostatic forces between molecules. Hydrogen bonds {{are responsible for the}} high boiling points of water and ammonia with respect to their heavier analogues.|$|R
25|$|Alcohols can be {{oxidised}} to give aldehydes, ketones or carboxylic acids, or {{they can}} be dehydrated to alkenes.
