5|$|A kitsune {{may take}} on human form, an ability <b>learned</b> <b>when</b> it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, {{although}} some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a broad leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. Sometimes young adult males These shapes {{are not limited}} by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can duplicate {{the appearance of a}} specific person. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox. Kitsune-gao or fox-faced refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.|$|E

25|$|Music for {{parade and}} show bands is {{typically}} learned separately, in a concert band setting.

The new unit needed to combine cross-border insurgency warfare to take the fight to the enemies' bases of operation in territory under hostile governmental control (which collectively virtually encircled Rhodesia), with domestic policing counter-insurgency operations of a more traditional colonial nature, both disciplines being drawn heavily from the experiences that both Walls and Reid-Daly had <b>learned</b> <b>when</b> they had fought alongside one another in the Malayan Emergency twenty years earlier.

However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson <b>learned.</b> <b>When</b> Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
25|$|Language {{acquisition}} in multilingual {{individuals is}} contingent on two factors: {{age of the}} language acquisition and proficiency. Specialization is centered in the perisylvian cortex of the left hemisphere. Various regions of both {{the right and left}} hemisphere activate during language production. Multilingual individuals consistently demonstrate similar activation patterns in the brain when using either one of the two or more languages they fluently know. Age of acquiring the second-or-higher language, and proficiency of use determine what specific brain regions and pathways activate when using (thinking or speaking) the language. In contrast to those who acquired their multiple languages at different points in their life, those who acquire multiple languages when young, and at virtually the same time, show similar activations in parts of Broca's area and left inferior frontal lobe. If the second-or-higher language is acquired later in life, specifically after the critical period, the language becomes centralized in a different part of Broca's area than the native language and other languages <b>learned</b> <b>when</b> young.|$|E

It still consisted of a three-layer system of voids and liquid-filled compartments meant to absorb the energy of an underwater explosion. It was bounded on the inside by the [...] torpedo bulkhead. Her enlarged oil tanks reduced the empty spaces that could flood and cause the ship to list and greater provision was made to pump these spaces out.

[...] After much debate, the council decided on action, and planned a third crossing for December 29. [...] On December 28 it snowed, but the weather cleared that night and it became bitter cold. [...] As this effort involved most of the army, eight crossing points were used. [...] At some of them the ice had frozen two to three inches (4 to 7cm) thick, and was capable of supporting soldiers, who crossed the ice on foot. [...] At other crossings the conditions were so bad that the attempts were abandoned for the day. [...] It was New Years Eve before the army and all of its baggage was back in New Jersey. [...] This was somewhat fortunate, as the enlistment period of John Glover's regiment (along with a significant number of others) was expiring {{at the end of the}} year, and many of these men, including most of Glover's, wanted to go home, where a lucrative privateering trade awaited them. [...] Only by offering a bounty to be paid immediately from Congressional coffers in Philadelphia did a significant number of men agree to stay with the army another six weeks.|$|E
