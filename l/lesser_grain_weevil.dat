40|$|Managing stored {{grains and}} seed {{requires}} {{the use of}} various techniques to ensure the quality of the product entering the storage facility does not deteriorate over time. These techniques include: the use of sanitation, storing sound, dry grain, managing temperature and aeration, using chemical protectants, regular sampling, and the use of fumigation. Bin and storage facilities also {{play an important role in}} determining the quality of the stored grain. Storage facilities should be inspected regularly for deterioration of any type. Proper storage moisture varies depending on type of seed, length of storage and storage conditions. Seed moisture content changes until equilibrium is established with the surrounding environment. The equilibrium moisture is different for each kind of seed. High oil content seeds (soybeans, peanuts, sunflowers) will not absorb as much moisture as seed with a high starch content (wheat, barley, corn, sorghum). Oil does not absorb water; therefore, in a seed with 40 % oil the seed moisture will be concentrated in the other 60 %. The time to reach equilibrium will vary from days to months depending on the kind of seed, humidity and temperature. When there are large differences in seed moisture and the surrounding environment the initial change is rapid and slows as equilibrium temperature/moisture is approached.

We were also interested in germination of bean and snap bean seed damaged by <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> and in germination of the seed treated by freezing which was aimed at controlling <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> by cold. We also recorded the differences between bean and snap bean seed, which was or was not treated by freezing in laboratory conditions. This investigation was carried out by applying the two factorial block system. The obtained results were evaluated by the variance analysis and x 2 test These results suggest that the bean seed of a bad fraction had low levels of germination, but still it was present. Although the seed of good appearance was carefully selected, germination was slightly lower than it should have been. The seed with the large amount of <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> performed a high level germination in laboratory conditions.

Seventeen crops were mostly cultivated by the farmers in the surveyed areas; maize (32 %), sunflower (16 %) and pigeon peas (12 %) were the most cultivated while maize was the most stored. There are at least 7 months between two harvest seasons of each crop; while farmers sold the crops soon after harvest to cater for household expenditure (54 %) and school fees (38 %), the market prices increased significantly (P 0. 05) within six months of storage.

Of the factors governing multiplication may be mentioned the rate of oviposition, the length of time a female lives before she lays eggs and the length of her ovipository life. These factors are dependent in turn on the environ-ment, and they have formed the subject of this investigation with reference to the <b>grain</b> <b>weevil,</b> Calandra granaria, in stored wheat. In no earlier work have strictly controlled environ-mental conditions been applied in this connexion. For instance, Kunicke (1936) reports that at 260 C. a female lays 200 eggs over an unstated period of time and that at 240 C. adult Calandra could live for a year. Lavrekhin (1937) states that at 25 - 270 C. the females lived for about 130 days, and that the average rate of oviposition was 0 - 9 egg per day from the 14 th to the 54 th day, the rate then falling off. Since these results were obtained without any precise control of the atmospheric humidity they are of little value. With these defects, in mind the features of oviposition rate, length of preoviposition period and of lengths of ovipository life in Calandra have been examined under a series of controlled humidities for each of several temperatures.

Thirteen years after the application of selenium, molybdenum and zinc, significant translocation and accumulation of these elements in the grain were established, indicating a long-term effect of these microelements on triticale plants. The highest degree of accumulation in grains and seedling shoots was found for selenium, then molybdenum, while the detected amounts of zinc were significantly lower. The degree of accumulation of all threemicroelements in the grain and seedling shoot increased as doses increased. Translocation index from shoot to grain at the grain-filling phase was the highest when zinc was used, then selenium, and the lowest when molybdenum was applied. The highest translocationindex from the grain during germination into seedling shoots was obtained with zinc, then molybdenum and selenium. Translocation indexes of the investigated elements significantly decreased as the doses of elements increased. Dry weight of seedling shoots decreasedas molybdenum and zinc in grain increased. High selenium concentration moderately stimulated seedling development, pointing out a high tolerance of triticale to higher concentration of this microelement at initial development stages.

40|$|Nutritional {{quality and}} {{physical}} conditions {{were used to}} evaluate grain sorghum damaged by either the <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> borer Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) or by nontoxin-producing fungi. Experimental treatments were: 1) control 04. 0 % moisture), 2) <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> borer (LGB) (14 % moisture with initial infestation of 4. 5 adults/lb of grain) and 3) fungal (Fungal) (15. 5 % moisture). Control grain was used to formulate a 17 % crude protein diet. The remaining dietary treatments were formulated by replacing the control grain with the two damaged grains on a weight basis. Forty-five female Yorkshire and 12 crossbred male pigs, with an average initial weight of 22 lb were used in growth (35 days) and metabolism studies, respectively. Results indicated similar average daily gains and digestibilities for {{the two types of}} damaged grain when compared with the control. Pigs fed the diet containing the insect-damaged grain showed an 18 % poorer feed conversion rate and a 21 % higher average daily feed consumption during the 14 to 35 -day interval. Throughout the feeding study, the diet containing the fungal-damaged grain sorghum resulted in feed conversion and average daily feed consumption similar to pigs fed the control diet...|$|R
40|$|Using 128 {{crossbred}} pigs with {{an average}} initial weight of 18. 3 Kg, we determined the effect that insect- and fungal-damaged sorghum {{would have on the}} pigs' performance. No differences were found in daily feed consumption for any treatment during a 28 -day feeding trial. Average daily gains and feed efficiencies were {{similar to those of the}} control for pigs fed grain sorghum that had been damaged by <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> borer; red beetle; a mixture of <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> borer, flat grain beetle, and indian meal moth, or Aspergilas Candidus. Pigs fed grain sorghum damaged by rice weevil showed lower average daily gains and a higher feed-to-gain ratio than did the controls. Aspergilas Glaucus-damaged grain showed similar ADG, but a significantly poorer F/G during the first 14 days, but not during the second half of the study. Even though insect damaged grain appears to be nutritionally adequate rather significant losses of dry matter and energy are sustained when grain sorghum is allowed to go out of condition. Up to 6 % of the gross energy and approximately 5 % of the crude protein content was lost to infestation or fungal invasion...|$|R
30|$|Another {{possible}} mode {{of action}} is physical. Alexander et al. [13] showed that the {{mode of action}} for inert dust insecticides was independent of chemical reactivity. We have previously shown that concrobium dust causes mortality in Reticulitermes flavipes[14]. Also, inert dusts induced death in <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> by desiccation since respiration and ingestion {{did not seem to}} harm the insects. While ZnO is not inert, it is entirely possible that termite mortality demonstrated by Kartal et al. [12] and Clausen et al. [11, 15] {{is the result of a}} physical reaction alone, or in addition to a physiochemical reaction since a film of nano-particles remained on the surface of the unleached wood blocks. Furthermore, antibacterial activity has been reported to increase with reduction in particle size [8]. In our previous study, wood blocks were treated with a single particle size (30 nm) of ZnO and the effect of particle size could not be ascertained.|$|R
40|$|Storage losses due to pests {{threaten}} livelihoods {{of farmers}} across Africa. Synthetic pesticides provide effective control when used correctly but resource-poor farmers cannot afford them. A survey of farmer ethno-ecological knowledge of pests of stored maize and bean, and their pest management practices including pesticidal plant use, {{was conducted in}} eastern Zambia and northern Malawi. Almost all respondents reported serious pest damage, with bruchids (Callosobruchus maculatus) and <b>grain</b> <b>weevils</b> (Sitophilus spp.) being major pests in beans and maize, respectively. The larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus) was reported more widely in Malawi. In Zambia, 50 % of farmers used synthetic pesticides during storage, while nearly all did so in Malawi. Despite differences in storage methods between Malawi and Zambia, farmers in both countries were familiar with pesticidal plants, where Tephrosia vogelii was the most frequently reported. Surprisingly few farmers actually used pesticidal plants, highlighting a promotion opportunity. Our results provide a foundation for optimizing the use of pesticidal plants and enhancing their value to resource-poor farmers, across Africa...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the damage}} done by insects to grain in storage and {{shipments}} is due to four species. These are the granary weevil, the rice or black <b>weevil,</b> the <b>lesser</b> <b>grain</b> borer or Australian weevil, and the Angoumois grain moth. Others of the 40 species or groups of species described in this bulletin can cause great damage to grain if storage conditions are unusually favorable for their increase [...] These four pests live throughout their larval life entirely within the kernel, where they feed unseen, usually unsuspected [...] The other pests discussed, with few exceptions, are 'surface feeders.

40|$|The <b>Lesser</b> <b>Grain</b> Borer {{is a major}} pest of stored grain with {{a global}} distribution. This project has, {{for the first time}} {{recorded}} this pest throughout broad spatial areas, tens of kilometres from grain production or storage. Statistical analysis revealed that different factors such as ambient temperature and the availability of food resources affect R. dominica differently between different habitats. This suggests that, contrary to the prevailing view, this pest is not solely dependent on stored wheat and can continue to persist throughout a range of habitats. These findings have important management implications for Australia's wheat industry...|$|R
40|$|Solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) fibres and {{automated}} {{thermal desorption}} (ATD) tubes were used with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to investigate volatile secretions from the headspace gas of adults and larvae of confused flour beetle Tribolium confusum du Val, {{saw-toothed grain beetle}} Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> Sitophilus granarius (L.), flour mite Acarus siro L. and storage mite Glycyphagus domesticus (De Geer). A number of VOCs were specifically linked with confused flour beetle T. confusum and not observed with the other insect and mite species. For instance, 2 -methyl-p-benzoquinone and 2 -ethyl-p-benzoquinone were specifically linked to confused flour beetle. However, this study found that benzoquinones were not present in the headspace volatiles of the larvae of confused flour beetle, whereas, 1 -pentadecene was detected in adults and larvae of confused flour beetle. The results of the volatile extraction experiments with saw-toothed grain beetles O. surinamensis showed that several volatiles were detected in the adults and larvae of saw-toothed grain beetle {{but not in the}} other insect and mite species. Some of these VOCs were detected only in adults, and these were butanoic acid, 1 -methylethyl ester and 1, 3 -octadiene. The others were found in both larvae and adults. These were 2, 4 -hexadien- 1 -ol, octane, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, 2, 5 -dimethylpyrazine, 1 -octen- 3 -one and 1 -octen- 3 -ol. The analysis of the headspace from <b>grain</b> <b>weevil</b> S. granarius showed three VOCs which were specifically linked to weevils compared to the other species. These were mequinol, 2 -methylpropanoic acid and 2 -pentanone. The results showed that the known mite-produced alarm pheromone citral (comprising (Z) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal and (E) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2, 6 -octadienal) was detected in both mite species flour mite A. siro and storage mite G. domesticus but not in insect species. This study has identified a number of VOCs which may enable the early detection of storage insects and mites in grain stores. Many of the VOCs identified were specific to either mites or one of the insect species studied which could enable specific identification of the cause of infestation...|$|R
