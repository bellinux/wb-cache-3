Many different nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques can detect first <b>layer</b> <b>corrosion,</b> and much {{progress has been made}} quantifying corrosion that exists in this layer[l]. Due to the layered nature of a lap-splice, second <b>layer</b> <b>corrosion</b> is much more difficult to detect, and also more difficult to quantify. Current maintenance procedures also make it difficult for researchers to obtain lap-splice corrosion samples from serviceable aircraft. The detection of corrosion in lap-splice assemblies has been given an important inspection priority by the airline industry, and regular inspection procedures have been developed to meet these new requirements. During maintenance, if corrosion is suspected in a lap-splice area, the area is opened up for further inspection by removing the rivets, adhesive and sometimes the paint. If the corrosion damage is beyond the manufacturer’s tolerances, the corroded area is cut out and patch-repaired; otherwise, the corrosion is removed by chemical or mechanical means, leaving a serviceable but thinner metal skin when the joint is reassembled[2]. In either case the original character of the lap-splice has been destroyed by the maintenance process, and its use for NDE purposes is lost. In this light, it becomes necessary for researchers to fabricate their own laboratory samples and compare these artificial samples with actual in-service samples...|$|E

The chill zone (4 +/- 1 mu m in thickness) had fine columnar and equiaxed grains and contained a distribution of submicron Mg-Al-Zn intermetallic particles.

40|$|The life of {{lead-acid}} batteries {{is typically}} governed by corrosion {{of the positive}} grid. The grid experiences highly oxidising environments which, in turn, corrodes the grid material. However, the resulting <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> is essential to create an electrically conductive bond between the grid and active material. Additionally, alloying elements are necessary to allow low-cost production techniques to be used. The selection of grid material is therefore a compromise between function, life and ease-of-manufacture. Tubular plate lead-acid batteries have historically used antimonial-lead alloys as the grid alloy. These alloys impart mechanical strength within a die-cast grid and provide a suitably conductive oxide within the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer.</b> The use of tin in many lead alloy blends {{has resulted in a}} beneficial effect on the corrosion rate of these alloys. Tin-lead alloys are used in thin plate lead-acid batteries. However there is no published data on their use for grids of tubular plates in deep-cycling applications. A simple binary, low-tin lead alloy has been tested and found to exhibit a significantly lower corrosion rate during periods of heavy cycling when compared to a traditional low-antimony based alloy. However, it was shown that under severe over-charge conditions, the tin-lead alloy corroded at a significantly faster rate than that of an antimonial alloy. The lead-tin alloy performed well as a positive grid material throughout 500 cycles. No indications of premature capacity loss were observed and the ability of the alloy to be recharged was excellent. Electron microprobe analysis of sections of cycled positive plates showed the doping effect of tin within the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> of the grid material. This effect led to an increase in the conductivity of the layer, resulting in an increased ion-conductivity of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer.</b> The <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> of each alloy type was found to be fine, densely packed and uniformly structured under cycling conditions, but it became more porous during periods of severe over-charge. The tin-based alloy was shown to produce a thinner <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> at completion of 500 cycles when compared to that of the antimonial alloy. Further, the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> of the tin based alloy was found to be less cracked than that of the antimonial based alloy.

The first step of the model sample preparation was grinding of the bronze surface by using emery with 60, then 280 and finally by 600 grains density, {{in order to achieve}} the defined surface roughness. The next step of the work were optical and scanning electron microscopy observations with energy dispersive X-ray micro analysis (SEM-EDX) of the prepared bronze sample for purpose of surface structure characterization and element composition determination. Bronze samples with defined surface structure were corroded in different corrosion atmospheres. Three different model <b>corrosion</b> <b>layers</b> were formed by acidic atmospheres of hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and sulphuric acid. The element composition and structure of <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> was determined by SEM-EDX again. The different amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, sulfur, copper, tin and lead in the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> according to different types of corrosion atmospheres were determined. The next and also main part of the work was a plasma chemical reduction of corroded samples. The plasma reactor used the RF discharge (13. 56 MHz) created in quartz tube with outer electrodes. The generation of capacitively coupled plasma in continuous or pulse mode by different supplied power was carried out. The plasma radiation emitted from the RF discharge during the sample treatment was measured by optical emission spectroscopy. The quantity of OH radical created in an active discharge by reactions of atomic hydrogen with the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> is a significant indicator of a reduction process.

The analyses show that the decrease of main corrosion agents as chlorine and oxygen was achieved by hydrogen plasma treatment. The corrosions as well as their removal are a very complex problem and the plasmachemical treatment of metal objects is an efficient method for the removal of <b>corrosion</b> <b>layers</b> as compared to conventional conservations methods mainly due to a significant reduction of treatment time...|$|R
40|$|The {{corrosion}} behaviour of Al 6061 -TiO 2 particulate composites in chloride, nitrate, sulphate and acidic {{media has}} been studied in the present investigation. The unreinforced matrix, and the composites containing 2, 4 and 6 weight percent of TiO 2 particulates were prepared by liquid metallurgy route using the vortex technique. Their corrosion behaviour was evaluated by weight loss, potentiodynamic polarisation, scanning electron micrograpaph (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA) methods. The studies show that corrosion current density (I Corr) and the corrosion rate were highest {{in the case of}} corrodent 0. 1 N HCl. The rate of corrosion of both the matrix alloy and the composites decreased with increase in time of exposure in acid medium, possibly due to the formation of a passive oxide <b>layer.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> current (I Corr), corrosion potential (E Corr) and pitting potential (E Pit) were obtained from potentiodynamic polarisation studies. In all the media, the I Corr values of unreinforced matrix alloy and composites were found to increase as the TiO 2 content increased from 0 % to 6 %, which could be attributed to the microgalvanic coupling between the reinforcement or conducting interfacial products and the matrix alloy. Insulator TiO 2 particulates are perceived to act as inert material and degrade the integrity of the protective oxide layer on the Al matrix alloy. The presence of reinforcement in the matrix increases cathode to anode ratio in the composites, resulting in the formation of pits during localised corrosion. Moreover, the pitting effect was more pronounced in the presence of aggressive Cl- ions compared to mild NO 3 - and SO 4 (2 -) ions. SEM and EDX analysis of samples in chloride media showed the presence of large pits and completely deteriorated surface, complementing weight loss and polarisation studies...|$|E
40|$|A new flux-focusing {{eddy current}} probe was {{recently}} developed at NASA Langley Research Center. The new probe {{is similar in}} design to a reflection type eddy current probe, but is unique in {{that it does not}} require the use of an impedance bridge for balancing. The device monitors the RMS output voltage of a pickup coil and, as a result, is easier to operate and interpret than traditional eddy current instruments. The unique design feature of the probe is a ferromagnetic cylinder, typically 1020 steel, which separates a concentrically positioned drive and pickup coil. The increased permeability of the steel causes the magnetic flux produced by the drive coil to be focused in a ring around the pickup coil. At high frequencies the eddy currents induced in both the sample and the cylinder allow little or no flux to link with the pickup coil. This results in a self-nulling condition which {{has been shown to be}} useful for the unambiguous detection of cracks in conducting materials. As the frequency is lowered the flux produced by the drive coil begins to link with the pickup coil causing an output which, among other things, is proportional to the thickness of the test specimen. This enables highly accurate measurements of the thickness of conducting materials and helps to facilitate the monitoring of thickness variations in a conducting structure such as an aircraft fuselage. Under ideal laboratory conditions the probe can sense thickness changes on the order of 1 % as illustrated. However, this is highly dependent upon the thickness, and the geometric complexity of the sample being tested and for practical problems the sensitivity is usually much less. In this presentation we highlight some of the advantages and limitations in using the probe to inspect aircraft panels for corrosion and other types of material nonuniformities. In particular, we present preliminary results which illustrate the probes capabilities for detecting first and second <b>layer</b> <b>corrosion</b> in aircraft panels which may contain air gaps between the layers. Since the probe utilized eddy currents its corrosion detection capabilities are similar to convectional eddy current techniques, but the new probe is much easier to use...|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical {{impedance}} spectroscopy (EIS) {{has been}} widely used to characterize rates and mechanisms during electrochemical processes. In this study, EIS was employed to probe the behavior for simulated galvanic coupling of a carbon fiber/polymer matrix composite in the marine environment. In a later study the effect of cathodic 10 n plating and ion implantation of 304 stainless steel on its corrosion behavior was examined. The electrochemical behavior of a carbon fiber/vinyl ester composite in 3. 5 % NaCl solution was investigated. Negative potentials were applied to the composite material to simulate galvanic coupling of metals. EIS enables time dependent data to be acquired non destructively from a single sample. The impedance of the material {{as a function of}} time and applied negative potential was measured. It was found that increased damage to the composite was induced by more applied negative potentials, as cathodic reactions were increased with decreasing potential. Experimental data from the measurement technique is also amenable to modelling by passive electrical circuit elements. The system was equivalently modelled by two interacting RCtype subcircuits representing the carbon fiber/moisture and vinyl ester/moisture interphases. The pore resistance Rpo determined from the model was found to offer a damage monitoring criteria for the composite material. In an examination of surface damage to composites, laboratory testings were found to simulate accurately long term surface damage from galvanic marine exposure m seawater. Surface examination after long term galvanic coupling in seawater indicated removal of the polymer matrix above carbon fibers in addition to previously found blisters. Therefore two types of damage, blistering and dissolution, occurred due to galvanic interactions seawater exposure. Blistering was found only 720 hours (30 days) at a potential of - 0. 65 VscE, along with regions of polymer surface dissolution. Imposing a potential of - 1. 2 V s CE resulted in exposing carbon fibers after the covering polymer layer was rapidly removed. Possible electrochemical mechanisms for the polymer dissolution process are discussed. TiN and ZrN cathodic ion plated coatings were applied to a 304 stainless steel, and exposed to 0. 5 N NaCl solution. The TiN coatings were also ion implanted with Ti and Au to determine the effect of ion implantation on corrosion behavior. It was found that ion implantation did not enhance the corrosion resistance of the TiN on 304 stainless steel. However the ZrN did protect the stainless steel from corrosion. It is suggested that the ZrN is inherently more protective by formation of a passive layer. TiN even with excess Ti ions from implantation did not form a protective passive <b>layer.</b> <b>Corrosion</b> interfaces of coated and/or implanted stainless steel were modelled by a simple parallel RC-type circuit due to strong interfacial bonding between substrate and coatings. Modelled data indicated the charge transfer resistance of the ZrN was higher than TiN and was related to the enhanced protection of ZrN...|$|E
40|$|During {{operation}} of the valve regulated lead/acid (VRLA) battery, a mixed stoichiometry lead oxide <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> is formed {{on the surface of}} the positive electrode. The formation of this layer has a number of consequences including increased electrode resistance and decreased strength. Experimental results obtained from cycling 40 Ah VRLA batteries revealed an increase in <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> thickness on the sides of the grid bars compared to the top and bottom. It is suggested that the areas of increased <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> thickness corresponded to the areas of high current density {{on the surface of the}} grid. In order to investigate this observation the finite element package ANSYS was used to produce qualitative estimates of the values in current density, which would be expected on the tested grid design. Results suggest that <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> thickening is related to current density. The model was then used to predict the expected current distribution around a number of hypothetical electrode designs. These incorporated changes in both grid bar cross-section and positive active material. Results showed that improvements could be made to existing grid designs with respect to lowering current densities...|$|R
30|$|Retrieved copper-alloyed {{artefacts}} were in {{an overall}} good preservation status owing to the local characteristics of the clayey carbonate containing soil that limited access to atmospheric oxygen and assured a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. The objects, albeit fragmented, showed a good surface preservation through the formation of smooth <b>corrosion</b> <b>layers.</b> The formation of such smooth layers is consistent with comparison of the elemental composition of the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> and uncorroded core that indicate that decuprification and dezincification were the main corrosion processes.|$|R
40|$|Performance of a valve {{regulated}} lead/acid battery {{is affected by}} the properties of the positive grid <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer.</b> An investigation has been carried out using a range of experimental techniques to study the influence of <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> composition and structure on cyclic performance. A number of designs of battery were manufactured with different grids and positive active materials (PAMs). Two grid types were used consisting of either pure lead or a lead/tin alloy. Variations in PAM composition and structure were obtained by forming electrodes from grey oxide pastes containing additions of, red lead, tetrabasic lead sulphate, or sulphuric acid (sulphated). Results indicated that both grid alloy composition and PAM type affect the <b>corrosion</b> <b>layer</b> properties. Ultra-microtoming was used to prepare sections of the grid/corrosion layer interface. Results showed that corrosion propagated along tin rich grain boundaries...|$|R
