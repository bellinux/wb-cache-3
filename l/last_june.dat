5|$|On 16 April, United took on Toronto FC at Toronto's BMO Field. In the 2010 campaign, United {{were able}} to pull out a 1–0 victory against the Reds; this time, D.C. was able to earn a 3–0 victory at Toronto. Their game against Toronto quickly went into good fortune for the Black-and-Red, as United found {{the back of the}} net twice within the first 10 minutes of play. The opening goal was scored by Chris Pontius, which was his first in MLS league play since his hat trick against Seattle Sounders FC <b>last</b> <b>June,</b> prior to his calf injury. Pontius netted in the 5th minute as well as the 73rd minute of the match. Additionally, Charlie Davies netted his fifth MLS goal of the year, and his second in the run of play. Davies' goal was a follow up shot in the 9th minute {{following}} a strike from winger Josh Wolff. Additionally, the game saw United not only pull out their first away win of the season, but their first shout-out since the Carolina Challenge Cup; which was also Bill Hamid's first shutout in MLS play.|$|E

Three-quarters of bids came from foreign investors. Pakistan's stock market has doubled in dollar terms {{since the start of}} 2012, {{thanks in large part to}} such foreign interest. The Economist said that the progress in providing economic stability is encouraging. But Pakistan needs sustained growth of 5–7% a year if it is markedly to cut poverty-at the last count, nearly a quarter of Pakistanis were below the poverty line.|$|E

During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the Wood Nymphs Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, {{he wrote to his}} Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [...] Thalberg and [...] Strauss , and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since <b>last</b> <b>June.</b> I sincerely hope that Prince Albert... will do something to improve our taste.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1914, [...] Dennison wrote Oscar Lipps, Acting Superintendent at Carlisle: “My sister, Martha Wheelock, aged twenty years, whose term expired at Flandreau, South Dakota <b>last</b> <b>June,</b> and is {{now with}} me in West DePere, desires to be {{admitted}} to the Carlisle Indian School as a pupil. I am very anxious that she shall go if possible. She is in eighth grade. My son, Edmund is also very anxious to have the benefit of a diploma from Carlisle on account of the prestige it carries with it throughout the West.” Edmund, who was born in at the Carlisle Indian School in 1896, had been attending public school in Wisconsin and doing well, but Dennison was concerned about the environment. “Unfortunately, however, De Pere is a city of less than five thousand inhabitants, yet has in the neighborhood of twenty-two, or twenty-four saloons, and on account of what is falsely termed liberal sentiment, the saloon keepers do not hold strictly to the law of the land, and as a result we see young boys very frequently under the influence of liquor.” Within a month, both Edmund and Martha were attending Carlisle and active in school life and literary societies.|$|E
