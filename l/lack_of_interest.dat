A survey was taken of a small sectoral sample of 58 building firms within the Central Belt of Scotland, 20 of whose owner-managers were assessed in detail using the Repertory Grid and Personal Project techniques.

40|$|Introduction. Low {{sexual desire}} {{has been studied}} more {{extensively}} in women than in men. Aim. The study aims to analyze the correlates <b>of</b> distressing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> and the self-assessed reasons for the <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> among heterosexual men from three countries. Methods. A web-based survey was completed by 5, 255 men aged 18 – 75 years from Portugal, Croatia, and Norway. Main Outcome Measures. We used an item that assesses <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> from the British NATSAL 2000. Anxiety and depression were measured with the SCL-ANX 4 and SCL-DEP 6. Relationship intimacy was measured using a five-item version of the Emotional Intimacy Scale. A shortened version of the Sexual Boredom Scale {{was used to assess}} proneness to sexual boredom in relation to the duration of relationship, and personal distress was evaluated using an item created for this study. Results. Distressing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> lasting at least 2 months in the previous year was reported by 14. 4 % of the participants. The most prevalent comorbidity among these men was erectile difficulty (48. 7 %). Men with low confidence levels in erectile function, not feeling attracted to the partner, and those in long-term relationships {{were more likely to have}} experienced <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> than were men with high confidence levels and those who felt attracted to their partner and those in shorter-term relationships. Professional stress was the most frequently reported reason for <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest.</b> Sexual boredom as a result of a long-term relationship was significantly and negatively correlated with the level of intimacy (r = − 0. 351, P < 0. 001) and sexual satisfaction (r = − 0. 497, P < 0. 001). Conclusions. Distressing <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>interest</b> in heterosexual men was associated with a number of intrapersonal (self-confidence in erectile function, stress), interpersonal (relationship duration, partner attractiveness), and sociocultural variables...|$|R
