50|$|Tumor markers, {{chemicals}} sometimes {{found in}} the blood of people with cancer, can be helpful in diagnosing and monitoring the course of <b>liver</b> <b>cancers.</b> High levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood can be found in many cases of HCC and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma can be detected with these commonly used tumor markers: carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 125 (CA125). These tumour markers are found in primary <b>liver</b> <b>cancers,</b> as well as in other cancers and certain other disorders.|$|R

5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium increases the risk of lung cancer, <b>liver</b> <b>cancer,</b> bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E

40|$|Hepatic {{progenitor}} cells (HPCs) are bipotential cells {{residing in}} normal liver. Their proliferation is observed in reactive {{conditions of the}} liver and in primary <b>liver</b> <b>cancers.</b> The observation that some hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) express a biliary-like immunophenotype {{has led to the}} identification of HPCs in HCC. Accumulating evidence suggests that HPCs play a role as the cell of origin in a variety of primary <b>liver</b> <b>cancers.</b> This has {{led to the development of}} revolutionary concepts in hepatocarcinogenesis.

5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted <b>liver</b> <b>cancer</b> therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can usually be discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E

5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood.

5|$|Hepatitis C is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms.
