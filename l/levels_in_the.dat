5|$|In August 2012, oxygen <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river {{were found}} to be low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between hydrogen peroxide, which is used to improve oxygen <b>levels</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E
