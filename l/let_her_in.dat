25|$|A {{few days}} before LulzSec disbanded, the FBI {{executed}} a search warrant on an Iowa home rented by Laurelai Bailey. Authorities interviewed her for five hours and confiscated her hard drives, camera, and other electronic equipment, but no charges were filed. Bailey denied {{being a member of}} the group, but admitted chatting with members of LulzSec online and later leaking those chats. The FBI was interested in having her infiltrate the group, but Bailey claimed the members hated her and would never <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in.</b> The questioning by the FBI led a local technical support company to fire Laurelai, claiming she embarrassed the company.|$|E
500|$|The song's final choruses {{include the}} line [...] "You {{may think of}} Sexy Sadie, <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> through your front door", reprising the late-period Beatles device of self-reference. In this case, Harrison name-checks [...] "Sexy Sadie", John Lennon's thinly veiled attack on the Maharishi and the latter's alleged sexual {{advances}} towards one of the female students at the Rishikesh retreat. Inglis views this mention in [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as significant on three levels: Harrison is alluding to a casual sexual partner in the present; recalling his former mentor and guru, the Maharishi; and supplying [...] "a coded reference" [...] to his past as a Beatle.|$|E
5000|$|After the performance, {{there is}} a huge crowd wanting to see the opera singer but no one is allowed backstage. As Rosemarie ponders how to get <b>in,</b> <b>her</b> other sister, Dorothy, walks up and tells the {{security}} guard she is [...] "on the list" [...] and he <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>in.</b> Rosemarie on a hunch then tells the guard she's Mary Miletti and she thinks she's on the list. He confirms she is and <b>lets</b> <b>her</b> <b>in.</b>|$|R

500|$|While Joe {{engages the}} robots with his {{modified}} Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins {{photographs from the}} street {{with little regard for}} her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and [...] reluctantly convinces Joe to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tacks the origin of the signal on a part of a map before his capture.|$|E
500|$|In the city, Wei {{finds the}} people that Zhang was {{supposed}} to be working with, only to discover that they had lost him at the train station days before. She forces another girl her age, Sun Zhimei, to help her look for Zhang at the train station, but they do not find him. Wei has no success finding Zhang through the public address system and [...] "missing person" [...] posters, so she goes to the local television station to broadcast a missing person notice. The receptionist (Feng Yuying) will not <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> without valid identification, though, and says the only way she can enter is with permission from the station manager, whom she describes as [...] "a man with glasses". For the rest of the day, Wei stands by the station's only gate, stopping every man with glasses, but she does not find the station manager, and spends the night asleep on the street. The next day the station manager (Wu Wanlu) sees her at the gate again, through his window, and lets her in, scolding the receptionist for making her wait outside.|$|E
500|$|It {{begins with}} Jackson in {{what seems to}} be a hotel, singing about his girlfriend. He is distressed because he found a silver card in with the name [...] "Alex" [...] on it. To him, it implies that [...] "Alex" [...] is another man who his girlfriend is with; thus, she is {{cheating}} on Jackson. However, as the story in the video unfolds, this is not true, because the girl takes on different identities (I.e. Eve, Diana, etc.) for her job as a high class call girl. [...] "Alex" [...] (which is also a girl's name), just happens to be one of them. The video alternates scenes from where Jackson is singing about his pain, to where the girl is being changed into her different identities and taking care of her jobs (mostly meeting with other men and even some women and sleeping with them). Towards the end of the video, Jackson has packed up his bags to leave town, because of his distress. A helicopter comes to pick him up from his house. The girl comes to Jackson's house and she asks his assistant (who knows the situation and aided Jackson in his departure) to <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in.</b> It is likely she quit the job for him and wants to stay. The assistant shakes his head, implying that he left. When she asks why, he drops a flutter of silver nameplates (including the one that said [...] "Alex") from a slot in the door. After that scene, Jackson is seen sleeping and smoke floats out the side of the screen. Having lost her love and without any alternative, the girl turns to her callgirl existence again. Her employer slaps her in the face and she is then seen being prepared for a new identity.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{said she}} found the episode both [...] "dishearting" [...] and [...] "engaging", as well as later adding that it was [...] "sad" [...] and [...] "frightening" [...] when Jake O'Connor was accused of murdering his father. Writing about the final scene which shows Megan enter the Russell’s house, {{she said that she}} wanted to [...] "smack" [...] Megan for doing so, saying [...] "What was she thinking? She knew Scanlon had committed the murder and that Jen was acting strangely when she wouldn't <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in.</b> Yet, she went back to find the door open and walked right in. Megan's intelligent enough to know that something wasn't right but she's unarmed and untrained to handle the situation. For some reason she seemed incapable of making the smart decision to wait for the real police". Orlando said of the flashback scenes that she hopes in future episodes they [...] "delve deeper" [...] into Megan's father's death, saying that it was [...] "certainly a turning point for the character and I'd love to know more". She said it was [...] "nice" [...] to see scenes between Peter and Megan and said of the carpooling storyline, [...] "Snacks for carpool didn't seem like a bad idea but they could have used a couple of healthier options to go with the chocolate". Of Curtis and Kate's examining Manny Santos, she said that their expressions were [...] "hysterical" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] when they decided whether Manny was a juvenile, adding that it gave [...] "a much needed moment of comic relief in an otherwise heavy episode". She finished in saying that the episode [...] "grabbed her attention", finishing, [...] "These engaging characters and this episode was a winner for Body of Proof". In the carpooling storyline it featured Tastykake's products, a line of snack foods based in Philadelphia. Such products which were mentioned were Krimpets and KandyKakes, with the ABC saying they were the [...] "best".|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} Austin {{politicians}} and politicos have expressed sorrow at Gale's death. Marti Bier, a policy aide for the Austin City council member Randi Shade, directly attributed Gale's {{death to the}} Salvation Army, saying, [...] "Something Jennifer would never talk about, but was a reality for her, {{is that she is}} a transwoman living in a transphobic society. Homelessness in the trans-community is a really big problem, and one that goes ignored. There are no laws in Texas protecting transgender people, whether from job discrimination, housing discrimination or hate crimes," [...] and [...] "The Salvation Army would not <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> there unless she was grouped with the men. They would make her use her male birth name and completely disregard, and disrespect, her identity as a trans-woman." [...] The Burnt Orange Report blog posted a reflective essay on her life along with photos and a plea to support homelessness.|$|E
2500|$|During Osbourne's {{appearance}} on The Graham Norton Show, she stated, {{in reference to}} Minogue, [...] "She knows she's there because of her looks, not because of her contribution to the music industry." [...] In a press conference held on 12 December 2007, when asked why she had been publicly talking about Minogue, Osbourne said [...] "It's an even playing field, Dannii speaks about me, I speak about her." [...] Minogue said in turn [...] "I've looked up to Sharon and Louis for years and I {{wanted to be part}} of that gang. But when they're slating you, you think: 'Please don't, I really like you.'" [...] Cowell admitted that Osbourne did not feel comfortable about having a new judge and that Osbourne and Minogue would never be [...] "the best of buddies," [...] adding that if Osbourne wanted to leave the show, he would <b>let</b> <b>her</b> (<b>in</b> fact, Osbourne left after series 4). The Daily Mail reported that Cowell was forced to sit the judges down, asking them to maintain a civil relationship with each other behind the scenes. The apparent flirting between Cowell and Minogue also generated comment in the popular media.|$|E

2500|$|Chekhov wrote The Cherry Orchard {{over the}} course of several years, {{alternating}} between periods of lighthearted giddiness and despondent frustration which he considered as bordering upon sloth (in a letter, he wrote, [...] "Every sentence I write strikes me as good for nothing.") Throughout this time he was also further inhibited by his chronic tuberculosis. Guarded by nature, Chekhov seemed overly secretive about all facets of the work, including even the title. As late as the Summer of 1902 he still had not shared anything about the play with anyone in his immediate family or the Moscow Art Theatre (MAT). It was only to comfort his wife, Olga Knipper (who was recovering from a miscarriage at the time), that he finally <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> on the play's title, whispering it to her despite the fact that the two were alone. Chekhov was apparently delighted with the very sound of the title, and enjoyed the same sense of triumph months later when he finally revealed it to Konstantin Stanislavski. By October 1903 the play was finished and sent to the MAT company. Three weeks later, Chekhov arrived at rehearsals in what would be a futile attempt to curb all the [...] "weepiness" [...] from the play which Stanislavski had developed. The author apparently also snickered when, during rehearsals, the word [...] "orchard" [...] was replaced with the more practical [...] "plantation", feeling that with that word he had perfectly and symbolically captured the impracticality of an entire way of life.|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 1972, a {{few weeks}} before the second trial was to start, Hill was shot dead by a masked gunman during a robbery at his mansion as Hill and his wife {{returned}} home from a medical conference in Las Vegas. The masked intruder forced his way into the Hills' home about a half hour before John and Connie Hill were due to arrive home. The man bound Hill's mother and son and taped their mouths with adhesive tape. When the Hills arrived, Connie rang the home's doorbell and was greeted by someone in a green mask she initially thought to be her stepson playing a joke. [...] The intruder grabbed Connie Hill, saying [...] "This is a robbery." [...] She was able to struggle away from him and run down the street. As she ran and called out for help, she heard shots fired. A neighbor heard her cries for help, <b>let</b> <b>her</b> <b>in,</b> and let her call the police. When the police and an ambulance arrived at the Hill home, they found John Hill in the foyer, face down. Standing over him was his 12-year-old son; feet and arms bound, he had managed to hop from a back room of the house. [...] The adhesive tape had come loose from his mouth and he cried, [...] "They've killed my daddy." [...] The ambulance attendant searched for vital signs but found none. When the body was turned over, Hill's eyes, nose and mouth were found to have been sealed shut with adhesive tape by his killer. The police noted this type of killing was prevalent in the local underworld. John Hill was beaten and shot three times: in the chest, shoulder and right arm.|$|E
