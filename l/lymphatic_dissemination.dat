40|$|Introduction: The {{presence}} of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> {{is an important}} predictor of survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). The {{aim of this study}} was to discover a prognostic gene expression pro. le for <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> in EA and to identify genes and pathways that provide oncological insight in <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Methods: Patients who had <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> (N = 55) were compared with patients without <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> (N = 22). Whole-genome oligonucleotide microarrays were used to evaluate the genetic signature of 77 esophageal cancers. Multiple random validation was used to analyze the stability of the molecular signature and predictive power. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was applied to elucidate oncogenetic pathways. Results: <b>Lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> was correctly predicted in 75 +/- 14 % of lymph node positive patients. The absence of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> was correctly predicted in 41 +/- 23 % of lymph-node-negative patients. Argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) was selected for validation on the protein level because it was present in most prognostic signatures as well as the list of differentially expressed genes. ASS expression was lower (P = 0. 048) in patients with <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> than in patients without. GSEA identified that arginine metabolism pathways and lipid metabolism pathways are related to less chance of developing <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Discussion: The predictive pro. le does not outperform current clinical practice to predict the {{presence of}} <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> in patients with EA.

40|$|<b>Lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> {{from the}} primary tumor is a major {{mechanism}} by which breast cancer cells access the systemic circulation, resulting in distant metastasis and mortality. Numerous studies link activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF- 1) with tumor angiogenesis, metastasis, and patient mortality.

In this study, we show that HIF- 1 promotes lymphatic metastasis of breast cancer by direct transactivation of the gene encoding platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGF-B), which has proliferative and chemotactic effects on lymphatic endothelial cells. Lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in mice bearing human breast cancer orthografts were blocked by administration of the HIF- 1 inhibitor digoxin or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib.

However, this will not explain the existence of endometriosis in the abdominal wall without any previous surgery.

Sampson’s theory postulated the implantation or retrograde menstruation hypothesis which states that endometrial tissue from the uterus is shed during menstruation and transported retrograde through the fallopian tubes, thereby gaining access to and implanting on pelvic structures [20 – 24]. Another theory suggests <b>lymphatic</b> or vascular <b>dissemination,</b> and a third explanation states that cells in the abdomen undergo metaplasia induced by hormonal manipulation [22].

50|$|In {{countries}} where cow milk infected with Mycobacterium bovis has been eliminated (due to culling of infected cows and pasteurization), primary tuberculosis is usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis {{and almost always}} begins in the lungs.

Tubercle bacilli, either free or within phagocytes, drain to the regional nodes, which also often caseate.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} known to {{metastasize}} primarily by the <b>lymphatic</b> system. <b>Dissemination</b> through <b>lymphatic</b> vessels represents an early step in regional tumor progression, {{and the presence of}} lymphatic metastasis is associated with a poor prognosis. In patients who have undergone a radical hysterectomy, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), assessed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, is a major factor for adjuvant therapy in patients with cervical cancer. With the advent of a lymphatic endothelial cell-specific marker, such as D 2 - 40, it is now possible to distinguish between blood and lymphatic space invasion (LSI). In this study, the utility of D 2 - 40 was assessed for the detection of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and identification of LSI. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 3 (VEGFR- 3), VEGF-C, tyrosine receptor kinase- 2, and angiopoietin- 1 were assessed by immunohistochemical methods on 50 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Clinicopathologic characteristics, including pelvic lymph node metastasis, were correlated with the above histochemical findings. We found that lymphangiogenesis, measured by an increase in peritumoral LVD, was significantly associated with positive lymph node status (P <. 005). VEGFR- 3 expression was significantly associated with LVD (P <. 05). D 2 - 40 staining verified LSI (P =. 03) and surpassed that of hematoxylin and eosin-identified LVSI (P =. 54).

In all LYVE- 1 -stained sections, LV (some of which contained red blood cells) were frequently found localised in extralobular stroma, dermis, connective tissue stroma and adjacent to artery and vein, but were rare within the intralobular stroma or the tumour body (3 / 67 cases) or areas of widespread invasion. In contrast small blood vessels were observed in intra- and extralobular stroma in the factor VIII-stained sections. Quantitation of vessel numbers revealed that LYVE- 1 /PCAB detected a significantly larger number of LV than either HandE or LYVE- 1 /MCAB (P< 0. 0001). LYVE- 1 /PCAB detected LVI in 25 / 67 cases (37. 3 %) and their presence was significantly associated with both lymph node metastasis (chi(2) = 4. 698, P= 0. 0248) and unfavourable overall survival (OS) (P= 0. 0453), while not relapse- free survival (RFS) (P= 0. 2948).

40|$|<b>Lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination</b> is a {{key event}} in {{cervical}} cancer progression and related tumor lymphatic markers are viewed as promising prognostic factor of nodal extension. However, validating such parameters requires an objective characterization of the lymphatic vasculature. Here, we performed a global analysis of the lymphatic network using a new computerized method applied on whole uterine cervical digital images. Sixty-eight cases of cervical neoplasia (12 CIN 3, 10 FIGO stage 1 A and 46 stage IB 1) and 10 cases of normal cervical tissue were reacted with antibodies raised against D 2 - 40, D 2 - 40 /p 16 and D 2 - 40 /Ki 67. Immunostained structures were automatically detected on whole slides. The lymphatic vessel density (D 2 - 40), proliferating lymphatic vessel density (D 2 - 40 /ki 67) and spatial lymphatic distribution in respect to the adjacent epithelium were assessed from normal cervix to early cervical cancer and correlated with lymphovascular space invasion and lymph node status. Prominent lymphatic vessel density and proliferating lymphatic vessel density are detected under the transformation zone of benign cervix and no further increase is noted during cancer progression. Notably, a shift of lymphatic vessel distribution toward the neoplastic edges is detected. In IB 1 cervical cancer, although intra- and peritumoral lymphatic vessel density are neither correlated with lymphovascular space invasion nor with lymph node metastasis, a specific spatial distribution with more lymphatic vessels {{in the vicinity of}} tumor edges is predictive of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Herein, we provide a new computerized method suitable for an innovative detailed analysis of the lymphatic network.

Spermatic cord sarcomas (SCS) of the genitourinary tract account for 2 % of all urological tumors. Herein we presented our {{experience in the}} treatment of these tumors and a review of the literature. Patients and Methods: A review of the literature was performed using the Medline database with no restriction on language and date of published papers. The literature search used the following terms: epidemiology, surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and spermatic cord sarcomas. Four cases treated from December 2009 to May 2010 are described. Results: All patients were treated with radical orchiectomy. The final pathological report showed different types of sarcomas. Two of the patients were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. 12 months after surgery, 2 / 4 patients were alive without signs of relapse. Conclusion: SCS are very rare tumors with a poor prognosis. SCS's prognostic factors have been identified in grading, size, depth of invasion and surgical margin status. Age and performance status of the patient are however very important. <b>Lymphatic</b> and hematogenous <b>dissemination</b> is uncommon.
