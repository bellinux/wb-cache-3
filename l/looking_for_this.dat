They are also found in a limited number of creeks in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevier County, Tennessee. These salamanders are very rarely encountered in either area. One <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> species is more likely to find E. junaluska in larger rocky streams in colder weather. Another popular way of spotting this species is late-night driving along roads on rainy nights. They can be seen moving between the terrestrial habitat they inhabit and the areas where they breed.|$|E
500|$|The band were {{adamant about}} not {{replacing}} Duane's {{position in the}} band. Les Dudek, the guitarist who would eventually record [...] "Jessica" [...] and [...] "Ramblin' Man," [...] had entered the sessions {{when he was asked}} to jam with Betts through mutual friends. The band enjoyed how Dudek played and Phil Walden, the band's manager, seemed set on Dudek being in the band. Word of mouth, propagated by Dudek himself, was that he [...] "got the gig" [...] and had become the Allman Brothers' new co-lead guitarist. [...] "We went <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> dude to kick his ass. Nobody was going to replace Duane and the very thought of it was infuriating to us," [...] said Trucks. After recording completed, Dudek went on the road with Boz Scaggs and the Steve Miller Band. He wanted to end his contract with Phil Walden at Capricorn, and part of his release granted him no part of the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters, including a songwriting credit for [...] "Jessica", as he had no written contract.|$|E

2500|$|Seems Zoya Vinogradova was {{an actress}} only and before {{performance}} of Mister X {{her name and}} family name could be jargoned due to Mister X Intelligence services program. It can be confirmed by jargon [...] "a poisonous snake" [...] with has commencement from 1970-x. One school-girl Zoya and her parents were sent to Odessa in 1974 or 1975 from the Volga region about. She became a school-girl of one school in Odessa. It was needed, that one school-boy Yuriy had to feel the love to this girl Zoya, and it succeeded. Next step was to let know for this boy that Zoya means dangerous. When the boy was <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> girl she became smile and said roughly: [...] "What are you looking?" [...] Other boys and girl pay attention and it is shamefully for the boy. The poet and writer Alexander Pushkin verse [...] "Oleg Prophetic" [...] {{was included in the}} program of this class during that period. Personage Oleg Prophetic died due to snake bite, the snake was described by the poet as [...] "the snake under a boot tree". The word snake on Russian is [...] "змея" [...] (zmeya), pronunciation is close to Zoya. The boy Yuriy (short name Yura) was looking at the girl Zoya and he thought: [...] "A Snake under a boot tree". In 1977, and of eight class education, girls of this class gave one to another and to some school-boys own special note-books where had to be mentioned any wishes or remarks as last two classes could be completed by girls and boys, who wished to continue education in any institute, high school or academy. It was possible after completion of 10 classes education. Everybody could check what was written by others and the boy Yura sow that Zoy wrote in one note-book: [...] "The love does not exist." [...] Zoya and her parent back from Odessa to Volga region in 1977. The boy Yuriy remembered that it was just switching from the previous love to Zhoya and his love to Zoya was switched off after Zoya departure. Later he understood that behind him was family with equipment and their boy Oleg received nickname [...] "Oleg Prophetic". Seems Zoya arrived in Odessa for short time to mentioned who will stay with equipment behind Yura. Jargon [...] "Zoya" [...] is [...] "a dangerous snake" [...] was promulgated, seems to avoid anybody understand really situation. The boy Yuriy does not call any Zoya as a snake. Really the boy Oleg became a [...] "snake" [...] for Yuriy later. It is example, how new meanings of words could enter the Russian language. It is means that some jargon could enter during the Mister X filming or later. Seems all jargon of the word [...] "виноград" [...] (...) entered during the Mister X filming or later. And really, the festival's bride was a problem for KGB due to plenty questions and misunderstandings.|$|E

60|$|Toward {{the close}} of that {{afternoon}} three wild beasts came around {{the point of the}} bluff and made their way northward along the beach. They were ferocious creatures with shaggy hair and beards. Two of them carried guns, and each of them had a knife in his belt. When they came to a broad bit of beach above the reach of the waves, they were very much surprised at some footsteps they saw. They were the tracks of two men, instead of those of the one they were <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> <b>This</b> discovery made them very cautious. They were eager to kill the escaped African before he got far enough away to give information of their retreat, for they knew not at what time an armed force in search of them might approach the coast.

She was then in charge of some black people, he did not know of what tribe, who, he believed, had found her wandering in the bush. He noted that the black people seemed to treat her with the greatest reverence, although they could not understand what she said. On the following day, whilst searching for six lost goats, he was captured by Arabs who, he heard afterwards, were out <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> white woman. The day after the man had told me this, he was seized with inflammation of the lungs, of which, being in a weak state from his sufferings in the slave gang, he quickly died. Now you will understand why I was not particularly anxious to revisit Kilwa." ...|$|E
