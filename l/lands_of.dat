5|$|Before he {{controlled}} Deddington, Chesney temporarily {{administered the}} <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> Robert d'Oilly, {{who had previously}} held Oxford Castle but had defected {{to the side of}} the Empress Matilda in 1141 and died a year later. D'Oilly's heir took refuge with Matilda when Stephen overran his lands two weeks after his father's death, leading to Chesney's control of the d'Oilly lands. Some historians have seen this holding of the lands as Stephen giving Chesney the d'Oilly barony, but the only evidence for this is that Chesney eventually owned a manor previously belonging to d'Oilly which does not necessarily mean that he received the whole barony. It is far more likely that Stephen gave Chesney parts of the <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> William fitzOsbern, which had reverted to the king in 1075. Most of the known <b>lands</b> <b>of</b> fitzOsbern are known to have been owned by Chesney or by tenants who held the lands from him.|$|E
