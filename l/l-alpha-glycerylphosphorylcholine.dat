40|$|SummaryCurrent neuroimaging {{techniques}} have very limited abilities to directly identify and quantify neurotransmitters from brain sections. We {{have developed a}} molecular-specific approach for the simultaneous imaging and quantitation of multiple neurotransmitters, precursors, and metabolites, such as tyrosine, tryptamine, tyramine, phenethylamine, dopamine, 3 -methoxytyramine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, acetylcholine, and <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine,</b> in histological tissue sections at high spatial resolutions. The method is employed to directly measure changes in the absolute and relative levels of neurotransmitters in specific brain structures in animal disease models {{and in response to}} drug treatments, demonstrating the power of mass spectrometry imaging in neuroscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (alpha-GPC), a {{putative}} acetylcholine precursor, on the EEG power spectrum in rats were investigated. The {{results show that}} the oral administration of alpha-GPC (100 - 300 - 600 mg/kg) induced a significant decrease in absolute spectral energy in the delta frequency band. A significant increase in absolute spectral energy in the beta frequency band was elicited by alpha-GPC at dose levels of 100 and 300 mg/kg, while the administration of a higher dose (600 mg/kg) of this compound resulted in the loss of response (bell-shaped dose-response curve). No significant changes in the EEG power spectrum were found in rats treated with phosphatidylcholine (PC). The present data, suggesting that the electrocorticographic (ECoG) activation elicited by alpha-GPC may be correlated with its stimulatory effect on brain acetylcholine release, further extend the pharmacological profile of this new cognition enhancer...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the cholinomimetic {{properties}} of the drug <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (alpha-GPC) at CNS level. Experiments using tritium labelled alpha-GPC indicate that the drug reaches the brain after i. p. and per os administration. In order to study the cholinomimetic properties of this drug an indirect functional index of cholinergic activation was used. In fact cholinergic agonists induce an activation of striatal dopaminergic output. alpha-GPC both i. p. and per os administered increased striatal dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) content. In addition, the in vitro K+ stimulated dopamine release was increased in rats treated in vivo with alpha-GPC. Since alpha-GPC has a weak displacing activity in QNB binding, the in vivo cholinergic activity {{might be due to}} the fact that this drug may increase the availability of choline for acetylcholine synthesis leading to increased acetylcholine production. This activity may be useful in those situations such as aging in which cholinergic activity is deficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (alpha-GPC) on scopolamine-induced memory {{impairment}} and on brain acetylcholine (ACh) synthesis and release were investigated in rats. Oral administration of alpha-GPC 3 h before the behavioural test prevented the learning impairment induced by scopolamine given 30 min before {{the acquisition of}} a passive avoidance response. Similarly, retrograde amnesia induced by scopolamine, given immediately after acquisition training, was also completely reversed by the drug. These effects were dose-dependent with a maximum at 300 mg/kg. The mechanism of action of this compound was investigated by measuring hippocampal ACh synthesis and release both in vivo {{by means of the}} microdialysis technique and in vitro in tissue slices. alpha-GPC dose dependently increased ACh release with a maximum at 300 mg/kg. In addition, i. v. injection of [14 C]alpha-GPC resulted in [14 C]ACh formation. The data suggest that the behavioural effects of alpha-GPC may be related to its property to increase hippocampal ACh synthesis and release...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GPC), a deacylatedphosphatidylcholine derivative, {{can influence the}} mitochondrial respiratory activity and in this way, may exert tissue protective effects. Rat liver mitochondria were examined with high-resolution respirometry to analyze the effects of GPC on the electron transport chain in normoxic and anoxic conditions. Besides, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham operation or standardized liver ischemia-reperfusion (IR), with or without GPC administration. The reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the tissue myeloperoxidase, xanthine oxidoreductase and NADPH oxidases activities were measured. Tissue malondialdehyde and nitrite/nitrate formation, together with blood superoxide and hydrogen-peroxide production were assessed. GPC increased the efficacy of complex I-linked mitochondrial oxygen consumption, with significantly lower in vitro leak respiration. Mechanistically, liver IR injury was accompanied by deteriorated mitochondrial respiration and enhanced ROS production and, as a consequence, by significantly increased inflammatory enzyme activities. GPC administration decreased the inflammatory activation {{in line with the}} reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress markers. GPC, by preserving the mitochondrial complex I function respiration, reduced the biochemical signs of oxidative stress after an IR episode. This suggests that GPC is a mitochondria-targeted compound that indirectly suppresses the activity of major intracellular superoxide-generating enzymes...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of aging and}} of <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GFC) treatment on the acetylcholine synthesizing and degradating enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and on cholinergic muscarinic M- 1 and M- 2 receptors were assessed in the hippocampus using immunocytochemical, histochemical and radioligand binding techniques, respectively. The investigation was performed on male Wistar rats of 2 months (young), 12 months (adult), and 27 months (old). Oral GFC was given at the dose of 100 mg/Kg/day from the 21 st to the 27 th month of age. ChAT revealed the highest immunostaining in the hippocampus of adult rats followed by young and old animals. The highest expression of AChE reactivity was noticeable in the hippocampus of adult rats followed by old and young animals. Treatment with GFC restored in part ChAT immunoreactivity and AChE reactivity in the hippocampus of aged rats. Muscarinic M- 1 and M- 2 receptors were labeled with [3 H]-pirenzepine and [3 H]-AF-DX- 116 respectively. The density of M- 1 muscarinic receptors decreased with age, whereas M- 2 muscarinic receptors did not change. GFC treatment countered in part the loss of M- 1 receptors in old rats and was without effect on M- 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|Ionizing {{radiation}} plays a {{major role}} in the treatment of brain tumors, but side-effects may restrict the efficacy of therapy. In the present study, our goals were to establish whether the administration of <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GPC) can moderate or prevent any of the irradiation-induced functional and morphological changes in a rodent model of hippocampus irradiation. Anesthetized adult (6 -weeks-old) male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 40 Gy irradiation of one hemisphere of the brain, without or with GPC treatment (50 mg/kg bw by gavage), the GPC treatment continuing for 4 months. The effects of this partial rat brain irradiation on the spatial orientation and learning ability of the rats were assessed with the repeated Morris water maze (MWM) test. Histopathologic (HP) evaluation based on hematoxylin-eosin and Luxol blue staining was performed 4 months after irradiation. The 40 Gy irradiation resulted in a moderate neurological deficit at the levels of both cognitive function and morphology 4 months after the irradiation. The MWM test proved to be a highly sensitive tool for the detection of neurofunctional impairment. The site navigation of the rats was impaired by the irradiation, but the GPC treatment markedly decreased the cognitive impairment. HP examination revealed lesser amounts of macrophage density, reactive gliosis, calcification and extent of demyelination in the GPC-treated group. GPC treatment led to significant protection against the cognitive decline and cellular damage, evoked by focal brain irradiation at 40 Gy dose level. Our study warrants further research on the protective or mitigating effects of GPC on radiation injuries...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Choline-containing dietary phospholipids, {{including}} phosphatidylcholine (PC), may {{function as}} anti-inflammatory substances, but the mechanism remains largely unknown. We investigated {{the effects of}} <b>l-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GPC), a deacylated PC derivative, in a rodent model of small intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Methods Anaesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, mesenteric IR (45 min mesenteric artery occlusion, followed by 180 min reperfusion), IR with GPC pretreatment (16. 56 mg kg- 1 GPC i. v., 5 min prior to ischaemia) or IR with GPC post-treatment (16. 56 mg kg- 1 GPC i. v., 5 min prior to reperfusion) groups. Macrohaemodynamics and microhaemodynamic parameters were measured; intestinal inflammatory markers (xanthine oxidoreductase activity, superoxide and nitrotyrosine levels) and liver ATP contents were determined. Results The IR challenge reduced the intestinal intramural red blood cell velocity, increased the mesenteric vascular resistance, the tissue xanthine oxidoreductase activity, the superoxide production, and the nitrotyrosine levels, and the ATP content of the liver was decreased. Exogenous GPC attenuated the macro- and microcirculatory dysfunction and provided significant protection against the radical production resulting from the IR stress. The GPC pretreatment alleviated the hepatic ATP depletion, the reductions in the mean arterial pressure and superior mesenteric artery flow, and similarly to the post-treatments with GPC, also decreased the xanthine oxidoreductase activity, the intestinal superoxide production, the nitrotyrosine level, and normalized the microcirculatory dysfunction. Conclusions These data demonstrate the effectiveness of GPC therapies and provide indirect evidence that the anti-inflammatory effects of PC could be linked to a reaction involving the polar part of the molecule. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Choline-containing {{phospholipids}} were {{proposed as}} cognition enhancing agents, but evidence on their activity is controversial. CDP-choline (cytidine- 5 ´-diphosphocholine, CDP) and choline alphoscerate (<b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine,</b> GPC) represent the choline-containing phospholipids with larger clinical {{evidence in the}} treatment of sequelae of cerebrovascular accidents and of cognitive disorders. These compounds which display mainly a cholinergic profile interfere with phospholipids biosynthesis, brain metabolism and neurotransmitter systems. Dated preclinical studies and clinical evidence suggested that CDP-choline may have also a monoaminergic profile. The present study was designed to assess the influence of treatment for 7 days with choline-equivalent doses (CDP-choline: 325 mg/Kg/day; GPC: 150 mg/Kg/day) of these compounds on brain dopamine (DA), and serotonin (5 -HT) levels and on DA plasma membrane transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT 1 and VMAT 2), serotonin transporter (SERT), and norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the rat. Frontal cortex, striatum and cerebellum were investigated by HPLC with electrochemical detection, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis and ELISA techniques. CDP-choline did not affect DA levels, which increased after GPC administration in frontal cortex and cerebellum. GPC increased also 5 -HT levels in frontal cortex and striatum. DAT was stimulated in frontal cortex and cerebellum by both CDP and GPC, whereas VMAT 2, SERT, NET were unaffected. VMAT 1 was not detectable. The above data indicate that CDP-choline and GPC possess a monoaminergic profile and interfere to some extent with brain monoamine transporters. This activity on a relevant drug target, good tolerability and safety of CDP-choline and GPC suggests that these compounds may merit further investigations in appropriate clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|Background: We {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the microcirculatory consequences of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury {{and the effects of}} <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GPC), a deacylated phospholipid derivative, on postischemic hepatocellular damage, with special emphasis on the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase type 4 (NOX 4), which is predominantly expressed in hepatic microvessels. Materials and methods: Anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 60 -min ischemia of the left liver lobes and 180 -min reperfusion, with or without GPC treatment (50  mg/kg intravenously 5  min before reperfusion, n =  6 each). A third group (n =  6) served as saline-treated control. Noninvasive online examination of the hepatic microcirculation was performed hourly by means of modified spectrometry. Plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB 1), plasma aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, tissue xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities, and expressions of NOX 2 and NOX 4 proteins were determined. Results: Liver IR resulted in significant increases in NOX 2 and NOX 4 expressions and XOR and MPO activities, and approximately 2 -fold increases in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and HMGB 1. The microvascular blood flow and tissue oxygen saturation decreased by ∼ 20 % from control values. GPC administration ameliorated the postischemic microcirculatory deterioration and reduced the liver necroenzyme levels significantly; the NOX 4 expression, MPO activity, and HMGB 1 level were also decreased, whereas the NOX 2 expression, TNF-α level, and XOR activity were not influenced by GPC pretreatment. Conclusions: NOX 4 activation is a decisive component in the IR-induced microcirculatory dysfunction. Exogenous GPC ameliorates the inflammatory activation, and preserves the postischemic microvascular perfusion and liver functions, these effects being associated with a reduced hepatic expression of NOX 4. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|SUMMARY Methane (CH 4) was earlier {{thought to}} be {{produced}} in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract by methanogenic bacterial fermentation, under strictly anaerobic conditions. Humans can be CH 4 producers or CH 4 nonproducers, depending {{on the presence of}} methanogenic strains, age, race and lifestyle. The producer status, or a higher CH 4 level in the exhaled breath, is considered to be associated with various GI disorders, such as chronic constipation or lactose malabsorption. Nevertheless, the exclusivity of bacterial CH 4 formation was challenged recently when in vitro and in vivo studies revealed the possibility of non-microbial CH 4 formation in mitochondria and eukaryote cells, in both plants and animals. The classical CH 4 detection method is based on gas chromatography, which has many limitations, and real-time measurement is not possible. We set out to develop a photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) -based on-line method with appropriate specificity and sensitivity to describe the process of CH 4 emission in rodents and also in human volunteers. Our next objective was to investigate nonbacterial biotic methanogenesis and to shed light on the mechanistic details of the reaction. The initial in vitro studies led to the proposal that a continuous lack of the electron acceptor oxygen will maintain an elevated mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio, causing reductive stress. Electrophilic methyl groups bound to positively-charged nitrogen moieties, such as in phosphatidylcholine molecules, may potentially act as substitute electron acceptors, and in consequence CH 4 may be liberated. Thus, priming during hypoxia occurs as a progressive process involving depressed electron transport, the loss of cytochrome c and antioxidants, and the triggering of methane release during the abnormal formation of reactive oxygen species induced by reoxygenation or reperfusion. We therefore hypothesized that the formation and emission of CH 4 in mammals may be connected with hypoxic events leading to, or associated with a mitochondrial dysfunction. A further aim was to influence the consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction by the administration of a water-soluble, deacylated derivative of phosphatidylcholine, <b>L-alpha-glycerylphosphorylcholine</b> (GPC). Here, we took into account the earlier in vivo findings that GPC is a centrally-acting cholinergic precursor which increases the tolerance to ischemic tissue damage and is clinically effective in various neurodegenerative diseases. We assumed that GPC treatment could moderate the CH 4 generation and also the inflammatory consequences of experimental oxidoreductive stress. In three parallel studies, we determined data on the applicability of a novel PAS-based instrument. As compared with gas chromatography, this allows real-time and dynamic measurements, while the gas-sampling procedure does not demand the use of disposable bags or syringes and operates without chemicals. The use of the instrument is noninvasive, allows the detection of the whole-body gas emission of rodents and is appropriate for human exhaled breath analysis too. Moreover, it is relatively cost-effective due to the application of near-infrared diode lasers. After the development of an appropriately specific and sensitive detection system for CH 4, we investigated the functional role of mitochondrial electron transport in biogenesis. We demonstrated that the extent of CH 4 generation is significantly increased in rodents exposed to chronic sodium azide challenge or endotoxemia. The phenomenon proved to be independent of the methanogenic flora, since the CH 4 emission was also elevated in antibiotic-treated groups. As endotoxemia and specific inhibition of mitochondrial complex IV with sodium azide led to an increased CH 4 output, we assumed that mitochondrial distress and the subsequent inflammatory reaction might be common denominators of CH 4 biogenesis. The results pointed to a possible role of CH 4 as an alarm signal for the development of mitochondrial responses under hypoxic conditions, and accordingly it may be a biomarker of such events. In our studies, the stress-induced CH 4 generation, the hepatic microcirculatory reduction and the increased pro-oxidant and inflammatory responses were markedly attenuated by GPC treatment. When the consequence of mesenteric ischemia/reperfusion, or gamma-irradiation of the hippocampus were investigated, it emerged that GPC maintained the decreased ATP content of the liver. In conclusion, the results suggest that PAS-based spectroscopy is an excellent approach for CH 4 detection, not only in animal experiments, but also in human investigations. CH 4 production in mammals is connected with hypoxic events and is associated with a mitochondrial dysfunction. GPC is protective against the inflammatory consequences of a hypoxic reaction that might involve cellular or mitochondrial CH 4 generation. ...|$|E
