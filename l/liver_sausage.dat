Nowadays þorramatur is mostly eaten during the ancient Nordic month of þorri, in January and February, {{as a tribute}} to old culture. Þorramatur consists of many different types of food. These are mostly offal dishes like pickled ram's testicles, putrefied shark, singed sheep heads, singed sheep head jam, black pudding, <b>liver</b> <b>sausage</b> (similar to Scottish haggis) and dried fish (often cod or haddock) with or without butter.|$|E
60|$|So when I {{returned}} I {{crossed the}} ante-chamber and walked past {{him with my}} accustomed dignity; nor did he offer any comment on my get-up. I often affected a disguise in those days, even when I was not engaged in business, and the dress and get-up of a respectable commissionnaire was a favourite one with me. As soon as I had changed I sent him out to make purchases for our luncheon--five sous' worth of stale bread, and ten sous' worth of <b>liver</b> <b>sausage,</b> {{of which he was}} inordinately fond. He would take the opportunity on the way of getting moderately drunk on as many glasses of absinthe as he could afford. I saw him go out of the outer door, and then I set to work to examine the precious document.|$|E

60|$|When Tur-il-i-ra {{perceived}} them, he arose {{and welcomed}} them heartily, remembering Trumkard {{as an old}} friend. He caused them to be seated on the porch, and ordered water to be brought that they might free themselves from the dust of the journey.

40|$|Chemical {{parameters}} {{obtained for}} 280 samples {{randomly selected from}} a variety of ready-to-eat meat products were used to assess nutritional value and wholesomeness. The products investigated in this study include wieners, bologna, meat loaves, <b>sausages,</b> <b>liver</b> products and mortadella. Evaluations of gross composition (moisture, fat, protein,) were found to be insufficient to fully characterize these products. Fat/protein and water/protein quotients reflected well on the nutritional quality. Limitations in the application of these and other parameters are shown. Correlations of physico-chemical parameters such as redox-potential and available water to susceptibility to bacterial spoilage within this closely defined group were statistically insignificant...|$|R
50|$|Another {{typically}} Twents food is bakleaverworst (roughly {{translated as}} baked <b>liver</b> <b>sausage),</b> mostly abbreviated to bakworst.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi validar um método de determinação de zinco eritrocitário (ZnER) por espectrofotometria de absorção atômica (EAA), avaliar com esse parâmetro o estado nutricional em Zn de mulheres adultas, relacioná-lo com a ingestão dietética diária, identificando os alimentos fonte do mineral. O método foi validado com limites de detecção e de quantificação de 0, 006 e 0, 045 (0, 013) migZn/mL, respectivamente, e níveis de exatidão e de imprecisão intra-ensaio e inter-ensaio de 95 (0, 4) %, 3, 6 % e 5, 3 %, respectivamente. A ingestão média de Zn do grupo (n= 21) foi de 9, 7 (3) mgZn/dia e 15 desses resultados estão acima da RDA de 8 mg/d e 4 abaixo da EAR de 6, 8 mg/d (Institute of Medicine/ 2000 b). A concentração média de ZnER foi de 38, 2 (5) mgZn/gHb, valor menor do que o encontrado por outros autores para o mesmo gênero e estágio de vida. As fontes de Zn da dieta do grupo (> 1, 2 mg Zn/ 100 g) foram: carnes bovina e suína, fígado bovino, linguiça, queijos dos tipos prato, branco, gouda e mussarela e amendoim. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} a method for determining erythrocytic Zn (ZnER) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), in order to evaluate, with this parameter, the Zn nutriture of adult women (n= 21), and to relate it with the dietary daily Zn ingestion by the group. The method was validated with limits of detection and quantification of 0. 006 and 0. 045 (0. 013) mgZn/mL, respectively, and accuracy and intra and inter-assay coefficients of variation of 95 (0. 4) %, 3. 6 % and 5. 3 %, respectively. The average daily ingestion of Zn by the adult women was 9. 7 (3) mgZn/d, 15 of them had intake levels above the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 8 mg/d (RDA/ 2001) and 4 below the Estimated Average Requirement of 6, 8 mg/d (EAR / 2001). The average concentration of ZnER was 38. 2 (5) mgZn/gHb, a value lower than that found by other authors for the same age and gender group.

40|$|A case of food {{poisoning}} outbreak involving Aeromonas hydrophila is {{reported in this}} study. A group of 27 people consumed a typical Swedish food “landgång” which {{is a type of}} smörgåsbord containing shrimps with mayonnaise, <b>liver</b> paté, ham, <b>sausage,</b> and legume salad which was purchased from a food store. Twenty-two of the 27 persons became ill within 20 - 34 hr of consumption of the food and reported the symptoms ranging from severe acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever and vomiting. One person also fainted. The symptoms lasted for a couple of days. Of the remaining 5 healthy persons who consumed the left-over food the next day, 2 became ill with similar symptoms. The bacteriological examination of left-over food samples resulted in the isolation of A. hydrophila from shrimps with mayonnaise, smoked <b>sausage,</b> <b>liver</b> paté and boiled ham. The total number of A. hydrophila in these foods were log 106 to log > 107 organisms per gram of food sample. A. hydrophila was however, not isolated from legume/mayonnaise salad samples. All the food samples tested showed low numbers of other expected food contaminating organisms such as coliforms at 37 C and 44 C, fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, fungi and yeast etc., while Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not detected in the food samples. Investigations of the virulence profiles of the A. hydrophila isolates showed their capacity to produce β-hemolysin, cytotoxins, cytotonic toxins, enterotoxins, and adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal (Henle 407) cells in culture...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} 730 faecal samples of offal (mainly <b>liver),</b> mince-meat and <b>sausage</b> meat collected from abattoirs and retail butchers' shops for campylobacters.

Specimens collected from abattoirs were, in general, more often contaminated than material obtained from retail butchers' shops. Only 1. 4 % of minced meats and sausage meats contained campylobacters. Most isolates (89. 5 %) were C. jejuni biotype 1 (Skirrow & Benjamin, 1980) of serotypes 1 and 2 (Penner & Hennessy, 1980).
