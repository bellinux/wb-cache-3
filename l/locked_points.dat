Staff <b>locked</b> <b>points</b> were provided at the main line junction. In 1953 the main line was using the Electric Staff safeworking system, so a special procedure was required. A freight train would be despatched from Heidelberg with a 'Heidelberg to Macleod' electric staff. The train then proceeded to the junction, where it would be met by the signalman from Macleod carrying the 'Macleod to Mont Park' train staff. The staffs would be exchanged, the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' staff used to unlock the points so they could be set for the diverge, and the train allowed to proceed to Mont Park with the 'Macleod to Mont Park' staff. The signalman then reset the points to the main line, and returned the 'Heidelberg to Macleod' Electric staff to the Electric staff instrument to allow another train to use the main line. On the return from Mont Park the reverse procedure was carried out.|$|E

While reversing direction onto the other track required no outside intervention, running against the defined current of traffic would require train orders or the services of a pilotman and such ABS crossovers would feature either telephone communications with the train dispatcher or a structure that could serve as a temporary block station.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} of recertifying a loaded bearing member using ultrasound testing {{to compensate for}} different equipment configurations and temperature conditions. The standard frequency F 1 of a reference block is determined via an ultrasonic tone burst generated by a first pulsed phased locked loop (P 2 L 2) equipment configuration. Once a <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> number S is determined for F 1, the reference frequency F 1 a of the reference block is determined at this <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> number via a second P 2 L 2 equipment configuration to permit an equipment offset compensation factor Fo 1 =((F 1 -F 1 a) /F 1) (1000000) to be determined. Next, a reference frequency F 2 of the unloaded bearing member is determined using a second P 2 L 2 equipment configuration and is then compensated for equipment offset errors via the relationship F 2 +F 2 (Fo 1) / 1000000. A <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> number b is also determined for F 2. A resonant frequency F 3 is determined for the reference block using a third P 2 L 2 equipment configuration to determine a second offset compensation factor F 02 =((F 1 -F 3) /F 1) 1000000. Next the resonant frequency F 4 of the loaded bearing member is measured at <b>lock</b> <b>point</b> number b via the third P 2 L 2 equipment configuration and the bolt load determined by the relationship (- 1000000) CI(((F 2 -F 4) /F 2) -Fo 2), wherein CI is a factor correlating measured frequency shift to the applied load.

40|$|The {{design of}} the ILD FTD sub {{detector}} {{is one of the}} main tasks of the IFCA group. One of the main issues of tracking detectors is to know at each moment the exact position of every component. Having a deformation and displacement monitor system integrated in the sub detectors would be of great utility to deal with this task. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is the primary technique used in several areas for environmental and deformation monitor. Due to its light mass, their immunity to electromagnetic and magnetic fields and nuclear environments, multiplexing capability and the possibility to be embedded seems to be the best solution for our purpose. As a previous step, a technological demonstrator of FTD support-petals will be designed and manufactured with FBG sensors embedded in its carbon fiber sandwich structure. The aim will be to measure the deformation in predefined points of the demonstrator and calculate the deformed shape of the structure and the displacement between the <b>locked</b> <b>points</b> of the petal...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a new unambiguous acquisition and tracking technique for general Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) ranging signals, {{which will be}} used in modern GPS, European Galileo system and Chinese BeiDou system. The test criterion employed in this technique is based on a synthesized correlation function which completely removes positive side peaks while keeping the sharp main peak. Simulation results indicate that the proposed technique completely removes the ambiguity threat in the acquisition process while maintaining relatively higher acquisition performance for low order BOC signals. The potential false <b>lock</b> <b>points</b> in the tracking phase for any order BOC signals are avoided by using the proposed method. Impacts of thermal noise and multipath on the proposed technique are investigated; the simulation results show that the new method allows the removal of false <b>lock</b> <b>points</b> with slightly degraded tracking performance.

40|$|Introduction The {{critical}} phase, in jumping {{events in}} track and field, appears to be between touchdown and take-off. Since obvious similarities exist between the take off phase in both long jump and pole vault, numerous 3 D kinematics and electromyographic studies have only looked at long jump. Currently there are few detailed kinematics electromyographic data on the pole vault take-off phase. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to characterise kinematics and electromyographic variables during the take-off phase to provide a better understanding of this phase in pole vaulting and its role in performance outcome. Material and methods Six pole-vaulters took part in the study. Kinematics data were captured with retro reflective markers fixed on the body. Hip, knee and ankle angle were calculated. Differential bipolar surface electrodes were placed on the following muscles of the take-off leg: tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, bicep femoris and gluteus maximus. EMG activity was synchronously acquired with the kinematic data. EMG data were rectified and smoothed using a second order low pass Butterworth Bidirectional filter (resulting in a 4 th order filter) with a cut-off frequency of 14 Hz. Results Evolution of hip, knee and ankle angle show no significant differences during the last step before touchdown, the take-off phase and the beginning of fly phase. Meanwhile, strong differences in EMG signal are noted inter and intra pole vaulter. However for a same subject the EMG activities seem to converge to some phase <b>locked</b> <b>point.</b> Discussion All pole vaulters have approximately the same visible coordination This coordination reflects a different muscular control among pole vaulters but also for a considered pole vaulter. These phase <b>locked</b> <b>point</b> could be considered as invariant of motor control i. e. a prerequisite for a normal sequence of the movement and performance realization...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple scheme for {{tuneable}} relative frequency stabilization of lasers. A highly sensitive and accurate frequency-to-voltage converter {{is used to}} derive an error signal from the beat note between two lasers.

The results indicate that sub-kHz relative linewidth and a <b>locking</b> <b>point</b> drift {{on the order of}} 100 Hz for times scales of 1 h are achievable. The scheme can, therefore, be applied to situations where up to now only optical PLLs could provide sufficient accuracy and precision.

40|$|We propose and {{demonstrate}} a laser frequency stabilization scheme which generates a dispersion-like tunable Doppler-free dichroic lock (TDFDL) signal.

The method involves measurement of magnetically induced dichroism in an atomic vapour for a weak probe laser beam in presence of a counter propagating strong pump laser beam. A simple model is presented to explain the basic principles of this method to generate the TDFDL signal. The spectral shift in the locking signal is achieved by tuning the frequency of the pump beam. The TDFDL signal is shown to be useful for locking the frequency of a cooling laser used for magneto-optcal trap (MOT) for $^{ 87 }Rb$ atoms...|$|R
