5|$|On 29 April 1970, South Vietnamese and U.S. units {{unleashed}} a limited, multi-pronged Cambodian Campaign that Washington hoped would solve three problems: First, {{it would provide}} a shield for the American withdrawal from Vietnam (by destroying the PAVN logistical system and killing enemy troops) in Cambodia; second, it would provide a test for the policy of Vietnamization; third, it {{would serve as a}} signal to Hanoi that Nixon meant business. Despite Nixon's appreciation of Lon Nol's position, the Cambodian leader was not even informed in advance of the decision to send troops into his country. He <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> only after it had begun from the head of the U.S. mission, who had himself <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from a radio broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus on the character of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there {{when he learned that}} the Trinity test of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though {{this was the first time}} the Soviets had been officially given {{information}} about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> (through espionage) long before Truman did.|$|E

Stricklett {{played an important}} role in popularizing the spitball. Stricklett taught the spitball to Jack Chesbro, who saw him use the pitch while pitching in minor league baseball. Though Chesbro had experimented with the pitch in the minor leagues, Stricklett showed him how to master it in 1904. Stricklett taught it to Ed Walsh while they roomed together with the White Sox.|$|E

Ibn Baṭṭūṭa in the above quote may have had a millet couscous. Ibn Baṭṭūṭa also mentions rice couscous in the area of Mali in 1350. Millet couscous was never as popular as hard wheat couscous because it took longer to cook and didn’t taste as good.|$|E

25|$|By autumn 1939 a new {{degree of}} {{persecution}} loomed. The Nazi authorities started to deport Jewish Austrians and Gentile Austrians of Jewish descent to occupied Poland.

Grüber <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> by the Wehrmacht commander of Lublin and than protested at every higher ranking superior up to the then Prussian Minister-President Hermann Göring, who forbade further deportations from Prussia for the time being. The Gestapo warned Grüber never to adopt party for the deported again. The deported {{were not allowed to}} return.|$|E
25|$|Champe Ransom, whom Stevenson {{hired as}} an {{assistant}} in the 1970s, wrote an unpublished report about Stevenson's work, which Edwards cites in his Immortality (1992) and Reincarnation (1996). According to Ransom, Edwards wrote, Stevenson asked the children leading questions, filled in gaps in the narrative, did not spend enough time interviewing them, and left too long a period between the claimed recall and the interview; it was often {{years after the first}} mention of a recall that Stevenson <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> In only eleven of the 1,111 cases Ransom looked at had there been no contact between the families of the deceased and of the child before the interview; in addition, according to Ransom, seven of those eleven cases were seriously flawed. He also wrote that there were problems with the way Stevenson presented the cases, in that he would report his witnesses' conclusions, rather than the data upon which the conclusions rested. Weaknesses in cases would be reported in a separate part of his books, rather than during the discussion of the cases themselves. Ransom concluded that it all amounted to anecdotal evidence of the weakest kind.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Priestley's son William was {{presented}} to the French Assembly and granted letters of naturalization on 8 June 1792. Priestley <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from the Morning Chronicle. A decree of 26 August 1792 by the French National Assembly conferred French citizenship on Joseph Priestley and others who had [...] "served the cause of liberty" [...] by their writings. Priestley accepted French citizenship, considering it [...] "the greatest of honours". [...] In the French National Convention election on 5 September 1792, Joseph Priestley was elected to the French National Convention by at least two departments, (Orne and Rhône-et-Loire). However, he declined the honor, on the grounds that he was not fluent in French.|$|E
40|$|Teachers {{take on a}} {{wide range}} of roles in a school, yet most teacher {{education}} courses prepare students for only the role of classroom teacher. A problem-based learning approach to teaching and learning and IT-based resources in a technology-rich learning environment have been combined to provide under-graduate education students with an exciting and innovative way to <b>learn</b> <b>about</b> <b>IT</b> in schools.

500|$|Since {{at least}} the time of Ramon y Cajal (1852-1934), psychologists have speculated that the brain stores memory by {{altering}} the strength of connections between neurons that are simultaneously active. [...] This idea was formalized by Donald Hebb in 1949, but for many years remained unexplained. In 1973, Tim Bliss and Terje Lømo described a phenomenon in the rabbit hippocampus that appeared to meet Hebb's specifications: [...] a change in synaptic responsiveness induced by brief strong activation and lasting for hours or days or longer. [...] This phenomenon was soon referred to as long-term potentiation (LTP). [...] As a candidate mechanism for long-term memory, LTP has since been studied intensively, {{and a great deal}} has been <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> However, the complexity and variety of the intracellular signalling cascades that can trigger LTP is acknowledged as preventing a more complete understanding.|$|E

500|$|Asher {{is one of}} {{the four}} main {{characters}} in series two of EastEnders: E20, alongside Sol, Naz and Stevie. They were created by the programme's team of thirteen writers. Actor and singer Heshima Thompson auditioned for the series, having <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from his agent. Part of the process involved a dance audition with Tony Adigun, the leader of dance group Avant Garde. Thompson was subsequently cast as Asher, and the character and his casting were announced on 28 July 2010. Deborah Sathe, the show's producer, expressed pride in the writers and stated, [...] " [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." [...] Thompson called E20 [...] "a great project to be part of", and eagerly anticipated the dancing the role would entail. He later {{said in an interview with}} Daniel Kilkelly from entertainment news website Digital Spy that it was good to be able to combine his love of acting with his love of dance.|$|E

500|$|Secord wrote two {{accounts}} of her walk, {{the first in}} 1853, and the second in 1861. [...] Neither account contains details that can be corroborated with military {{accounts of}} the battle, such as specific dates or details about troops. Her account changed throughout her life. [...] Historian Pierre Berton noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack. [...] She told FitzGibbon {{that her husband had}} <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with treason had Secord revealed her source. [...] In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace producer, Tim Kaiser, in an {{interview}} with The New York Times, said that the doll's appearance was not any kind of [...] "forced" [...] product placement, as some speculated, explaining, [...] "It was just a natural fit, because Jack's affection for Cher is a thread that is running through the show already." [...] Kaiser continued saying that NBC [...] "saw the strength" [...] of the episode's storyline and understood that [...] "if a Cher doll is in the show that much, it's {{an integral part of the}} episode." [...] Kaiser said that [...] "Gypsies, Tramps and Weed" [...] writer Katie Palmer [...] "originally didn't know" [...] Mattel planned to market a Cher doll and <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> after working on the script. Curt King, a spokesman for NBC, further commented that the doll's role in the episode was due to the producers thinking of [...] "a lot of humor [...] would come out of it." [...] Mark Malinowski, senior vice president and director at Ketchum Entertainment Marketing, revealed that Mattel was launching the Cher doll and in a [...] "brainstorming meeting" [...] they mentioned Will & Grace as the Jack character in love with Cher. [...] "We thought it would be great to try to include the doll in a plot line of an episode because it would be organic, playing off something that already exists. I don't think any viewer will see this and think 'product placement.' [...] It's strategic for the product and relevant for the audience, particularly the gay men who watch the show because the characters of Jack and Will are gay." [...] It was also noted that Mattel did not pay a fee to the show's producers or NBC to have the Cher doll appear in the episode.|$|E
500|$|The game on May 1 in Philadelphia {{became a}} moment of peace in the rivalry during {{the top of the}} ninth inning. Mets' Daniel Murphy was batting as a pinch-hitter against Phillies' {{reliever}} Ryan Madson when the fans started chanting [...] "U-S-A!" [...] The Phillies didn't know the reason for the chants, but in the Mets' dugout, bench coach Ken Oberkfell told Manager Terry Collins that al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, had been killed by United States special operations forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Shane Victorino later told the Phillies the news. However, when asked how they <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> during an on-air telephone call with Mike and Mike in the Morning on ESPN Radio the next day, he said that a trainer in the dugout broke the news. Ryan Howard called the news [...] "an uplifting moment," [...] while Victorino said it was [...] "a special moment...for families...who...lost their loved ones...(on) 9/11" [...] and [...] "a big day in American history." [...] On the Mets' side, David Wright called it [...] "just an incredible moment and...you kind of come together...for a common cause", while Collins said that the Mets 21, 14-inning win behind Ronny Paulino's game-winning RBI double in his Mets debut was [...] "a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight", but felt they [...] "could have finished the game two hours ago and celebrated a little bit of it." [...] Mike Lopresti of USA Today called the game between the rivals [...] "a perfect fit" [...] when the news broke, while Adam Rubin of ESPNNewYork.com called the peace in the rivalry [...] "fitting" [...] for a Mets fan, and said that it drew parallels to their 32 win over rival Atlanta Braves on September 21, 2001 in the first major sporting event in New York City since the attacks.|$|E
