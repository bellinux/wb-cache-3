5|$|At another point, Voss {{was caught}} in a crossfire by at least five of his attackers but seemed unhurt. At about this point, Maybery withdrew with his aircraft's upper {{right-hand}} <b>longeron</b> holed in several places.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and <b>longeron,</b> to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E
25|$|The planes collided, {{with the}} nozzle of the {{refueling}} boom striking {{the top of}} the B-52 fuselage, breaking a <b>longeron</b> and snapping off the left wing, which resulted in an explosion that was witnessed by a second B-52 about a mile away. All four men on the KC-135 and three of the seven men on the bomber were killed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Longerons</b> often carry larger loads than {{stringers}} {{and also}} help to transfer skin loads to internal structure. <b>Longerons</b> nearly always attach to frames or ribs. Stringers often are not attached to anything but the skin, where they carry {{a portion of the}} fuselage bending moment through axial loading. [...] It is not uncommon to have a mixture of <b>longerons</b> and stringers in the same major structural component.|$|R
50|$|The Taupin had {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with its low pressure mainwheels mounted on V-struts hinged {{from the lower}} <b>longerons</b> and with a single telescopic strut on each side to the mid-upper <b>longerons,</b> though the drawing in L'Aéronatique shows a different, split axle undercarriage.|$|R
25|$|The wings were braced to the {{fuselage}} with a parallel pair of struts {{from the lower}} <b>longerons</b> to the spars at about mid-span assisted by N-form, cross-braced jury struts at right angles. Four very short struts from the upper fuselage <b>longerons</b> to the wing centre section formed a low cabane.|$|R
25|$|The hull was {{a normal}} frame and <b>longeron</b> design with chines. The tailplane, carried {{on top of the}} fin, had a very large dihedral, with smaller fins mounted on its tips {{perpendicular}} to its surface. A third fin was later added to the centre after testing of the first prototype had revealed an instability in yaw. This was added to the second prototype while it was still being constructed.|$|E
25|$|The {{empennage}} {{was very}} {{similar to that of the}} Latécoère 28, with a nearly triangular tailplane carrying split, tabbed elevators. The fin was also triangular, with a semi-circular, unbalanced but tabbed rudder. The undercarriage units were mounted at the end of each stub-wing, giving it a wide 5.70 m (18ft 8 in) track. The wheels were large, with low pressure tyres of 1,150mm diameter and 250mm width (45 × 10 in). Each unit had an axle, articulated at the lower <b>longeron,</b> and a pair of oleo legs fixed to the stub wing where the lift struts joined.|$|E
25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired interplane strut on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage <b>longeron.</b>|$|E
50|$|Its {{landing gear}} was fixed and conventional, with mainwheels on split, cranked axles {{mounted on a}} central {{inverted}} strut-pyramid from the lower fuselage <b>longerons.</b> There were rearward drag struts to the <b>longerons</b> as well as rubber cord shock absorbing struts. The undercarriage track was 1.30 m. The PM X had a short, castering tailskid.|$|R
25|$|The DP.VII's mainwheels were {{mounted on}} a single axle, {{conventionally}} rubber sprung to a cross member attached to the lower fuselage <b>longerons</b> by a V-form pair of struts on each side. Less conventionally, the undercarriage structure was braced by another, transverse, V-strut from the cross piece centre to the <b>longerons.</b> There was a sprung tail skid at the rear.|$|R
50|$|The C.251 had a fixed {{tail wheel}} {{undercarriage}} and the rudder was slightly cut away below {{to give the}} tail wheel leg room for movement. The main wheels were mounted on half-axles attached on the central fuselage underside and hinged on faired V-struts from the lower fuselage <b>longerons.</b> Landing loads were absorbed by legs also mounted on the lower <b>longerons.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 2 November 2007, a 27-year-old F-15C (AF Ser. No. 80-0034) of the 131st Fighter Wing, Missouri Air National Guard, crashed {{following}} an in-flight breakup due to structural failure during combat training near St. Louis, Missouri. The pilot, Major Stephen W. Stilwell, ejected but suffered serious injuries. On 3 November 2007, all non-mission critical F-15s were grounded pending the crash investigation's outcome. By 13 November 2007, over 1,100 F-15s were grounded worldwide after Israel, Japan and Saudi Arabia grounded their aircraft as well. F-15Es were cleared on 15 November 2007 pending individual inspections. On 8 January 2008, the USAF cleared 60 {{percent of the}} F-15A/B/C/D fleet to fly. On 10 January 2008, the accident review board released its report, which attributed the crash to the <b>longeron</b> not meeting specifications. On 15 February 2008, the Air Force cleared all F-15s for flight, pending inspections and any needed repairs. In March 2008, Stilwell {{filed a lawsuit against}} Boeing.|$|E
25|$|Fuselage {{structure}} was typical for the period, being welded chrome-moly tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in {{and covered with}} fabric. Wings were built around two solid spruce spars with the airfoil formed from trussed ribs made from plywood and spruce. The leading edge was covered in aluminum sheeting and the whole assembly covered in fabric. Ailerons were interconnected with a strut mounted to the trailing edge and on some versions were sheeted with ribbed aluminum. Most models were not fitted with flaps – the VKS-7F, built for the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) being the exception. It was fitted with split flaps only on the undersides of the upper wings and at mid chord, inboard and {{just ahead of the}} ailerons. Wing bracing was with a canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage <b>longeron,</b> there being no bracing wires. Elevators and rudder were built up from welded steel tubing braced with wire cables, and both could be trimmed, the elevators in flight and the rudder with a ground adjustable tab. Normally the main undercarriage was made up of a pair of vees, sprung with oleo/spring struts and provided with brakes as standard equipment, and a free-castoring tailwheel sprung with triangulated shock cords. was fitted to most aircraft, although a small number for Brazil were fitted with a tail skid. Floats were also offered as an option, starting with the UIC which had Edo P-3300 floats. Later types (including the UKC, YKC and CJC) were offered with Edo 38-3430 floats.|$|E
500|$|Structural fatigue was {{accelerated}} {{by at least}} a factor of eight in a low-altitude flight profile over that of high-altitude flying, requiring costly repairs to extend service life. In the early 1960s, the three-phase High Stress program was launched to counter structural fatigue, enrolling aircraft at 2,000 flying hours. Follow-up programs were conducted, such as a 2,000-hour service life extension to select airframes in 1966–1968, and the extensive Pacer Plank reskinning, completed in 1977. The wet wing introduced on G and H models was even more susceptible to fatigue, experiencing 60% more stress during flight than the old wing. The wings were modified by 1964 under ECP 1050. This {{was followed by a}} fuselage skin and <b>longeron</b> replacement (ECP 1185) in 1966, and the B-52 Stability Augmentation and Flight Control program (ECP 1195) in 1967. Fuel leaks due to deteriorating Marman clamps continued to plague all variants of the B-52. To this end, the aircraft were subjected to Blue Band (1957), Hard Shell (1958), and finally QuickClip (1958) programs. The latter fitted safety straps that prevented catastrophic loss of fuel in case of clamp failure. The B-52's service ceiling is officially listed as 50,000feet, but operational experience shows this is difficult to reach when fully laden with bombs. According to one source: [...] "The optimal altitude for a combat mission was around 43,000feet, because to exceed that height would rapidly degrade the planes range." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{tetrahedral}} beam {{that can}} be compactly stowed, sequentially deployed, and widely manipulated to provide a structurally sound yet highly maneuverable truss structure is comprised {{of a number of}} repeating units of tandem tetralhedral sharing common sides. Fixed length battens are jointed into equilateral triangles called batten frames. Apexes of adjacent triangles are interconnected by <b>longerons</b> having a mid-point folding hinge. Joints, comprised of gussets pivotabley connected by links, permit two independent degrees of rotational freedom between joined adjacent batten frames, and provide a stable structure from packaged configuration to complete deployment. The <b>longerons</b> and joints can be actuated in any sequence, independently of one another. The beam is suited to remote actuation. <b>Longerons</b> may be provided with powered mid-point hinges enabling beam erection and packaging under remote control. Providing one or more <b>longerons</b> with powered telescoping segments permits the shape of the beam central axis to be remotely manipulated so that the beam may function as a remote manipulator arm...|$|R
5|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main <b>longerons</b> {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached. The fuselage plating was 24, 20 and 18 gauge in order of thickness towards the tail, while the fin structure was completed using short <b>longerons</b> from frames 20 to 23, before being covered in 22 gauge plating.|$|R
2500|$|The Kittiwake's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} around four <b>longerons,</b> with flat sides and bottom and single curvature decking. [...] Its overwing cockpit has a rearward sliding canopy and its fixed tricycle undercarriage has cantilever angled steel spring main legs attached to the lower <b>longerons,</b> giving a track of 5ft 9 in (1.75 m). The Kittiwake I was powered by a 100hp (75kW) Continental O-200 flat four engine.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the common}} {{configuration}} {{the wings of}} the D.XVI and D.XVII were different. The D.XVIIs wings had constant chord and overhung ailerons. [...] It was mounted over the fuselage on each side with an inverted V-form strut pair from the leading edge to the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> and a second strut from the rear wing spar to the same <b>longeron</b> further aft. [...] The structure was stabilized laterally with a further outward leaning strut between top of the forward V-strut and the upper fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 2008, the USAF Air Combat Command (ACC) {{cleared a}} portion of its F-15A through D-model fleet for return to flying status. It also {{recommended}} a limited return to flight for units worldwide using the affected models. The accident review board report was released on 10 January 2008. The report stated that analysis of the F-15C wreckage determined that the <b>longeron</b> did not meet drawing specifications, which led to fatigue cracks and finally a catastrophic failure of the remaining support structures and breakup of the aircraft in flight. [...] In a report released on 10 January 2008, nine other F-15s were identified to have similar problems in the <b>longeron.</b> As {{a result of these}} problems, General John D. W. Corley stated that [...] "the long-term future of the F-15 is in question." [...] On 15 February 2008, ACC cleared all its grounded F-15A/B/C/D fighters for flight pending inspections, engineering reviews and any needed repairs. ACC also recommended release of other U.S. F-15A/B/C/D aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The G.M.G. II {{was a high}} wing, strut braced {{monoplane}} {{of wooden}} construction. Its wing had a single spar and was plywood covered from the spar forward to form a torsion resistant D-box. Behind the spar the wing was fabric covered. [...] It was braced on each side with a single, short, airfoil section strut to the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> and mounted centrally on an arched continuation of the upper fuselage structure from the engine installation, over the tandem cockpits, to behind the seating.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} of 14 longitudinal stringers and four main <b>longerons</b> {{attached to the}} frames helped form a light but rigid structure to which sheets of alclad stressed skinning were attached.

50|$|Construction of {{the boat}} is {{somewhat}} unorthodox: design has no frames at all. The plywood hull is constructed on the jig with <b>longerons</b> forming the hull shape; the <b>longerons</b> are in turn stiffened by two thwarts and the transom piece. The result is lightweight yet strong, quick-to-construct hull. This, combined with good performance {{of the boat}} has made it popular with homebuilders. Glass-reinforced plastic is also allowed as hull material.|$|R
50|$|The Kittiwake's {{fuselage}} {{is built}} around four <b>longerons,</b> with flat sides and bottom and single curvature decking. Its overwing cockpit has a rearward sliding canopy and its fixed tricycle undercarriage has cantilever angled steel spring main legs attached to the lower <b>longerons,</b> giving a track of 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m). The Kittiwake I was powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Continental O-200 flat four engine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was flat-sided, {{built up}} around four longerons which {{were made of}} spruce at the rear and ash forward of the cockpit. [...] Behind the cockpit, the fuselage narrowed in plan view in a gently curved way to the tail, but less usually Comper made the fuselage reduce in depth also; whilst the upper <b>longeron</b> was horizontal with the aircraft in flying position, the lower one was angled upwards. [...] The fin and rudder formed an approximate quadrant, though the unbalanced rudder extended down between the elevators to the fuselage bottom. [...] The nearly rectangular tailplane was mounted on the upper <b>longeron.</b> A standard curved decking, built up with stringers over frames topped the fuselage from front to rear. Forward of the cockpit the lower longerons curved strongly upwards and inwards, meeting the now inward curving upper members at the engine bulkhead, on which was mounted the 32hp (24kW) Bristol Cherub I flat-twin driving a two-bladed small diameter propeller. The single axle undercarriage was mounted {{on a pair of}} short V-shaped legs, each V cut out of plywood and mounted vertically on the lower longerons, so that the track was about 4ft (1.22 m). The CLA.2 sat close to the ground, with its wheels only slightly ahead of and below the wing leading edge.|$|E
2500|$|The Starduster has a {{recommended}} {{power range}} of [...] {{and is usually}} powered by a four-cylinder, horizontally opposed, 125hp (93kW) Lycoming O-290-D-1, though more powerful engines of up to 200hp (150kW) have been fitted. [...] It has a conventional tailwheel undercarriage. [...] The mainwheels are mounted on V-struts hinged from the lower fuselage <b>longeron,</b> with rubber shock absorbers on diagonal extension struts between wheel and a short, central, under fuselage V-form mounting bracket. [...] The main legs are often partially or completely faired and the wheels enclosed in spats.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{aircraft}} fuelled {{to fly the}} Atlantic {{was going}} to be heavy and undercarriage design was critical, as Martinsyde found to their cost. [...] The Atlantic used a split axle arrangement: on each side the short main leg extended from below the forward and innermost interplane strut. [...] There was a second member back to below the aft interplane strut and an axle from the large single wheel upwards and inwards, hinged to the lower fuselage <b>longeron.</b> [...] Shocks were absorbed by a combination of oleo-pneumatic and bungee elastic components. [...] At 21ft 0 in (6.40 m) the track was very wide.|$|E
50|$|The hull/fuselage had poplar frames, and <b>longerons</b> made of ash. The plywood-skinned hull had a {{double-layered}} bottom, with {{an external}} layer of cedar, while the flanks {{were made from}} orthogonally arranged laminates of cedar. The fabric-covered wings had spruce <b>longerons</b> and poplar ribs, utilising the low-weight and high-strength characteristics of these woods, and were painted to render them impermeable to water. Twin stabilising floats were mounted at mid-wing.|$|R
2500|$|The Blériot XII was a {{high wing}} tractor {{configuration}} monoplane with a deep uncovered fuselage, with the wings mounted on the upper <b>longerons</b> and the pilot and passenger seated between upper and lower <b>longerons</b> below {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Lateral control was effected by a pair of ailerons mounted independently of the wings on the lower <b>longerons</b> behind the pilot. The prototype was initially powered by an [...] E.N.V. Type D water-cooled engine mounted on the lower <b>longerons,</b> driving a two-bladed propeller mounted at the same level as the wing [...] via a chain with a reduction ratio of about 2:1. [...] When first flown the empennage consisted of an elevator at the extreme rear of the fuselage, with a separate fixed horizontal surface mounted above and in front of it, and three small rectangular rudders above the elevator. [...] After initial flight trials during May 1909 the rudders were removed. Various configurations were experimented with, the final arrangement being an elongated triangular fin with a rectangular unbalanced rudder hinged to the trailing edge.|$|R
5000|$|Fuselage of {{semi-monocoque}} construction employing <b>longerons</b> and bulkheads, with an ovoid cross-section. The cockpit {{is covered}} with a two-part acrylic glass canopy.|$|R
2500|$|The MS.341 had a {{conventional}} undercarriage {{with a small}} tailwheel. [...] Single mainwheels were mounted on V-form legs hinged centrally under the fuselage. [...] Vertical shock absorber in broad fairings were supported by an array of four struts, one to the forward lift strut's junction with the wing, one to the upper fuselage <b>longeron</b> and two to the lower one. [...] Most of the variants in the MS.340 family were powered by air-cooled inverted four cylinder in-line piston engines from either Renault or de Havilland. [...] The exception was the MS.343 variant which had a nine-cylinder Salmson 9N radial.|$|E
2500|$|The high {{wings of}} the 440 had exactly the same span of those of the 28 and the same plan away from the centre section, of {{constant}} chord with roughly elliptical tips. They were constructed from a mixture of wood and metal, based on two rectangular spars and fabric covered. [...] Double ailerons covered most of the straight part of the trailing edge. [...] There were a pair of very wide chord lift struts under each wing, linking the lower fuselage <b>longeron</b> to the two wing spars near mid-span. [...] The centre section was supported by four faired spars from points on the lift struts about 30% outboard, together with a steel cabane.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1917, Albatros {{received}} {{an order from}} the Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen) for an improved version of the D.III. The resulting D.V prototype flew later that month. The D.V closely resembled the D.III and used the same 127kW (170hp) Mercedes D.IIIa engine. The most notable difference was a new, fully elliptical cross-section fuselage which was [...] lighter than the partially flat-sided fuselage of the earlier D.I through D.III designs. The new elliptical cross-section required an additional <b>longeron</b> {{on each side of}} the fuselage and the fin, rudder and tailplane initially remained unchanged from the D.III. The prototype D.V retained the standard rudder of the Johannisthal-built D.III but production examples used the enlarged rudder featured on D.IIIs built by Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke (OAW). The D.V also featured a larger spinner and ventral fin.|$|E
50|$|Four spruce <b>longerons</b> {{formed the}} basis of the fuselage, which was plywood-covered forward from the cockpit area. The gunner's position, with a {{rotatable}} machine gun mounting, was close behind the smaller cockpit for the pilot. Both were equipped with heating and oxygen. Aft of the gunner the fuselage was fabric-covered apart from curved plywood decking. A clipped triangular tailplane mounted on the upper <b>longerons</b> carried near rectangular, horn-balanced elevators. The fin was straight-edged and the rudder also horn-balanced.|$|R
