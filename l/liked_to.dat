5|$|Olivier's stage {{roles in}} 1934 {{included}} Bothwell in Gordon Daviot's Queen of Scots, {{which was only}} a moderate success for him and for the play, but led to an important engagement for the same management (Bronson Albery) shortly afterwards. In the interim {{he had a great}} success playing a thinly disguised version of the American actor John Barrymore in Edna Ferber's Theatre Royal. His success was vitiated by his breaking an ankle two months into the run, in one of the athletic, acrobatic stunts with which he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> enliven his performances.|$|E

5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} {{in groups of}} three, {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, the first to record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E

He reported that Jude was camera shy and <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft-Lane that his name was actually Ste. Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities.|$|E

5|$|Barrel Roll {{was one of}} {{the most}} closely held secrets and one of the most unknown {{components}} of the American military commitment in Southeast Asia. Due to the ostensible neutrality of Laos, guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954 and 1962, both the U.S. and North Vietnam strove to maintain the secrecy of their operations and only slowly escalated military actions there. As much as both parties would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have publicized their enemy's own alleged violation of the accords, both had more to gain by keeping their own roles quiet. Regardless, by the end of the conflict in 1975, Laos emerged from nine years of war just as devastated as any of the other Asian participants in the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> experiment with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> make his runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; his approach would often lead {{his team to}} recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged {{that they were going}} to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} {{greatest}} impact on Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the daughter of one of his heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
