50|$|In 1878, William Kingdon Clifford {{published}} his Elements of Dynamic. Clifford developed split-biquaternions, {{which he called}} algebraic motors. Clifford obviated quaternion study by separating the dot product and cross product of two vectors from the complete quaternion notation. This approach made vector calculus available to engineers and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the <b>lead-lag</b> effect in the fourth dimension. Between 1880 and 1887, Oliver Heaviside developed the operational calculus (involving the D notation for the differential operator, which he is credited with creating), a method of solving differential equations by transforming them into ordinary algebraic equations which caused {{a great deal of}} controversy when introduced, owing to the lack of rigour in his derivation of it.

5000|$|With Wei-Xing Zhou, he has {{introduced}} the [...] "thermal optimal path" [...] method {{as a novel method}} {{to quantify the}} dynamical evolution of <b>lead-lag</b> structures between two time series.

Then, the lag-lead structure is searched for as the optimal path in the distance matrix landscape that minimizes the total mismatch between the two time series, and that obeys a one-to-one causal matching condition. The problem is solved mathematically by transfer matrix techniques, matching the TOP method to the problem of random directed polymers interacting with random substrates. Applications include the study of the relationships between inflation, inflation change, GDP growth rate and unemployment rate, volatilities of the US inflation rate versus economic growth rates, the US stock market versus the Federal funds rate and Treasury bond yields and the UK and US real-estate versus monetary policies.|$|E
5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the <b>lead-lag</b> hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called <b>lead-lag,</b> dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to elastomeric bearings. Elastomeric bearings are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|E

The distinction between coordinated signals and synchronized signals is very important. Synchronized signals all change {{at the same time and}} are only used in special instances or in older systems. Coordinated (progressed) systems are controlled from a master controller and are set up so lights [...] "cascade" [...] (progress) in sequence so platoons of vehicles can proceed through a continuous series of green lights. A graphical representation of phase state on a two-axis plane of distance versus time clearly shows a [...] "green band" [...] that has been established based on signalized intersection spacing and expected vehicle speeds. In some countries (e.g. Germany, France and the Netherlands), this [...] "green band" [...] system is used to limit speeds in certain areas. Lights are timed in such a way that motorists can drive through without stopping if their speed is lower than a given limit, mostly 50 km/h (30 mph) in urban areas.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{symmetric}} thermal optimal path (TOPS) method {{to determine the}} time-dependent <b>lead-lag</b> relationship between two stochastic time series. This novel version of the previously introduced TOP method alleviates some inconsistencies by imposing that the <b>lead-lag</b> relationship should be invariant {{with respect to a}} time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This means that, if `X comes before Y', this transforms into `Y comes before X' under a time reversal. We show that previously proposed bootstrap test lacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there is no <b>lead-lag</b> correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel tests. The first free energy p-value ρ criterion quantifies the probability that a given <b>lead-lag</b> structure could be obtained from random time series with similar characteristics except of the <b>lead-lag</b> information. The second self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the <b>lead-lag</b> path to be significant, synchronising the two time series using the time varying <b>lead-lag</b> path should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform intensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations. Finally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time dependent <b>lead-lag</b> structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. The TOPS approach stresses the importance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of information or policies may have drastically different impacts and developments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical conditions. This study reinforces the view that the hypothesis of statistical stationarity is highly questionable. Comment: 23 Latex pages including 14 figure...|$|E

The dimensionless <b>lead-lag</b> frequency of the mode is approximately 1. 5 at the highest tip speed.
