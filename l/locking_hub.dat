50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1948 by Arthur Warn, who invented a <b>locking</b> <b>hub</b> system {{designed}} for use on surplus World War II Jeep vehicles. Originally based in Seattle, Washington, Mr. Warn worked with Belleview Manufacturing of Portland, Oregon to manufacture the bolt-on/bolt-off hubs. By 1954, the hubs were available as optional equipment through several major automakers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. <b>Locking</b> <b>hubs</b> disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the axle completely locked in.|$|R
50|$|Unlike <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> CAD {{systems are}} {{generally}} automatic and engaged when {{the vehicle is}} placed in four wheel drive. Due {{to the lack of}} driver control over the CAD, it is not as well known to the public as <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> are.|$|R
5000|$|DX with manual mirrors, {{no central}} locking, vinyl interior, {{optional}} AC, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|ST with {{electric}} windows, electric mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|RX (from 1995) with {{electric}} mirrors, central locking, carpet interior, AC, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>hubs</b> are {{obtrusive}} {{and damage}} can occur {{that can cause}} the four wheel drive system to fail — damage {{that would not be}} an issue in a CAD system. However CAD systems are mostly vacuum controlled and damage can occur to the vacuum system and to the CAD itself. Rotting of vacuum lines will cause the four wheel drive system to fail — damage that would not be an issue with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Four-wheel-drive {{improvements}} {{included the}} addition of automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> for the F-150 in 1989. Models with the 5.0L V8 also had an option of a [...] "Touch Drive" [...] electronic transfer case.|$|R
50|$|The {{innovative}} Quadra-Trac full-time four-wheel-drive system, which {{broadened the}} appeal of Jeep products to people who wanted four-wheel-drive traction without the inconvenience of a manual-shift transfer case and manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> was introduced in 1973.|$|R
50|$|Like <b>locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> the CAD {{system is}} {{designed}} to improve fuel efficiency of the vehicle. Other, often debated, benefits of CAD systems are reduced vibration, axle wear, and noise, as well as improved steering and drivability.|$|R
25|$|The Svea Velocipede with {{vertical}} {{pedal arrangement}} and <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> {{was introduced in}} 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungström and Birger Ljungström. It attracted attention at the World Fair and was produced in a few thousand units.|$|R
50|$|In some vehicles, manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> {{are used}} to engage the front wheels. This {{requires}} getting in/out of the vehicle to engage or disengage the front wheels. This {{may have to be}} done repeatedly if road conditions are irregular (shift from snow, then dry pavement, then snow again, repeatedly).|$|R
5000|$|Ti (from late 1989) with {{electric}} windows, electric mirrors, central locking, velour and carpet interior, rear AC, seven speaker sound system, alloy three-spoke wheels, automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> The Ti model {{had a high}} roof design with sunroof until 1991. Leather and woodgrain trim was made standard in 1992 with the Series 2.|$|R
5000|$|Isuzu {{introduced}} the five-door Isuzu Rodeo to the United States in 1990 for the 1991 model year. It was available {{with either a}} 2.6-liter inline-four engine rated at [...] or a 3.1-liter V6 engine made by General Motors (GM) which had the same power output as the 2.6, but had more torque. An automatic transmission was available for the V6. The Rodeo, like the Amigo was available in both RWD and 4WD, with the latter featuring manually <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on the S version and automatically <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on the XS and top-of-the-line LS. Rear-wheel ABS were standard feature on 4WDs. A RWD manual transmission model with a 21.9 usgal L tank was rated at 18 mpg in city driving by the EPA, and 22 mpg on the highway. A 4WD model with the V6 and automatic transmission was rated at 15 mpg city and 18 mpg highway.|$|R
50|$|Exposed <b>hub</b> <b>locks</b> can {{be broken}} or damaged by {{off-road}} conditions, rendering 4×4 useless and leaving the vehicle stranded. Also, in some axle designs (such as those used on older Land Rovers), the top swivel bearing can become starved for lubrication (which is normally supplied by oil slung up by the rotating axle), unless the <b>hubs</b> are <b>locked</b> every few hundred miles. Also, since <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> generally do not require a key to operate, they can be maliciously locked or unlocked by persons other than the vehicle owner.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Big Three all started using this axle. GM began phasing {{it out in}} 1988 in favor of Independent suspension, while still {{offering}} it in some higher GVWR trucks (V-30) until 1991. Dodge used a Dana 60 up to 2002. 3rd Generation Dodge Rams dropped the Dana 60 in favor of AAM axles. Ford still uses the Dana 60 front axle. Manufactured in both Kingpin and Ball joint variations, [...] "standard" [...] (low pinion) and [...] "reverse cut" [...] rotation (high pinion) variations and open and limited slip, and locking variations. The housing material is Gray iron in early axles and Ductile iron in later axles. GM and Ford Dana 60 axles utilize <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> Dodge Dana 60 axles utilized <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> until 1994 when a Center Axle Disconnect (CAD) system was adopted. However, model year 2002 Rams phased out the CAD system leaving some 2002 Dana 60 axles permanently locked in.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 44 Front axle {{first saw}} {{use in the}} 1950s and still in use today. Dana 44 Front axles were known for {{utilizing}} <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> or a center axle disconnect system. However, a permanently locked-in Dana 44 is not uncommon. The Dana 44 has seen use in 1/4-, 1/2-, 3/4-, and 1-ton rated trucks. The Dana 44 was manufactured in kingpin and ball joint variations, as well as closed and open knuckle variations.|$|R
5000|$|Developed at NAMI (the National Automobile Institute), the prototype, {{known as}} NAMI 049, was {{completed}} in 1958. Unlike the Jeep, it had a Fibreglass body, four-wheel torsion bar independent suspension, and permanent four-wheel drive with <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> It had a wheelbase of 1,800 mm, a ground clearance of 280 mm, and was powered by a [...] MD-65 motorcycle engine (copied from an Orbita motorcycle). Trials proved it underpowered, and the body too fragile.|$|R
5000|$|Warn Industries {{currently}} employs around 500 {{people and}} has a total of 400,000 sq/ft of manufacturing space in both Clackamas and Milwaukie, Oregon. The company has won a number awards for its products, most recently winning a [...] "gold" [...] Excellence Award from Ford Motor Company for being a top-tier supplier to the automobile manufacturer. Warn Industries supplies Ford Motor Company with wheel-end disconnects (automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs)</b> {{for a number of}} its pickup models.|$|R
50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic self <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and synchronized direct high range planetary gearing, such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional four-wheel drive was still available with manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{four-wheel drive}} pickups {{featured}} manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and a two-speed dual range New Process 205 transfer case with four drive modes: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, while Four High yielded a locked 50:50 torque split. Four Low applied reduction gearing. The {{front and rear}} propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral allowed for flat towing, or use of the power take off (PTO).|$|R
50|$|For {{model year}} 1981, {{automatic}} <b>locking</b> front <b>hubs</b> were added for shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive models, and the NP208 transfer case replaced the NP205 in most models.|$|R
50|$|On {{two-wheel drive}} F-250 and F-350 pickups, the Twin I-Beam {{independent}} front suspension with coil springs was used; their four-wheel drive counterparts were equipped with solid front axle (Dana 50 and Dana 60) with leaf springs. In 2005, the front suspension was updated as four-wheel drive trucks were converted to front coil springs; to reduce unsprung weight, the mounting of the front sway bar was changed to the frame instead of the front axle. The manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> on Super Duty trucks are made by Warn.|$|R
5000|$|Axles were Dana 44 {{front and}} 9¼" [...] or 8 1/4" [...] Chrysler {{corporate}} rear. AWD models (1973-1979) were {{equipped with the}} full-time version of the Dana 44 that had no provision for <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> and had a front wheel bearing design with a somewhat dubious reputation. In 1980 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD (Center Axle Disconnect) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum. The CAD Dana 44 was carried on {{until the end of}} Ramcharger production in 1993. The vacuum switch on the transfer case would occasionally fail and either leave the CAD engaged or not engage the CAD at all. Limited slip differentials were available for the 9¼" [...] rear axle. The AWD versions used a 5 on 4½" [...] wheel bolt circle and the part-time 4WD models used a 5 on 5½" [...] bolt circle. Two wheel drive models used the 5 on 4.5" [...] wheel bolt circle and in 1985 changed to the 5 on 5.5" [...] pattern.|$|R
25|$|Subaru {{introduced}} the category-expanding Leone in 1972, an inexpensive compact station wagon with a light-duty, part-time four-wheel drive {{system that could}} not be engaged on dry pavement. In September AMC introduced Quadra Trac full-time AWD for the 1973 model year Jeep Cherokee and Wagoneer. Thanks to full-time AWD, which relieved the driver of getting out to <b>lock</b> <b>hubs</b> and having to manually select between 2WD and 4WD modes, it dominated all other makes in FIA rally competition. Gene Henderson and Ken Pogue won the Press-on-Regardless Rally FIA championship with a Quadra Trac equipped Jeep in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The Bronco was {{designed}} under engineer Paul G. Axelrad. The axles and brakes from the Ford F-100 {{four wheel drive}} pickup truck were used, but the front axle was located by radius arms (from the frame near {{the rear of the}} transmission forward to the axle). A lateral track bar allowed the use of coil springs that gave the Bronco a 34 ft turning circle, long wheel travel, and an anti-dive geometry, which was useful for snowplowing. The rear suspension was more conventional, with leaf springs in a typical Hotchkiss design. A shift-on the-fly Dana transfer case and <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> were standard, and heavy-duty suspension was an option.|$|R
5000|$|Manual Shift On-the-Fly {{transfer}} {{cases have}} a selector lever on the driver's side floor transmission hump {{and may also}} have either two sealed automatic front axle <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> or two manual front axle hub selectors of [...] "LOCK" [...] and [...] "UNLOCK" [...] or [...] "FREE". To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed, {{the speed at which}} 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.|$|R
50|$|A {{center axle}} {{disconnect}} system or CAD {{is an alternative}} to <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> CAD systems are typically used in front drive axles on four wheel drive vehicles. A CAD system works by having an axle shaft (typically the longer shaft) split into two pieces. One piece {{is connected to the}} carrier, the other connected to the wheel. This reduces drag on the axle by allowing only the spider and side gears to spin, while the differential carrier, pinion and drive shaft are at rest. The axle is engaged by connecting the two split axle shafts. The ends of the axles are typically splined and use a collar to connect the two shafts together by sliding over both shafts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Locking</b> <b>hubs,</b> {{also known}} as free {{wheeling}} hubs are fitted to some (mainly older) four-wheel drive vehicles, allowing the front wheels to rotate freely when disconnected (unlocked) from the front axle. This is done to reduce the mechanical resistance of the front-portion of the drivetrain when four-wheel drive is not in use. The hub, along with the wheel, is designed to engage (lock) onto the axle, to be powered by the drivetrain in four-wheel drive; or the hub can disengage (unlock) from the axle when four-wheel drive is not needed, thus allowing the front wheels to rotate freely within the hub. The hub is a component where the wheel is directly mounted to, and is outside the axle.|$|R
50|$|Most 70 Series Land Cruisers (both petrol {{and diesel}} models) use inline six-cylinder engines. The {{exceptions}} are the V8 diesel 1VD-FTV engine introduced in some markets in 2007 and the V6 petrol 1GR-FE introduced in 2009, with the last straight-6 available being the diesel 1HZ for markets with less stringent emission rules such as Africa and Bolivia. Regardless of the engine, a 5-speed manual transmission delivers power to a part-time four-wheel-drive transfer case with high and low range. The solid front axles are a full-floating design with manual <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> The solid rear axles are available in semi-floating and full-floating variations. Selectable locking differentials (front and rear) are factory options in some markets.|$|R
50|$|In {{some other}} vehicles, {{automatic}} <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> are used which, {{as the name}} implies, engage automatically when 4WD is desired. The main advantage is that the driver {{does not need to}} leave the vehicle to activate 4WD, or drive the vehicle in 2WD with the front axle disengaged. The disadvantage with this system is that most designs require the vehicle to move some distance (usually a whole wheel turn, often going backwards) after engaging 4WD, in order for the hubs to engage or disengage (in many cases, 4WD can be engaged with the vehicle moving). This might not be possible if the vehicle gets completely stuck before 4WD has been engaged, meaning automatic hubs require more caution on the driver's part.|$|R
5000|$|On 4x4 models {{there is}} a choice of a manual {{chain-driven}} transfer case floor shifter with manual front <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> or Electronic-Shift-On-the-Fly (ESOF, a $185 option over the manual) dash knob with vacuum activated automatic and (in case of failure) manual override front hubs. The optional FX4 models are basically a standard 4x4 with an Off Road package that includes a few extras like upgraded heavy duty Rancho shocks, limited-slip rear differential, added skid plates for the fuel tank and transfer case, and two [...] "FX4" [...] decals on both back bed-sides instead of the standard [...] "4x4". For all 4x4 models, the 2-speed transfer case 4x4-LOW range has a gear reduction of 2.72:1. Brazilian and Venezuelan versions had only the ESOF transfer case.|$|R
50|$|Predominantly, Explorer was not {{equipped}} with Two High mode {{except in the}} 1995-1996 model years. In model years 1998-up no Two High was available. Only Auto, Four High and Four Low modes were offered. Two High mode was unique to the Expedition, though it was discontinued between the 1999-2002 model years. Two High mode was reintroduced on the redesigned second generation Expedition (U222) for the 2003 model year and featured a new full front axle disconnect system with vacuum operated front <b>locking</b> <b>hubs</b> that would disconnect the front axle, front differential, and front drive shaft when not needed for quieter, more fuel-efficient operation on pavement. Ford claimed that the improved Two High mode could help increase fuel economy up to half-a-mile per gallon of gasoline. In Two High mode, torque is routed to the rear drive wheels only, imitating rear-wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design. Ford TTB Dana 44 axles all utilized <b>locking</b> <b>hubs.</b> The TTB set-up is based on Ford's highly successful Twin I-beam design on two-wheel-drive pick-up truck models.|$|R
50|$|The 1924 and 1925 DIS, with a 117 in wheelbase, {{switched}} from Rolls-Royce-type <b>locking</b> wheel <b>hubs</b> to Rudge knock-ons, better cam, and bigger valves, while the 1925 and 1926 DISS {{on the same}} wheelbase. Some of the DISes were bodied by Kelsch. The DIS became the Series 6 in 1927, switching to coil ignition and water pump.|$|R
5000|$|The Mazda AZ-Offroad, {{introduced}} in October 1998, is a rebadged Jimny. The AZ {{in the name}} refers to Autozam, Mazda's ill-fated small car marque. It is fitted with the turbocharged 660 cc DOHC Suzuki K6A engine, which produces [...] Manually operated four wheel drive is standard with auto <b>locking</b> front <b>hubs</b> and low range, whilst an automatic transmission is optional.|$|R
