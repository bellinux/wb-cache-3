25|$|An Estonian oil {{syndicate}} {{became a}} joint Estonian-Soviet enterprise in 1928 and Päts {{was hired by}} it as a <b>legal</b> <b>consultant</b> in 1930. His annual salary was $4,000, which was {{twice as much as}} the State Elder earned and more than eight times as muchs as Päts earned {{as a member of the}} Riigikogu. The purpose of the joint enterprise for the Soviets was not supposed to be business-related, but only to attract Päts. This official salary by the Soviet Union has thus been seen as the salary for his long-term cooperation with the Soviets. After Päts's coup d'état, the Soviet Union increased economic cooperation with Estonian enterprises.|$|E

500|$|The French author Jean-Paul Picaper, {{who studied}} the Oradour {{massacre}} that was perpetrated by {{the men of the}} Das Reich, notes the tendentious nature of Weidinger's narrative: it provided a sanitized version of history without any references to massacres. He argues that the unit histories, like other HIAG publications, focused on the positive, [...] "heroic" [...] side of National Socialism. The researcher Danny S. Parker notes similar efforts undertaken to rewrite the history of the Leibstandarte division. HIAG worked with Rudolf Lehmann, chief of staff of 1st SS Panzer Corps, to produce what Parker calls an [...] "exculpating multi-volume chronicle" [...] of the division, even including the Malmedy massacre. HIAG involved a <b>legal</b> <b>consultant</b> to make sure the account would be {{within the framework of the}} strict German laws prohibiting glorification of the Nazi past. The project also included the former chief of staff of the unit, Dietrich Ziemssen, who in 1952 produced a revisionist version of the massacre in his pamphlet Der Malmedy Prozess.|$|E
500|$|The use of sandbox {{applications}} like Garry's Mod {{have allowed}} for Combine non-player characters {{to be used}} in a variety of webcomics and machinima productions. The combine are also referenced in the Portal (series). In one webcomic, Concerned, the Combine are portrayed as a highly bureaucratic and often inept organization. One issue shows a Civil Protection briefing for attempting to capture the comic's protagonist Gordon Frohman, in which officers are instructed to cluster around explosive barrels, seek cover on unstable structures and rappel down from bridges in front of fast moving vehicles. In another example, the machinima series Combine Nation follows Civil Protection officers in a similar style to police procedural documentaries. The officers perform their duties with various twists, such as the team's medical officer having an obsession with adhesive bandages and the <b>legal</b> <b>consultant,</b> an Overwatch soldier, favoring dramatic entries, such as throwing flashbangs, which often backfire on him. Another web series, called The Combine, parodies the TV show The Office. This series attempts to portray the combine as an intergalactic corporation that suffers from everyday office issues and problems. One episode shows the soldiers attempting to bypass a webfilter so they can watch videos online instead of working. Other media portray the Combine with more serious overtones, such as the live-action video The Combine Interview, which parodies an interview with Tom Cruise discussing Scientology. The video, described by ActionTrip as [...] "eerie, to say the least" [...] and by both Joystiq and Kotaku as [...] "creepy", instead presents an interview with a Civil Protection officer discussing the Combine's rule of Earth, adapting Cruise's words to fit the Combine theme. PC Gamer UK noted that [...] "the suggestion, of course, is that Scientology's purpose or self-image in some way resembles that of the homogenising intergalactic murderous alien collective".|$|E

40|$|The {{focus in}} this Essay {{is on the}} {{regulations}} which have been adopted in the various states within the United States to recognize lawyers licensed in other countries. As the financial and commercial markets move beyond national boundaries to become global markets, lawyers practicing in the United States will increasingly {{be called upon to}} analyze and understand international law and the laws of countries outside the United States. Adopting regulations allowing foreign <b>legal</b> <b>consultants</b> to practice law will permit US lawyers to better serve their current clients. In addition, US lawyers will more easily obtain access to markets for legal services in other countries once reciprocal access is available for the lawyers from those countries. Therefore, each of the jurisdictions within the United States should adopt regulations permitting foreign <b>legal</b> <b>consultants</b> to practice law. Ideally, the requirements should be made uniform throughout all fifty states and the District of Columbia...|$|R
