40|$|The Zinifex Century Zinc mine, in the {{southern}} Gulf of northwest Queensland is expected to operate until 2017. The mine is a major regional economic driver and the closure will be significant for the Gulf communities. Accordingly it is now timely to consider the post mine economy for the region and to consider how best to <b>lever</b> <b>off</b> the existing and planned activity of the mine. This study analyses the economic contribution of the Zinifex Mine to {{the southern}} Gulf, assesses the likely impacts and provides some suggested pathways forward to capitalise on the existing investment window the mine has to offer as well capturing any development opportunities the mine {{will have on the}} region. While the primary goal is the post mine economy, underpinning the future economic development options identified for the southern Gulf are a range of social, cultural and attitudinal issues. These include cultural differences between indigenous and non indigenous Australians as well as the will, interest, skill and or capacity and business acumen of many non-indigenous and indigenous groups required to achieve self reliance. An integrated model is proposed to provide a framework to foster the post mine economy. The model provided emphasises three areas (a) underpinning prerequisites, (b) development of specific business opportunities, and (c) fostering individual and community capacity. These need to be considered holistically. The dynamics of the area and the support systems required are discussed in terms of achieving “on the ground” change.

40|$|The Zinifex Century Zinc mine, {{located in}} the {{southern}} Gulf of northwest Queensland has fourteen years of operation remaining. The mine is a major economic driver in the region. Accordingly it is now timely to consider the post mine economy for the region and to consider how best to <b>lever</b> <b>off</b> the existing and planned activity of the mine during its remaining period of operation. As such, this pending closure provides an ideal case study for understanding issues associated with developing post mine economies. The Zinifex Century Mine provides direct employment for over 600 people at the site. A further 1500 people {{are estimated to be}} indirectly employed. Since 1997 the revenue to the state from Zinifex’s activities has been of the order of $ 155 m. The potential benefit of the mine to the State and the region is approximated at $ 520 m of minimum guaranteed revenue. This study assesses the economic contribution of the Zinfex Mine to the communities of the southern Gulf, explores the likely impacts of its closure. In addition, the study provides some suggested pathways to capitalise on the existing investment window the mine has to offer. Many of the strategies identified for the economic transition to a post mine economy for the southern Gulf are interrelated. The successful progress on a particular activity is dependent on the progress of other activity. Furthermore, the southern Gulf region has a number of socio-economic characteristics that make the region less well off than the rest of Queensland. The area is disadvantaged in comparison to other regions of Queensland by low income families, residents with little formal training and non-school qualifications, {{a large portion of the}} labour force employed as unskilled labour and significant unemployment. Zinfex Century Zinc Mine has contributed to the southern Gulf communities in three significant areas: Altering the population, industry employment, training and occupational characteristics of the southern Gulf communities; Sponsoring programs attempting to improve the health, employment, education and social welfare of indigenous communities through the Gulf Communities Agreement (GCA); and Through direct and indirect economic impacts flowing from mine employment and the purchase of mining goods and services from businesses operating within the southern Gulf...|$|R
5000|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth won the toss, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. In the Australian first innings Keith Stackpole survived lbw appeals from Ken Shuttleworth and Peter Lever before he was out caught by <b>Lever</b> <b>off</b> Snow for 8. The England fast bowler John Snow wrote, [...] "I have never come across another umpire so full of his own importance, so stubborn, lacking in humour, unreasonable and utterly unable to distinguish between a delivery short of a length which rises around {{the height of the}} rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high" [...] and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, the great England umpire Dickie Bird wrote [...] "as far as I am concerned, intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is then that I feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that is when I always step in". As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for Rowan to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth. Snow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling in the Second Test at Perth, but refused to accept that rib high balls were intimidatory and continued to bowl them. As a result, Snow was given an official warning, which meant {{that he would not be}} allowed to bowl if he was warned again. Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said, [...] "Now that's a bouncer for you".|$|R

40|$|This qualitative, case-based study {{examined}} how managers conceptualise customer value and translate customer learning into customer value creating processes. The study considered {{a sample of}} high and low performing firms operating in non-dynamic and dynamic market environments to investigate market and firm-level effects. It was found regardless of whether a firm operates in a non-dynamic or dynamic market environment, managers approach customer value as a time dependent and tridimensionally construct. In order to operationalise customer value, managers need to constantly consider: 1. The attributes or benefits that are embedded in or customers can associate with the firm’s products and services, 2. The consequences achieved by customers when using or being provided with the firm’s products and services, and 3. The goals and purposes which are achieved by customers after they use or received the firm’s products and services. In other words, in order to create optimal levels of customer value, managers must be able to map the configuration of activities that need to be undertaken at the firm to the configuration of commercial and assurance-based benefits customers want to have delivered to them through the firm’s products and services at different points in time. They must then be able to map these activities and benefits to the combination of resources that can realise them. This includes the combination of dynamic capabilities which the firm uses to develop products and services that can help customers cope with change and have their idiosyncratic problems addressed. However, it was found that firms that operate in dynamic market environments tend to invest in and develop more structured and ordered approaches to customer learning than the firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments. They also rely more on bottom-up/top down decision-making processes to develop the firm’s customer value delivery strategy than firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments. Firms that operate in non-dynamic market environments tend to use top-down decisionmaking processes {{and are more likely to}} <b>lever</b> <b>off</b> their strategic planning processes to develop their customer value delivery strategy than firms that operate in dynamic market environments. Consistent with these findings and the RBV literature, it was found that the high performing firms were better at creating value for their target customers across three customer value dimensions. Their managers were also better at identifying when it was in everyone’s best interests to differentiate between customer groups, and integrate and link critical customer learning and decision-making processes. This includes processes that promote strategic and operational forms of customer learning, and continual customer value learning and performance tracking. In summary, the study demonstrated that heterogeneous firm performance can be explained by the way managers at different firms are able to conceptualise customer value, how they develop their customer value delivery strategies, and their differing abilities to integrate key customer value learning and decision-making processes. Moreover, it demonstrated that a firm is more likely to sustain a competitive advantage and be persistently high performing if it develops a core customer value learning and customer value delivery competency.

Commercial models can cook 20 or more cups. As a possible source of confusion, model specifications and names may list either cooked or uncooked capacity. Rice roughly doubles in size during cooking; therefore, a 10 cup (uncooked) rice cooker can produce up to 20 cups of cooked rice. The prices vary greatly, depending on the capacity, features, materials used, and the country of origin.|$|R
60|$|A gentle {{rain had}} fallen during the day, but had ceased {{as she made}} her way toward Insall's house. The place was {{familiar}} now: she had been there to supper with Mrs. Maturin, a supper cooked and served by Martha Vesey, an elderly, efficient and appallingly neat widow, whom Insall had discovered somewhere in his travels and installed as his housekeeper. Janet paused with her hand on the gate latch to gaze around her, at the picket fence on which he had been working when she had walked hither the year before. It was primly painted now, its posts crowned with the carved pineapples; behind the fence old-fashioned flowers were in bloom, lupins and false indigo; and the retaining wall of blue-grey slaty stone, which he had laid that spring, was finished. A wind stirred the maple, releasing a shower of heavy drops, and she opened the gate and went up the path and knocked at the door. There was no response--even Martha must be absent, in the village! Janet was disappointed, she had looked forward to seeing him, to telling him how great had been her pleasure in the story he had written, at the same time doubting her courage to do so. She had never been able to speak to him about his work and what did her opinion matter to him? As she turned away the stillness was broken by a humming sound gradually rising to a crescendo, so she ventured slowly around the house and into the orchard of gnarled apple trees on the slope until she came insight of a little white building beside the brook. The weathervane perched on the gable, and veering in the wet breeze, seemed like a live fish swimming in its own element; and through the open window she saw Insall bending over a lathe, from which the chips were flying. She hesitated. Then he looked up, and seeing her, reached above his head to pull the <b>lever</b> that shut <b>off</b> the power.|$|R
2500|$|After {{passing a}} medical Barrington {{was chosen to}} manage the MCC tour of India in 1976–77, where his own legendary status was soon {{emulated}} that of Tony Greig. In the First Test John Lever took 10/70 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test Barrington advised Greig to bat {{as long as possible}} so that India would have to bat on a wearing pitch. The England captain took 434 minutes making 103 with a fever, India were bowled out for 181 in the second innings and England won by 10 wickets. Another win in the Third Test gave England their first series victory in India since Douglas Jardine in 1933–34, but was spoilt by accusations by the Indian captain Bishan Bedi that Lever used Vaseline to shine the ball. Bernard Thomas, the England physiotherapist had given Lever and Bob Willis Vaseline strips on their foreheads to stop sweat dripping into their eyes, but <b>Lever</b> took his <b>off</b> as the Vaseline made the ball slip from his hands. The umpire picked up the strips and Bedi claimed that this not only accounted for their current defeat (India had been dismissed for 164 and 82), but the others as well. The strips were examined without any conclusion being found as to whether they helped bowling and the matter was referred the MCC. Barrington diplomatically thanked the Indian Board for not finding anything averse and was criticised for not defending his players more, but as Lever said [...] "if he had overreacted, the tour could have been called off". England lost the Fourth Test to some dubious umpiring and Barrington, while scathing in his official report, declined to publicly voice his complaints to the press. At the end of the tour he was joined by Ann, who did secretarial work for him and the team, and the Fifth test was drawn for a 3–1 series win. After the India tour the team proceeded to Australia for the Centenary Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, a gathering of almost every Ashes Test player from England and Australia. Apart from the cricket the Test was secretly used to recruit English and Australia players for Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket (WSC). Tony Greig became a leading Packer recruiter and Barrington was kept in the dark as he would have to report any such activity to the TCCB. Ironically, Barrington secretly gathered guests for Greig's appearance on This Is Your Life on their return to England.|$|R
