5|$|The Binding of Isaac was {{developed}} following {{the release of}} Super Meat Boy, which McMillen considered a significant risk and a large time effort.

He also considered he could take further risk with the concept.|$|E

5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming a need for expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> a role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E

5|$|Beebe's {{position}} in the Zoological Society underwent a change in 1918: He was given the title of Honorary Curator of Birds, and was made {{the director of the}} newly created Department of Tropical Research. With his new position, Beebe no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> the duty of caring for the zoo's animals, freeing him to devote himself fully to his writing and research. Beebe's duties as curator were passed to Lee Crandall, the former Assistant Curator who had worked under Beebe, although Crandall continued to rely on Beebe for help treating illness in birds, and caring for the exotic birds brought back from Beebe's expeditions.|$|E
5|$|By May 1786, Raspe no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> {{control over}} the book, which {{was taken over by}} a {{different}} publisher, G. Kearsley. Kearsley, intending the book for a higher-class audience than the original editions had been, commissioned extensive additions and revisions from other hands, including new stories, twelve new engravings, and much rewriting of Raspe's prose. This third edition was sold at two shillings, twice the price of the original, as Gulliver Revived, or the Singular Travels, Campaigns, Voyages, and Adventures of Baron Munikhouson, commonly pronounced Munchausen.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, {{as he was}} used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect {{on the quality of the}} film. A King in New York was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. A King in New York was not shown in America until 1973.|$|E

Nonetheless, his contract with RMM denied Anthony the right to perform in Spanish for Colombia Records. This resulted in a lawsuit against Mercado because Anthony did not want to work under him anymore. As part of the settlement, RMM Records retained the rights to his earlier albums and to release a greatest hits collection from them while Anthony no <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> any obligations to RMM.|$|E
5|$|He was {{described}} by sportswriters of the time {{as one of the}} fastest pitchers in the league, comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein. Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as fast as Rusie, and could have extended his career much <b>longer</b> <b>had</b> he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P.

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{emerged into}} the Bay of Campeche as a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{on the afternoon}} of August21.

Nevertheless, the warm waters of the bay proved conducive for some development and the eye contracted overnight, indicating that the hurricane was regaining structure. With better structure came stronger winds of 100mph (160km/h), and the storm was re-categorized as a Category2 hurricane.|$|E

German soldiers were now on average six years older than their Allied counterparts. Many in the Normandy area were Ostlegionen (eastern legions)– conscripts and volunteers from Russia, Mongolia, and other areas of the Soviet Union. They were provided mainly with unreliable captured equipment and lacked motorised transport. Many German units were under strength.|$|E
