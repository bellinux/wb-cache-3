He presented a thorough report about the 1900–01 glider experiments and complemented his talk with a <b>lantern</b> <b>slide</b> show of photographs. Wilbur's speech was the first public account of the brothers' experiments. A report {{was published in the}} Journal of the society, which was then separately published as an offprint titled Some Aeronautical Experiments in a 300 copy edition.|$|E

The Alexander family also owned the Alexander Building on the South-West (opposie) corner of Beaufort and Walcott Streets. It was constructed in 1914/1915 in a Federation Free Classical style and was designed for a mixture of vaudeville and <b>lantern</b> <b>slide</b> shows.|$|E

60|$|The pawnbroker, {{repressing}} his choler, {{replaced the}} bottle, and, seating {{himself at the}} table, reached over for the kettle, and made the tea. It was really a pleasing picture of domestic life, and would have looked well in a <b>lantern</b> <b>slide</b> at a temperance lecture, the long, gaunt Jew and the burly seaman hobnobbing over the blameless teapot. But Mr. Hyams grew restless. He was intent upon business; but the other, so far as his inroads on the teapot and the eatables gave any indication, seemed to be bent only upon pleasure. Once again {{the picture of the}} former sailor rose before Mr. Hyams’ eyes, and he scowled fiercely as the seaman pushed his cup up for the fourth time.|$|E

60|$|Lazily interested, {{he watched}} this blur {{increase}} {{until it became}} the Idalia steaming at full speed, coming down the coast. Without changing his position {{he kept his eyes}} upon the beautiful white yacht as she drew swiftly near, and came opposite to Coralio. Then, sitting upright, he saw her float steadily past and on. Scarcely a mile of sea had separated her from the shore. He had seen the frequent flash of her polished brass work and the stripes of her deck-awnings--so much, and no more. Like a ship on a magic <b>lantern</b> <b>slide</b> the Idalia had crossed the illuminated circle of the consul's little world, and was gone. Save for the tiny cloud of smoke that was left hanging over the brim of the sea, she might have been an immaterial thing, a chimera of his idle brain.|$|E
60|$|But you may imagine I had {{a dismal}} time all that hour. I {{understood}} the people about me were Sceptics, {{the kind of}} people who don't believe things--a singular class, and, I am told, a growing one. These excellent people, it seems, have conscientious objections to going to chapel or church, but at the same time the devotional habit of countless generations of pious forerunners is strong in them. Consequently they have invented things like these lectures to go to, with a professor instead of a priest, and a <b>lantern</b> <b>slide</b> of a stomach by way of altar-piece; and alcohol they make their Devil, and their god is Hygiene--a curious and instructive case of mental inertia. I understand, too, there are several other temples of this Cult in London--South Place Chapel and Essex Hall, for instance, where they worship the Spirit of the Innermost. But the thing that struck me so oddly was the number of bald heads glimmering faintly in the reflected light from the lantern circle. And that set me thinking upon a difficulty I have never been able to surmount.|$|E
