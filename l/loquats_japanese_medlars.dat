60|$|Now, {{however, the}} {{national}} taste has changed; {{the supply of}} Madeira not sufficing for the demand, the class called boticarios (apothecaries) brought rivals into the market; and extensive imitation's with apples, <b>loquats</b> (<b>Japanese</b> <b>medlars),</b> and other frauds, brandied to make the stuff keep, plastered or doctored with Paris-plaster to correct over-acidity, and coloured and sweetened with burnt sugar and with boiled 'must' (mosto) to mock the Madeira flavour, gave the island-produce a bad name. Again, the revolution in the wine-trade of 1860-61 brought with it certain Continental ideas. In France a glass of Madeira follows soup, and in Austria it is drunk in liqueur-glasses like Tokay.|$|E

50|$|Eriobotrya japonica was {{formerly}} {{thought to be}} {{closely related to the}} genus Mespilus, and is still sometimes known as the <b>Japanese</b> <b>medlar.</b> It is also known as Japanese plum and Chinese plum, also known as pipa in China.|$|R
50|$|In {{certain parts}} of the world, some fruits are called plums and are quite {{different}} from fruits known as plums in Europe or the Americas. For example, marian plums are popular in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, otherwise also known as gandaria, plum mango, ma-praang, ma-yong, ramania, kundang, rembunia or setar. Another example is the Chinese Plum, popular as pipa or Chinese plums in East Asia and Southeast Asia, and as <b>Japanese</b> <b>medlar,</b> <b>loquat,</b> nispero, bibassier and wollmispel elsewhere. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, jambul, a fruit from tropical tree in Myrtaceae family, is similarly sometimes referred to 'damson plums', and it is different from damson plums found in Europe and Americas. Jambul is also called as Java plum, Malabar plum, jaman, jamun, jamblang, jiwat, salam, duhat, koeli, jambuláo or koriang.|$|R
40|$|Six sample lots of loquat commercialized in Campinas, Brazil were {{analyzed}} for their carotenoid composition beta-carotene (7. 8 micrograms/g), zeta-carotene (0. 1 micrograms/g), neurosporene (1. 1 micrograms/g), beta-cryptoxanthin (4. 8 micrograms/g), 5, 6 -monoepoxy-beta-cryptoxanthin (0. 6 micrograms/g), violaxanthin (1. 6 micrograms/g), (0. 8 micrograms/g) and auroxanthin (0. 9 micrograms/g) were identified beta-Carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin were the principal pigments, {{being responsible for}} 44 % and 27 %, respectively, of the total carotenoid content (17. 6 micrograms/g). Both were also the principal contributors to the vitamin A value of 175 RE/ 100 g. The carotenoid composition of the Brazilian loquat resembles that of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>loquat</b> variety Tanaka...|$|R
40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of aroma compounds in selected species of less known fruits (sea buckthorn, cornelian cherry, rowanberry, <b>medlar,</b> <b>japanese</b> quince and chokeberry). The theoretical part {{is focused on the}} description of these plants, their chemical composition, possibility of utilization and processing. Aroma compounds were identified and quantified in experimental parts. The aroma compounds were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and analysed by gas chromatography. A total of 45 compounds were identified. This compounds included 17 alcohols, 9 ketons, 8 aldehydes, 6 acids and 5 esters. Concurrently, the sensory evaluation of these fruits was carried out. The profile test and evaluation using graphical scales were used for evaluation of pleasantness and intensity of taste and odour...|$|R
