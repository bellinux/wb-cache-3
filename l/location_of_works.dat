Methods the research {{is based on a}} set of general scientific and specific methods of cognition used in the science of Financial Law dialectic method formaldogmatic method methods of analysis analogy induction and synthesis historical retrospective formalization and logical method. 	Results the article presents theoreticallegal analysis of the consequences of ambiguous interpretation of a legal norm para. 4 subclause 2. 2. clause 1 Art. 164 of the Taxation Code of the Russian Federation in relation to organizations rendering services in the sphere of oil and oil products transportation and transshipment. It is stated that one of the essential problems in the practice of value added tax implementation is the use of zero tax rate. When the norms of the above Article are interpreted it causes problems in organizations engaged in oil and oil products transportation and transshipment due to the differences in positions of the Russian Ministry of Finance and the taxation authorities about the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> to be referred to transshipment. Another problem is narrow comprehension of organizations engaged in oil transportation as well as uncertainty of norms related to the terminology of oil transportation transshipment and reloading. All the above inaccuracies and ambiguities in legislation lead to problems in organizations engaged in oil transportation as is shown by the example of ldquoMarine Port Servicerdquo Close Corporation. The author also presents the results of analysis of judicial practice in the sphere of interpreting para. 4 subclause 2. 2. clause 1 Art. 164 of the Taxation Code of the Russian Federation. The possible consequences of the revealed contradiction are determined for the oil markets and for the budget incomes formation. The carried out research results in proposals for improving the taxation of taxpaying organizations rendering services in the sphere of oil and oil products transportation reloading andor transshipment. 	Scientific novelty the legal uncertainty in interpretation and implementation of a legal norm para. 4 subclause 2. 2. clause 1 Art. 164 of the Taxation Code of the Russian Federation was revealed proposals are formulated for interpreting the notion of reloading for the purposes of taxation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the {{analysis}} of an unpublished set of documents that contains the inventories of paintings and sculptures created between 1835 and 1836 –immediately after the Ecclesiastic Confiscation- in some thirty Madrid based convents. The inventories were created with the purpose of gathering the secularized cultural heritage and place it in museum of new creation known as Museo Nacional de la Trinidad (National Holy Trinity Museum), whose collection was ultimately taken to the Prado Museum in 1892. In the long process of establishment of the Museo Nacional, the origin of the works of art that composed the collection was forgotten. The identification of the origin of those pieces is precisely the main goal of the present study, thus following with the investigation started by Juan Antonio Gaya Nuño in 1947, which regain interest in 1980 with the identification and systematic control of works from the old National Museum´s collection. Also, the publication of Álvarez Lopera´s study in 2009 made a fundamental contribution to the history of the National Museum and to the origin of its collection. This scholar´s methodology has been used in great extent for the analysis of the documents here presented. This study is divided in two main sections. The first one takes into account the historical development of the national heritage´s management after de decrees of Ecclesiastic Confiscation. The first chapter is devoted to definition of the legal and institutional framework in which the initiative to record works of art belonging to the Catholic Church took place. The second one addresses the factual intervention in each convent and all the eventualities one must bear in mind in order to interpret the documents properly, always taking into account that the events took place before 1835; that is, immediately after the Ecclesiastic Confiscation, when an important amount of works of art changed location and owner many times. The clues as to how to correctly interpret and read the inventories are presented by using specific cases and a thorough analysis of a substantial amount of archive materials. Chapter three describes {{the ways in which the}} works were gathered and kept in a temporary location that eventually would become the National Museum. The history and particularities of this institution until its final merging with the Prado Museum makes up the main core of this final chapter of the first section. The second section is devoted to the presentation of results through the elaboration of a catalogue, in which we reveal the origin of 186 unique works of art now part of the Prado collection, The Bowes Museum of Barnard Castle and the San Fernando Academy of Madrid. Through the unveiling of the original <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> of art it has been possible to reconstruct some dismantled decoration projects. We will point out only by way of illustration the exact reconstruction of the nowadays dispersed series of artworks that made up the mural decoration of the Convent of Recoletos. Being some of the pieces property of the Bowes Museum, we hypothesize for the first time the collaboration of Herrera el Mozo and Franciscó Solís and attribute the authority of two until yet anonymous altarpieces to Claudio Coello and Francisco Rizi. On the other hand, it was possible to enhance the current catalogue of works by artist from Toledo for some Madrid based convents. That is the case of Garcia Salmerón, Luis Tristán or Blas Muñoz. We also underscore the collaboration between Antonio de Pereda and the Dominican Order of Atocha, whose implication in the quality and quantity of catalogued works of art makes it of special importance for the history of the artistic patronage in Madrid in the XVII century. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{complexity}} {{of jobs and}} match quality only increase with the density <b>of</b> the worker’s <b>work</b> <b>location</b> and not with the density <b>of</b> the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> residence. This underlines our hypothesis that the density of workers and jobs in cities results in better matching between the two. Our findings suggest that more skilled workers sort into cities of residence for consumption preferences or other reasons, such as the partner’s <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> while their <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> depends on job opportunities. Unfortunately, the dataset does not include information about distances from the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> living to dense labour markets.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{earnings}} differentials between men and women and to find the factors explaining the differentials among home-based workers with comparison to on-site workers. The overall hypotheses examined were: (a) sex is a significant factor in choosing simultaneously occupation and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> and (b) sex is a significant factor in determining the earnings, given the choice <b>of</b> occupation and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The data from Census of Population and Housing, 1990 (United States) : Public Use Microdata Sample: 1 / 10, 000 Sample were used for this study. One of the major findings of this study is that sex was an important factor in choosing occupation and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> However, sex was not significant in the prediction of hourly earnings, after controlling for choice <b>of</b> occupation and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work,</b> when all occupations and locations were considered. Within separate analyses of hourly earnings according to occupational categories, sex was found to be a significant determinant of earnings in all occupational categories. Another major finding is that there are still great differences in the occupational distribution according to sex. As one reason of these differences in the occupational structure between men and women, the possibility of discrimination at the entrance to the occupation, in the form of an occupational entry barrier, cannot be removed...|$|R

Based on the considerations above, we assume that work schedules and locations that fit in well with leisure activities provide more utility than those that do not. In addition, flexible schedules and locations provide more utility than inflexible ones, because they are more adaptable to changing circumstances for instance. Note that this is not much different from the usual assumptions about consumption and leisure in standard labour economics. Just like we assume that consumption and leisure are normal goods, i.e. that more consumption and more leisure “is better” {{in the sense that it}} provides more utility, we assume here that more flexibility in work schedule and location (i.e. more control over timing and <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work)</b> and thus a better schedule and working time fit “is better” as well.|$|R

40|$|The {{context in}} which {{projects}} operate constantly influences the way projects are structured and managed. Due to increasing movements owing to global development, projects are becoming dispersed on multi sites where people and tasks are distributed. Coupled with the inherent complexity of development, complex projects become even more complex. Thus, the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and complexity are considered contextual factors that moderate how projects are managed. Studying {{the impact of these}} factors on project performance is of significant importance. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to contribute to the body of knowledge of project management research by offering {{a better understanding of the}} impacts of contextual factors on projects’ success. This is achieved through the development of a contingent model that has the potential to deal with the variability and constraints imposed by the extent <b>of</b> the <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and project complexity. In this research, a model is proposed based on the assumptions of contingency theory. A contingent approach was adopted in order to theorise the influences <b>of</b> the <b>work’s</b> <b>location</b> and complexity as contingency factors on the relationship between structure and performance of projects. Moreover, the impact of ICT use on project performance and its mediating role between a project’s structure and performance was also addressed. A conceptual model was developed which divided projects into four types: Simple Co-located, Simple Dispersed, Complex Co-located, and Complex Dispersed projects. These types were the results of two continuums <b>of</b> project context: <b>Location</b> <b>of</b> <b>Work</b> and Project Complexity. Each quadrant suggests that when a project’s <b>location</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> and complexity are at certain levels, its structural and technological characteristics are fitted in a certain way to achieve a successful project performance. Based on this model we tested a number of hypotheses. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.
