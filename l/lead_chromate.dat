5|$|The Patries {{envelope}} {{was composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the envelope of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with <b>lead</b> <b>chromate</b> to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the envelope. The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (<b>lead</b> <b>chromate</b> PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic <b>lead</b> <b>chromate</b> (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

She was the second Lebaudy airship, and [...] "surpassed her predecessor in both size and method of construction". The company's first airship, simply known as the Lebaudy, and dubbed by the French public [...] "Le Jaune" [...] ("The Yellow (One)") because of the yellow colour of the <b>lead</b> <b>chromate</b> paint on its cloth exterior, was considered the most successful airship then in operation.|$|E

This is possibly due to financial aspects in fabrication of house paint as low-cost green shades combining PB 15 with yellow pigments are cheaper than e.g. the green copper phthalocyanine complex PG 7 or chromium oxide greens (Cr 2 O 3 or Cr 2 O 3 · 2 H 2 O) [24, 25].|$|R

40|$|Lead oxide is {{a general}} term and can be either lead {{monoxide}} or "litharge " (PbO); lead tetroxide or "red lead " (Pb 3 O 4); or black or "gray " oxide which {{is a mixture of}} 70 percent lead monoxide and 30 percent metallic lead. Black lead is made for specific use in the manufacture of lead acid storage batteries. Because {{of the size of the}} lead acid battery industry, lead monoxide is the most important commercial compound of lead, based on volume. Total oxide production in 1989 was 57, 984 megagrams (64, 000 tons). Litharge is used primarily in the manufacture of various ceramic products. Because of its electrical and electronic properties, litharge is also used in capacitors, Vidicon ® tubes, and electrophotographic plates, as well as in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials. It is also used as an activator in rubber, a curing agent in elastomers, a sulfur removal agent in the production of thioles and in oil refining, and an oxidation catalyst in several organic chemical processes. It also has important markets in the production of many lead chemicals, dry colors, soaps (i. e., lead stearate), and driers for paint. Another important use of litharge is the production of lead salts, particularly those used as stabilizers for plastics, notably polyvinyl chloride materials. The major lead pigment is red lead (Pb 3 O 4), which is used principally in ferrous metal protective paints. Other lead pigments include white <b>lead</b> and <b>lead</b> <b>chromates.</b> There are several commercial varieties of white lead including leaded zinc oxide, basic carbonate white lead, basic sulfate white lead, and basic lead silicates. Of these, the most important is leaded zinc oxide, which is used almost entirely as white pigment for exterior oil-based paints. 12. 16. 2 Process Description 8 Black oxide is usually produced by a Barton Pot process. Basic carbonate white lead production is based on the reaction of litharge with acetic acid or acetate ions. This product, when reacted with carbon dioxide, will form lead carbonate. White leads (other than carbonates) are made either by chemical, fuming, or mechanical blending processes. Red lead is produced by oxidizing litharge in a reverberatory furnace.

A preliminary spectroscopic analysis was carried out on these samples by using Micro-Raman and SERS techniques and the results of a first series are reported in this study. The preliminary analyses carried out with the Raman techniques have shown the presence of a variety of compounds. The white powders, among the more abundant ones, present in lead pyxes, were made of Cerussite PbCO 3 coming from a complete carbonatation of hydrocerussite PbCO 3 *Pb(OH) 2. This is compatible with the high chronology of the samples: instead, hydrocerussite has been identified in Pompeii samples. Its presence can be a clear indicator of cosmesis, since {{it is well known that}} its use in mural painting is not advisable. At the time, cerussa (lead white) was employed as a foundation. Other white substances are calcite and aragonite: the first could come from the ground where the unguentaria were found, the second one could derive from ground sea shells. Litharge, an oxide present in many containers, could derive from the alteration of cerussa, or from a proper addition, whether the yellow colour had a special meaning for the population of the site. The container NI 3149 had a gray powder composed of Carbon mixed with calcium phosphate. This could have been a bone-black or could come from cinerary urn.

40|$|Chromium is a trace metal of {{importance}} in human physiology and, in addition, as 51 -chromate, {{has been extensively}} used as a label {{in the study of}} blood cell pool sizes and intravascular kinetics. The transport characteristics of 51 -chromate were investigated in normal human leukocytes. Chromate uptake is unidirectional over a 1 hr incubation with extracellular chromate concentrations up to 200 μmoles/liter. Under these conditions, intracellular 51 -chromium is in a form in which it is nonexchangeable. Influx is temperature sensitive with a Q 10 of approximately 2 and may be energy dependent since a variety of metabolic poisons strongly inhibit uptake. The unidirectional influx of chromate follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the maximum velocity is 52 mμmoles/g dry weight of cells per min and the chromate concentration at which influx velocity is half maximal is 87 μmoles/liter. This transport mechanism is highly specific for chromate; other divalent tetrahedral anions only slightly inhibit influx at concentrations up to 10 times that of chromate. Metavanadate, however, competitively inhibits chromate influx at equimolar concentrations. Exposure of cells to unlabeled <b>chromate</b> <b>leads</b> to inhibition of subsequent influx of 51 -chromate.
