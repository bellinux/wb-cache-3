50|$|A-Stoff: Liquid oxygen {{equipment}} {{consists of a}} pipe, which follows a circuitous route along the centreline of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame’s</b> lower half. The pipe is fixed on the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> by brackets, and closed at each end by cast ramp-and-claw seals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> {{included}} two accommodations for the rocket, a nose clamp around the warhead and a pivoting clamp around the rocket midsection. Both accommodations included a saddle, and various mechanisms to assist dismount of the rocket onto its launch table. The mechanisms were operated with two drive shafts {{running up the}} port <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> beam. The drive shafts ran within the integral rungs, and were operated by a crewman with a ratchet hand tool.The two drive shafts comprised a short shaft and a long shaft; both starting at the trunnion end of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame,</b> one running half {{the length of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> while the other ran the full length.|$|R
50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated the speed of raising or lowering the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> One hand tap selected direction to either raise or lower the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> The second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> from its vertical position.|$|R
50|$|The <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> was {{constructed}} of two formed I-beams, with tubular and box transverse braces.

40|$|The {{application}} of low temperature silicon nitride protective layers on wire bonded integrated circuits mounted on lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> is reported. An {{evaluation of the}} mechanical and electrical compatibility of both plasma nitride and photochemical silicon nitride (photonitride) passivations (parallel evaluations) of integrated circuits which were then encapsulated in plastic is described. Photonitride passivation is compatible with all wire bonded lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies,</b> with or without initial chip passivation. Plasma nitride passivation of lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> is possible only if the chip is passivated before lead <b>frame</b> <b>assembly.</b> The survival rate after the environmental test sequence of devices with a coating of plasma nitride on the chip and a coating of either plasma nitride or photonitride over the assembled device is significantly {{greater than that of}} devices assembled with no nitride protective coating over either chip or lead frame...|$|R

40|$|The work {{investigates the}} {{application}} of a novel frame model to reduce the computational cost of the mistuning analysis of bladed disc systems. A full-scale finite element (FE) model of the bladed disc is considered as benchmark. The single blade frame configuration is identified via an optimization process. The individual blades are then assembled by 3 D springs, whose parameters are determined via calibration process. The dynamics of the novel beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is also compared to those obtained from three state-of-the-art FE-based reduced order models (ROMs) : a lumped parameter approach; a Timoshenko beam assembly, and component mode synthesis (CMS) based techniques with free and fixed interfaces. The development of these classical ROMs to represent the bladed disc is also addressed in detail. A methodology to perform the mistuning analysis is then proposed and implemented. A comparison of the modal properties and forced response dynamics between the aforementioned ROMs and the full-scale FE model is presented. The case study demonstrates that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can predict the variations of the blade amplitude factors with results being in agreement with the full-scale FE model. The CMS based ROMs underestimate the maximum amplitude factor, while the results obtained from beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> are generally conservative. The beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> is 4 times more computationally efficient than the CMS fixed-interface approach. This study proves that the beam <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> can efficiently predict the mistuning behavior of bladed discs when low order modes are of interest...|$|R

50|$|The {{long drive}} shaft {{ran along the}} full length of the port beam of the <b>lifting</b> <b>frame.</b> It entered a worm gear at the pivot clamp, then {{continued}} to the nose clamp where it entered another worm gear. A shift lever at the nose clamp disengaged the drive shaft to allow either simultaneous or independent operation of the two worm gears. The worm gear at the pivot clamp operated a pair of scissor arms, one {{on each side of the}} <b>lifting</b> <b>frame</b> to insert or extract the trunnion pins from the rocket. The worm gear at the nose clamp operated the jaws of the nose clamp to either open or close, thus enclosing or releasing the rocket.|$|R

40|$|The first {{fuel plate}} <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> of the AFIP- 6 MKII {{experiment}} was irradiated as planned from December, 2011 through February, 2012 {{in the center}} flux trap of the Advanced Test Reactor during cycle 151 A. Following irradiation in this cycle and while reconfiguring the experiment in the ATR canal, a non-fueled component (the bottom plate) of the first fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> became separated from the rail sides. There {{is no evidence that}} the fueled region of the fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> was compromised by this incident or the irradiation conditions. The separation of this component was determined to have been caused by flow induced vibrations, where vortex shedding frequencies were resonant with a natural frequency of the bottom plate component. This gave way to amplification, fracture, and separation from the assembly. Although parallel flow induced vibrations were analyzed, vortex shedding flow induced vibrations was an unfamiliar failure mode that was difficult to identify. Both the once-irradiated first fuel plate and un-irradiated second fuel plate <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> were planned for irradiation in the subsequent cycle 151 B. The AFIP- 6 MKII experiment was excluded from irradiation in cycle 151 B because non-trivial design modifications would be needed to mitigate this type of incident during the second irradiation cycle. All items of the experiment hardware were accounted for and cycle 151 B occurred with a non-fueled AFIP backup assembly in the center flux trap. Options for completion of the AFIP- 6 MKII experiment campaign are presented and future preventative actions are recommended...|$|R
