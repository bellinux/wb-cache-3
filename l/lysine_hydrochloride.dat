40|$|Metal {{enhanced}} {{room temperature}} phosphorescence (MERTP) of fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC) was observed {{with the presence}} of proper content of Ag@SiO 2 core-shell (Ag@SiO 2). The FITC-MERTP was quenched by the existing of lysine in the system. Based on this phenomenon, a novel method for determination of lysine had hereby been developed. Under the added amount ratio of FITC to Ag@SiO 2 of 1 : 1. 5, pH of 8. 0, the detection limit for lysine was 0. 270 mu mol/L, the response was linearly proportional to the concentration of lysine in the range of 1. 50 - 90. 5 mu mol/L, the recoveries of standard addition of artificial samples were in the range of 97. 0 %- 108. 0 %, the relative standard deviation was less than 2. 1 % (n= 9).

40|$|A {{limited number}} of {{researches}} {{have been reported to}} apply the Arrhenius equation to study the relationship between drugs and its degradation products so far. In the present work, the thermal degradation kinetics of <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> solutions for injection, the special solvent for ademetionine 1, 4 -butanedisulfonate (SAM) for injection, was investigated at selected temperatures and pH values. The main degradation product of lysine was separated, purified, and confirmed as lysine lactam. A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographic (RP-HPLC) method without derivation was developed for the simultaneous determination of lysine and lysine lactam. The results confirmed that both the lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation followed zero-order reaction kinetics. The degradation and generation rate constants increased with increasing temperatures and decreasing pH values. The temperature-dependent degradation and generation reaction could be sufficiently modeled on the Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 80. 14 and 83. 22  kJ/mol, respectively. Meanwhile, a linear relationship existed between the amount of lysine degradation and lysine lactam generation since the approximate activation energy. Considering there could be other side effects, we established an upper limit of lysine lactam (500  μg/ml), as the acceptable criteria for stability to estimate the shelf life together with lysine, which made the prediction more accurate and credible. Extrapolation data demonstrated that the <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> solutions for injection could be stable for two years stored at room temperature...|$|E

40|$|The master´s thesis {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{interaction}} between the polysaccharide hyaluronan of diffrerent molecular weights with the amino acids arginine, <b>lysine,</b> arginine <b>hydrochloride</b> and 6 -aminocaproic acid. They are expected interaction between carboxyl groups of hyaluronan and amino groups of amino acids. These interactions were investigated by using ultrasonic spectroscopy, DLS, measuring pH and conductivity. Obtained results were compared with sodium polystyrene sulfonate. With ultrasonic spectroscopy was observed a change of concentration inkrement for titration of amino acid to water or polymers solutions especially for high molecular weight hyaluronan and for NaPSS in combination with 6 AKK in concentration range of added amino acid 0 – 30 mM. The size of this change could mean a degree of interaction between polymers and amino acids. This theory has not been confirmed by other methods. By pH and conductivity measurements interations between arginine and low molecular weight hyaluronan and NaPSS were only confirmed. There was no possibility to make unequivocal conclusions from determination of particle size and zeta potential by DLS. Overall, the issue of the interaction of amino acids with polyanions was proved above expectations complex and will be appropriate to further expand the observations made in this thesis...|$|R

Results: Ingredients imported to the USA from China, including organic & conventional soybeans and meal, <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D & E, choline, carriers (rice hulls, corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline, were inoculated with PEDV. Control ingredients, and treatments (ingredients plus a liquid antimicrobial (SalCURB, Kemin Industries (LA) or a 2 % custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA)) were tested. The model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013. To mimic conditions on land and sea, historical temperature and percent relative humidity (% RH) data were programmed into an environmental chamber which stored all containers. To evaluate PEDV viability over time, ingredients were organized into 1 of 4 batches of samples, each batch representing a specific segment of transport. Batch 1 (segment 1) simulated transport of contaminated ingredients from manufacturing plants in Beijing (day 1 post-contamination (PC)). Batch 2 (segments 1 and 2) simulated manufacturing and delivery to Shanghai, including time in Anquing terminal awaiting shipment (days 1 - 8 PC). Batch 3 (segments 1, 2 and 3) represented time in China, the crossing of the Pacific and entry to the US at the San Francisco, CA terminal (day 1 - 27 PC). Batch 4 (segments 1 - 4) represented the previous events, including transport to Des Moines, IA (days 1 - 37 PC). Across control (non-treated) ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional), Vitamin D, <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and choline chloride. In contrast, viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients using a model simulating shipment from China to the US. This is proof of concept suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients could serve as transboundary risk factors for PEDV, along with the identification of effective mitigation options...|$|E

40|$|The healing {{activity}} of gallic acid enriched ethanolic extract (GAE) of Phyllanthus emblica fruits (amla) against the indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration in mice was investigated. The activity {{was correlated with}} the ability of GAE to alter the cyclooxygenase- (COX-) dependent healing pathways. Histology of the stomach tissues revealed maximum ulceration on the 3 rd day after indomethacin (18 [*]mg/kg, single dose) administration that was associated with significant increase in inflammatory factors, namely, mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (i-NOS) expression. Proangiogenic parameters such as the levels of prostaglandin (PG) E 2, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), von Willebrand Factor VIII, and endothelial NOS (e-NOS) were downregulated by indomethacin. Treatment with GAE (5 [*]mg/kg/day) and omeprazole (3 [*]mg/kg/day) for 3 days led to effective healing of the acute ulceration, while GAE could reverse the indomethacin-induced proinflammatory changes of the designated biochemical parameters.

High levels of nitric oxide (NO) are generated with inducible form of {{nitric oxide synthase}} (iNOS) leading to the renal IR injury and glutathione (GSH) depletion. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the effect of L-Nil (N 6 - (1 -Iminoethyl) -L- <b>lysine.</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> a selective inhibitor of iNOS, in prevention of renal GSH depletion and IR injury. Methods: Ischemia was induced by 40 -min clamping of the renal arteries followed by 6 h reperfusion. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups: Sham operated, Sham- L-Nil, IR and IR- L-Nil. In the IR groups, rats were administered saline or L-Nil (3 mg/kg iv bolus followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/h) 15 min prior ischemia. Other groups underwent surgery protocol but did not undergo renal arteries occlusion and were maintained under anesthesia {{for the duration of the}} experiment (40 min + 6 h). Renal function was assessed by plasma creatinine (Cr), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) measurements. Fractional excretion of Na+ (FENa+), urinary N-acetyl-ß-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and renal GSH level were also measured. Results: We found that L-Nil significantly reduced the IR mediated increases in Cr, BUN, AST, FENa+, NOx and urine NAG activity.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of proteins {{by a variety}} of co-solvents can be related to their property of increasing the surface tension of water. It is demonstrated that, during the thermal unfolding of proteins, this increase of the surface tension can be overcome by the increase in the temperature of the solution at the midpoint of the transition, Tm, and the weak binding of co-solvent molecules. Three such co-solvents were studied: trehalose, <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (LysHCl), and arginine hydrochloride (ArgHCl). Trehalose and LysHCl increase the midpoint of Tm. The increase of the surface tension by addition of trehalose is completely compensated by its decrease due to the increase in Tm. However, for LysHCl, the increase of the surface tension by the co-solvent is partly reduced by its binding to the protein. For trehalose, preferential interaction measurements with RNaseA demonstrate that it is totally excluded from the protein. In contrast, LysHCl gives evidence of binding to RNaseA. ArgHCl also increases the surface tension of water. Nevertheless, Tm of RNaseA decreases on addition of ArgHCl to the solution. Preferential interaction measurements showed very small values of preferential hydration of the native protein, indicating extensive binding of ArgHCl to the protein. During unfolding, the amount of additional ArgHCl binding is sufficiently large to counteract the surface tension effects, and the protein is destabilized. Therefore, although surface tension appears to be a critical factor in the {{stabilization of}} proteins, its increase by co-solvent does not ensure increased stabilization. The binding of ligands can reduce significantly, or even overwhelm, its effects...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that the non-alpha-helical, amino-terminal head region of vimentin is {{essential}} for the formation and stability of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs). In order to specify its target site on companion protein subunits, it was cut off from vimentin at amino acid position 96 with lysine-specific endoproteinase and allowed to react with intact vimentin and other IF proteins. In solution of high salt concentration (500 mM KCl), the isolated polypeptide (vim NT) showed a high affinity for all cytoplasmic IF proteins tested, but not for nuclear lamins. Employing limited digestion of the IF proteins with different proteinases, the binding site was shown to reside in their alpha-helical rod domains. Other polypeptides possessing alpha-helical regions with the potential to form coiled-coil structures like tropomyosin and myosin subfragment 2 did not react with vim NT. The binding to IF proteins was strongly inhibited by phosphorylation of vim NT and totally abolished in the presence of 200 mM arginine hydrochloride, whereas the same concentration of <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was ineffective. Limited chymotryptic digestion of vim NT produced polypeptides that were unable to react with the alpha-helical region of vimentin at high salt concentration. Consistent with these observations, vim NT strongly inhibited filament formation in vitro from protofilamentous vimentin. A 14 -mer oligopeptide comprising the amino acids 3 to 16 of the amino terminus also inhibited filament formation, though to a lesser extent. Conversely, vim NT and, with a lower efficiency, the 14 -mer oligopeptide also severely affected the structure of preformed vimentin filaments by unraveling them. Phosphorylated vim NT was considerably less active in this respect. Further digestion of the rod domain of vimentin with chymotrypsin yielded 17. 4 and 21 kDa polypeptides, which were tentatively characterized as originating from the carboxy- and amino-terminal half of the rod domain, respectively. Both formed salt-stable complexes with vim NT, the smaller polypeptide with a higher efficiency than the larger one. These results suggest that the staggered, antiparallel arrangement of the two coiled-coils in the protofilaments of IF proteins is, at least in part, determined by the twofold, symmetrical association of the amino-terminal head regions of one coiled-coil rope structure with the carboxy-terminal halves of the alpha-helical rod domains of the other coiled-coil and that similar interactions occur during filament assembly and in the intact filament...|$|E

First published February 18, 2009; doi: 10. 1152 /ajprenal. 90371. 2008. -Even though renal hypoxia {{is believed to}} play {{a pivotal role in}} the development of acute kidney injury, no study has specifically addressed the alterations in renal oxygenation in the early onset of renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Renal oxygenation depends on a balance between oxygen supply and consumption, with the nitric oxide (NO) as a major regulator of microvascular oxygen supply and oxygen consumption. The aim of this study was to investigate whether I/R induces inducible NO synthase (iNOS) -dependent early changes in renal oxygenation and the potential benefit of iNOS inhibitors on such alterations. Anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a 30 -min suprarenal aortic clamping with or without either the nonselective NO synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or the selective iNOS inhibitor L-N- 6 -(1 -iminoethyl) <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (L-NIL). Cortical (C mu Po- 2) and outer medullary (M mu Po- 2) microvascular oxygen pressure (mu Po- 2), renal oxygen delivery (Do(2 ren)), renal oxygen consumption ((V) over doto(2 ren)), and renal oxygen extraction (O 2 ER) were measured by oxygen-dependent quenching phosphorescence techniques throughout 2 h of reperfusion. During reperfusion renal arterial resistance and oxygen shunting increased, whereas renal blood flow, C mu Po- 2, and M mu Po- 2 (- 70, - 42, and - 42 %, respectively, P < 0. 05), (V) over dot o(2 ren), and Do(2 ren) (- 70 %, P < 0. 0001, and - 28 %, P < 0. 05) dropped. Whereas L-NAME further decreased Do(2 ren), (V) over dot o(2 ren), C mu Po- 2, and M mu Po- 2 and deteriorated renal function, L-NIL partially prevented the drop of Do(2 ren) and mu Po- 2, increased O 2 ER, restored (V) over dot o(2 ren) and metabolic efficiency, and prevented deterioration of renal function. Our results demonstrate that renal I/R induces early iNOS-dependent microvascular hypoxia in disrupting the balance between microvascular oxygen supply and (V) over dot o(2 ren), whereas endothelial NO synthase activity is compulsory for the maintenance of this balance.

40|$|Due to the finicky {{nature of}} the {{domestic}} cats' feeding habits, palatability is a highly complex area of feline nutrition, but one which is vitally important, with pet owners today selecting a brand based on palatability rather than nutritional value (Trivedi and Benning 1999). To date there is little published literature about the specific compounds and ingredients responsible for the palatability of cat foods, however, some animal by-products, particularly fish offals have been reported as being highly palatable to the cat (MacDonald et al. 1984). There is much interest {{in the use of}} synthetic diets for palatability testing because these diets can be easily manipulated to control specific properties of the diet. The aims of this study, using the domestic cat as the test species were to: (1) test the efficacy of using synthetic diets in palatability trials, (2) determine the palatability of various fish by-products when included in synthetic and commercially canned diets, (3) develop a method suitable for fractionating fish by-products and fractionate selected by-products. (4) determine the palatability of the fish by-product fractions obtained and (5) determine the palatability of various pure compounds when dissolved in pet milk. All palatability trials carried out used the two bowl free choice testing method. The freeze dried forms of hoki, mussel, salmon and jack mackerel by-products were included in a synthetic diet and compared to an un-supplemented synthetic diet. Hoki, mussel, salmon and barracouta by-products and the three fish by-product fractions (salmon oil, salmon water and barracouta water) were included fresh in commercially made canned diets and compared to a common commercial diet (control). Finally various pure compounds (amino acids, malic acid, salts, urea, creatinine, creatine, etc.) were dissolved in pet milk and compared to un-supplemented pet milk (control). Feed intakes were recorded daily for all of the trials. The test animals used were domestic short haired cats obtained from the Centre for Feline Nutrition (Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand) and all were in excellent health before testing began. The panels of cats used were either all castrated males aged three to nine years old, or a mixture of castrated males, entire females and entire males aged two to eleven years old. The feed intake data collected during the trials were analysed using t tests, and repeat measures ANOVA. Feed intakes were low overall during the synthetic trial due to the un-supplemented control diet itself not being very palatable. These low feed intakes resulted in weight losses in the cats and the study had to be abandoned prematurely. Therefore, the results are only based on a sample size of two and are of limited value as such. The other three trials were highly successful, with all cats remaining healthy, apart from two which were taken from the milk trial due to health reasons unrelated to these trials. Salmon and jack mackerel by-products were both significantly (P 0. 05) from the control when they were included in synthetic diets. When the fish by-products were included in commercial diets, the salmon and mussel by-products were the most palatable of the test diets, however, the salmon, mussel and barracouta by-products were not significantly different (P> 0. 05) from the control in terms of palatability. The hoki by-product was significantly (P 0. 05) different from the control in terms of palatability. Lastly, the trials involving the testing of pure compounds highlighted that at the 0. 3 % dose proline, lysine (<b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride),</b> histidine, cysteine (cysteine hydrochloride), glycine and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were all significantly (P 0. 05) than the control at this inclusion level. In conclusion, salmon by-product was liked and hoki by-product was disliked by the cats when included in both synthetic and commercial diets. Mussel by-product was palatable when included in the commercial diets, but was no more palatable than the control when tested in the synthetic diet. Jack mackerel by-product was palatable in the synthetic diet and barracouta by-product was no more palatable than the control in the commercial diet. Salmon oil and the compounds proline, <b>lysine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> histidine, glycine, cysteine hydrochloride and sodium dihydrogen phosphate were highly palatable to the cat. If future work with synthetic diets occurs it needs to be aimed at pre-weaned kittens as {{it would be easier to}} wean young inexperienced kittens onto a synthetic diet than older cats which are used to receiving a commercially made diet. The fish by-products tested here, along with other New Zealand fish species need to be further investigated. It may also be of use to test the fish by-products and their fractions in a different type of base diet in order to determine how this affects their palatability. The dose dependency of the compounds found palatable in the milk trials also needs to be established, in order to find an optimum dose for them to be used as palatability enhancers...|$|E
