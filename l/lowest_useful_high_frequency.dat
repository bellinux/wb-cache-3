40|$|Abstract Background Electrocardiogram {{recordings}} {{are very}} often contaminated by high-frequency noise usually power-line interference and EMG disturbances (tremor). Specific method for interference cancellation without affecting the proper ECG components, called subtraction procedure, was developed some two decades ago. Filtering out the tremor remains a priori partially successful {{since it has}} a relatively wide spectrum, which overlaps the useful ECG frequency band. Method The proposed method for tremor suppression implements the following three procedures. Contaminated ECG signals are subjected to moving averaging (comb filter with linear phase characteristic) with first zero set at 50 Hz to suppress tremor and PL interference simultaneously. The reduced peaks of QRS complexes and other relatively high and steep ECG waves are then restored by an introduced by us procedure called linearly-angular, so that the <b>useful</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> components are preserved in the range specified by the embedded in the ECG instrument filter, usually up to 125 Hz. Finally, a Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter is applied for supplementary tremor suppression outside the QRS complexes.

40|$|This study investigates whether {{standard}} time series models are <b>useful</b> in <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> foreign exchange applications. This issue is examined from two perspectives. First, an innovative Monte Carlo procedure {{demonstrates that the}} unconditional distribution of <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> foreign exchange returns cannot be approximated by the unconditional distribution of returns simulated by autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) processes. However in the second section of the paper, a range of standard ARCH models are shown to produce accurate forecasts of realized daily variance when frequently sampled data is used to generate and appraise variance forecasts. This {{appears to be an}} artifact of the noise inherent in using the daily squared return as an estimator of realized daily variance. In short, this paper demonstrates that whilst standard econometric models are unable to capture the intraday foreign exchange return generating process, practical benefits in forecasting applications are readily attainable from using <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> data to develop and evaluate existing asset pricing models...|$|R

Here discrete wavelet frame analysis was first applied to obtain the wavelet coefficients of the Doppler signal at multiple scales.

In order to improve the adaptability of the threshold, a threshold-based wavelet packet denoising method was employed [5]. This approach, which can adaptively select the threshold, preserved <b>useful</b> <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> components and offered higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared with straightforward wavelet-based denoising methods. The matching pursuit (MP) method was also used for improving the SNR of Doppler blood flow signals [6].

The results disclose that the PHDS algorithm can substantially reduce the size of data while preserving the critical bearing defect information for all the data sets used in this work even when a large down-sample ratio was used (i. e., 500 times down-sampled). In contrast, the down-sample process using existing normal down-sample technique in signal processing eliminates the useful and critical information such as bearing defect frequencies in a signal when the same down-sample ratio was employed.

We show here that PTR-MS is capable of discriminating individual monoterpenes when operating in the alternating drift voltage (AD) mode. The approach is based on the principle that slightly different energies are required for the fragmentation/clustering of a given monoterpene, so in AD mode each monoterpene has different time points for fragmentation. Therefore from a fragmentation analysis of background-subtracted standards it is possible to calculate the percentage of each monoterpene in an absolute concentration of their sum. Although monoterpenes have been chosen as an example, the method is likely to be effective for other structural isomeric species such as the sesquiterpenes or methyl vinyl ketone/methacrolein (MVK/MACR) ...|$|R
