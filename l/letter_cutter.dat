50|$|Miklós Tótfalusi Kis (Misztótfalusi Kis Miklós) (1650 - March 20, 1702) was a Hungarian <b>letter</b> <b>cutter,</b> {{typeface}} designer, typographer and printer. Kis {{was one of}} {{the first}} printers and letter cutters of the Georgian type letters. He made fonts on the request of the Georgian king Archil of Imereti.|$|E

He also inspired and trained other renowned sculptors and <b>letter</b> <b>cutters,</b> including John Skelton, Michael Harvey and the Irish sculptor Michael Biggs.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the work}} of most stonemasons, {{the work of}} the monumental mason is of small size, often just a small slab of stone, but {{generally}} with a highly detailed finish. Generally gravestones are highly polished with detailed engraving of text and symbols. Some memorials are more elaborate and may involve the sculpture of symbols associated with death, such as angels, hands joined in prayer, and vases of flowers. Some specially-made stones feature artistic lettering by <b>letter</b> <b>cutters.</b>|$|R
50|$|From {{his return}} from France in 1919 {{until his death in}} 1967, Joseph {{continued}} to work in the Guild on Ditchling Common, cutting inscriptions, carving sculptures and decorative stone work. His rate of production was prodigious, able to cut inscriptions at three or four times the speed of most <b>letter</b> <b>cutters,</b> examples of his letter cutting can be found in many Sussex cemeteries and in churches and public buildings throughout south-east England. During his career, for example, he made more than twenty sets of Stations of the Cross (each set containing fourteen panels), including carving the Stations of the Cross at St Matthew's, Westminster. His work is often mistaken for that of his master, as his letter cutting is difficult to distinguish, but his sculptures are easier to recognise, as he developed his own style, based on the Romanesque sculptures he saw in France and in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.|$|R

50|$|Eric Gill, the {{sculptor}} and <b>letter</b> <b>cutter,</b> came to Ditchling in 1907 with his apprentice Joseph Cribb {{and was soon}} followed by other craftsmen. In 1921 they founded the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, a Roman Catholic community of artists and craftsmen, inspired by ideas of the medieval guilds and the Arts and Crafts movement. The community had its own workshops and chapel, and thrived for many years. Its affairs were finally wound up in 1989, and the workshops demolished.|$|E
5000|$|Mihai Iștvanovici, {{also known}} as [...] "the Wallachian" [...] or Stepaneshvili, was a 17-18th century Wallachian <b>letter</b> <b>cutter,</b> {{typeface}} designer, typographer and printer {{who worked in the}} first typography in Georgia under King Vakhtang VI of Kartli. Mihai was a native of Transylvania, born into a peasant family that served Hungarian landlords. Mihai was sent to Georgia by Anthim the Iberian upon the request of King Vakhtang VI of Kartli, in order to establish a printing press and typography. He likely arrived in Georgia in 1707. Vakhtang VI wrote in his will, [...] "I brought the printer from Wallachia and made a typography".|$|E

50|$|The vinyl cutter is {{an entry}} level machine making signs. It can make durable signs. Computer {{designed}} vector files with patterns and letters are directly {{cut on the}} roll of vinyl which is mounted and feed into the vinyl cutter, through USB or serial cable. Vinyl cutters are mainly used to make signs, banners and advertisements. Advertisements seen on automobiles and vans are often made with vinyl cut <b>letters.</b> Vinyl <b>cutters</b> {{can also be used}} to cut out shapes from thin cardboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{story of}} the Guild began when Eric Gill the {{sculptor}} and <b>letter</b> <b>cutter</b> came to Ditchling, Sussex in 1907 with his apprentice Joseph Cribb and was soon followed by fellow craftsmen Edward Johnston and Hilary Pepler. In 1921 they founded the Guild, this being a Roman Catholic community {{based on the idea}} of the medieval guild, which existed for the protection and the promotion of its members' work and had been revived by the leaders of the Arts and Crafts Movement. It was a community of work, faith and domestic life, with workshops and a chapel, and members living according to their faith. Its philosophy was encapsulated in what today might be called its mission statement, engraved on a stone plaque, now in Cheltenham Museum.|$|E
50|$|Hadrianus Junius, {{otherwise}} known as Adriaen de Jonghe, wrote this story around 1567 in his book Batavia, published only in 1588, and was quoted by Cornelis de Bie. Now known primarily for his Emblemata, Junius moved to Haarlem in 1550, and wrote several books, acting shortly as the rector of the Latin School there, as the city physician and as historiographer of the States of Holland (as of 1565/66). His story was echoed by his friend Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert, who started a printing business in Haarlem in 1560. Later Samuel Ampzing (with the help of Petrus Scriverius) repeated the story in Lavre-Kranz Voor Lavrens Koster Van Haerlem, Eerste Vinder vande Boek-Druckerye (1628) with illustrations of the invention. According to Junius, sometime in the 1420s, Coster was in the Haarlemmerhout carving letters from bark for the amusement of his grandchildren, and observed that the letters left impressions on the sand. He proceeded to invent {{a new type of}} ink that didn't run, and he began a printing company based on his invention with a primitive typesetting arrangement using moveable type. Since the Haarlemmerhout was burned during a siege by the Kennemers in 1426 during the Hook and Cod wars, this must have been early in the 1420s. Using wooden letters at first, he later used lead and tin movable type. His company prospered and grew. He is said to have printed several books including Speculum Humanae Salvationis with several assistants including the <b>letter</b> <b>cutter</b> Johann Fust, and it was this <b>letter</b> <b>cutter</b> Fust (often spelled Faust) who, when Laurens was nearing death, broke his promise of secrecy and stole his presses and type and took them to Mainz where he started his own printing company.|$|E
50|$|After Joseph {{returned}} from France he continued working with Eric Gill, leading {{the work of}} various assistants and drawing his brother Lawrence into Gill's team, which was busy making war memorials. In 1920 Joseph joined Gill, Hilary Pepler and Desmond Chute in setting up the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, an association of Catholic artists and craftworkers on Ditchling Common. From 1920 Joseph also started taking on his own commissions, also initially making war memorials. His first large sculptural commission was a crucifix for the war memorial at Downside Abbey. When Gill left the Guild and moved first to Wales and later to Buckinghamshire, Joseph's brother went with him and took over Joseph's role as Gill's lead assistant. Joseph remained at the Guild and took over Gill's workshop, establishing his own practice as a sculptor, carver and <b>letter</b> <b>cutter.</b> He continued to do occasional work for Gill, helping him {{with some of his}} major sculpture, for example on the monumental sculpture Mankind that is now in the Tate, and cutting letters to Gill's designs.|$|E

40|$|An {{international}} {{panel of}} type and design experts gathered at Sheridan on September 21, 2015 {{to talk about}} the form of typography and how its history contributes to its future. The panelists were Matthew Carter, Rod McDonald, Allan Haley and Charles Nix of Monotype. The discussion followed an exhibition and world premiere screening of a digitized and expanded film by Carl Dair, who designed Cartier – Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface. The film, Carl Dair at Enschedé: The Last Days of Metal Type features a digitized version of the 1957 silent film shot by Dair while studying in Holland with one of the last great European <b>letter</b> punch <b>cutters,</b> Paul Rädisch. It begins with a prologue by Canadian type designer Rod McDonald, who in 1998, updated and expanded Dair 2 ̆ 7 s Cartier typeface for digital technology. The film is narrated by Matthew Carter, one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading typeface designers who also studied with Rädisch. The film was co-produced by Sheridan College and Massey College at the University of Toronto. The exhibit in the Sheridan Art Gallery, opened prior to the film screening, included artifacts such as didactic panels, photographs, sketches, tools, letters and books. It told the story of Carl Dair 2 ̆ 7 s quest to create Canada 2 ̆ 7 s first Latin typeface as part of the 1967 centennial as well as Rod McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s redesign. The panel discussion was part of Sheridan’s Creative Campus Series. [URL]...|$|R
