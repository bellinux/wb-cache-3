This {{was established in the}} unprecedented case of R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999). In an appeal to the House of Lords, the Crown Prosecution Service sought to overturn a quashing order made by the Divisional Court regarding extradition warrants made against the ex-Chilean dictator, Senator Augusto Pinochet. Amnesty International (AI) was given <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in the proceedings. However, one of the judges of the case, Lord Hoffmann, was a director and chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd. (AICL), a company under the control of AI. He was eventually disqualified from the case and the outcome of the proceedings set aside. The House of Lords held that the close connection between AICL and AI presented Lord Hoffmann with an interest in the outcome of the litigation. Even though it was non-pecuniary, the Law Lords took the view that the interest was sufficient to warrant Lord Hoffmann's automatic disqualification from hearing the case. In Locabail (U.K.) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999), the Court of Appeal warned against any further extension of the automatic disqualification rule, [...] "unless plainly required to give effect to the important underlying principles upon which the rule is based".|$|E

The defences of Barger and McKay included an objection that the that the Excise Act 1906 was invalid. That objection was referred to the Full Court of the High Court for hearing. The argument for Barger and McKay was that although the Act on its face purports to be an exercise of the taxation power, the real substance and effect of the Act was with respect to the conditions and remuneration of labour. The State of Victoria obtained <b>leave</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in both cases and similarly argued the Excise Act 1906 was invalid.
