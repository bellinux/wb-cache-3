Similar response is seen during procedures on Larynx in microlaryngeal surgery which produces an intense cardiovascular stimulation during suspension laryngoscopy and intubation. AIM OF STUDY Supraglottic jet ventilation versus conventional endotracheal ventilation in minor <b>laryngeal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> To evaluate the haemodynamic response in supraglottic jet ventilation and conventional intubation in minor <b>laryngeal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> METHODS Patients were randomised to 2 Groups: 30 patients in each group; Group A - in whom supraglottic jet ventilation was planned and Group B - in whom endotracheal intubation was planned. RESULT The haemodynamic response in terms of increase in MAP and HR is significantly more with endotracheal intubation than with supraglottic jet ventilation. CONCLUSION Our study showed that supraglottic jet ventilation showed a better haemodynamic stability when compared to conventional endotracheal intubation in patients undergoing minor <b>laryngeal</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Statistical scores were also in favour of the patients treated with supraglottic jet ventilation based on the p values. ...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study}} was to describe the position of the cricothyroid articulation and the distance between the right and left articulations, and to compare these findings between genders. The following measurements were obtained for 16 cadavers (9 men and 7 women) : angulation of the cricothyroid articulation in the cricoid ring, dimensions of the thyroid articular surface of the cricoid cartilage, and distance between the cricothyroid and cricoarytenoid articulations. The cricothyroid articulation angle was narrower in men than in women (p =. 04). The major diameter of the articular facet of the thyroid cartilage was wider in men (p =. 001).

40|$|Objectives: We {{assessed}} {{the outcome of}} en bloc transoral resection of supraglottic and hypopharyngeal cancer using a distending laryngoscope with rigid videoendoscopic and laparoscopic surgical instruments. Methods: We enrolled 30 patients with T 1, T 2, or selected T 3 supraglottic and hypopharyngeal cancer in the study; 9 patients had undergone radiotherapy. Neck dissections were performed for node-positive patients. Postoperative radio-therapy was administered to patients with multiple lymph node metastases or positive surgical margins. Results: This surgical environment provided a wide view of the operative field, facilitating bimanual manipulation of laparoscopic surgical instruments, and enabled us to perform en bloc transoral resection. In 21 cases with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year (average, 33 months; range, 15 to 56 months), the 3 -year disease-specific survival rate and the laryngeal preservation rate were each 95 %. Normal food intake was eventually possible in all cases. Tracheostomy was performed for 2 patients as a prophylactic measure and for 1 patient because of a postoperative hemorrhage.

She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat. (However, Andrews has recently stated that it was due to [...] "a certain kind of muscular striation that happens on the vocal cords" [...] as a result of strain from Victor/Victoria, adding [...] "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.") She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999 she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 [...] "it's been two years, and it singing voice still hasn't returned." [...] The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount. Andrews admits that she has never recovered from the botched attempt to remove nodules from her vocal cords back in 1997.

Open surgery of the larynx allows for increased expo-sure of the surgical field and dexterity of instrumentation; however, healthy tissue, especially the delicate vibratory tissues and framework of the larynx, may be damaged during the procedure.
