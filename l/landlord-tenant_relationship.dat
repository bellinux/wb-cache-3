While News 12 had argued that the state had failed to demonstrate any basis for supposing that Bonie had confessed to the crime off camera, the judge said that the prosecution sought to learn whether he had made admissions relevant to the case. Raimundi's narration described Bonie making positive statements about his relationship with Moore.

40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted on the restructuring activities of tenant farmers in response to changing tenancy legislation and recent CAP reforms. This paper examines the geography of farm tenancy agreements in England since 1995 and presents some findings from postal and telephone surveys on the possible future business trajectories of tenant farmers and the changing nature of <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships.</b> A clear north-south divide is identified in terms of farm tenancy agreements and a complex array of different tenancy agreements is demonstrated. The relationships between landlords and tenants are changing and the increasing variety of agreements provides evidence of a more fluid (post-feudal) system of agricultural leases. Nevertheless, high levels of uncertainty and negativity characterise tenant farmers' views on the impacts of CAP reforms. Crucially, the very identity of a tenant farmer is changing, towards an owner-occupier who rents additional land, and there is an urgent need for more detailed research on the 'consequential geographies' of farm property rights and the changing nature of <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{concepts}} of landlord and tenant have been recycled {{to refer to}} the modern relationship of the parties to land which is held under a lease. It has been pointed out by Professor F.H.

50|$|In Japan, landowners {{turned over}} their land to {{families}} of tenant farmers to manage.

After WWII, the Farm Land Reform Law of 1946 banned absentee landlordism, re-distributing land and permitted tenants to buy.

50|$|In English and Irish law, a {{fee farm}} grant is a hybrid type of land {{ownership}} typical {{in cities and}} towns. The word fee is derived from fief, meaning a feudal landholding, and a fee farm grant {{is similar to a}} fee simple {{in the sense that it}} gives the grantee the right to hold a freehold estate, the only difference being the payment of an annual rent (farm being an archaic word for rent) and covenants, thus putting both parties in a <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{property}} law and real estate, a future interest {{is a legal}} right to property ownership {{that does not include}} the right to present possession or enjoyment of the property. Future interests are created on the formation of a defeasible estate; that is, an estate with a condition or event triggering transfer of possessory ownership. A common example is the <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationship.</b> The landlord may own a house, but has no general right to enter it while it is being rented. The conditions triggering the transfer of possession, first to the tenant then back to the landlord, are usually detailed in a lease.|$|E

Purpose – The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the factors present in successful energy efficiency investments that might indicate how to resolve the landlord-tenant dilemma in existing and new commercial property. Design/methodology/approach – The paper reviews literature to indicate the importance of energy efficiency in buildings and to explore the barriers to such investments, including problematic <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships.</b> Such relationships have been investigated by the International Energy Agency, and a similar approach is used here in two case studies in new and existing buildings. These studies explore the nature of <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships</b> and the importance of policy and standards of building performance. Findings – In neither case did landlord-tenant issues constitute barriers to investments in energy efficiency, however, these investments were made for other reasons than simple cost savings. Construction of new commercial property to Passivhaus standards ensures a high-build quality and a comfortable building with low-energy costs. The added value to tenants may justify the cost of construction. The cost of investments in energy efficient buildings can also be justified by the enhanced reputation of landlords which may be more valuable than a DEC rating. In neither case was the commercial Green Deal felt to be an attractive funding mechanism. Practical implications – Conclusions based on these case studies must be regarded as tentative, so future studies of successful energy efficient buildings should be undertaken to explore the motivation to invest, particularly the relative importance of indirect benefits of energy efficiency. Originality/value – One of the case study buildings is exceptionally energy efficient and is the result of a particularly open and effective contractual relationship. Further study of such cases may suggest a new approach to landlord-tenant problems of energy efficiency, even in refurbishment of existing buildings...|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors have}} been {{hypothesized}} {{to account for the}} fact that certain disputes become legal claims while others fail to escalate.

This thesis is based on an empirical study exploring the existence of such disputing styles in the context of <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships.</b> Accounts of reallife disputes were gathered through interviews with tenants having recently faced problems with their landlords; four personality tests were also administered to the participants.

50|$|More formally, in owner-occupancy, the <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationship</b> is short-circuited. Consider a model: two people, A and B, {{each of whom}} owns property. If A {{lives in}} B's property, and B lives in A's, two {{financial}} transactions take place: each pays rent to the other. But if A and B are both owner-occupiers, no money changes hands even though the same economic relationships exists; there are still two owners and two occupiers, but the transactions between them no longer go through the market. The amount that would have changed hands had the owner and occupier been different persons is the imputed rent.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to {{filing a}} suit {{in court for}} eviction, {{generally}} the landlord must provide written notice to the tenant (commonly called a notice to quit or notice to vacate).

50|$|The next 240 years {{following}} the Ladia Revolt passed without any sign of serious discontent against Spanish rule. Although armed uprisings and resistance occurred in other provinces, notably in the Ilocos and in Jolo, Malolos was largely unaffected. Economic development that took precedence in the low-lying areas around Malolos, were steadily converted into productive ricefields and fishponds. This must have entailed {{a great deal of}} capital, both financial and labor, and both were apparently available in Malolos. The mestizo descendants of the pre-Hispanic Chinese traders, who became the landlords, must have been the major source of the finances. The ordinary townfolk furnished the labor and became the tenants. This <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationship</b> lasted until the middle of the 20th century.|$|E
40|$|The present Iowa laws {{pertaining}} to <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships</b> do {{not distinguish between}} urban and agricultural conditions, with only two exceptions: The agricultural landlord’s lien and the termination of indefinite agricultural leases. This lien applies to the total crop and to all personal property of the tenant, except to the property exempted from execution. In addition, leases usually contain a provision in which the tenant waives his exemption rights. In periods of excessive price decline or crop failure, and if production credit is sought by the tenant, the landlord’s lien may work serious hardship. As a possible corrective, placing of certain limitations on the landlord’s lien, and declaring invalid any waivers of exemption rights might be considered. An Iowa statute provides that any lease with a fixed date of termination shall expire without notice and that only 1 month’s notice is necessary to terminate an indefinite tenancy. The old common law rule provided for a 6 months’ period of notice for termination of leases without a definite expiration date. It was changed by legislation {{in order to accommodate}} urban tenants and landlords. A statute requiring a 6 months’ notice for the termination of any farm lease would be better adapted to agricultural needs...|$|R
50|$|The Bank's {{policy of}} {{requiring}} collateral valued at 200 {{percent or more}} of the amount of the loan requested had adverse effects. The security requirement directed loans to the urban areas, where property values are high, and excluded loans to potentially productive areas where no title deeds exist or where communal ownership prevails. The Development Bank, as a tool for large-scale development, had not accomplished all of the objectives. One of the weaknesses of the Bank was a passive attitude. It would have been more desirable if it had sought promising avenues of investment rather than to wait to be approached by applicants. Some 85 percent of the number of loans made by the bank were overdue. These include 97 percent of small agricultural loans (up to Eth$2,000), about 80 percent of the industrial of the industrial loans, nearly 78 percent of the coffee loans, and over 65 percent of the agricultural development loans. However, the 85 percent of outstanding loans overdue represented less than 27 percent of the total amount outstanding. The multiplicity of forms of land tenure, the prevalence of tenant cultivation, the absence of legally defined <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships,</b> and the lack of cadastral surveys and clearly defined certificates of ownership have restricted the Bank's activities.|$|R
40|$|Any {{number of}} {{concepts}} and ideas {{have been set}} forth {{over the past two}} or three decades to describe and explain the various problems common 10 urban development in Third World countries. Perhaps foremost among these has been the notion of the urban informal economy, a topic that has generated an enormous literature and that has, despite (or even because of) considerable debate and argument, provided considerable analytic leverage when brought to bear on the topic of Third World urban development and underdevelopment. Yet while this concept has been indeed useful, it may become even more so if linked with two notions from applied economics, namely, the ideas of rent seeking (hereinafter sometimes referred 10 simply as R-S) and rent avoidance (R-A). The terms, which are closely related, do not deal with the usual meaning of the term "rent", especially in the context of <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships.</b> Rather, rent here refers 10 "that part of the payment 10 an owner of resources over and above that which those resources could command in any altemative use" (Buchanan 1980 : 3).

5000|$|James C. Scott {{takes this}} grid of {{interpretation}} and applies {{to it to}} rural communities in the developing world.

The <b>Landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationship,</b> for example, may not permit the peasant to reap the most benefit from his work, but would be based on a [...] "reciprocity ethic." [...] The precarity of agrarian life is a central tenet of Scott's argument.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which landlords of property portfolios are permitted by law to take account of the interests of other properties in their portfolio when exercising control over individual properties. It also examines what rights individual tenants have in the management of of their landlord's portfolio, and what effect competition law might have on portfolio landlords' control. The courts' approach to the reasonableness of a landlord's withholding of consent is considered in detail, with particular attention paid to how it may affect the ability of portfolio landlords to protect the rest of their properties from harm through the withholding of consent. Attention is also given to the legislative interference in the law of landlord and tenant, and the areas where Parliament considered the impact of law on portfolio landlords, such as fines provisions in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1927, and in the rejection of proposals for mandatory full qualification of user covenants. The need for competition law in the land sector in response to the market power of portfolio landlords is also discussed. Finaly, a number of ways for tenants to have some say in the management of the portfolio are examined. These include contractual provisions intended to empower the tenant, the doctrine of non-derogation from grant, the use of letting schemes, the use of competition law to escape restrictive covenants, cooperation between landlords and tenants and the use of alternative dispute resolution to maintain amicable <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R
40|$|Tax {{arbitrage}} {{opportunities in}} rental housing markets arise when high bracket taxpayers exploit the tax shelter and conversion {{features of the}} tax treatment of rental housing {{and as a consequence}} offer low bracket taxpayers rental housing at a cost lower than if they purchased the same quantity of housing for owner occupation. A microdata set has been employed to estimate the size of these tax arbitrage opportunities with respect to 1907 properties owned by Australian landlords. The measure of tax arbitrage opportunities is the breakeven tax rate at which the maximum rental rate a potential occupant is prepared to pay before turning to purchased housing is equal to the landlord&# 039;s reservation rental rate. Potential occupants with marginal tax rates below the breakeven tax rate find that renting has a relative cost advantage over home purchase. When agency costs (the costs incurred in managing <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships)</b> are included in the tax arbitrage model, our estimates of the breakeven tax rate indicate that home purchase has a relative cost advantage over renting for most potential occupants. Renting is only financially attractive to low tax bracket individuals. This finding is consistent with Australian tenure patterns. However, there are more puzzling results. A majority of landlords belong to tax brackets below the top bracket, landlords in the lowest tax brackets typically make below normal profits, and reservation rental rates {{at the bottom of the}} rental housing market are relatively high. Down payment requirements, lock-in effects, and rent clientele groups are put forward as possible explanations for these findings...|$|R
40|$|The site of some {{of western}} Europe’s most {{dramatic}} movement episodes, Ireland is a peculiar case for studying social movement research. The 1798 uprising was a significant element of the Atlantic Revolutions; the Land War (1879 - 1882) initiated one of the world’s most successful land reforms, with a near-complete transition from <b>landlord-tenant</b> <b>relationships</b> to peasant proprietorship; the period between 1916 and 1923 saw one of western Europe’s few successful independence movements; the Northern Irish “troubles” from 1969 – 1994 were Europe’s longest-running episode of lethal internal violence; 1978 - 1981 {{saw one of the}} few outright defeats of nuclear power worldwide; the women’s and GLBTQ movements brought about a more dramatic change from institutionalised Catholic power than in most Northern contexts; and working-class community organising has played a role in Ireland comparable to Latin American contexts. On the face of it, a strong social movements research agenda would seem natural. However, most of these topics have been successfully colonised by other disciplines. In the independent state, history has emphasised questions of national legitimacy and the view from elites, often at the expense of researching popular organising. Feminist and GLBTQ scholarship has similarly prioritised a celebratory or critical account of the women’s movement in which movement aspects are routinely secondary. Where Irish history is less unique, such as agrarian unrest, labour history and the left, strong tendencies to atheoretical empiricism have restricted wider dialogues. As might be expected in a small post-colonial setting, movement-based theorising and historiography have also made significant contributions, but as with academic work the key concerns have typically been to legitimate movements and explore their relationship to the state, particularly because movement intellectuals have often become (or started as) academics and state functionaries. The result, as in India, is a field dominated by discussions of the choices made by actors (often narrowed to leading figures or political parties) at well-known historical junctures, and their role in inflecting processes of state formation and restructuring. In parallel, Irish movements have also been a privileged ground for literature and debates over national identity. Partly as a result, research on movements has often sought refuge in North American and British canonical orthodoxy and has minimised engagement with these literatures’ movement-relevant aspects. A primary concern has been to convince others of the value of social movement studies for interpreting Ireland, rather than asking how the Irish experience might inform the development of social movement studies. Given the very particular course of Irish history, this is a missed opportunity...|$|R
