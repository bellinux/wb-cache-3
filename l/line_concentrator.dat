40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{personal}} handyphone system (PHS) service {{began in}} Japan in 1995. As this new communication service matched social needs well, {{the number of}} subscribers quickly reached 7 million in just two years. The changes of the social needs for telephone services progressed {{from the age of}} “phones to more homes ” to one of “a phone for each person. ” This means that we have entered the age of personal communication. In addition, a user’s needs for anytime, anywhere voice and data communication have also increased recently. Against the backdrop of this, the recent immense strides in multimedia, mobile switching and radio communication technologies are attracting attention for the implementation of personal land mobile communications. Hitachi Ltd. ’s main components of the PHS network including: the PHS switching system, high-efficiency remote <b>line</b> <b>concentrator,</b> cell station (CS), and CS maintenance system are introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} and the operation of three <b>line</b> <b>concentrators</b> which are essential parts of an experimental digital wideband network with decentralized switching are described. The bit rate of the incoming and outgoing TDM signals of the <b>line</b> <b>concentrators</b> is 278. 528 Mc/s. The clock rates for routing and switching the TDM signals in the <b>line</b> <b>concentrators</b> are approx. 70 Mc/s and 8 Mc/s; these clock rates exceed the corresponding clock rates of digital exchanges hitherto known. The <b>line</b> <b>concentrators</b> are for studying the problems of synchronization, switching and monitoring of digital wideband networks with narrowband and wideband dialogue and distribution services...|$|R

40|$|Centralized {{computer}} networks are hierarchical communication infrastructures {{in which a}} central computer services {{a large number of}} terminals or workstations. For a large network, some concentrators are commonly used to increase the cost efficiency. Several terminals are connected to a concentrator via low capacity <b>lines,</b> and each <b>concentrator</b> is connected to the central computer via a high capacity <b>line.</b> A <b>concentrator</b> is generally subject to technological constraints on the amount of traffic it can manage, and each terminal has its capacity requirement. The problem then is to determine the number and location of concentrators and to allocate the terminals to these concentrators at minimum cost. This is known as the concentrator location problem. If the number and location of concentrators are already known beforehand, the problem then reduces to determining the allocation of terminals only. This is known as the terminal assignment problem. These problems are NP-complete. Therefore, finding a polynomial time algorithm to solve them to optimality is highly unlikely. This study aims to develop some efficient algorithms based on simulated annealing to solve these problems. The results are compared to those given by some existing heuristics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{has found}} that to {{generate}} electricity for a domestic supply, {{the use of a}} two stage <b>line</b> focus <b>concentrator</b> coupled to a Stirling engine by way of a heat pipe is very inefficient, and the end result (useful power) could be better achieved by a line focus system with a Rankine cycle heat engine, or by using photovoltaic cells. For larger systems such as that needed to supply a small community, a point focus solar Stirling engine is the most efficient system at this stage, but with the rapid improvements being made in the performance of photovoltaic cells, {{this may not be the}} case in the future...|$|R
50|$|The {{concentrator}} unit {{consists of}} four main sub-systems, <b>line</b> modules, digital <b>concentrator</b> switch, digital <b>line</b> termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if connection to the DLE is lost.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} an original design of small hybrid solar plant using Organic Rankine Cycles with hermetic scroll expander- generators. The hot supply is provided from vacuumed collector tubes along the focal <b>line</b> of solar <b>concentrators</b> made of mirror bands fixed on a plane surface (CEP). The plant is integrated with a cogeneration Diesel engine unit to ensure power availability independently from the variations of solar radiation. It is primarily intended for isolated sites in developing countries. Measurements on the power unit of 13 kWel show an excellent behavior over {{a broad range of}} parameters with an efficiency of the order of 18 % (50 % exergetic efficiency), which is very promising, particularly when considering that the concept of superposed cycles will allow operations at higher supply temperatures with further technological developments...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber <b>lines.</b> The digital <b>concentrator</b> switch multiplexes the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|R
40|$|Secondary {{concentrators}} {{are used}} in solar concentrating systems to redirect solar beams reflected by the primary concentrators to the focal point or <b>line.</b> Secondary <b>concentrators</b> allow smaller receiver apertures (and hence lower reradiation losses) and increase the concentrated solar flux density. Solar mirrors for secondary concentrators are permanently exposed to environmental conditions, a high radiation flux and elevated temperatures that potentially cause stress and degradations throughout the time. For most solar mirrors, exposures to sunlight during service, particulary ultraviolet wavelenghts, temperature, and moisture can lead to loss in reflectance. Insufficient cooling of mirror surfaces may lead to destruction of the mirror e. g. by melting. Therefore, analyzing solar reflectors of secondary concetrators by simulating the previouse conditions is crucial. The present work is focused on studying the degradation of the mirrors by simulating accelerated exposure, caused by several ambient paramenters {{and the effect of}} concetrated radiation. It has been done under the framwork of the SFERA project. The tests were performed at two installations. The salt spray tests and weathering tests (constant and cycle temperature, damp heat and humidity) were completed at the Solar Reflectors Durability Laboratory of PSA (Plataforma Solar de Almeria, Spain). The high flux exposure tests of mirrors with their cooling system were performed at the Solar Technology Laboratory (STL) of PSI (Paul Scherrer Institute, Switherland). A total of 9 selected mirror types were exposed to different levels of concentrated radiation and accelerated weathering parameters to simulate and analyze the effects caused by the ambient conditions. According to results obtained, aluminium reflectors and thin-glass silvered reflectors glued to an aluminium structure have demonstrated to be appropriate for cooled 3 D secondary concentrators (tower systems). In addition, laminated silvered-glass mirrors have shown to be suitable for non-cooled 2 D secondary concentrators (Fresnel and parabolic-trough collectors) ...|$|R
