During tissue morphogenesis, cells are equipped with networks of actomyosin that generate forces. Here we present a technique based on near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond (fs) pulsed <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> that allows subcellular ablation of actomyosin networks. This technique allows to selectively ablate actomyosin networks while preserving cell plasma membrane. The resulting relaxation of the remaining network after <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> is imaged and analyzed to deduce local forces responsible for tissue morphogenesis in the developing Drosophila embryo...|$|E

The aims of this study were: (i) to isolate goat ES cell lines from both in vivo and in vitro derived blastocysts and (ii) to characterize the growth characteristics and expression of markers indicative of pluripotency in goat ES cells. The goat inner cell mass (ICM) of in vitro and in vivo derived whole blastocysts was isolated by manually cutting or <b>laser</b> <b>dissection,</b> with in vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF's) as a feeder layer to obtain the ES cells. The in vivo derived blastocysts recorded a significant difference in producing goat ES cell lines at Passage 3, compared with in vitro derived blastocysts (91. 7 % vs. 20. 8 % respectively). The manually cut ICM (inner cell mass) isolation technique consistently recorded the highest success rate in goat ES cells for Passages 1 and 3, compared with the whole blastocyst culture (control) and those from the <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> technique (71. 3 % vs. 39. 6 % and 43. 9 %; 35. 0 % vs. 12. 5 % and 23. 3 % respectively). Alkaline phosphatase (AP), Oct- 4 and SSEA- 3 staining gave positive results in identifying the goat ES cells. In conclusion, goat ES cells could be produced by isolation of the ICM by using both manual and <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> of blastocysts, as characterized by AP, Oct- 4 and SSEA- 3 staining.

30|$|Yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) <b>laser</b> fibre <b>dissection</b> is {{of great}} value for the adhesiolysis (Fig.  3): {{the tip of the}} fibre is visualised and guided to dissect the adhesions. However, in a {{completely}} obstructed cavity, this energy is very difficult to be used without orientation. The laser takes very little time to dissect lateral wall adhesions. The technique should be applied very delicately as fibres are very fragile and expensive to replace. In experienced hands, laser can be very effective with minimal tissue destruction. However, be aware that heat diffuses into the tissues, causing thermal damage up to 1  cm in depth and bubbles may be present during dissection hindering the view. Good view is essential in operative hysteroscopy. YAG laser use for minimal access surgery however is very expensive and not readily available in all hospitals. Few reports have included YAG laser use for IUA dissection [36].|$|R

Two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify the proteome expression profile. The differential proteins were further analyzed using bioinformatics tools and compared with the published literature. Results We identified 868 / 872 commonly expressed proteins and 978 differential proteins from 4 paired cancer and normal stromal samples using <b>laser</b> capture micro <b>dissection</b> coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. 487 / 491 proteins uniquely expressed in cancer/normal stroma. Differential proteins were compared with the entire list of the international protein index (IPI), and there were 42 / 42 gene ontology (GO) terms exhibited as enriched and 8 / 5 exhibited as depleted in cellular Component, respectively. Significantly altered pathways between cancer/normal stroma mainly include metabolic pathways, ribosome, focal adhesion, etc. Finally, descriptive statistics show that the stromal proteins with extremes of P I and MW have the same probability to be a biomarker. Conclusions Based on our results, stromal cells are essential component of the cancer, biomarker discovery and network based multi target therapy should consider neoplastic cells itself and corresponding stroma as whole one. </p...|$|R

40|$|Laser microdissection is an {{invaluable}} tool in medical research that facilitates collecting specific cell populations for molecular analysis. Diversity of research targets (e. g., cancerous and precancerous lesions in clinical and animal research, cell pellets, rodent embryos, etc.) and varied scientific objectives, however, present challenges toward establishing standard laser microdissection protocols. Sample preparation {{is crucial for}} quality RNA, DNA and protein retrieval, where it often determines the feasibility of a laser microdissection project. The majority of microdissection studies in clinical and animal model research are conducted on frozen tissues containing native nucleic acids, unmodified by fixation. However, the variable morphological quality of frozen sections from tissues containing fat, collagen or delicate cell structures can limit or prevent successful harvest of the desired cell population via <b>laser</b> <b>dissection.</b> The CryoJane Tape-Transfer System®, a commercial device that improves cryosectioning outcomes on glass slides has been reported superior for slide preparation and isolation of high quality osteocyte RNA (frozen bone) during <b>laser</b> <b>dissection.</b> Considering the reported advantages of CryoJane for <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> on glass slides, we asked whether the system could also work with the plastic membrane slides used by UV laser based microdissection instruments, as these are better suited for collection of larger target areas. In an attempt to optimize laser microdissection slide preparation for tissues of different RNA stability and cryosectioning difficulty, we evaluated the CryoJane system for use with both glass (laser capture microdissection) and membrane (laser cutting microdissection) slides. We have established a sample preparation protocol for glass and membrane slides including manual coating of membrane slides with CryoJane solutions, cryosectioning, slide staining and dissection procedure, lysis and RNA extraction that facilitated efficient dissection and high quality RNA retrieval from CryoJane preparations.

40|$|AbstractIn {{eukaryotic}} cells, proper {{position of}} the mitotic spindle is necessary for successful cell division and development. We explored the nature of forces governing the positioning and elongation of the mitotic spindle in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We hypothesized that astral microtubules exert mechanical force on the S. pombe spindle and thus help align the spindle with the major axis of the cell [1, 2]. Microtubules were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [3] and visualized by two-photon microscopy. Forces were inferred both from time-lapse imaging of mitotic cells and, more directly, from mechanical perturbations induced by <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> [4, 5] of the spindle and astral microtubules. We found that astral microtubules push on the spindle poles in S. pombe, {{in contrast to the}} pulling forces observed {{in a number of other}} cell types [4, 6 – 9]. Further, <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> of the spindle midzone induced spindle collapse inward. This offers direct evidence in support of the hypothesis that spindle elongation is driven by the sliding apart of antiparallel microtubules in the spindle midzone [10, 11]. Broken spindles recovered and mitosis completed as usual. We propose a model of spindle centering and elongation by microtubule-based pushing forces...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{analyze the}} feasibility, {{advantages}} and {{results of the}} use of a thulium laser in nephron sparing surgery for renal cell carcinoma. Materials and Methods: In this single center prospective study 10 consecutive high risk patients underwent open or laparoscopic thulium laser assisted enucleation for small peripheral renal cell carcinoma at our department. We used a 2. 0 mu m continuous or pulsed thulium laser. This diode pumped solid state laser emits a wavelength of 2, 013 nm in the infrared spectrum and penetrates tissue to a depth of 0. 5 mm. Results: The entire tumor enucleation was performed using the frontal thulium laser fiber. In all cases the thulium laser produced a smooth incision of the renal parenchyma and a safe delineation of the plane between the tumor and the surrounding tissue. In addition, in the off clamp procedures bleeding was limited during the dissection and did not interfere with the definition of the surgical plane. Median surgical time {{from the beginning of the}} <b>laser</b> assisted tumor <b>dissection</b> to the end, after verification of bleeding control on the cut surface, was 15 minutes (range 12 to 20). No significant (less than 40 cc) blood loss occurred during the <b>laser</b> assisted tumor <b>dissection.</b> All cases were clear cell renal cell carcinoma and no positive surgical margins were found. In all cases postoperative management was uncomplicated without evidence of hemorrhage.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of tissue-specific genetic alterations {{depends on the}} selective procurement of homogeneous cell populations. Microbeam microdissection of membrane-mounted native tissue (MOMeNT) permits the rapid, selective, and low-contamination procurement of tumor or other cells from histological sections by non-thermic non-contact laser microdissection. Tissue sections are mounted on a specifically designed ultrathin transparent supporter membrane. Tissue together with the membrane are then dissected with an ultraviolet (337 -nm) pulsed laser microbeam coupled into a robot-stage microscope. The ultraviolet <b>laser</b> causes <b>dissection</b> by cold photolysis due to the high photon density of the microbeam rather than by local heating. The track of the laser microbeam can be preselected freely on a video screen, and the size and form of the dissectates can thus be adapted to the histological features of the section with a delineation accuracy in the micron range. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA from the dissectates is not impaired, and tumor-specific loss of heterozygosity of the APC gene as well as homozygous deletion of the MTS 1 gene are demonstrated in bladder carcinomas. Taken together, microbeam MOMeNT is a novel technique that utilizes membrane-based microdissection by an ultraviolet laser microbeam, thus providing a flexible, easy-to-use high-performance tool for the molecular pathologist...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of DNA from archival {{formalin}} and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue {{for genetic}} and epigenetic analyses may be problematic, since the DNA is often degraded and only limited amounts may be available.

Improvement in TIMI flow from grade 0 - 1 to grade 2 - 3 was observed in 10 of these 12 patients after laser application. The overall results of 18 patients were: increase in TIMI grade flow from 0. 33 +/- 0. 49 after wire passage to 1. 28 +/- 1. 23 (P = 0. 0051) after attempted laser application, and to 2. 67 +/- 0. 97 after PTCA (P = 0. 0004).

40|$|The {{goal of a}} {{collaborative}} effort between the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH (FZJ) is to produce monodisperse microparticles for nuclear safeguards applications in order to strengthen the IAEA's analytical capabilities to detect illicit nuclear activities. These particles are intended to serve for quality control purposes and eventually as certified reference materials for mass spectrometry. Therefore, the principal requirement is the consistency concerning the number of uranium atoms per particle, but also a homogenous size distribution, a consistent isotopic composition and uniform particle morphology. This work focuses on {{different aspects of the}} particle production process, including (1) development and implementation of the particle generation process and (2) particle collection techniques as well as (3) substrate and sample preparation techniques for further analysis and (4) particle size distribution using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and large geometry secondary ionization mass spectrometry (LG-SIMS) for determination of the isotopic ratios. A working microparticle setup was developed and implemented at FZJ. The entire setup is designed as a closed system to mitigate the risk of contaminations. Monodisperse uranium oxide particles are generated by spray pyrolysis and particles are collected by inertial impaction on vitreous carbon substrates. Furthermore, substrates can be prepared in advance with reference marks to facilitate particle identification and relocation of single particles with high precision in different analytical instruments. Customizable reference marks were engraved using a <b>laser</b> micro <b>dissection</b> instrument (LMD). Collection efficiency assessment of two different inertial impactor designs, a one-stage inertial impactor and a modified cyclone impactor, are in agreement with the theoretical predictions. A consistent particle size distribution, a homogeneous morphology and the presence of uranium was confirmed using SEM-EDX. LG-SIMS analysis performed on single uranium microparticles confirmed consistency of the uranium isotopic ratios in comparison to the initial precursor solutions. JRC. G.

40|$|Cell {{signaling}} involves complex transduction {{mechanisms in}} which information released by nearby cells or extracellular cues are {{transmitted to the}} cell, regulating fundamental cellular activities. Understanding such mechanisms requires cell stimulation with precise control of low numbers of active molecules at high spatial and temporal resolution under physiological conditions. Optical manipulation techniques, such as optical tweezing, mechanical stress probing or nano-ablation, allow handling of probes and sub-cellular elements with nanometric and millisecond resolution. PicoNewton forces, such as those involved in cell motility or intracellular activity, can be measured with femtoNewton sensitivity while controlling the biochemical environment. Recent technical achievements in optical manipulation have new potentials, such as exploring the actions of individual molecules within living cells. Here, we review the progress in optical manipulation techniques for single-cell experiments, {{with a focus on}} force probing, cell mechanical stimulation and the local delivery of active molecules using optically manipulated micro-vectors and <b>laser</b> <b>dissection...</b>|$|E
40|$|SummaryBiological tissues must {{generate}} {{forces to}} shape organs and achieve proper development. Such forces often {{result from the}} contraction of an apical acto-myosin meshwork. Here we describe an alternative mechanism for tissue contraction, based on individual cell volume change. We show that during Drosophila dorsal closure (DC), a wound healing-related process, the contraction of the amnioserosa (AS) {{is associated with a}} major reduction of the volume of its cells, triggered by caspase activation {{at the onset of the}} apoptotic program of AS cells. Cell volume decrease results in a contractile force that promotes tissue shrinkage. Estimating mechanical tensions with <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> and using 3 D biophysical modeling, we show that the cell volume decrease acts together with the contraction of the actin cable surrounding the tissue to govern DC kinetics. Our study identifies a mechanism by which tissues generate forces and movements by modulating individual cell volume during development...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Cerebral atrophy is a {{correlate}} {{of clinical}} progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). Mitochondria are now established {{to play a}} part in the pathogenesis of MS. Uniquely, mitochondria harbor their own mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), essential for maintaining a healthy central nervous system. We explored mitochondrial respiratory chain activity and mtDNA deletions in single neurons from secondary progressive MS (SPMS) cases. Methods: Ninety-eight snap-frozen brain blocks from 13 SPMS cases together with complex IV/complex II histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, <b>laser</b> <b>dissection</b> microscopy, long-range and real-time PCR and sequencing were used to identify and analyze respiratory-deficient neurons devoid of complex IV and with complex II activity. Results: The density of respiratory-deficient neurons in SPMS was strikingly in excess of aged controls. The majority of respiratory-deficient neurons were located in layer VI and immediate subcortical white matter (WM) irrespective of lesions. Multiple deletions of mtDNA were apparent throughout the gray matter (GM) in MS. The respiratory-deficient neurons harbored high levels of clonally expanded mtDNA deletions at a single-cell level. Furthermore, there were neurons lacking mtDNA-encoded catalytic subunits of complex IV. mtDNA deletions sufficiently explained the biochemical defect in the majority of respiratory-deficient neurons. Interpretation: These findings provide evidence that neurons in MS are respiratory-deficient due to mtDN...|$|E
30|$|Mechanical lead {{extraction}} {{systems are}} very useful tools developed for lead extraction procedures. They consist of specially designed locking stylets which fix {{the lead and}} a hand-powered flexible dilator plastic sheath. The sheath has threaded metal distal tip which cuts fibrous adhesions when rotated by a handle. Unlike powered sheaths like <b>laser</b> or electrosurgical <b>dissection</b> sheaths, no energy form is used for extraction. The distal steel blade of the sheath can be more effective on calcified areas on which powered sheaths are less effective (Smith and Love 2008). After the lead is fixed by locking stylet; the sheath is advanced over the lead-stylet complex to cut fibrotic adhesions and liberate the lead from vascular system. Evolution® mechanical dilator sheath which we use in our clinic for extraction procedures also has a telescopic outer polymer sheath which protects venous wall from the metal cutting tip. Leads are extracted by gentle traction, countertraction and by cutting through adhesions with this system. Mechanical extraction systems are less costly than laser systems and successful results are being reported with these systems recently (Starck et al. 2013; Mazzone et al. 2013).|$|R

It is during embryogenesis that the body plan of the developing plant is established. Analysis of transcriptional changesembryo. This thesis demonstrates the application of <b>laser</b> capture micro <b>dissection</b> {{to the analysis of}} embryogenesis in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. This technique has been used in combination with DNA microarray technology to allow a global analysis of gene expression in the cotyledon, root and shoot apical meristem regions of the torpedo-stage embryo. Validation of the approach has been achieved by comparison of the ATH 1 GeneChip® data obtained, with published gene expression patterns confirmed by in situ hybridisation and promoter: GUS analysis. Further validation was successfully undertaken through the creation of promoter: Gus constructs for a number of previously uncharacterised putative transcription factor genes, {{selected on the basis of}} differential expression between the cotyledon and root regions. Initial attempts to assign putative function to these genes through an analysis of T-DNA insertion lines yielded no aberrant phenotypes. Transcriptional profiling of embryogenesis from the globular-stage through to the torpedo-stage was carried out using GeneSpring, uncovering distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns, and revealing a number of genes of potential interest for further research...|$|R
40|$|A {{very diverse}} group of fungi capable of forming {{endophytic}} associations may have profound consequences for natural ecosystems {{as well as for}} cultivated plants. Fungal endophytes may benefit their host plants by producing secondary metabolites, and may be an important source for bioactive antimicrobial compounds, used in agriculture, commercial industry, and in medicine. Earlier studies on endophytes using traditional isolation methods were subject to many technical limitations. Molecular approaches available today can overcome some of these technical limitations and provide a more accurate picture of endophytic associations in natural habitats. In this study, 48 grass individuals were examined for the presence of fungal endophytes. Microscope was used to visualize hyphae morphology and estimate the hyphal load, whereas <b>Laser</b> Micro <b>dissection</b> and Pressure Catapulting (LMPC) technique was used as the first stage for their species determination. With LMPC, hyphae are catapulted and collected directly from the host tissues into the caps of microfuge tubes after which they are identified using molecular techniques. The grasses belong to the species of Calamagrostis phragmitoides, Anthoxanthum nipponicum, and Festuca sp. and were collected in meadows along river valleys in eastern Finnmark, northern Norway, during July and August 2008. All grass individuals were found to have several morphologies of hyphae present. From a total of 384 hyphal samples that were catapulted from the three grass species, 36 DNA sequences were successfully isolated by molecular techniques. The success of retrieving hyphal DNA sequences was similar in all three grass species. The DNA sequences retrieved were shown to belong to six classes of fungal endophytes, namely Eurotiomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Pezizomycetes, and Exobasidiomycetes. Hyphal load or hyphal morphology was not found to be important for the success of catapulting and PCR amplification. In addition, hyphal morphology was not predictive of endophyte classification, as morphology type was associated with several classes and genera of fungal endophytes. The conclusion from this study is that although the LMPC technique enables isolation of fungal endophytes directly from grass, other processes, such as the extraction of DNA and the PCR technique, still have limitations for successful endophyte isolation...|$|R
