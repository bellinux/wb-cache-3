In 1851, Blix traveled to Hanover, Germany to study at the faculty of Architecture and <b>Landscape</b> <b>Sciences</b> at the University of Hanover. He was not the only Norwegian student at the school; there were at least 53 other Norwegians there, amongst them Paul Due, Halvor Heyerdahl and Henrik Thrap-Meyer. The professor Conrad Wilhelm Hase at the university had a few years earlier installed several reforms that Blix and his students took advantage of. Blix became very influenced by Hase's Neo-Gothic architectural style, which style he later would use on railway stations and churches in Norway. Upon finishing his study in Hanover, Blix studied from 1854 to 1855 at the University of Karlsruhe.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{future of}} {{humanity}} {{depends on whether}} or not we have a vision to guide our transition toward sustainability, on scales ranging from local landscapes to the planet as a whole. Sustainability science {{is at the core of}} this vision, and landscapes and regions represent a pivotal scale domain. The main objectives of this paper are: (1) to elucidate key definitions and concepts of sustainability, including the Brundtland definition, the triple bottom line, weak and strong sustainability, resilience, human well-being, and ecosystem services; (2) to examine key definitions and concepts of landscape sustainability, including those derived from general concepts and those developed for specific landscapes; and (3) to propose a framework for developing a <b>science</b> of <b>landscape</b> sustainability. Landscape sustainability is defined as the capacity of a landscape to consistently provide long-term, landscape-specific ecosystem ser-vices essential for maintaining and improving human well-being. Fundamentally, well-being is a journey, not a destination. <b>Landscape</b> sustainability <b>science</b> is a place-based, use-inspired science of understanding and improving the dynamic relationship between ecosystem services and human well-being in changing landscapes under uncertainties arising from internal feedbacks and external disturbances. While <b>landscape</b> sustainability <b>science</b> emphasizes place-based research on landscape and regional scales, significant between landscape interactions and hierarchical linkages to both finer and broader scales (or externalities) must not be ignored. To advance <b>landscape</b> sustainability <b>science,</b> spatially explicit methods are essential, especially experimental approaches that take advantage of designed landscapes and multi-scaled simulation models that couple the dynamics of landscape services (ecosystem services provided by multiple landscape elements in combina-tion as emergent properties) and human well-being...|$|R

In this regard from 54 Universities of Republic of Belarus, disciplines of landscape and environmental profile has been taught only in 6 ones. The survey {{have been made}} for 6 Universities and includes analysis {{of the list of}} landscape and ecological disciplines, history of their formation, total volume of classroom hours, and also hours allocated for self-study work.

The certain problems in the field of <b>landscape</b> <b>science</b> and geoecology education were identified as lack of academic disciplines, innovative specializations and specialities on landscape ecology.

The aim is to substantiate the methodical approaches to determine the resource potential of bed natural complexes in the sea shallows taking ecological reguirements and nature-protection measures into consideration. The methods for classification of the bed natural complexes of sea shallows have been developed on base of the quantitative methods. The methods evaluating the resource potential of sea shallows have been developed on base of the landscape map-making.

40|$|Current {{trends in}} the {{condition}} of Australia's natural resources show that while some improvements are occurring, many areas are declining due to increasing pressures of agricultural intensification, urbanisation, invasive species and climate change. Arresting and reversing this persistent trend will need new approaches and tools to assist planning, implementation and monitoring of conservation and restoration programs. Critical {{to the success of}} these approaches is the need for integration as a deliberate process of considering and modelling the resources, people and institutions in a region in a holistic and systematic way. The modelling tools need to represent the processes and interactions between the biophysical, ecological, social, economic and institutional components making up the landscape. The intent of the modelling is to identify the causes, effects and consequences of existing and potential changes in regional landscapes. Simply relying on improved component information and understanding will not address the most challenging management issue – how do we manage the whole with a reasonable appreciation of the consequences of individual actions? This cannot be done without invoking integrated <b>landscape</b> <b>science.</b> But this new and challenging form of systems science is currently under-developed, highlighting the need for a significant integrated <b>landscape</b> <b>science</b> capability in Australia.

40|$|To a large extent, {{we live in}} “yesterdays ’ cities ” in {{the sense}} that many of the urban {{patterns}} that we see today—roads, buildings, land ownership etc—refl ect the social, economic and technological decision making of the past. Understanding the role of time and the way that it conditions future urban options, we argue, is fundamental to the urban design professionals responsible for transitioning “cities of today ” into the more sustainable “cities of tomorrow”. We take a view of cities as landscapes undergoing a continuous process of change known as urbanisation—a complex dynamic that is diffi cult to address through land use policies such as zoning. Decisions constrained by time (the development contract period), and space (the development site), tend to result in a continual shift in the responsibility of decision makers to determine the best outcomes for urban residents. To complicate matters further, it would appear that landscape planning practices and land use policy have not kept up with the “pace of time ” and the evolution of <b>landscape</b> <b>science</b> and the constantly changing urban condition. In this paper, the product of an emerging collaboration between a landscape architect and a landscape ecologist, we re-examine the nexus between <b>landscape</b> <b>science</b> and design {{as it relates to the}} sustainability and resilience of cities. To diffuse many of the common problems with conventional expressions of environmentalism, which invariably lead to meaningless debates about sustainable development, we use Canberra as a case study to argue the role for science in providing an objective and rigorous platform for formulating future urban options...|$|E

Multifunctional management is therefore a prerequisite for the sustainable use of landscapes, and the only general strategy that may address the problems created by constantly growing demands on resources arising from production, residence, dumping of waste, habitat, ecosystem services, and recreation.

Temporary changes produced by autoregulative (cyclic) processes are without any invariant changes, while the evolutionary processes change the invariant.
