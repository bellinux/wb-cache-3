25|$|The album, {{particularly}} {{the length of}} the songs and orchestral arrangements, was partially inspired by the 1971 Roy Harper album Stormcock. In September 2007, Harper supported Joanna Newsom at her Royal Albert Hall performance, playing Stormcock in its entirety. Newsom was also impressed by Van Dyke Parks' 1968 album Song Cycle, and asked him to collaborate on Ys after <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> record.|$|E

California's Rancid, in particular, are known as [...] "incurable Clash zealots".

Malice, a member of the hip hop duo, claimed: [...] "Illmatic captured the whole New York state of mind for me. It embraced everything I knew New York to be. The album had 10 songs, all of them flawless. Me and my homies got great memories of rolling around <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> huslin', smokin', chillin'. That embodied everything that was right with hip-hop. That CD never came out my deck." [...] Speaking in 2012, British producer, DJ Semtex described Illmatic as [...] "an exemplary album of perfection that forced the evolution of lyricism and production values within hip hop. Eighteen years later it remains omnipotent." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, as he puts it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an unemployed person, living alone in a flat in Ballymun, <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E
2500|$|In another {{interview}} Grohl stated, [...] "I {{wrote that}} song to be a teenage makeout song.

[...] Also in the song, Dave changed the last line which is meant to sing [...] "always coming back I cannot forget you girl" [...] to [...] "always coming back I cannot forget you Gil" [...] in reference to their producer Gil Norton.|$|E

2500|$|After graduating, Thomas {{subsequently}} {{embarked on}} his comedy career, initially supporting himself through working on building sites with his father. Thomas' early exposure to comedy was through watching {{and listening to}} Dave Allen, Steptoe and Son, The Goon Show and Tony Hancock; his biggest influence was hearing a recording of Alexei Sayle: [...] "It was like someone had kicked the door in - just <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> tape and thinking that someone could do this stuff". He went on to write material for Dave Allen.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the age of}} four, he {{made his}} first [...] "painting" [...] on a wall at home: a perfect red circle, which {{anticipated}} his life as under the signs of rhythm and geometric precision. His teen years were dedicated to painting, and he won his first national prize at age 17. It was only natural that he was sent to the bigger city of Porto to enroll in the School of Fine Arts to pursue a degree in painting. However, at the registration desk, he took the advice of the clerk, who told him that his high school diploma allowed him to enroll in Architecture, which was then a more promising career. As he later admitted, he made a mistake by <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man.|$|E
2500|$|The series {{focuses on}} the {{exploits}} and misadventures of short-fused hotelier Basil Fawlty and his acerbic wife Sybil, {{as well as their}} employees: porter and waiter Manuel, maid Polly, and, in the second series, chef Terry. The episodes typically revolve around Basil's efforts to succeed in [...] "raising the tone" [...] of his hotel and his increasing frustration at the numerous complications and mistakes, both his own and those of others, which prevent him from doing so. Much of the humour comes from Basil's overly aggressive manner, engaging in angry but witty arguments with guests, staff and, in particular, Sybil, whom he addresses (in a faux-romantic way) with insults such as [...] "that golfing puff adder", [...] "my little piranha fish" [...] and [...] "my little nest of vipers". Despite this, he frequently feels intimidated, she being able to stop him in his tracks at any time, usually with a short, sharp cry of [...] "Basil!" [...] At the end of some episodes, Basil succeeds in annoying (or at least bemusing) the guests and frequently gets his comeuppance. Basil occasionally longs for a touch of class, sometimes by playing recordings of classical music. In one episode he is playing music by Brahms when Sybil remarks, after pestering him asking to do different tasks: [...] "You could have them both done by now if you hadn't spend the whole morning skulking in there <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> racket." [...] Basil replies, with exasperation, [...] "Racket?? That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!" ...|$|E
