The Willis Tower has an observation deck open to tourists year round with high up views overlooking Chicago and Lake Michigan. The observation deck includes an enclosed glass balcony that extends 10 feet out {{on the side of}} the building. Tourists are able to <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> down.|$|E
500|$|Disston {{was married}} with {{a son and}} two daughters, all of whom survived him. [...] He was a Presbyterian and a Mason. [...] He was {{described}} as a fun-loving socialite as evidenced by a yacht he owned named Mischief. [...] But he was also known as a hard-working executive whose gentle facial features were balanced with intense eyes described by one reporter as: [...] "like that of the great eagle in the cage at the Tampa Bay Hotel, that can <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> at the sun without a tear, or even a blink." ...|$|E
500|$|Chambrin did {{not speak}} English, but summoned his English-speaking brother. Smith {{produced}} his RAF rank insignia as proof of his identity. Smith and Bill {{made their way to}} the border crossing, guided by Chambrin, who told them that his brother would meet them on the other side of the border. The only crossing was a bridge, manned by German sentries. Smith observed the checkpoint for a while, and saw that pedestrians crossing alone or in pairs were rarely challenged, while larger groups often were. He thought it might be possible simply to walk across, and told Bill to [...] "just <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> ahead and walk quietly on". They were not challenged, and met Chambrin's brother a few miles away. The Austrian and Frenchman joined them the next day; the Polish soldier, who had appeared to Smith to be underage, had lost his nerve on seeing the Germans and had gone back.|$|E

500|$|... As {{she tries}} to sleep, Brahms's Lullaby plays softly in the background. She then levitates off her bed using her stomach muscles to move {{the top half of}} her body. Knowles said that the {{levitation}} shot was the hardest one as she had difficulties making her neck <b>look</b> <b>straight.</b> She added that the scene represents the nightmare and the white bird flying above her takes her into her dream, which unfolds after the screech of an electric guitar. Knowles is transported to a desert and several clouds are present in the background. She wears a black Roberto Cavalli dress and boots; as the music begins, her two backup dancers wearing Gareth Pugh pieces appear. The scene changes into a computer-generated sci-fi landscape where Knowles is inscribed with a circle and square in a similar fashion to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man. The first chorus is brought in by a subtle glass-breaking sound effect as the sci-fi special effects disappear and Knowles appears in a silver one-shouldered mini dress on a white background. Accompanied by her backup dancers, she performs sophisticated, street and hip-busting dance moves.|$|E
500|$|Harrison Ford reprises {{the role}} of Dr. Henry [...] "Indiana" [...] Jones, Jr. To prepare for the role, the 64-year-old Ford spent {{three hours a day}} at a gym, practiced with the bullwhip for two weeks, and relied on a high-protein diet of fish and vegetables. Ford had kept fit during the series' hiatus anyway, as he hoped for another film. He {{performed}} many of his own stunts because stunt technology had become safer since 1989, and he also felt it improved his performance. It is also said that he still fit into his pants from Raiders of the Lost Ark. He argued, [...] "The appeal of Indiana Jones isn't his youth but his imagination, his resourcefulness. His physicality {{is a big part of}} it, especially the way he gets out of tight situations. But it's not all hitting people and falling from high places. My ambition in action is to have the audience <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> in the face of character and not at the back of a capable stuntman's head. I hope to continue that no matter how old I get." [...] Ford felt his return would reduce U.S. ageism (he refused to dye his hair for the role), because of the film's family appeal: [...] "This is a movie which is geared not to [...] segment of the demographic, an age-defined segment ... We've got a great shot at breaking the movie demographic constraints." [...] He told Koepp to add more references to his age in the script. Spielberg said Ford was not too old to play Indiana: [...] "When a guy gets to be that age and he still packs the same punch, and he still runs just as fast and climbs just as high, he's gonna be breathing a little heavier at the end of the set piece. And I felt, 'Let's have some fun with that. Let's not hide that. Spielberg recalled the line in Raiders that said, [...] "It's not the years, it's the mileage," [...] and felt he could not tell the difference between Ford during the shoots for Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.|$|E
2500|$|John the Evangelist, {{the author}} of the fourth gospel account, is symbolized by an eagle, often with a halo, an animal may have {{originally}} been seen as the king of the birds. The eagle is a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> into the sun.|$|E

2500|$|The A-22's {{structure}} is almost completely all-metal {{with only the}} engine cowling, wing fillets and wheel spats being made of composites. The wings and control surfaces are fabric covered. The aircraft has excellent visibility, due to {{the large amount of}} glazing, including convex doors, that allow the occupants to <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> down. The A-22 uses a 3-axis control system, giving the pilot full control over the aircraft. The A-22 uses flaperons in place of ailerons and flaps, giving a stall speed of [...] with the flaperons fully down.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} at the bar that Aykroyd {{introduced}} Belushi to the blues. An interest soon became a fascination, {{and it was not}} long before the two began singing with local blues bands. Jokingly, SNL band leader Howard Shore suggested they call themselves [...] "The Blues Brothers." [...] In an April 1988 interview he gave to the Chicago Sun-Times, Aykroyd said the Blues Brothers act borrowed from Sam & Dave and others; the Sun-Times quoted him as explaining: [...] "Well obviously the duo thing and the dancing, but the hats came from John Lee Hooker. The suits came from the concept that when you were a jazz player in the 40's, 50's 60's, to <b>look</b> <b>straight,</b> you had to wear a suit." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the first}} works {{executed}} after his return to Paris was {{a portrait of the}} duc d'Orléans. After the heir to the throne was killed in a carriage accident {{a few months after the}} painting was completed in 1842, Ingres received commissions to make additional copies. He also received a commission to design seventeen stained glass windows for the chapel on the place where the accident occurred, and a commission for eight additional stained-glass designs for Orléans chapel in Dreux. He became a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He took his students frequently to the Louvre to the see the classical and Renaissance art, instructing them to <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> ahead and to avoid the works of Rubens, which he believed deviated too far from the true values of [...] art.|$|E

2500|$|The Parthenon is {{regarded}} as the finest example of Greek architecture. The temple, wrote John Julius Cooper, [...] "enjoys the reputation of being the most perfect Doric temple ever built. Even in antiquity, its architectural refinements were legendary, especially the subtle correspondence between the curvature of the stylobate, the taper of the naos walls and the entasis of the columns." [...] Entasis refers to the slight swelling, of 1/8 inch, in the centre of the columns to counteract the appearance of columns having a waist, as the swelling makes them <b>look</b> <b>straight</b> from a distance. The stylobate is the platform on which the columns stand. As in many other classical Greek temples, it has a slight parabolic upward curvature intended to shed rainwater and reinforce the building against earthquakes. The columns might therefore be supposed to lean outwards, but they actually lean slightly inwards so that if they carried on, they would meet almost exactly a mile above the centre of the Parthenon; since they are all the same height, the curvature of the outer stylobate edge is transmitted to the architrave and roof above: [...] "All follow the rule of being built to delicate curves", Gorham Stevens observed when pointing out that, in addition, the west front was built at a slightly higher level than that of the east front.|$|E
