A navigable sluice {{controlled}} the entrance to the river between 1786 and 1928, when it was replaced by a vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> which was not navigable. The river provided water power to operate the bellows of an iron works at Beckley Furnace, used to make cannons for the Royal Navy between 1578 and 1770, when it became uneconomic, and a water mill which replaced it, until that burnt down in 1909. The lower reaches supported a thriving shipbuilding industry from the early nineteenth century onwards, and although on a smaller scale, was still doing so in 2000.|$|E

50|$|The kauri logging {{industry}} was profitable in early European days {{and up to}} the mid-20th century. Forests were well inland, with no easy way to get the logs to the sea or to sawmills. Kauri logs were dragged to a convenient stream bed with steep sides and a driving dam was constructed of wood, with a <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> near the bottom large enough for the logs to pass through. When the dam had filled, which might take up to a year, the gate was opened and the logs above the dam were pushed out through the hole and swept down to the sea. The logging industry cut down large swaths of old growth, and most of the current growth is younger native forest (around 150,000 kauri seedlings were planted by the New Zealand Forest Service in the 1970s and 1980s) as well as some remaining kauri in the far north of the island. Much of the island is covered with regenerating bush dominated by kanuka and kauri.|$|E
5000|$|By 1571, {{the river}} was an {{important}} route for the carriage of grain to London, and the City of London obtained another act to authorise improvements. This included making new cuts, and creating towpaths {{on both sides of}} the river. Shoals were removed, and a cut, probably the section which is now called Bow River from Old Ford Locks to Bow Locks, was excavated, which was not subject to any tolls. The plan for a branch from the river to the north of London was not implemented. One innovation was the construction of a pound lock at Waltham Abbey, Essex, in 1577. This had mitred gates at each end, and was probably the second lock to be built in England, although it was the first to be built on a river. It inspired Vallens to write a poem entitled [...] "A tale of Two Swannes" [...] about it in 1590. It was 70 by 24 ft, with wooden sides. The remainder of the control of levels was carried out by [...] "staunches" [...] or [...] "turnpikes", consisting of a single vertically <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> in a weir, through which boats were pulled against the current.|$|E
50|$|A {{major project}} of river {{engineering}} {{was carried out}} in 1596, when the course of the Rother was diverted around the northern edge of Rye to join the Tillingham. The scheme was expensive, and untimately was not a success, as the Rother reverted to its previous course to the east on Rye in 1610. Another attempt at engineering the mouths of the three rivers began in 1723, when an Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise {{the construction of a new}} channel from the Brede near Winchelsea to the sea. After great expense and 63 years work, the channel, called the New Harbour, was opened in July 1787, and the old outlet to the sea was closed. A wet autumn caused extensive flooding of the hinterland, and in November 1787, after just four months, the New Harbour was abandoned, and the old channel from Rye to the sea was reopened. A navigable sluice was constructed across the Tillingham in 1786, just above Strand Quay. Its function was to prevent salt water flowing up the river, and to improve the scouring of the channel below it. At the same time, wharfs were constructed at Ferry Bridge, Leasam Farm, Marshall’s Farm and Marley Farm, the final one around 2 mi above the sluice. It is not entirely clear how the lock was used, since maps from 1872 carry a note that the sluice was the highest point to which tides flowed, but maps from 1898 and 1907 state that tides flowed for a further 3 mi beyond the sluice when the lock gates were opened. Navigation on most of the Tillingham ended in 1928, when the sluice was replaced by a vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|E

40|$|Water {{diversion}} {{mechanisms are}} commonly used in the irrigation systems and this concept is older than tank (reservoir) systems in Sri Lanka. At present, for water diversions in the wet zone anicuts are constructed by using lifting type gates. Anicuts are used to maintain required water level in the upstream by releasing only the excess water to downstream. In the <b>lifting</b> <b>gate,</b> water is allowed to flow from the bottom and this causes high erosion in the canal. The thrust force due to water pressure on the <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> {{makes it difficult to}} operate the system and then controlling the system is a complex task. This paper describes the construction and operation of newly introduced flap gates and issues related to <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> which are presently used for diversion process. In this analysis, conceptual design of a flap gate with compressive arc type wall plate is proposed to minimize use of construction materials. In the proposed system, height of the anicut could be changed from the top and then the water level in the upstream is not varied much when compared with lifting gates for varying flows in the cannel. According to the practical experiences from implemented proposed systems, controlling of the system is much easier compared to the conventional system.

40|$|On {{the morning}} of August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. A storm of Katrinas {{strength}} and intensity is expected to cause major flooding but the main portion of the destruction was caused by its exposure to failures at almost all levels of responsibility. In Katrinas wake, a Grand Plan for Louisiana is introduced by the Louisiana State University. In this thesis, {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) is analyzed. It is recommended to implement two flood protection structures in combination with a straight levee alignment between them. This option has the best high water safety and most positive ecological influence. It is concluded that closing the MRGO is the favorable option for the future development. The GIWW is highly navigated and should remain open A vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> is chosen as optimal flood protection structure. Its hoisting system is complex but well known, providing a reliable closure system. It can also safely discharge excess water, which represents a main functional requirement. Quantifying time dependent processes leads to conclude that the optimal combination is a gate height of + 30 ft (10. 6 m, MSL) and leakage width of 0. 05 m at the sides and 0. 15 m at the bottom. This has the benefit that no perfect closure is needed during a storm event, which reduces the need for maintenance and increases the reliability of the closing process. In the design of the steel <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> reference is made to the Hartel Canal Barrier, a proven protection scheme in the Netherlands. The total mass of the gate amounts 1060 tonnes. The main contributors are the bottom and center lens-shaped barrier sections. The front plate forms the largest single contributor at 20 % of the total mass of the gate. The upper lens-shaped barrier section requires only 40 % of the steel volume needed for the leading lens-shaped sections and results in a weight reduction of 126 tonnes. Major problems due to the <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> vibration in vertical direction are not expected as the system is positively damped and the excitation frequency is sufficiently small compared to the first Eigen frequency.

40|$|In December 2002 {{the highly}} {{innovative}} inflatable storm surge barrier near Kampen in the Netherlands was finished. This Ramspol barrier (named after the small villages next to it) has {{to protect the}} area surrounding the "Zwarte Meer" during north-western storms. These storms result in water setup that can cause severe problems for the very low area in the Eastern part of the Netherlands. One of the reasons to build an inflatable barrier instead of a more traditional barrier, amongst others reasons, {{was that it was}} expected to be an economically preferable solution. No real proof for this claim exists until now. This thesis focusses on a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) comparison between inflatable barriers and 'traditional' vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> barriers. This means that all costs that occur during the lifetime of the barriers are taken into account. During this thesis a case study has been performed for the location of the Hartel barrier near Spijkenisse in the Netherlands. An inflatable barrier based on Ramspol has been designed for that location with the same requirements that hold for the original Hartel barrier. Based on this design the construction costs have been determined for such a barrier and these have been compared to the construction costs for the original barrier. Then maintenance strategies based on decompositions for both types of barriers have been determined in order to predict and calculate the expected maintenance costs in a deterministic way. In order to increase the reliability and get an insight in sensitivities a sensitivity analysis has been performed by making use of a Monte Carlo simulation. This provides results with a 5...|$|E
40|$|In 2008 Hurricane Ike flooded {{large parts}} of the barrier islands in front of the Galveston Bay near Houston, Texas. The storm surge also entered the bay through the inlets causing great damage along the bay and the port of Houston. Because of the high {{probability}} that a hurricane would strike again the “Ike Dike” was developed. The concept consists of heightening and extending the floodwall on Galveston Island and Bolivar Peninsula. Barriers will be placed at the San Luis Pass and Bolivar Roads inlet whereas the Rollover Pass might be closed completely. The Bolivar Roads barrier will be a combination between a floodgate and a <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> structure. During non-storm conditions, when the gates are open, the flow area through the inlets are expected to reduce up to 40 - 60 % due to the barriers. The reduction of flow area can cause a decrease of the tidal prism and tidal range. Also current velocities are expected to increase near the barriers and decrease in the main bay. The residence time of fresh water in the bay is expected to increase and the salinity to decrease. The reduction of the tidal prism, tidal range and current speeds can cause a redistribution of the sediment from marshes and flats to the channels within the bay. The blocking of sediment from the Mexican Gulf by the barriers can further enhance this. Changes of the hydrodynamics, water quality and morphology in the bay could potentially result in loss of habitat and disturb the ecology. A 2 D hydrodynamic model has been created in order to investigate the impact of the barriers on the tidal prism, tidal range and circulation in the bay. The morphology and water quality of the bay are investigated qualitatively using literature, reference projects and the outcomes of the 2 D model. It is concluded that a 40 - 60 % decrease of the flow area at the Bolivar Roads entrance affects the hydrodynamics of the Galveston Bay. To mitigate or prevent these effects the design could be altered such that the flow area is reduced by less 20 %, because the impacts of such a barrier are relatively small. Another mitigating solution could be to build compartment dams to preserve the tidal range. Coastal EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Ho Chi Minh City has to {{deal with}} severe {{flooding}} in the rainy season. To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the lock head. Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting gates and rolling or sliding gates. One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular the locking cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created. The inner dimensions of the lock chamber are determined, the structural elements are designed and an structural calculation of the single leave gate is made.

40|$|On 29 October 2012 {{hurricane}} Sandy hit {{the coast}} of New York City. This category 1 hurricane had a devastating effect: {{large parts of the}} city were flooded and the city was out of business for several days. An estimated total damage of $ 41. 9 billion had occurred of which $ 5 billion in account of the metro system. The largest damage was to the subway (underground) on Manhattan. The main challenge of this research was to design a protection for the subway of Manhattan. The main sources of flood water are the rivers that enter the city via overflow of the river bank. Flood water enters the subway system mainly via the ventilation grates and the commuter entrances. There are not many tubes that start in a flood prone area. The tube most vulnerable for flooding is the Steinway tube of the Flushing line, running from Queens under the East River to Grand Central Station on Manhattan. The Steinway tube has 200, 000 daily users and was flooded during Sandy via the ventilation grates on 50 th Avenue. The future flood levels in this report take the 90 th percentile sea level rise (SLR) projection into account as calculated by the NPCC. The safety level is currently 1 / 60 -years, but decreases to 1 / 5 -years is SLR projections in 2080 are reached. Long Island City is modelled as a storage basin where water enters via overflow of the East River Bank. The inflow of the 100 to 10, 000 year floods is modelled as a harmonic tidal wave. The results show that the water level in the basin is equal to the storm surge flood level in most cases. Combined with surface elevation data, the damage to the three subsystems Long Island City, the Steinway tube and the subway system of Manhattan shows that the risk is significant. At the considered flood levels, the Flushing line will flood via the start of the Steinway tube. The Steinway tube inflow model shows whether the flood water reaches Grand Central Station on Manhattan. A 1 / 500 -years flood in 2080 results in a total damage of $ 2, 571 million to all three systems. Compared to protection of only the Steinway tube, the multifunctional bank protection at the East River, called the Greenline, adds the most value to Long Island City. Considering the political and economic feasibility, the Greenline is not designed into detail. The Steinway Flood Gate scores the highest on benefit/costs-ratio, while the protection of Manhattan only is economic not feasible: the net present value is negative for each design level. The Steinway tube is protected by closing the ventilation grates and commuter entrances with covers that are designed by a third party. Directly in front of the Steinway tube, the Steinway Flood Gate is designed. This vertical <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> has a door of 6. 00 meters high and 7. 70 meters wide. Two towers of 12 meters support this flood door. The door is able to move in horizontal direction to enable the sealing of the tube. The Steinway Flood Gate is a perfect long-term flood protection that can be realized in the near future. It is an economically attractive investment that improves the safety of the New York City Subway system. However, in the faraway future the Greenline gives much more value per invested dollar.
