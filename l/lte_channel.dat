CWC's Caymanian business unit (then named LIME Cayman) initally launched their first LTE network on December 10, 2013 and received certification from Apple {{for the use}} of iPhones on the network on May 16, 2014. The network initially launched with 100% coverage across the Cayman Islands on LTE Band 17 (700 MHz). The network was followed by, days after, Digicel launching their own LTE network, on Band 3 (1800 MHz), offering twice the speed offered by LIME's network. In August 2016, FLOW became one of 8 carriers in North America (others being AT&T, T-Mobile USA, Verizon, Sprint, Rogers, Telus and Bell) and the first Caribbean operator to, after additional network upgrades, have rolled out an LTE-A network, followed by Orange in the French West Indies and the Dominican Republic. The LTE-A network adds a 5 MHz <b>LTE</b> <b>channel</b> on Band 2 (1900 MHz), found in the busy areas within the city of George Town, making a device able to access 2 Carrier Aggregation (2CA) able to access speeds of up to 112 Mbit/s (theoretical).|$|E

Reconfigurable platform is preferred in the SDR due to the reuse of hardware. Convolutional code is widely adopted in many wireless protocols but the code parameter differs. In order to support multi-standard service, a decoder compatible for different protocols is needed. In this paper, we designed a flexible Viterbi decoder which is compatible with WiMAX, UMB and <b>LTE’s</b> <b>channel</b> coding scheme. High efficient cascaded Addcompare-select unit architecture and sliding window method for trace back are presented. Meanwhile, conflict free memory access model is also given.

40|$|Reliable network {{measurements}} are a fundamental component of networking research as they enable network analysis, system debugging, performance evaluation and optimization. In particular, decoding the <b>LTE</b> control <b>channel</b> would give {{access to the}} full base station traffic at a 1 ms granularity, thus allowing for traffic profiling and accurate measurements. Although a few open-source implementations of LTE are available, they do not provide tools to reliably decoding the <b>LTE</b> control <b>channel</b> and, thus, accessing the scheduling information. In this paper, we present OWL, an Online Watcher for LTE that is able to decode all the resource blocks in more than 99 % of the system frames, significantly outperforming existing non-commercial prior decoders. Compared to previous attempts, OWL grounds the decoding procedure on information obtained from the LTE random access mechanism.

30|$|Since the {{complexity}} of the sensing algorithm is one of our main concerns, a new algorithm is now proposed to further reduce the FWT complexity. This is a generic algorithm that could be applied in case the sensing resolution is the whole <b>LTE</b> <b>channel</b> or multiples of an RB as described in the previous section.|$|E
30|$|In {{the fine}} sensing stage, two {{algorithms}} are proposed; {{one of them}} uses the cyclic shift property of the LTE OFDM signal while the other uses one of the LTE synchronization signals, namely, the primary synchronization signal. Fine sensing based on the primary synchronization signal is chosen because it has less complexity {{as compared to the}} use of other LTE synchronization signals such as the secondary synchronization signal or the LTE reference signals (pilots), as will be shown later in the sequel. Also, it is shown to perform very well under different wireless <b>LTE</b> <b>channel</b> models. Some optimizations are also done to the cyclic prefix algorithm to enhance its performance and reduce the complexity. Finally, end-to-end results are presented showing the performance of both the coarse and fine sensing results collectively for different coarse and fine sensing algorithm pairs under various <b>LTE</b> <b>channel</b> conditions.|$|E
30|$|The coarse sensing {{algorithm}} first {{scans the}} whole spectrum {{to search for}} the unoccupied LTE channels with the resolution of a complete <b>LTE</b> <b>channel.</b> If none exists, the FWT engine would go further in the LTE spectrum to search with the resolution of a resource block (RB) with a very slight additional complexity; this constitutes another benefit of using FWT over FFT. All this information is then transmitted to the MAC layer that performs the scheduling among the cognitive users.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of fast-fading <b>LTE</b> downlink <b>channels</b> in high-speed applications of LTE advanced is investigated in this article. In order to adequately track the fast time-varying channel response, an adaptive channel estimation and interpolation algorithm is essential. In this article, the multi-path fast-fading channel is modelled as a tapped-delay, discrete, finite impulse response filter, and the time-correlation {{of the channel}} taps is modelled as an autoregressive (AR) process. Using this AR time-correlation, we develop an extended Kalman filter to jointly estimate the complex-valued channel frequency response and the AR parameters from the transmission of known pilot symbols. Furthermore, the channel estimates at the known pilot symbols are interpolated to the unknown data symbols by using the estimated time-correlation. This article integrates both channel estimation at pilot symbols and interpolation at data symbol into the proposed Kalman interpolation filter. The bit error rate performance of our new channel estimation scheme is demonstrated via simulation examples for <b>LTE</b> and fast-fading <b>channels</b> in high-speed applications...|$|R
30|$|When {{the channel}} is time-variant and {{correlated}} across time slots, {{it is possible}} to exploit the information about the channel across time slots by an appropriate filtering and benefit from contamination randomization. In this paper, channel estimation across multiple time slots is performed using {{a modified version of the}} Kalman filter, which is capable of tracking the channel and the channel correlation. The level of contamination suppression depends on the channel correlation between slots of the UE of interest as well as the contaminators. In <b>LTE,</b> <b>channel</b> correlation between time slots is large even at medium-high speeds, making the proposed solution very efficient.|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} the {{small-scale}} fading mechanisms, the specifications shown in such a table (i.e., Power Delay Profile) refer to the time spreading of the signal. So, according to Section[*] 2.1. 2.1, and by assuming a correlation function above 0.5, the coherence bandwidth of the channel is approximately 199.5527 kHz, then the channel can theoretically be classified as frequency-selective given that the minimum <b>LTE</b> <b>channel</b> bandwidth is equal to 1.4 MHz, which clearly exceeds f 0. This {{is the reason why}} a variable length cyclic prefix (i.e., normal or extended) matching the time-slot (0.5 ms) is included in LTE [19].|$|E

For a five small cell network, this number grows to 34, 340. If the measurement time per configuration is only 1 h, then the time necessary to gather measurements for a four small cell network is 193 days and for a five small cell network is close to 4 years. In order to overcome this constraint, we aim at designing a solution that is capable of performing nearly optimal while leveraging {{only a limited number of}} KPI measurements.|$|E

The constant K accounts for propagation losses, such as absorption and penetration losses. We have assumed in our simulations that α = 3.68 and set 10 log(K) to be − 40 dB, corresponding to a version of the urban Costa Hata model used in LTE network studies [5, 21, 22]. For comparison purposes, we do not account for random fading components (which consists of mostly shadow fading variations for <b>LTE</b> downlink <b>channels).</b>|$|R
30|$|In our {{previous}} work in IEEE 802.16, the channel capacity {{was assumed to}} be static, and the threshold of data accumulation (DATA_TH) was practically set as the size of a time frame (i.e., the number of bits that can be carried in a time frame). In <b>LTE,</b> the <b>channel</b> capacity varies due to the adaptively selected Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) for each UE. LTE eNB typically selects MCS for a UE depending on a prediction of the DL channel condition, which is according to the channel quality indicator (CQI) feedback transmitted by that UE. 3 GPP gives a table of reference for efficiency of each CQI index as shown in Table  1. The estimation of the <b>channel</b> capacity of <b>LTE</b> is therefore based on the CQI report from the UE and the corresponding efficiency value in Table  1. Moreover, since <b>LTE</b> physical control <b>channels</b> (such as PDCCH, PCFICH, and PHICH) also make use of the REs in the TTI, estimation of the capacity for the user data should exclude the REs reserved for the control channels.|$|R

In this case, the LTE system still works correctly, but only 16 QAM and QPSK (indoor/outdoor) modulations can be used. Furthermore, mobile TV reception is also more affected by LTE services because LTE interference power is concentrated into a narrower channel. In real RANs, where power limits are more likely set to 1 Hz of occupied bandwidth, {{the impact on the}} reception of mobile TV services would be the same. The influence of channels overlapping and the effect of different EIRP unbalances could be investigated from the remaining charts.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new Hardware (HW) im- plementation proposal for Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) based channel estimators.

30|$|Inter-class {{fairness}} issues: in {{the literature}} [13], composite scheduling rules serve the best-effort traffic by using the classical proportional fair rule, i.e., ratio of instantaneous channel quality to the time-averaged throughput [9, 17 – 19]. They prioritize delay-sensitive traffic by considering either the logarithmic, exponential, or linear function of the HoL delay. However, such composite scheduling strategies result in a higher priority difference between the delay-sensitive and best-effort traffic classes. In other words, the higher the difference among the scheduling priorities of traffic classes, the lower will be the multi-user channel diversity exploitation. In <b>LTE,</b> multi-user <b>channel</b> diversity has more significance since it is a multi-carrier system which allows multi-user diversity exploitation in the time and frequency domain.|$|R
