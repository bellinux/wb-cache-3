5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as depression, is a mental disorder characterized by at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years {{in which they are}} normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|Planning for the {{operation}} began in 1943. In {{the months leading up}} to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal, but postponing would have meant a delay of at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days in each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.|$|E
5|$|Further funds {{came from}} the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The French Polynesian {{assembly}} in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed {{to travel to the}} region for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their homes by the Church World Service later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.|$|E

5|$|Commercially, {{it was not}} as {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales in her career at the time and was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 2016, with {{forwards}} Paul George, C. J. Miles and Kevin Seraphin sidelined, Robinson {{started and}} posted a double double with 16 points and 11 rebounds in an overtime win against the Oklahoma City Thunder. He got his second {{start of the}} season on November 25 and finished with a team high and career-high 20 points and five rebounds against the Brooklyn Nets. Those two starts were regarded as the best two performances of his career up to that date. Robinson returned to the starting lineup when Monta Ellis was injured in mid-December. He posted a season-high rebounding performance in a 12-point, 12-rebound double double against the Detroit Pistons in his fourth start in his return to the starting lineup. During the 2017 All-Star Weekend, Robinson became the first Pacers player since Fred Jones (in 2004) to win the Slam Dunk Contest. On March 24 with less than 3 weeks left in the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> with a calf strain. After missing the final 11 games of the regular season, Robinson was sidelined for {{the first game of the}} 2017 NBA Playoffs on April 15 against Cleveland, but he returned to the lineup for game 2 on April 17.|$|E
5|$|The {{departure}} of this combined squadron was observed by Captain Keats on Superb, which {{after returning to}} Cadiz had retained station off the port with HMS Thames and HMS Pasley. Thames was inshore searching a seized American merchant ship, and witnessed {{the emergence of the}} squadron, retreating before four ships of the line that approached the British frigate. Superb was sighted shortly afterwards and also retreated before a ship of the line and two frigates, reconstituting his small squadron in the wake of Moreno's force. Keats immediately sent Pasley ahead to Gibraltar to warn Saumarez, the brig arriving at 15:00 closely followed by {{the main body of the}} combined squadron, from which Saint Antoine had detached during the departure from Cadiz and was following behind, shadowed by Superb. Moreno's squadron anchored in the Bay of Gibraltar, out of reach of the British batteries on Gibraltar and waited there for Linois to complete his repairs, Saint Antoine joining the squadron on the morning of 10 July. Keats then brought his ships into Gibraltar, where efforts to repair the squadron were increased, with the knowledge that Moreno would soon be sailing to Cadiz with Linois squadron. Saumarez, concerned by the size of the combined squadron, sent urgent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith in the Eastern Mediterranean requesting support in the belief that Moreno would be delayed at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> due to the condition of Linois's ships. Saumarez was wrong: Moreno planned to convoy the battered squadron the short distance to Cadiz as soon as they were seaworthy.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} squadron sailed from Cadiz on 9 July, progressing rapidly southwards {{and reaching}} Algeciras Bay {{late in the}} afternoon, except for Saint Antoine which was delayed and arrived the following morning. The force was anchored close to Algeciras, well {{out of range of}} cannon at Gibraltar, and there waited for Linois to finish making the necessary repairs to his ships. Shadowing the combined squadron was a small British force under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats on HMS Superb with the frigate HMS Thames and the brig HMS Pasley. Although part of Saumarez's squadron, Keats had been too late {{to take part in the}} first battle, and had instead cruised off Cadiz watching the Spanish fleet there. When Moreno sailed, Keats was initially chased by portions of the Franco-Spanish squadron, but eluded and followed them, subsequently joining Saumarez at Gibraltar. At the British port, the dockyards were the scene of frantic activity as Saumarez, supported by commissioner Captain Alexander Ball, sought to repair his squadron so that it could intercept Moreno's forces on their voyage back to Cadiz. Pompée was temporarily abandoned in the yard, her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron. Saumarez also gave orders that his flagship, HMS Caesar was also to be left at Gibraltar, but Captain Jahleel Brenton requested the opportunity to repair his ship and Saumarez relented, the crew of Caesar working all day and in shifts throughout the night in order to bring their ship up to fighting standard. Saumarez believed however that due to the condition of Linois's ships and the mistaken assumption that the combined squadron would sail for Cartagena to the east, he would have at <b>least</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> to prepare and sent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith, then at sea off Egypt, requesting support against the combined squadron.|$|E
