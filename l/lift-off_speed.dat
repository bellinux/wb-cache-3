The data from the sensors are used to calculate numerous factors including airspeed and altitude. Because three pressure transducers had been improperly calibrated by the maintenance crew due to condensation inside devices, the flight-control computers calculated inaccurate aircraft angle of attack and airspeed. Incorrect airspeed data on cockpit displays led to the aircraft rotating 12 knots slower than indicated. After the wheels lifted from the runway, which caused the flight control system to switch to different control laws, the erroneously sensed negative angle of attack caused the computers to inject a sudden, 1.6g, uncommanded 30-degree pitch-up maneuver. The combination of slow <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> and the extreme angle of attack (and attendant drag) resulted in an unrecoverable stall, yaw, and descent. Both crew members successfully ejected from the aircraft soon after the left wing tip started to gouge the ground alongside the runway. The aircraft hit the ground, tumbled, and burned after its fuel ignited.|$|E

One application of these bearings is in turbopumps for liquid rocket engines. To evaluate bearing performance, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> of the shaft from the bearing surface is experimentally determined. Experimental data of lift-off are collected using a circuit running through the shaft and the designed bearing. Other methods for measuring liftoff speeds were attempted but did not yield consistent results. Water {{is used as a}} lubricant to simulate a low viscosity medium. In comparison to load-capacity-based predictions for FPBs, the experimental results showed lower lift-off speeds, higher load capacities, higher eccentricity ratios, and lower attitude angles.

At 0. 689 bar supply pressure and for a design speed of 3000 rpm, the HHB showed greater load capacities and lower eccentricities than the FPBs, but the FPBs had lower lift-off speeds and attitude angles. In fact, the FPBs in the load-between-pad orientation outperformed the HHB in the load-on-pocket orientation with lower lift-off speeds for the shaft weight-only case. An increased supply pressure lowered the lift-off speeds in the HHB tests. If the load in the bearing application remains relatively small, a FPB could be substituted for an HHB...|$|E

Recent laboratory failures have been assumed to be directly linked to operating foil bearings below their <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> while following conventional startup procedures for the engines. In each instance, the continuous sliding contact between the foils and shaft was believed to thermally overload the bearing and cause the engines to fail. These failures highlight the need to characterize required acceleration rates and minimum operating speeds for these applications. In this report, startup experiments were conducted with a large, rotorcraft engine sized foil bearing under moderate load and acceleration rates to identify the proper start procedures needed to avoid bearing failure.

40|$|Bosch Rexroth Hägglunds Drives AB {{manufactures}} hydraulic motors, {{a mechanical}} device that transforms energy from a liquid medium to kinetic energy. The piston assembly in the motor consists of both sliding and rolling interfaces. During start {{and when the}} speed is low, these surfaces will be in contact without any separating lubrication film. This is called boundary lubrication and causes high friction losses. When the motor obtains its <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> a transition from a mixed lubrication regime where the surfaces in the piston assembly are partly separated to a full film lubrication where they are completely separated by a lubrication film takes place. Running-in of an assembly is made to assure good conformity of the surfaces. The wear rate of the surfaces is high during running-in, but when the asperities of the surface are worn down, the wear that occurs after the running-in period will be mild and controlled. In this thesis work investigations were performed {{to determine if a}} lubricant in conjunction with a diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating can be used to improve running-in of the roller-piston interface of the motor. This could thereby decrease the <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> and boundary friction. The running-in lubricant is proposed to be used during the 30 minute delivery test that is performed at Bosch Rexroth Hägglunds Drives to ensure improved and reliable functioning of the motor. In the experiments, varying concentrations of anti-wear (AW) and extreme pressure (EP) additives were blended into mineral base oil and reciprocating conformal and counterformal tribological tests were performed. The wear and the surface roughness of the samples after the test were investigated with an optical profiler and scanning electron microscopy. It could be concluded that a high content of EP additive gave the highest amount of wear of the tested additive combinations, while the AW content did not seem to affect the results. Oil with high EP content could therefore work as a running-in oil, and should be further tested in a piston test rig. Validerat; 20110617 (anonymous...|$|E

A simple {{hydrodynamic}} model which relates the slip-speed (Us) and <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> (UL) to the physical forces acting on the fish has been verified experimentally using freshly killed fish and a rigid model. With an asymmetric semi-ellipsoid shape and a fineness ratio of 14 the plaice appears to be morphologically adapted to have minimum drag when heading into the current. As a result of this streamlined shape the lift force experienced by the fish is 10 - 20 times greater than the drag force, and the rheotactic behaviour therefore appears to be principally adapted to counteract hydrodynamic lift. Values of Us and UL, above which live fish must expend energy against the current, are exceeded for much of each tidal cycle in the southern North Sea.

40|$|The Blended Wing Body (BWB) {{aircraft}} {{offers a}} number of aerodynamic perfor- mance advantages when compared with conventional configurations. However, while operating at low airspeeds with nominal static margins, the controls on the BWB aircraft begin to saturate and the dynamic performance gets sluggish. Augmenta- tion of aerodynamic controls with the propulsion system is therefore considered in this research. Two aspects were of interest, namely thrust vectoring (TVC) and flap blowing. An aerodynamic model for the BWB aircraft with blown flap effects was formulated using empirical and vortex lattice methods and then integrated with a three spool Trent 500 turbofan engine model. The objectives were to estimate the effect of vectored thrust and engine bleed on its performance and to ascertain the corresponding gains in aerodynamic control effectiveness. To enhance control effectiveness, both internally and external blown flaps were sim- ulated. For a full span internally blown flap (IBF) arrangement using IPC flow, the amount of bleed mass flow and consequently the achievable blowing coefficients are limited. For IBF, the pitch control effectiveness was shown to increase by 18 % at low airspeeds. The associated detoriation in engine performance due to compressor bleed could be avoided either by bleeding the compressor at an earlier station along its ax- ial length or matching the engine for permanent bleed extraction. For an externally blown flap (EBF) arrangement using bypass air, high blowing coefficients are shown to be achieved at 100 % Fan RPM. This results in a 44 % increase in pitch control authority at landing and take-off speeds. The main benefit occurs at take-off, where both TVC and flap blowing help in achieving early pitch rotation, reducing take-off field lengths and <b>lift-off</b> <b>speeds</b> considerably. With central flap blowing and a lim- ited TVC of 10 ◦, the lift-off range reduces by 48 % and lift-off velocity by almost 26 %. For the lateral-directional axis it was shown that both aileron and rudder control powers can be almost doubled at a blowing coefficient of Cu = 0. 2. Increased roll authority greatly helps in achieving better roll response at low speeds, whereas the increased rudder power helps in maintaining flight path in presence of asymmetric thrust or engine failure, otherwise not possible using the conventional winglet rudder.

40|$|Moving machine {{assemblies}} {{are generally}} designed {{to operate in}} full film lubrication regime to ensure high efficiency and durability of components. However, {{it is not always}} possible to ensure this owing to changes in operating conditions such as load, speed, temperature etc. The overall frictional losses in machines are thus dependent on the operating lubrication regimes (boundary, mixed or full-film). The present work is thus aimed at investigating the role of different surface modification technologies on friction of a conformal tribopair both in boundary and full film lubrication regimes. The conformal pair chosen is a hydrodynamic bearing with some hydrostatic lift. A special test rig comprising of two bearings was built for the experimental studies. Tribological tests were conducted in a wide speed range so as to enable studies in all lubrication regimes i. e., in boundary, mixed and full-film lubrication. The influence of application of different surface modification technologies on friction has been studied. In all, rollers with five coatings (four hard DLC coatings and one self-lubricating coating) and two rollers without coating having different surface finish. Friction measurements were made on the new as well as the previously run-in components. The different coatings exhibit different levels of boundary friction, with the self-lubricating coating having lowest boundary friction, closely followed by those with hard DLC coatings. The softer amongst the hard DLC coatings showed similar boundary friction compared to that with uncoated rollers. The <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed,</b> i. e., the transition between full-film to mixed and boundary lubrication mainly governed by the surface topography characteristics. A smooth surface finish can be achieved either by polishing before the test or by effective running in of the new surface. The effectiveness of running-in of surfaces was influenced by the surface roughness and hardness of the interacting surfaces. Godkänd; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20100628 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|A hybrid bearing {{designed}} {{for use in a}} next generation turbo-pump is evaluated for the performance of initial lift-off, referred to as start-transient. The radial test rig features a high-speed spindle motor capable of 20, 000 rpm that drives a 718 Inconel rotor attached via a high-speed coupling. The drive end is supported by ceramic ball bearings, while the hybrid bearing supports the opposite end. A magnetic bearing delivers the applied loading along the mid-span of the rotor. Many parameters, including ramp rate [rpm/s] (drive torque), supply pressure at 15, 000 rpm, magnitude of the applied load, and load orientation, are varied to simulate different start-transient scenarios. The data are recorded in. dat files for future evaluation of transient predictions. Analysis of the data includes an evaluation of hydrodynamic and hydrostatic liftoff, an assessment of rub from passing through a lightly damped critical speed, and observation of pneumatic hammer instability. Hydrodynamic lift-off occurs when the hydrodynamic pressure, resulting from the relative motion of two surfaces, overcomes the forces acting on the rotor; no indication of hydrodynamic lift-off is provided. Hydrostatic lift-off results from the external supply pressure (which for this test rig is speed dependent) overcoming the forces acting on the rotor as determined from rotor centerline plots. With 0. 263 bar applied unit load in the vertical direction, hydrostatic lift-off occurs at 0 rpm and 2. 08 bar supply pressure. With a much higher load of 1. 53 bar, hydrostatic lift-off is at 12, 337 rpm and 10. 7 bar supply pressure. The required supply pressure for hydrostatic lift-off is approximately a linear function of the applied unit load. In a turbopump, hydrostatic lift-off depends on the speed because the supply pressure is proportional to the speed squared. With the load in the horizontal direction, hydrostatic lift-off occurs at lower speeds and pressures. The ramp rate did not affect the required supply pressure for hydrostatic lift-off. A lower supply pressure at 15, 000 rpm lowered the required supply pressure for hydrostatic liftoff as well as the natural frequencies creating a rub. The hydrostatic <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> should be minimized to avoid damage to the rotor/bearing surfaces due to contact...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{bearings}} in oil-free micro-turbomachinery for {{process gas}} applications and for power generation (< 400 kW) must offer adequate load capacity and thermal stability, reliable rotordynamic performance {{at high speeds}} and temperatures, low power losses and minimal maintenance costs. The metal mesh foil bearing (MMFB) is a promising foil bearing technology offering inexpensive manufacturing cost, large inherent material energy dissipation mechanism, and custom-tailored stiffness and damping properties. This dissertation presents predictions and measurements of the dynamic forced performance of various high speed and high temperature MMFBs. MMFB forced performance depends mainly on its elastic support structure, consisting of arcuate metal mesh pads and a smooth top foil. The analysis models the top foil as a 2 D finite element (FE) shell supported uniformly by a metal mesh under-layer. The solution of the structural FE model coupled with a gas film model, governed by the Reynolds equation, delivers the pressure distribution over the top foil and thus the load reaction. A perturbation analysis further renders the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for the bearing. The static and dynamic performance predictions are validated against limited published experimental data. A one-to-one comparison of the static and dynamic forced performance characteristics of a MMFB against a Generation I bump foil bearing (BFB) of similar size, with a slenderness ratio L/D= 1. 04, showcases the comparative performance of MMFB against a commercially available gas foil bearing design. The measurements of rotor <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> and drag friction at start-up and airborne conditions are conducted for rotor speeds up to 70 krpm and under identical specific loads (W/LD = 0. 06 to 0. 26 bar). The dynamic force coefficients of the bearings are estimated, in a ?floating bearing? type test rig, while floating atop a journal spinning to speeds as high as 50 krpm and with controlled static loads (22 N) applied in the vertical direction. The parameter identification is conducted in the frequency range of 200 - 400 Hz first, and then up to 600 Hz using higher load capacity shakers. A finite element rotordynamic program (XLTRC 2) models a hollow rotor and two MMFBs supporting it and predict the synchronous rotor response for known imbalances. The predictions agree well with the ambient temperature rotor response measurements. Extensive rotor response measurements and rotor and bearing temperature measurements, with a coil heater warming up to 200 ?C and placed inside the hollow rotor, reveal the importance of adequate thermal management. The database of high speed high temperature performance measurements {{and the development of}} a predictive tool will aid in the design and deployment of MMFBs in commercial high-speed turbomachinery.

40|$|A radial piston {{hydraulic}} motor has several components that encounter sliding orrolling motion under lubricated conditions. When a hydrostatic, hydrodynamic orelastohydrodynamic oil film separates the interacting surfaces, the wear and frictionare low provided {{of course the}} hydraulic fluid is free from the presence ofcontaminants. Mixed lubrication may occur even at relatively high speed when usinglow viscosity fluids and may result in increased friction which adversely affects theoperating efficiency of the {{hydraulic motor}}. Additionally, the increased heataccumulation at different interfaces of the motor under extreme operating conditionsinvolving high pressures, high speeds and low viscosities {{can also lead to}} unstoppablethermal process resulting in seizure. At low speeds, different tribological pairs operatein boundary lubrication regime and are prone to wear. The associated high friction canalso result in low starting efficiency. The research work reported here has thus focussed on addressing the above mentionedquestions so as to improve understanding of the tribological phenomena and find waysfor improving and alleviating hydraulic motor tribological components. The results have shown {{that it is possible to}} reduce both the boundary friction and thelift-off speed through proper choice of surface modification methods and theirapplication on motor components. The running-in aspect is also very important for the satisfactory tribologicalperformance of the motor. An optimal running-in can improve surface roughness andconformity of motor components. The studies have shown that the use of DLC andphosphate coatings can be effective in accomplishing these. It may however also bekept in mind that during the initial sliding (running-in) the machine components aresusceptible to wear and roughening of the surfaces. The conformity and roughness ofthe surfaces of the sliding components are important for the <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> and this alsoinfluences both the seizure resistance and overall efficiency of the motor. Threeprocesses give rise to the occurrence of seizure in a hydraulic motor and these havebeen identified as: friction heat generation during operation in mixed lubricationregime, friction heat generation during operation in full film lubrication regime andentrapment of wear particles between sliding surfaces. The initiation of scuffing on alocal scale has been found to be dependent on interface temperature rather than on thepv-value. There are several polymeric materials that are suitable for journal bearing applicationsin hydraulic motors. The PTFE based polymeric materials have the potential to reducebreak away friction by an order of magnitude. However, after running-in at 100 MPacontact pressure their low coefficients of friction have been found to increase. The simulation of a hybrid journal bearing including influence of surface roughnesshas shown good correlation with practical measurements in component test rig inlubrication regime ranging from full film down to boundary lubrication.

40|$|Airports in The Netherlands are {{subjected}} to tangent environmental laws to restrain pollution and noise nuisance. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol (AAS) is one airport dealing with this regulatory framework but nevertheless they are resolute to continue growth with respect to aircraft movements. To cope with the law related to aircraft noise, the department Stakeholder Strategy and Development (SSD) of AAS {{is responsible for the}} implementation of Noise Abatement Measures (NAMs). NAMs are used to minimize aircraft noise as to be able to maximize the number of aircraft movements within the environmental law as set by the Dutch government. SSD demands to be able to visualize the effect of a NAM by measuring aircraft noise with its Noise Monitoring System (NOMOS). However, in practice it appears that the effect of a NAM to the exposed noise level cannot easily be determined since the total set of measurements show a high degree of scattering. This is caused by the fact that many other parameters are contributing to the exposed noise level as, for example, engine setting and aircraft configuration. Therefore, AAS encounters difficulties evaluating the effectiveness of implemented noise reducing measures using the noise levels as measured by NOMOS. Hence, the research question becomes: How can the distinctiveness between noise measurements effectively be improved as to evaluate the direct effect of a Noise Abatement Measure to the measured noise level? As a first step towards answering this question, aircraft mass m and aircraft engine setting N 1 were identified which were expected to mask the effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Then, the Peak Find Method (PFM) is developed to determine N 1 from the associated acoustic time series as retrieved from NOMOS. Thirdly, aircraft mass m was found {{to be very difficult to}} determine from aircraft performance theories. Therefore, the <b>lift-off</b> <b>speed</b> at take-off Vlof 2 is taken as an aircraft mass representative. With the two predictors N 1 and Vlof 2 available and the measured maximum loudness levels Lmax retrieved from NOMOS, a Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis (MLRA) is carried out to assess the effect of the two predictors to variations in Lmax. Last, the identified MLRA model is used to subtract the contribution of N 1 and Vlof 2 from the received noise levels, hence leaving the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level. Initial correlation analysis showed no correlation between N 1 and Lmax and neither between Vlof 2 and Lmax. While the MLRA model is based upon the identified values of the predictors, it was therefore not expected that the high variations in Lmax would decrease when using these predictors, bearing in mind the results of both correlation analysis. And ultimately, by using the MLRA model only 7 % of the total variation in Lmax could be explained, which turned out to be too less to evaluate the direct effect of a NAM to the measured noise level.
