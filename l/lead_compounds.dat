5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (nitric acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of <b>lead</b> <b>compounds,</b> excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E
5|$|Lead forms {{a variety}} of {{compounds}} and exists in the environment in various forms. Features of poisoning differ {{depending on whether the}} agent is an organic compound (one that contains carbon), or an inorganic one. Organic lead poisoning is now very rare, because countries across the world have phased out the use of organic <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> as gasoline additives, but such compounds are still used in industrial settings. Organic <b>lead</b> <b>compounds,</b> which cross the skin and respiratory tract easily, affect the central nervous system predominantly.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and {{ingestion}} {{may lead}} to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble <b>lead</b> <b>compounds.</b> All inorganic <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as probably carcinogenic to humans (Category2A). They {{have been linked to}} renal cancer and glioma in experimental animals and to renal cancer, brain cancer and lung cancer in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to arsenic. Lead is known to substitute for zinc in a number of enzymes, including δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase) in the haem biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase, important for the correct metabolism of DNA and can therefore cause fetal damage.|$|E
50|$|In drug {{discovery}} either a large series of structural analogs of an initial <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> are created and tested {{as part of}} a structure-activity relationship study or a database is screened for structural analogs of a <b>lead</b> <b>compound.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recently, the Federal Circuit {{and lower}} courts have applied a new test {{to assess the}} {{question}} of obviousness for chemical compounds. While courts have always considered the presence of some <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> to be relevant {{to the question of}} obviousness, beginning {{at the turn of the}} millennium, the Federal Circuit began assessing obviousness in a more formulaic fashion, applying what is commonly referred to as the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> analysis to determine if a litigant has established a prima facie case of obviousness. This Paper describes the development of the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> analysis, and its application. This Paper then discusses some of the shortcomings and weaknesses of the doctrine’s applications and how understanding the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> analysis and how it is likely to be applied in typical situations can be useful in understanding both how to draft stronger patents and what ways might be available to attack the obviousness of a chemical compound or a court’s application of the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> analysis...|$|R
5000|$|Once a <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> {{series has}} been {{established}} with sufficient target potency and selectivity and favourable drug-like properties, one or two compounds will then be proposed for drug development. The best of these is generally called the <b>lead</b> <b>compound,</b> while the other will be designated as the [...] "backup".|$|R
5|$|Lead(II) sulfate is {{insoluble}} in water, {{like the}} sulfates of other heavy divalent cations. Lead(II) nitrate and lead(II) acetate are very soluble, {{and this is}} exploited in the synthesis of other <b>lead</b> <b>compounds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as insomnia, delirium, cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|After antiquity, {{mention of}} lead {{poisoning}} was absent from medical literature {{until the end}} of the Middle Ages. In 1656 the German physician Samuel Stockhausen recognized dust and fumes containing <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> as the cause of disease, called since ancient Roman times morbi metallici, that were known to afflict miners, smelter workers, potters, and others whose work exposed them to the metal.|$|E
25|$|These {{could be}} applied in three {{different}} ways. Lead could be added directly to a ceramic body {{in the form of}} a <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> in suspension, either from galena (PbS), red lead (Pb3O4), white lead (2PbCO3·Pb(OH)2), or lead oxide (PbO). The second method involves mixing the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> with silica, which is then placed in suspension and applied directly. The third method involves fritting the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> with silica, powdering the mixture, and suspending and applying it. The method used on a particular vessel may be deduced by analysing the interaction layer between the glaze and the ceramic body microscopically.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Recently, we {{have shown}} that small {{molecule}} dCK inhibitors in combination with pharmacological pertur-bations of de novo dNTP biosynthetic pathways could eliminate acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in animal models. However, our previous <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> had a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, {{we set out to}} develop dCK inhibitors with favorable pharmacokinetic properties. We delineated the sites of the inhibitor for modification, guided by crystal structures of dCK in complex with the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> and with derivatives. Crystal structure of the complex between dCK and the racemic mixture of our new <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> indicated that the R-isomer is responsible for kinase inhibition. This was corroborated by kinetic analysis of the purified enantiomers, which showed that the R-isomer has> 60 -fold higher affinity than the S-isomer for dCK. This new <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> has significantly improved metabolic stability, making it a prime candidate for dCK-inhibitor based therapies against hematological malignancies and, potentially, other cancers.

5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, genistein and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> in drug discovery.|$|E
5|$|Since the Middle Ages, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} {{produced}} as a {{raw material for}} the production of coloured pigments in lead paints, such as chrome yellow (lead(II) chromate), chrome orange (lead(II) hydroxide chromate) and similar <b>lead</b> <b>compounds.</b> These pigments were used for dyeing and printing calico and other textiles.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> {{exist in}} formal {{oxidation}} states other than +4 or +2. Lead(III) may be obtained, {{as an intermediate}} between lead(II) and lead(IV), in larger organolead complexes; this oxidation state is not stable as both the lead(III) ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals. The same applies for lead(I), {{which can be found}} in such species.|$|E

40|$|The alkenyldiarylmethanes (ADAMs) are a {{class of}} non-nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NNRTIs) targeting HIV- 1. Four chemically and metabolically stabilized ADAMs incorporating N-methoxyimidoyl halide replacements of the methyl esters of the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> were previously reported. In this study, twenty-five new ADAMs were synthesized in order to investigate the biological consequences of installing nine different methyl ester bioisosteres at three different locations. Attempts to define a universal rank order of methyl ester bioisosteres and discover the 'best' one in terms of inhibitory activity versus HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) led {{to the realization that}} the potencies are critically dependent on the surrounding structure at each location, and therefore the definition of universal rank order is impossible. This investigation produced several new non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in which all three of the three methyl esters of the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> were replaced by methyl ester bioisosteres, resulting in compounds that are more potent as HIV- 1 RT inhibitors and antiviral agents than the <b>lead</b> <b>compound</b> itself and are expected to also be more metabolically stable than the <b>lead</b> <b>compound.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|To {{improve the}} {{leaching}} {{process in the}} gold cyanidation, lead(II) nitrate solution is added. Although a bulk process, only limited amounts (10 to 100milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) are required. Both the cyanidation itself, {{as well as the}} use of <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> in the process, are deemed controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p valence electron configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E

5|$|Known {{since the}} Middle Ages {{by the name}} plumb dulcis, the {{production}} of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic lead or lead oxide in nitric acid was small-scale, for direct use in making other <b>lead</b> <b>compounds.</b> In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material {{in the production of}} pigments for lead paints, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on titanium dioxide. Other industrial uses included heat stabilization in nylon and polyesters, and in coatings of photothermographic paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in gold cyanidation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are used}} as, or in, {{coloring}} agents, oxidants, plastic, candles, glass, and semiconductors. Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle wicks to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation. Lead-based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{recently}} {{described a}} new family of bioactive molecules with interesting anti-cancer activities: the N-(4 -(3 -aminophenyl) thiazol- 2 -yl) acetamides.

5|$|Some <b>lead</b> <b>compounds</b> are {{colorful}} {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating things that are not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
