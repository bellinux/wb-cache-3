5|$|The International Reborn Doll Artists (IRDA) {{originated}} at {{the first}} conference for reborn doll artists on January 21, 2005. The IRDA group was assembled in order to offer education for improved skills {{in the art of}} reborn doll creation. They offer skill building tutorials and instruction so reborners can remain {{up to date on the}} newest techniques and meet others who share a common interest in reborn doll fabrication. A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> that were created by the IRDA's executive board. This ethical code stipulates the guidelines members are to follow in advertising, listing, and describing their dolls in order to divide credit fairly between manufacturers, sculptors, and artists.|$|E

50|$|The {{first attempt}} to create a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> {{biological}} parts was in 1996, by Rebatchouk et al. This team introduced a cloning strategy for the assembly of short DNA fragments. However, this early attempt was not widely recognised by the scientific research community at the time. In 1999, Arkin and Endy realized that the heterogeneous elements that made up a genetic circuit were lacking standards, so they proposed a <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> biological parts. BioBricks were described and introduced by Tom Knight at MIT in 2003. Since then, various research groups have utilized the BioBrick standard parts to engineer novel biological devices and systems.|$|R

A preliminary <b>list</b> <b>of</b> 1420 candidate <b>standard</b> stars is built and its properties are shown.
