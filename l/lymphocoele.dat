40|$|Objectives: Peripheral <b>lymphocoele</b> is a {{recognized}} complication after {{various forms of}} surgery. This is a case report of a calf <b>lymphocoele</b> after surgery for varicose veins by ambulatory phlebectomy. Method: The reported incidence, pathology and possible treatment methods are discussed. Conclusion:Phlebectomypractitioners {{need to be aware}} of the possibility of this complication...|$|E
40|$|<b>Lymphocoele</b> is a {{rare and}} little known {{complication}} with {{only a handful of}} reports available. We report two cases of <b>lymphocoele</b> after anterior lumbar surgery that have occurred in two different centres and discuss diagnosis and management options. The first case is that of a 53 -year-old male patient undergoing two level anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) for disabling back pain due to disc degeneration {{in the context of an}} old spondylodiscitis. He developed a large fluid mass postoperatively. Fluid levels of creatinin were low and intravenous urography ruled out a urinoma suggesting the diagnosis of a <b>lymphocoele.</b> Following two unsuccessful drainage attempts he underwent a laparoscopic marsupialization. The second case was that of a 32 -year-old female patient developing a large fluid mass following a L 5 corpectomy for a burst fracture. She was treated successfully with insertion of a vacuum drain during 7  days. <b>Lymphocoele</b> {{is a rare}} complication but should be suspected if fluid collects postoperatively following anterior lumbar spine procedures. Chemical analysis of the fluid can help in diagnosis. Modern treatment consists of laparoscopic marsupialization. Lymph vessel anatomy should be borne in mind while exposing the anterior lumbar spine...|$|E
40|$|Pelvic <b>lymphocoele</b> is {{a result}} of {{systemic}} surgical lymph nodes removal leading to the accumulation of proteinrichinterstitial fluid in the extraperitoneal space. The presence of fluid arrested within the tissue accompanied bya decrease in the amount of oxygen and proteolytic activity evoke chronic infection. The excess of protein in thepresence of a bacterial infection additionally deteriorate lymphatic dysfunction. The most common bacteria causingthe infection are haemolytic streptococci. Moreover, the oedema makes tissue nutrition and healing of the wounddifficult. There are no randomised clinical trials devoted to specific <b>lymphocoele</b> treatment. The aim of the therapyis stabilization of lymphocyst, its decrease by needle aspiration and the improvement of the patient’s quality of lifeas well as the prevention and treatment of side effects. In the article we describe both surgical and pharmacologicaloptions of <b>lymphocoele</b> treatment with special attention paid to sclerotherapy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFilariasis is an endemic {{infection}} seen {{in tropical}} and subtropical {{regions of the}} world that presents with lymphatic dysfunction in the form of <b>lymphocoele,</b> hydrocoele, chyluria, or groin lymphadenovarix. We report a case of filariasis with the unusual presentation of acute abdominal pain in which radiographic imaging modalities {{played a crucial role in}} diagnosis...|$|E
30|$|Results: The mean {{operating}} time ranged from 132  min (LAVH) and 150  min. (TLH) {{at the beginning}} of the learning curve, to 72  min (LAVH) and 68  min (TLH) now. Since we introduced TLH as a routine technique, the rate of LAVH has been continuously decreasing. The overall complication rate was 6.6 % (20 patients). All serious complications, including one major intraperitoneal bleeding episode requiring relaparoscopy, one bowel laceration, one epigastric vessels injury, one bladder injury and one major <b>lymphocoele</b> after pelvic lymphadenectomy happened during or after LAVH. None of them concerned TLH or SLH.|$|E
40|$|The normal post-surgical {{anatomy of}} the male pelvis {{following}} radical prostatectomy as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging Abstract The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances of recur-rent prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy have been documented in the radiology literature; however little has been written on the range of normal post-operative appearances. Common routes of surgical access for radical prostatectomy include retro-pubic and transperineal, although newer minimally invasive methods are gaining increasing acceptance. Speci-fically the range of appearances of the anastomotic site, the prostatic bed, {{the position of the}} bladder base, periure-thral tissue, levator sling, rectum and residual seminal vesicles (if present) are demonstrated. A non-enhancing low signal nodule is frequently seen at the vesicourethral anastomosis or within the seminal vesicle remnant and usually represents fibrosis. Ap-pearances following different surgical accesses do not differ tremendously, although the retropubic fat pad is reduced or absent following a retro-pubic approach. Anterior rectal-wall scarring may be present following a transperineal approach. Other post-surgical findings that may mimic disease include a <b>lymphocoele</b> and injected bladder-neck bulking agent. Many patients referred for MRI fol-lowing radical prostatectomy will have a pathological study showing disease recurrence, although in non-pathological studies the radiological features can differ significantly. It is important for the radiologist {{to be aware of the}} spectrum of normal post-surgical appearances so not to confuse these with locally recurrent disease...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveLive donor kidney {{transplantation}} {{is consistently}} superior to deceased donor kidney transplantation. Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) is increasingly {{accepted as a}} safe and preferred surgical option. To evaluate the outcome of LDN {{and the impact of}} multiple arteries, a retrospective review was conducted on patients in two transplant centres. MethodsFifty patients including eight with double vessels were studied. Standard left transperitoneal LDN was performed. Grafts including those with double vessels were prepared using the bench technique. Postoperative outcomes (up to 1 year) for donors and recipients were studied. The outcomes of recipients of a single or double vessel graft were compared. ResultsAll donors had an eventful recovery. No difference was found between the single and multiple vessels groups for operating time (168. 21 ± 5. 712 minutes vs. 197. 50 ± 15. 755 minutes) or hospital stay (3. 21 ± 0. 165 days vs. 4. 13 ± 0. 789 days). The recipient outcomes including hospital stay (10. 17 ± 0. 596 days vs. 12. 13 ± 1. 797 days) and creatinine levels at day 7 (106. 53 ± 5. 583 μmol/L vs. 107. 13 ± 11. 857 μmol/L) and 1 year (120. 21 ± 6. 562 μmol/L vs. 124. 75 ± 11. 857 μmol/L) were similar. No ureteric stricture or graft loss was noted at 1 -year follow-up. Recipient complications included <b>lymphocoele</b> (n = 2), haematoma (n = 3 with 2 requiring exploration), sepsis (n = 1), renal artery stenosis (n = 2 with 1 stented), repeated anastomosis (n = 1), and incisional hernia (n = 1). No differences were noted between the two groups. ConclusionOur results showed that overall donor morbidity rate was low, as reflected by the short hospital stay. Also, the overall parameters of the recipients were good. In particular, no ureteric stricture was noted, and graft survival was 100 % at 1 year. The outcomes of the reconstructed group, despite the technical challenge, were {{similar to those of the}} single-vessel group...|$|E
