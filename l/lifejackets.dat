5|$|Despite {{the safer}} eastern channel and {{improvements}} in maritime technology, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution still deals with incidents at the Doom Bar. In February 1997, two fishermen who were not wearing <b>lifejackets</b> drowned after their boat capsized. Two anglers {{had been killed in}} a similar incident in 1994. On 25 June 2007, the Padstow lifeboat and a rescue helicopter rescued the crews of two yachts in separate incidents from the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of these developments eventually culminated in success. On 13 March 1941 Braham achieved a surprise attack on a Dornier Do 17, knocking out one of its engines before the cannons jammed. His radar operator, Sergeant Ross, eventually unjammed three of the guns. Braham's second burst blew the bomber up at a range of 60 yards and the Beaufighter narrowly avoided colliding with the debris. The engagement lasted 13 minutes. The two aircrew achieved another success on the 9 May. Approaching from slightly below their target, Braham followed his radar operator's instructions until a visual sighting had been made. Identifying an aircraft through a patch of eclipsed stars he could then position himself to attack. Attacking two He 111s he downed one with two close-range and short bursts of cannon fire. The victory was confirmed. The He 111 had crashed in neighbouring Richmond, London. The dead pilot's Iron Cross was sent to Braham and a souvenir along with two Luftwaffe <b>lifejackets</b> which he preferred to the bulkier British design. He wore the lifejacket until he was shot down.|$|E

25|$|Divers only spend a {{few hours}} at a time on these fast but exposed boats. The boats are usually {{relatively}} small so they can easily be transported on roads and launched at a convenient site depending on the weather. Boats of this size can be launched from slipways or through the surf on suitable beaches. The smaller models are suitable for amateur divers, as they can only transport a few divers. The larger boats can carry enough divers to be viable for professional use. These boats will generally carry basic safety equipment such as marine VHF radio, small boat safety gear, <b>lifejackets</b> and first aid oxygen administration equipment.|$|E

40|$|Optimizing floating-point {{arithmetic}} {{is vital}} {{because it is}} ubiquitous, costly, and used in compute-heavy workloads. Implementing precise optimizations correctly, however, is difficult, since developers must account for all the esoteric properties of floating-point arithmetic {{to ensure that their}} transformations do not alter the output of a program.

25|$|When {{this act}} was made public, it was {{interpreted}} by {{much of the}} press as a bribe to prevent the crew from returning {{to the scene of}} the sinking to rescue others. The British Board of Trade's official inquiry into the disaster investigated the allegation but found the charge of bribery to be false. Even so, the publicity injured Sir Cosmo's reputation. A photograph of the occupants of Boat 1 was taken aboard the Carpathia. Lucile had consented to a request from a Carpathia passenger, Dr. Frank Blackmarr, to take the image, but the sight of some of the crew posing in their <b>lifejackets</b> disturbed some fellow survivors who subsequently complained about the incident.|$|E
25|$|Later, Goldfinger and his henchmen {{learn from}} SMERSH who Bond is, and {{determine}} {{to take him}} with them in defecting to the Soviet Union. They pose as doctors to incapacitate crew and passengers (including Bond) with drugged inoculations. Then they hijack the aircraft, carrying 1.5 tons of gold, Goldfinger's total savings. The hijacked airplane is piloted by three German ex-Luftwaffe pilots who work for Goldfinger. Oddjob meets his end when he is sucked through an airliner window after Bond pierces it with a knife. Bond and Goldfinger engage in a brief struggle, during which Bond is seized by a violent rage {{for the first time}} in his life, strangling Goldfinger to death with his bare hands. Bond then turns to the pilots and forces the airplane to turn back from its intended flight path, causing it to ditch in the ocean after running out of fuel. The weight of Goldfinger's gold causes the airplane to sink rapidly, taking his body and his pilots down with it. Only Bond and Pussy Galore, both wearing <b>lifejackets,</b> appear in the ocean and are soon picked up, as the only survivors.|$|E
25|$|Fishing was {{the most}} {{important}} industry from the 14th century until the mid-19th. Salt water fishing began before 1320, when too fine nets were seized by City authorities, but expanded greatly from the 16th century. Fisher Street was named after the fishing community there. From about 1775 welled and dry smacks were used, mostly as cod boats, and rigged as gaff cutters. Fishermen sailed as far as Iceland in the summer. They served Billingsgate Fish Market in the City of London, and moored in Barking Pool. Scymgeour Hewett, born on 7 December 1797, founded the Short Blue Fleet (England's biggest fishing fleet) based in Barking, and using smacks out of Barking and east coast ports. Around 1870 this fleet changed to gaff ketches that stayed out at sea for months, using ice for preservation of fish produced by flooding local fields in winter. Fleeting involved fish being ferried from fishing smacks to gaff cutters by little wooden ferry-boats. The rowers had to stand as the boats were piled high with fish boxes. Rowers refused to wear their bulky cork <b>lifejackets</b> because it slowed down their rowing. At first the fast 50-foot gaff cutters with great booms projecting beyond the sterns raced the fish to port to get the best prices.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was during}} the {{abandonment}} of the sinking Houston that Commander Rentz entered the water and attained partial safety along with other crewmembers on a destroyed airplane's float. Seeing extreme overcrowding {{and the fact that}} the pontoon was taking on water, he attempted to relinquish his space and <b>lifejacket</b> to wounded survivors nearby. He declared [...] "You men are young, I have lived the major part of my life and I am willing to go." [...] According to Houston survivor Private Jim Gee, no one would oblige the generous, fearless chaplain. Each time Rentz attempted to leave he was brought back by his shipmates. He ultimately relinquished his <b>lifejacket</b> to Seaman First Class Walter L. Beeson, who recounts that Rentz [...] "told me his heart was failing him; told me he couldn't last much longer." [...] Following a brief prayer, the Chaplain gave the <b>lifejacket</b> to Beeson, who refused to put it on. Rentz kicked away from the float and disappeared. Gee recalled [...] "No one realized what had happened. It's just one of those things that one minute he's there, and the next minute... he wasn't." [...] When Beeson realized that Rentz was gone, he put on the <b>lifejacket.</b> [...] For these actions, Rentz was posthumously awarded the United States Navy's second highest award for valor, the Navy Cross.|$|R

40|$|This report {{covers the}} design process {{implemented}} during {{the development of a}} life jacket designed for the active sea rescuer in the Swedish Sea Rescue Society (Svenska sjöräddningssällskapet). The project's objective was to investigate the needs of the sea rescuer and then meet them with a new flexible <b>lifejacket.</b> It will include features that facilitate the rescue operations without reducing the safety of the user, it will have a strong identity and appealing function and design. The project aims to expand existing knowledge in product development and supplement it with experience in SAR (search and rescue) and textile design. Initially, the group took part in SAR training for better understanding and for the opportunity to study the advantages and shortcomings of today's equipment. In the process, interviews were conducted to find out the target group's views and concerns. Varied and creative methods in combination with the continuous function tests helped to develop a well thought out and functional <b>lifejacket.</b> Idea generation, followed by careful selection produced the final concept. Detailed design was developed on the life jacket to form the basis for pattern design. The prototype was then sewn up. Tests on the prototype secured the vest feature. Adding one more iterative design process to determine and fix smaller errors before initiating the final prototype and product. The product needs to undergo ISO rating to be sold, the ISO-class the project focuses on is the Buoyancy 50. The result is a flexible, safe and efficient real <b>lifejacket</b> that meets the client requirements. The vest provides innovative solutions that did not exist when the project is conducted. The contious work will now carry on with Europe's most prominent <b>lifejacket</b> manufacturers Baltic Safety Products, who will add the <b>lifejacket</b> to their range.
