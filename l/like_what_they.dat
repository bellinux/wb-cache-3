5|$|Kohlberg {{established}} the Moral Judgement Interview in his original 1958 dissertation. During the roughly 45-minute tape recorded semi-structured interview, the interviewer uses moral dilemmas {{to determine which}} stage of moral reasoning a person uses. The dilemmas are fictional short stories that describe situations {{in which a person}} has to make a moral decision. The participant is asked a systemic series of open-ended questions, <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think the right course of action is, as well as justifications as to why certain actions are right or wrong. The form and structure of these replies are scored and not the content; over a set of multiple moral dilemmas an overall score is derived.|$|E
25|$|So far, {{there have}} been many interpretations for the Buddhist crisis and the immolation of Thích Quảng Đức in 1963. Relating the events in a larger context of Vietnamese Buddhism in twentieth century and looking at the {{interactions}} between Diệm and Buddhist groups, Miller argues that the Buddhist protests during Diệm's regime were not only the struggles for discrimination in religious practices and religious freedom but also the resistances of Vietnamese Buddhism to Diệm's nation building policies centered by Personalist revolution that Buddhists considered a threat to the revival of Vietnamese Buddhist power. Until the end of his life, Diệm, along with his brother Nhu still believed that their nation building was successful and they could resolve the Buddhist crisis in their own way, <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had done with the Hinh crisis in 1954 and the struggle with the Bình Xuyên in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Battle of az-Zallaqah: At Sagrajas (Friday 23 October 1086) {{north-east}} of Badajoz, the Almoravids (12,000 or 20,000 men) under Yusuf ibn Tashfin and Andalusians (including Kings of Seville, Granada, Málaga, and Badajoz) {{defeat a}} predominantly Leonese-Castilian army (possibly 50-60,000 men including Jews, Aragonese, Italian and French) under Alfonso VI of León and Castile. The Andalusians encamp {{separately from the}} Almoravids. The Christian vanguard (Alvar Fañez) surprise the Andalusian camp before dawn; the men of Seville (Al-Mutamid) hold firm but the remaining Andalusians are chased off by the Aragonese cavalry. The Christian main body then attacks the Almoravids, but are held by the Lamtuma, and then withdraw to their own camp {{in response to an}} outflanking move by ibn Tashufin. The Aragonese return to the field, do not <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see, and start a withdraw which turns to a rout. The Andalusians rally, and the Muslims drive Alfonso to a small hill. Alfonso and 500 knights escape in the night to Toledo. Al-Mutamid proposes that the Christians are pursued and crushed, but Ibn Tashufin retires back to his African domains leaving only 3,000 troops to defend the east of Al-Andalus. Al-Mutamid and the Almoravid generals Sir ibn Abi Bakr and Dawud ibn Aisha are reported to have fought well during the battle.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Time magazine, Jay Cocks {{observed}} {{the show to}} integrate [...] "sleek high tech and smooth dance rhythm into an evening of snazzy soul with a social conscience." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times remarked that Jackson's choreography [...] "represents the pinnacle {{of what can be}} done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show, in a similar fashion to her contemporaries. Jon Pareles commented, [...] "most lip-synched shows are done by video-era pop performers whose audiences are young and television trained. They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw on television—the dancing... the stage effects and incidentally the songs." [...] Michael MacCambridge considered it a [...] "moot point" [...] stating, [...] "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles." ...|$|E
500|$|Game {{director}} and composer Junichi Masuda stated that {{to keep the}} games fresh, he looks at every previous element {{to decide what to}} adapt to the new game, stating [...] "people may not <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like in the past, trend wise". He explained the new battle styles, stating that while triple battles take more strategy, rotation battles take more luck to win. Masuda stated that their goal when making the games was to make it fun for new players, but they also wanted to get players who have not played the series in a while to come back. He said that it was hard to find that balance to satisfy both kinds of players. For the new players, there is good explanation in how to play, while for old players, they incorporated the C-Gear, which makes the ability to trade and battle easier. When asked about the decision to introduce over 150 new species of Pokémon, Masuda stated that they did this so old players {{would not be able to}} know what is a good Pokémon to use, and it would level the playing ground for new players.|$|E

50|$|Travis' bluesy {{rendition}} {{was initially}} recorded {{as part of}} the album Rock, Rhythm & Blues, a 10-song compilation featuring covers of 1950s-era pop hits by 1980s stars.

500|$|Davis toured relentlessly for {{two years}} while tolerating intense {{physical}} pain and difficulty walking, caused by joint pain from sickle-cell anaemia, badly damaged ankles after a 1972 car wreck, and osteoporosis in his left hip, which had been operated on a decade earlier. He had also developed nodules on his larynx that often left him short of breath, especially when playing the trumpet. To numb the pain, he became increasingly dependent on self-medicating with painkillers, cocaine, and morphine, which combined with his alcohol and recreational drug use led to mood swings; he would by turns feel vulnerable and hostile. By the end of 1974, a disappointing showing in Down Beat magazine's readers poll reinforced to Davis that his reputation had diminished. Unfazed by detractors and personal troubles, he kept his touring schedule intense. [...] "He was like the general looking at the fort {{and they had a}} moat {{and we were going to}} get in that fort", Henderson later said. [...] "That was the attitude of the band. We didn't give a shit what the critics said. People are gonna <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> like, but if you don't like it, respect it. Respect that I have the right to do what I do. Because with or without you, we're going to do it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift's vocals {{have been}} {{described}} by Sophie Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter as [...] "sweet, but soft". In studio recordings, the Los Angeles Times identified Swift's [...] "defining" [...] vocal gesture as [...] "the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy". Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, remarked: [...] "Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough." [...] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice noted that her phrasing was previously [...] "bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's {{learned how to make}} words sound <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean." [...] The Hollywood Reporter opines that her live vocals are [...] "fine", but they do not match those of her peers. In 2009, they were also described as [...] "flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt". However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Brown {{decided to}} quit EastEnders after {{becoming}} [...] "discontented" [...] {{with the way}} Dot was portrayed. In 1997 she revealed to the Daily Mirror: [...] "I always felt Dot {{was one of those}} characters who should stay the same. She's a simple creature. There are some people who the same things happen to them again and again. They never learn [...] When I left, there was all that rubbish about it getting too much for me [...] I stopped because I wasn't being used very much. I thought, 'It's a part-time job'. It wasn't being written properly. Instead of finding the gossip and passing it on, [...] [...] was living on a reputation. [...] said to me, 'I loved it when [...] had [...] varicose veins.' I thought: 'What?! That was in 1985, it's 1993!'. I was getting so tetchy, so I thought I'd go. I'd had enough. They were a bit shocked, because apparently there were some good stories coming up." [...] Expanding on this in 2008, Brown stated that she [...] "didn’t <b>like</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing with Dot– she was meant to spread the gossip. Originally she was a fountain of knowledge then next thing I know, people are telling Dot what had been happening and I thought, ‘No, this just won’t do’. I was very annoyed, I felt like they had completely changed my character." [...] The character departed on-screen in August 1993, when Dot moved away from the soap's setting to live with her son Nick and his family in Gravesend, Kent.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{providing}} audience participation opportunities for its viewership, Good Game maintains a uniquely open relationship with them. Good Game explains that they [...] "take all suggestions & feedback seriously and, in fact, base the show around it." [...] Upon {{learning of the}} show's 2008 Lizzie award wins, Amanda Duthie, Head of Arts, Entertainment and Comedy at ABC TV said, [...] "The success of this breakout ABC2 program needs to be shared with our die-hard user-audience who are {{a significant part of}} the creative and editorial process – active on posting boards, contributors of video segments and accepting of experimental programming styles such as machinima – the audience is a true collaborator and unsung hero". Upon accepting the award the previous year, Junglist said: [...] "Good Game has a great fan base, and we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for our devoted audience...

2500|$|Rob Reiner {{said in a}} 2014 {{interview}} about his on- and off-screen chemistry with O'Connor, [...] "We did over 200 shows {{in front of a}} live audience. So I learned a lot about what audiences <b>like,</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> don't like, how stories are structured. I would {{spend a lot of time}} in the writing room and I actually wrote some scripts. And from Carroll O'Connor I learned a lot about how you perform and how important the script and story are for the actors. So the actor doesn't have to push things. You can let the story and the dialogue support you if it's good. I had great people around me and I took from all the people who were around." [...] He also stated, when he compared Carroll O'Connor's character to his acting mentor's real-life persona: [...] "Carroll O'Connor brought his humanity to the character even though he had these abhorrent views. He's still a feeling, human being. He loved his wife even though he acted the way he did, and he loved his daughter. Those things come out. I don't think anybody's all good or all bad." ...|$|E
