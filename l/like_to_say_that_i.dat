2500|$|With protesters {{gathering}} daily {{outside her}} Lima apartment building, lighting candles and demanding that she either be deported from Peru, or reimprisoned, Berenson {{sent a letter}} to President Alan Garcia admitting her [...] "criminal responsibility for terrorist collaboration" [...] and further writing [...] "I would also <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> very much regret the harm I have caused Peruvian society, and I ask forgiveness from people who have been affected by my actions or words." [...] She then requested that her sentence be commuted so she could return to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> spent three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist". Sébastien Huberdeau, the Tim Canterbury equivalent, was seen on international screens in The Barbarian Invasions, winner of the 2004 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} speak coherently, Henry," [...] Philippa observed, [...] "I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{exceedingly}} anxious {{to know why}} Mr. Lessingham has deserted us so precipitately." ...|$|E
5000|$|Discussing {{the style}} Herrera uses in his texts, he declared: [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> style isn't surface, style {{is a form}} of knowledge".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I shouldn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> sir. But--they seem rather harder, sir; at least, {{judging from}} what I see {{of them in}} York, sir. Rather harder, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I imagined," [...] Clarke said dryly. [...] "Still, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} some reason for believing {{you to be a}} badly treated man. You have my sympathy." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{got up in}} some irritation. [...] "Can I see him, at any rate?" [...] I asked. [...] "I am a journalist, {{and have}} no earthly motives except curiosity and {{personal}} vanity. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had shaken hands with the Superman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do her justice. I do {{her full}} justice," [...] she went on, with soft earnestness. [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> {{like to be}} able to say it. She 's full of {{intelligence}} and courage and devotion. She does n't do me a grain of justice; but that is no harm. There is something so fine in the aversions of a good woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Lizzie, in {{a frightened}} whisper, {{with her eyes}} often turned on the floor, told the whole story. [...] "If I'd had a minute to think of it," [...] she said, [...] "I would have confessed the truth at Carlisle. Why should I want to steal what was my own? But they came to me all so quickly, and I didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had them under my pillow." ...|$|E
30|$|For {{all these}} reasons, for the {{combination}} of permanencies and transformations, more or less radical, more or less real or only perceived, we <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> buildings are often antifragile—some buildings, under certain conditions.|$|R
5000|$|A common joke {{among those}} {{familiar}} with Barrett {{is that it is}} actually the center of the universe. Barrett folks <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> everyone [...] "Comes from, comes to, or knows someone from Barrett." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Many people <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he oppressed Shi'ites. I'm a Shi'ite, {{not from}} his city, not from his clan. When I hear such things I can say {{from my own}} {{experience}} that it's an exaggeration." ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was a long}} silence, {{and then}} Sir Walter said, seriously: [...] "Well, Mr. Wilson, I am not a detective, and these unhappy happenings have left you in charge of that branch of the business. We all lament the cause of this, but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> myself have the strongest {{confidence}} in your capacity for carrying on the work. What {{do you think we}} should do next?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Here the {{chairman}} gracefully {{waved his hand}} toward me {{and there was a}} certain amount of applause. [...] "Before I sit down," [...] {{the chairman}} added, [...] "I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am sorry to see such a poor turn-out to-night and to ask any of the members who haven't paid their dollar to pay it either to me or to Mr. Sibley as they pass out." ...|$|E
60|$|I hardly {{understood}} {{how this could}} have been, seeing that Mr. Micawber had paid them nothing at all as it was; but I {{did not like to}} ask. Neither did I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hoped he had not been too communicative to Uriah; or to inquire if they had talked much about me. I was afraid of hurting Mr. Micawber's feelings, or, at all events, Mrs. Micawber's, she being very sensitive; but I was uncomfortable about it, too, and often thought about it afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know; it 's a new thing, {{and must}} {{be a little bit}} hard at first," [...] stammered Fanny, not <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> working for one's living seemed a dreadful {{hardship}} to her.|$|R
5000|$|The {{president}} of URTEL, Moussa Keïta, recalls <b>that</b> [...] "We <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the 'Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision du Mali (ORTM) is the Voice of Mali {{and the local}} radio stations are the Voice of Malians." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (We would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> {{our ears}} at least, {{there is a}} music in this title {{like the sound of}} falling water, or of chopped ice. But we must not {{interrupt}} ourselves. We now begin. Listen.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, I say," [...] added Jimmy, [...] "I {{know you}} don't {{mean to be}} offensive, but I wish you wouldn't call me a thief. I'm a cracksman. There's a world of {{difference}} between the two branches of the profession. I mean, well, suppose you were an actor-manager, you wouldn't like to be called a super, would you? I mean--well, you see don't you? An ordinary thief, for instance, would use violence in a case like this. Violence--except in extreme cases; I hope this won't be one of them--is contrary to cracksmen's etiquette. On the other hand, Sir Thomas, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have you covered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} leave the five years, from 'seventy-six to 'eighty-one, entirely to me," [...] she resumed, [...] "and take the next five years, {{reckoning}} backward from 'seventy-six, you will help me to better purpose. Sir Jervis expects me to look for reports of Central American Explorations, through the newspapers of the last forty years; and I have taken the liberty of limiting the heavy task imposed on me. When I report my progress to my employer, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have got through ten years of the examination, instead of five. Do you see any objection to the arrangement I propose?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} admit that, once {{sure it was}} doing me harm, I could not, unaided, have given up tobacco. But I was {{reluctant}} to make sure. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> left off smoking because I considered it a mean form of slavery, to be condemned for moral {{as well as physical}} reasons; but though now I clearly see the folly of smoking, I was blind to it for some months after I had smoked my last pipe. I gave up my most delightful solace, as I regarded it, {{for no other reason than}} that the lady who was willing to fling herself away on me said that I must choose between it and her. This deferred our marriage for six months.|$|E
5000|$|James A. Moorer {{said in a}} 2005 interview, [...] "I <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the THX {{sound is}} the most widely-recognized piece of computer-generated music in the world. This {{may or may not}} be true, but it sounds cool!" ...|$|R
60|$|Feemy {{was rather}} puzzled; she didn't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{she was not}} engaged; she had a presentiment Mary Brady was fishing {{to find out if}} the report about the Captain's inconstancy was true, and as matters stood she did not exactly <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the affair was arranged.|$|R
5000|$|We {{have our}} {{troubles}} in England with the referee question, but I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the weakest of our referees {{at home is}} a Mussolini compared with the officials here. I have {{never seen such a}} lot of weak-kneed officials in all my career."---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'With {{regard to}} such {{questions}} as are not political,' continued Mr Gregsbury, warming; 'and which one can't be expected to care a curse about, beyond the natural care of not allowing inferior people to be as well off as ourselves--else where are our privileges?--I should wish my secretary to get together a few little flourishing speeches, of a patriotic cast. For instance, if any preposterous bill were brought forward, for giving poor grubbing devils of authors a right to their own property, I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> for one would never consent to opposing an insurmountable bar to the diffusion of literature among THE PEOPLE,--you understand?--that the creations of the pocket, being man's, might belong to one man, or one family; but that the creations of the brain, being God's, ought {{as a matter of}} course to belong to the people at large--and if I was pleasantly disposed, I should like to make a joke about posterity, and say that those who wrote for posterity should be content to be rewarded by the approbation OF posterity; it might take with the house, and could never do me any harm, because posterity can't be expected to know anything about me or my jokes either--do you see?' ...|$|E
6000|$|My {{point at}} any rate, {{such as it}} is, would be that even at the age I had reached in 1860 {{something}} of the happier time still lingered--the time in which a given product of the press might have a situation and an aspect, a considerability, so to speak, a circumscription and an aura; room to breathe and to show in, margin for the casting of its nets. The occasion at large was doubtless shrinking, one could note--shrinking like the unlet [...] "house" [...] on a night of grandest opera, but [...] "standing room only" [...] was not yet everywhere the sign, and the fine deliberate thing could here and there find its seat. I really indeed might have held it {{the golden age of}} letters still, and of their fond sister leisure, with that quiet swim into our ken on its appointed day, during our Bonn summer, of the charming Once a Week of the prime, the prime of George Meredith and Charles Reade and J. E. Millais and George du Maurier; which our father, to bridge our separation from him, sent us, from Paris and elsewhere, in prompt and characteristic relief of our plotted, our determined strict servitude to German, and to the embrace of the sweet slim essence of which the strain of one's muscles round a circular ton of advertisement was not a condition attached. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> rioted, all that season, on the supreme German classics and on Evan Harrington, with Charles Reade's A Good Fight, the assured little prelude to The Cloister and the Hearth, thrown in; and I should indeed be ready to say it, were not the expression gross for the really hushed piety of my attitude during those weeks. It was perhaps not quite till then that I fully emerged from the black shadow of the École Préparatoire aux Écoles Spéciales, not quite till we had got off beyond the blest Rhine at Basle that I ceased to hear and feel all but just behind me, portentous perhaps of another spring, the cold breath of the monster. The guttery Bonn-Gasse was during those weeks of the year close and stale, and the house of our good Herr Doctor Humpert, professor at the Bonn Gymnasium, in which I shared a room with my brother Wilky, contracted and dim, as well as fragrant through a range of assaults that differed only in kind and not at all in number from those of the street itself; and yet I held the period and the whole situation idyllic--the slightly odd sense of which was one's being to that extent attuned to the life of letters and of (oh the great thing!) impressions [...] "gone in for." [...] To feel a unity, a character and a tone in one's impressions, to feel them related and all harmoniously coloured, that was positively to face the æsthetic, the creative, even, quite wondrously, the critical life and almost on the spot to commence author. They had begun, the impressions--that was what was the matter with them--to scratch quite audibly at the door of liberation, of extension, of projection; what they were of one more or less knew, but what they were for was the question that began to stir, though one was still to be a long time at a loss directly to answer it.|$|E
5000|$|I would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{believe the}} lowest {{dimension}} of hell has been reserved for child molesters and unrepentant murderers, like Mumia Abu-Jamal. After {{thirty years of}} waiting, the time remaining before Abu-Jamal stands before his ultimate judge. It doesn't seem so far off as it once did when I was younger. I {{look forward to that}} day so I can finally close the chapter of my life and live with the gratification and assurance that Mumia Abu-Jamal will finally receive the punishment he deserves, for all eternity.|$|E
50|$|He {{was elected}} to the State House of Representatives in 1957 and served twenty four years, the last two years as Speaker of House.

6000|$|... "He had a fit," [...] Mr. Sabin said calmly, [...] "and {{left the}} service almost {{directly}} afterwards. He {{is living in}} strict seclusion in Norfolk, I believe. I should not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he is mad. As a matter of fact, I {{do not believe that}} he is." ...|$|R
50|$|Another of his {{personality}} traits is tenacity. Even though he can at times be lazy, and <b>likes</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his favorite place to be is in a hammock, once he has committed to accomplishing something he goes for it 100 percent, sometimes resorting to extreme measures to reach his goal.|$|R

5000|$|In 1957 it was {{announced}} Errol Flynn would star in a production in the US opposite Jan Brooks directed by Peter Ashmore. The play opened in Detroit {{with a view of}} bringing it to New York. Flynn struggled with the show, often forgetting lines. He quit the play in Cincinnati claiming that the play was [...] "no more fit for Broadway than Jack and the Beanstalk... I can't do much with the way its written." [...] Hartford responded that, [...] "In my defence, I'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have as yet to hear my play, from Mr Flynn, as it was written." [...] Flynn was replaced by John Emery and Demetrios Vilain replaced Ashmore as director.|$|E
50|$|I {{think that}} it was a most brave thing to-day to listen to the speech by the Deputy from Sligo to Alexander McCabe in {{reference}} to the women members of An Dáil, claiming that they only have the opinions they have because they have a grievance against England, or because their men folk were killed and murdered by England's representatives in this country. It was a most unworthy thing for any man to say here. I can say this more freely because, I thank my God, I have no dead men to throw in my teeth as a reason for holding the opinions I hold. I should <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think it most unfair to the women Teachtaí because Miss MacSwiney had suffered at England's hands.|$|E
5000|$|According <b>to</b> McNeish,"... he <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> his {{achievement}} {{was that he}} [...] "added {{a letter to the}} Bulgarian alphabet", but his monument is the great edition of the Paston Letters, [...] "a text throwing light on the attitudes of a 15th-century English family in Norfolk on the make." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, Friar {{received}} the Greek World Award. Then, in 1986, he won both a Ford Foundation grant and a National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities grant.

6000|$|... "He did {{not speak}} of it in that way," [...] Mr. Cuthbert answered, [...] "but {{in a sense that}} is, of course, what it amounts to.
