40|$|Two geoelectrical {{methods were}} used to {{characterize}} the state of an old French landfill cover. The objectives were to locate different materials used for the covering such as clay material or geomembrane and to identify heterogeneities that could be linked to possible defects in the cover due to fractures or cracks. These damages can induce preferential water pathways and unusual increase of leachate within the waste mass. The geoelectrical methods used were the electrical resistivity cartography with an Automatic Resistivity Profiling (ARP©) and the Self Potential method (SP). Results have put in evidence three distinct zones with different geoelectrical signatures that are correlated with three different phases of <b>landfill</b> <b>covering.</b> ARP also seems to have detected the presence of geomembrane installed all around the old landfill to improve its stability and geodrains over two closed alveoli. Local differences in apparent resistivity and self-potential signals have also been identified and could result in default in the clay cover due to thickness variations but also in different lithology, compaction and water content...|$|E

Continuous monitoring system of biological process has been developed and optimized and a bio-chemical process model has been developed using experimental tests data. The strengths have been identified in the minimization of the FOS (Stabilized Organic Fraction) quantities and in the higher yield of CDR (RDF-Refuse Derived Fuel) on the total amount of incoming waste. Primary strength consist in better quality CDR (RDF-Refuse Derived Fuel) obtained by eliminating most of the problems related to the waste refining process subsequent phase, with the possibility of adopting bio-dried material refining techniques and technologies, not usable for wet waste, with the same yields...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: The Environment Agency has {{commissioned}} a brief technical review of leachate recirculation, including {{a survey of}} current practice and experiences in the UK. A framework identifying technical, environmental and operational issues has been prepared, and a survey conducted of six major UK <b>landfill</b> companies, <b>covering</b> ~ 90 <b>landfills.</b> Recirculation is widely practised, utilizing {{a wide range of}} infrastructure designs. There is a high level of interest among UK operators, with seasonal flow balancing and stimulation of gas being the most common drivers. Quantities are typically in the range 5, 000 to 20, 000 m 3 /a. The main environmental issues appear to be odour from some systems, filling up of gas wells, and surface outbreaks. The main operational issue is clogging. More monitoring is needed to assess performance...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to analyze Cache County for {{potential}} sanitary <b>landfill</b> sites <b>covering</b> the period 2020 to 2120. The county population and per capita solid waste were estimated. The minimum landfill size was then calculated. A geographic information system (GIS) was used for data storage and vii analysis. Relevant data were gathered. Areas which would not support a landfill were eliminated. Remaining sites were rated as having slight, moderate, or severe restrictions for use as an area method sanitary landfill based on the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) Sanitary Facility Report, and the NRCS Soil Interpretations Rating Guide. Seventeen sites were designated as sites for further evaluation. A landfill ranking system giving a primary and/or secondary rating to data items was developed.

50|$|Bowers Landfill, {{also known}} as Island Road Landfill, is a former privately owned <b>landfill</b> site <b>covering</b> 12 acres near Circleville, Ohio, on the Scioto River floodplain. The site {{operated}} between 1958 and 1968. Initially only domestic refuse was accepted, but from 1963 the site began accepting chemical waste from DuPont and PPG Industries. Waste was either dumped {{on the ground and}} covered with a layer of soil, or incinerated in the open air. Analysis of surface water undertaken by the United States Environmental Protection Agency in 1980 revealed the presence of contaminants and in 1983 the site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) of hazardous waste sites eligible for long-term remedial action (cleanup) financed under the federal Superfund program. The cleanup was completed in 1993, and the site was removed from the NPL in 1997, but remains subject to review at 5-year intervals.|$|R
50|$|Waste {{diversion}} or landfill diversion is {{the process}} of diverting waste from landfills. The success of landfill diversion can be measured by comparison {{of the size of the}} landfill from one year to the next. If the landfill grows minimally or remains the same, then policies <b>covering</b> <b>landfill</b> diversion are successful. For example, currently in the United States there are 3000 landfills. A measure of the success of landfill diversion would be if that number remains the same or is reduced. In 2009, it was recorded that the national average of landfill diversion in the United States was 33.8%, while San Francisco had implemented the most effective policies and had recorded a landfill diversion rate of 77%. By diverting landfills we can preserve our natural resources.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Technical Instruction on Municipal Waste (TASi), the Waste Storage Ordinance (AbfAbIV), the EU Landfill Directive through the Landfill Ordinance (DepV) will drastically change the quantities of municipal waste both to be disposed of and to be landfilled, with the latter being especially affected by pretreatment methods. In addition, the closure of non-compliant landfills in the years 2005 and 2009 will have significant impacts on landfill inventories, which will consequently give rise to price structure changes in the associated waste management sectors. The report contains {{an evaluation of the}} inventory of class-II landfills and future capacity requirements in the 2000 - 2005 - 2009 time period. It also includes an evaluation of possible financial gaps in the reserve funds amassed for various types of landfills. Additionally, concepts to optimise the economics of waste management (landfill networks, for example) were developed.

40|$|Landfills have {{historically}} been seen as the ultimate solution for storing waste at minimum cost. It is now a well-established fact however that such deposits have related implications such as long-term methane emissions, local pollution concerns and limitations on urban development. Landfill mining has been suggested as a strategy to address such resource and pollution problems and in principle means the excavation, processing, treatment and/or recycling of deposited materials. This study involves a literature review on <b>landfill</b> mining <b>covering</b> an analysis of trends, objectives and research topics in 39 papers published during the period 1988 – 2008. The results show that so far landfill mining has primarily {{been seen as a}} way to solve traditional waste management issues such as lack of landfill space or facilitation of final closure and remediation of waste deposits. Although most initiatives also have involved some effort to recover deposited resources (primarily cover soil material), such constituents have been largely secondary. Typically, simple soil excavation and screening equipment have therefore been applied, often demonstrating moderate performance in obtaining marketable recyclables. Several worldwide changes and recent research findings however indicate {{the emergence of a new}} perspective on landfills as future reservoirs for resource extraction. Although the potential of this approach appears gigantic, it is argued that facilitating implementation also involves a number of challenges in terms of technology innovation, concepts for realization and frameworks for evaluating economic and environmental performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an S/S treatment {{which is based}} on the principles of High Performance Concrete (HPC). By using superplasticizers and hydrophobic additives, the proposed process allows the transformation of contaminated soils and sediments into low water to cement ratio (W/C) granular materials. These grains are characterized by lower porosity, lower leaching rate of inorganic contaminants and lower water absorption as well as higher mechanical properties and improved durability compared to solidified products obtained without additives. Moreover, the mixing water may be reduced more than 25 %. The results of X-ray microtomography and mercury intrusion porosimetry measurements carried out on samples prepared with and without additives are illustrated here. Volatile and/or semi-volatile organic pollutants, if present, can be removed from the granular material by a steam distillation step, at relatively low temperature (max 250 °C) and under vacuum (P < 0. 1 bar) in excellent yield. The resulting aggregates are suitable for the re-utilization as backfilling, concrete aggregates or may be employed for <b>covering</b> <b>landfills</b> and in other civil engineering projects...|$|R
5000|$|In 1961, Maricopa County began {{operating}} a <b>landfill</b> in Hassayampa, <b>covering</b> 47 acres {{on the west}} side of the Hassayampa River. For an 18 month period from April 20, 1979 to October 28, 1980, the site was used to dispose of hazardous waste. As a result, the 10 acre portion of the landfill was classified as a Superfund site in 1987. Site cleanup and monitoring is ongoing, and is funded by the Hassayampa Steering Committee, which consists of 12 of the major parties responsible for disposing of the hazardous waste at the site (as well as the owner of the site during the disposal time): Maricopa County (owner), Bull, DEC, Honeywell, Alcatel, General Instrument, AT&T, Shell, Arizona Public Service Co., Intel, National Can, and Reynolds Metals. In addition, the consent decree which established the settlement is notable for the financial participation of over 70 minor parties, [...] "de minimis parties", who are required to reimburse the 12 major dumpers. Their financial commitment is based on the volumetric share of the waste each sent to the dump. It is the first time in history that an EPA settlement included de minimis party participation.|$|R
40|$|Wood ash is a {{high quality}} waste that is {{generated}} by thermal utilization of fresh and waste wood. The material is too valuable to waste it. Ashes are often found unsuitable for disposal at landfills or for direct application due to their dusty consistency, high content of soluble substances and unburned carbon or their alkalinity.

These processes are: spontaneous or forced carbonization, granulation, preparation of artificial soil or their integration into other complementary waste like compost and digestate sewage sludge. Options of handling wood ashes are represented in this study. At first the treatment of waste wood ashes in Slovenia and Europe is presented. In the experimental part an attempt to integrate different portions of wood ashes into compost and dehydrated sewage sludge is studied, to get a stabilized product.

40|$|Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) {{landfills}} {{have been}} identified {{as one of the most}} important sources of methane (CH 4) emission. MSW contains a certain amount of biodegradable organic matter which undergoes anaerobic degradation resulting in the production of the landfill gas (LFG), which main component is tipically represented by CH 4. In order to minimise its negative effects on the envi-ronment, LFG recovery is a suitable tool to control CH 4 emissions from a landfill site and the measurement of CH 4 emissions represents a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of LFG recover-ing system in reducing biogas emission to the atmosphere. However, up to now few measurements of landfill CH 4 emissions have been reported, due to the heterogeneity of waste composition and temporarily <b>landfill</b> surface <b>covering</b> which give as a result high spatial variability of the LFG emis-sion from the landfill surface. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate CH 4 diffuse emis-sions, based on direct measurements carried out at Palermo (IT) landfill by means of a flux accumu-lation chamber coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID). The field campaign was carried out over a period of two years, and it was split into several experimental phases, performed in different seasons, in order to evaluate the influence that specific landfill features have on CH 4 emissions, as well as to understand the influence exterted by meteorological conditions during the field cam-paigns. Through the use of a geostatistic methodology, the instantaneous CH 4 fluxes from the land-fill surface have been used to obtain the total amount of methane emitted from the investigated area as well as the methane flux maps. Such emissions were further compared with the estimate achieved by means of CH 4 mass balance equations. The obtained results showed that a relationship between the local CH 4 emissions and some specific features of landfill can be established, and that the emis-sions obtained by applying the flux accumulation chamber method are in good agreement with the ones derived by the application of mass balance equations, also suggesting that the contoured flux maps represent a reliable tool to locate areas with abnormal emission in order to improve the gas re-covery system efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Wood ash is a {{high quality}} waste that is {{generated}} by thermal utilization of fresh and waste wood. The material is too valuable to waste it. Ashes are often found unsuitable for disposal at landfills or for direct application due to their fine powder consistency, high content of soluble substances, unburned carbon fraction or their high alkalinity. With relatively simple procedures they can be processed to a form suitable for utilization or disposal. These processes are: spontaneous or forced carbonization, granulation, preparation of artificial soil or their integration into other complementary waste like compost and sewage sludge.

40|$|In landfills, {{anaerobic}} biodegradation of solid wastes by methanogens {{is responsible for}} about 19 % of the anthropogenic CH[subscript 4] - {{one of the most}} important greenhouse gases - introduced into the atmosphere each year. Among design advances to reduce CH[subscript 4] emissions, gas collection systems have greatly reduced the environmental impacts of new landfills and are now mandatory in most parts of the world. However, installation of a gas collection system in small or old landfills with low CH[subscript 4] production is not economically feasible and in new landfills, gas collection systems are not 100 % efficient. This means that there will always be a certain amount of fugitive emissions. Therefore, any technology or approach that could help reducing atmospheric emissions of CH[subscript 4] from landfills - old or new - will be of great importance in connection with the atmospheric CH[subscript 4] budget. Proper use of techniques pertaining to the fields of geoenvironmental engineering and biotechnology can optimize the methane oxidation process within the landfill cover soil. More precisely, <b>covering</b> <b>landfills</b> using materials that might offer promising conditions to the development of methane oxidation bacteria or methanotrophs would be the equivalent of installing an immense biofilter above the waste mass, here referred to as a passive methane oxidation biocover (PMOB). PMOB efficiency depends on geotechnical soil conditions including the type of soil and porosity. Substrates must have a suitable pore volume to ensure the satisfactory supply of oxygen and methane as well as an adequate retention time for methane within the substrate. Substrate must also have a minimum of organic matter content and provide a satisfactory supply in nutrients that are essential prerequisites for the build-up of methanotrophic biomass. Natural CH[subscript 4] oxidation by methanotrophs, which have been isolated and characterized for a variety of soils, provides an important biological sink for both the atmospheric and the CH[subscript 4] that migrates through the landfill-cover soil. With the long-term goal of developing engineered top covers to optimize CH[subscript 4] abatement, 3 passive methane oxidation biocovers (PMOB) were built within the existing final cover of the St-Nicéphore MSW landfill, Quebec, Canada. As part of the main goals of this field experiment, we followed dynamics and changes in the potential activity and community structure of methanotrophs as a function of time and depth in two different materials: the substrate of one of the PMOBs (mix of compost and sand) and a reference soil (RS), i. e. the existing top cover (silt). The MPN and Q-PCR method was used for methanotrophs counts, while diversity was assessed by means of the DGGE fingerprinting method, and potential CH[subscript 4] oxidation was determined with soil microcosms. Over the monitoring period, changes in the number of methanotrophic bacteria in this PMOB exhibited different development phases: the first phase is an adaptation phases (3 months), in the second it is the actual growth phases and in third we characterise by a decline phases, because of temperature decline in December. The maximum of viable and culturable méthanotrophes were 1. 5 x 10 [superscript 9] Cells g dw[superscript - 1] (1. 7 « 3. 0 x 10 [superscript 8] Cells g dw[superscript - 1]) and 500 target of pmoA g dw[superscript - 1]. Methanotrophes counts show important variations with depth, while no observable change over time occurred in methanotroph number in the RS. Methanotrophs diversity revealed an overall dominance of Type I methanotrophs (especially genus Methylocaldum and Methylobacter) in both substrate and RS. As expected, the potential methane oxidation was higher in the PMOB substrate than in the RS. The maximum of potential rates were, respectively, 441. 1 and 76. 0 [micro]g CH[subscript 4] h[superscript - 1] g dw[superscript - 1]...|$|R
