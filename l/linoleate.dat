Each particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein that has 4536 amino acid residues and a mass of 514 kDa), along with 80 to 100 additional ancillary proteins. Each LDL has a highly hydrophobic core consisting of polyunsaturated fatty acid known as <b>linoleate</b> and hundreds to thousands (about 1500 commonly cited as an average) esterified and unesterified cholesterol molecules. This core also carries varying numbers of triglycerides and other fats and {{is surrounded by a}} shell of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol, as well as the single copy of Apo B-100. LDL particles are approximately 22nm (0.00000087in.) to 27.5nm in diameter and have a mass of about 3 million daltons. Since LDL particles contain a variable and changing number of fatty acid molecules, there is a distribution of LDL particle mass and size. Determining the structure of LDL has been a tough task because of its heterogeneous structure. The structure of LDL at human body temperature in native condition, with a resolution of about 16 Angstroms using cryo-electron microscopy, has been recently described.|$|E

2500|$|In mammals the aerobic {{desaturation}} is catalyzed by {{a complex}} of three membrane-bound enzymes (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase, cytochrome b5, and a desaturase).

The present study focused on the relative susceptibilities of <b>linoleates</b> and cholesterol in Jurkat cells under oxidative stress induced by selenium deficiency and free radical insult, as assessed by total hydroxyoctadecadienoic acids (tHODE) and total 7 -hydroxycholesterol (t 7 -OHCh) measured after reduction and saponification. It was observed that the levels of tHODE and t 7 -OHCh significantly increased by both oxidative insults. The increased amounts of t 7 -OHCh were higher than those of tHODE in both selenium-deficient and free radical-treated cells.

40|$|The net {{removal of}} two {{adjacent}} (vicinal) hydrogen atoms from an alkane {{to produce an}} alkene is a fundamental process of long-standing interest 1, 2 that is critical to, for example, lipid and terpene biosynthesis. Desaturases (and acetylenases) are adept at achieving this essential, often ubiquitous, oxidative functionalization [e. g., biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids 3 (oleates, <b>linoleates,</b> etc.), eicosanoids (leukotrienes, arachadonic acid, etc.), gibberellins 4, and carotenoids 5]. More broadly, alkane to alkene conversion always involves one or more chemical intermediates in a multistep reaction pathway. These may be either isolable species (such as alcohols or alkyl halides) or reactive intermediates (such as carbocations, alkyl radicals, or σ-alkyl-metal species). Here we report a desaturation reaction of simple, unactivated alkanes that is mechanistically unique. We show that benzynes are capable of simultaneous (i. e., concerted), bimolecular removal of two vicinal hydrogen atoms from a hydrocarbon. The discovery of this exothermic, net redox process (benzyne reduction and alkane oxidation) was enabled by the simple thermal generation of reactive benzyne intermediates through the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder cycloisomerization reaction of triyne substrates 6.

40|$|International audienceThe {{reaction}} of sunflower oil with selenite produces a complex mixture of selenitriglycerides with antioxidant and anticancer properties. To obtain {{insight into the}} identity and characteristics of the species formed, an analytical approach based on the combination of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with 78 Se-specific selenium detection by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS) and high-resolution (100   000), high mass accuracy (< 1 ppm) molecule-specific detection by electrospray–Orbitrap MS 3 was developed. For the first time, a non-aqueous mobile phase gradient was used in reversed-phase HPLC–ICP MS for the separation of a complex mixture of selenospecies and a mathematical correction of the background signal was developed. The identical chromatographic conditions served for the sample introduction into electrospray MS. Two types of samples were analyzed: sunflower oil dissolved in isopropanol and methanol extract of the oil containing 65 % selenium. HPLC–ICP MS showed 14 peaks, 11 of which could also be detected in the methanol extract. Isotopic patterns corresponding to molecules {{with one or two}} selenium atoms could be attributed by Orbitrap MS at the retention times corresponding to the HPLC–ICP MS peak apexes. Structural data for these species were acquired by MS 2 and MS 3 fragmentation of protonated or sodiated ions using high-energy collisional dissociation (HCD). A total of 11 selenium-containing triglycerol derivatives resulting from the oxidation of one or two double bonds of linoleic acid and analogous derivatives of glycerol-mixed <b>linoleate(s)</b> /oleinate(s) have been identified for the first time. The presence of these species was confirmed by the targeted analysis in the total oil isopropanol solution. Their identification corroborated the predicted elution order in reversed-phase chromatography: LLL (glycerol trilinoleate), LLO (glycerol dilinoleate–oleinate), LOO (glycerol linoleate–dioleinate), OOO (glycerol trioleinate), of which the extrapolation allowed for the prediction of the identity [glycerol dioleinate–stearate (OOS) and glycerol oleinate–distearate (OSS) ] of the nonpolar species detected by ICP MS in the oil but not detected by electrospray MS...|$|R
