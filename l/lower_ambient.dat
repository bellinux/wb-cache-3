2500|$|Though it {{does not}} enter torpor, E. wahlbergi is heterothermic, {{lowering}} its core body temperature while roosting. [...] In winter, this heterothermy is more pronounced. [...] Portions of the geographic range of E. wahlbergi incur the largest seasonal temperature variations of the entire Afrotropical region. [...] Metabolic rates increase up to 30% during the winter as compared to summer, allowing individuals to overcome heat loss in <b>lower</b> <b>ambient</b> temperatures. [...] Body mass also increases in winter. [...] An individual's thermoneutral zone may also be broader in the winter than in the summer, allowing a greater temperature tolerance and thus decreasing energy expenditure typically used to compensate for minor changes in core body temperature. [...] In times of heat stress, excessive salivation, wing fanning, body licking, and panting help to lower body temperature. [...] Some individuals are intolerant of extreme heat and die at temperatures greater than 40°C (104°F).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Green Roofs offers {{numerous}} advantages, including <b>lowering</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature, {{which is}} of increasing interest due to global warming concerns. However, there are technical problems pertaining to waterproofing to be resolved. Currently, the only recognized green roof waterproofing test is the German standard FLL. This paper examines the potential of replicating the test in tropical climate and reducing the test duration by using pre-grown plants. A three year old sample and a new setup were used for this experimental study. The new setup was prepared with close reference to the FLL standards and was compared against the three year old sample. Results showed that the waterproofing membrane was damaged by plant roots in both setups. Joints integrity was also challenged.

50|$|Born in Alton, Illinois, Jerde was a {{graduate}} of the School of Architecture at the University of Southern California. After early years working at Charles Kober Associates on multiple retail projects, including Plaza Pasadena, Jerde was commissioned by developer Ernie Hahn to design Horton Plaza, across from Horton Plaza Park in downtown San Diego. The project is a five story outdoor retail complex, with the main passage being diagonally oriented to the street grid and at the time anchored by Nordstrom, Macy's, and a Sam Goody music store; and connected to a Westin Hotel and the Balboa Theatre, resulting in an urban mixed-use center. It features long one-way ramps and sudden drop-offs, parapets, shadowy colonnades and cul-de-sacs. Its design breaks many traditional mall-design rules such as <b>lowering</b> <b>ambient</b> arousal levels and protecting the maximal lines-of-sight to merchandise. Its fragmented spaces are finished in a variety of bright colors. The project was completed in 1985.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose was}} to study {{potential}} age ‐ related changes in the circulatory system via heart rate variability (HRV) by gradually <b>lowering</b> <b>ambient</b> temperature (0. 2 °C/min) from thermoneutral (32 C°) towards cold (18 C°). ECG was recorded from a young (31 years) and from an older subject (78 years), both males. During the tests, brachium blood pressure (BP) was recorded. During the cooling, BP increased in both subjects (young from 95 / 69 to 132 / 75 mmHg, old from 125 / 68 to 176 / 101 mmHg), the latter exhibiting a prominent rise in diastolic values after cooling. HRV parameters increased in both subjects during the cold exposure being modest in the younger subject {{as compared to the}} older one. Also, recovery from the cold in terms of HRV was faster in the younger subject.

40|$|SummaryIncreased {{adipose tissue}} {{lipogenesis}} {{is associated with}} enhanced insulin sensitivity. Mice overexpressing the Glut 4 glucose transporter in adipocytes have elevated lipogenesis and increased glucose tolerance despite being obese with elevated circulating fatty acids. Lipidomic analysis of adipose tissue revealed the existence of branched fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFAs) that were elevated 16 - to 18 -fold in these mice. FAHFA isomers differ by the branched ester position on the hydroxy fatty acid (e. g., palmitic-acid- 9 -hydroxy-stearic-acid, 9 -PAHSA). PAHSAs are synthesized in vivo and regulated by fasting and high-fat feeding. PAHSA levels correlate highly with insulin sensitivity and are reduced in adipose tissue and serum of insulin-resistant humans. PAHSA administration in mice <b>lowers</b> <b>ambient</b> glycemia and improves glucose tolerance while stimulating GLP- 1 and insulin secretion. PAHSAs also reduce adipose tissue inflammation. In adipocytes, PAHSAs signal through GPR 120 to enhance insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Thus, FAHFAs are endogenous lipids {{with the potential to}} treat type 2 diabetes...|$|R

The resulting altimeter readings are known as flight levels.|$|E
