25|$|The initial {{focus of}} the library project was on {{upgrading}} the existing building. When the second floor was built {{on top of the}} library in the early 1970s, it initially housed the Council Area Office, though it was conceived even then that it would eventually be used as library space. However, investigations in 1999 by engineers revealed that the second <b>level</b> <b>floor</b> was too weak to support the weight of books without significant strengthening, which would be expensive to undertake. As well, the existing building was showing increasing signs of deterioration, most significantly a leaking ceiling. While it could be repaired, long-term maintenance would negate the short-term cost advantage of doing so. Thus, the option of a completely new building was brought under consideration.|$|E
25|$|The major {{refurbishment}} presented {{an opportunity to}} add to the infrastructure of the venue to make the process of ‘get-in’ and ‘get-out’ in a single day easier, and {{to add to the}} flexibility of the venue. Theatre consultants Carr & Angier worked with ISG Interior Exterior and Stage Technologies to create a new working space over the stage area with four large movable lighting bridges, capable of load sharing to lift large touring productions without the need for custom rigging. Delstar Engineering supplied eleven lifts to form the stage platform. These allow the stage layout to be reconfigured in many ways to suit the nature of the performance taking place. The choir benches can now be wheeled out to provide a <b>level</b> <b>floor</b> for staged and dance performances. The space between seat rows has been extended by 75mm by rebuilding the concrete floor of the stalls, with a loss of only 118 seats. Cooling has been introduced by reversing the airflow in the auditorium.|$|E

25|$|The building's {{lower level}} has been {{historically}} used for commercial purposes. As a corner lot, {{the first floor}} L-elevation has one square-shaped volume facing west towards Paseo Atocha, while the other two commercial spaces occupy the longitudinal axis that runs east-to-west along Castillo Street. The commercial spaces are of different sizes. In all three sections, the original floors were replaced with native tiles, product of an early 20th century intervention. The 12-foot high ceiling in the square-shaped section is covered with pressed tin panels, a decorative addition very frequently used during the 1920s among the upper class' residences and social/civic buildings in different cities in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the 17-foot high ceiling {{in the other two}} commercial areas have kept the original exposed ausubo (manilkara bidentata tree) beams, sustaining the pichipen rafters, which support three layers of thin bricks that make-up the foundation for the upper <b>level</b> <b>floor.</b> Throughout the entire first floor's interior, the stucco has been removed, leaving the brick walls completely exposed. Each commercial section has its own service room. The 110 feet 5 inches long longitudinal elevation that faces Castillo Street has a very public exposure with four large clear glass windows and an equal number of clear-glass-metal-framed doors. The axis that faces Paseo Atocha has an additional glass door and two large glass windows. All three spaces at the first floor have access to a narrow backyard limited by a seven-foot high brick and masonry wall, which runs east-to-west, and separates the commercial space, physically and visually, from a large open garden-like interior patio only accessible to the upper-level residents. The Castillo Street axis has, on its eastern end, an arched wooden gate, that provide access to the cochera (carport), which by the time Casa Vives was built in the 1860s, served to properly house the family's horse stagecoach, and later, during the early twentieth century, housed the Ford's model T's and Model A's.|$|E

Pflueger gained ideas from the ship's famous Art Deco adornments. Magnin and Pflueger went to Venice and Milan as well, but found very little of use to them on their short European trip. The $3million I. Magnin store on Wilshire (currently the Wilshire Galleria) opened in Los Angeles on February 10, 1939 with an interior completely devoted to Pflueger's concept of luxuriously separate boutique spaces within which individual sales items would receive unique attention. Pflueger's interior was attuned to women's fashions: the ground <b>level</b> <b>floor</b> was laid with rose-beige marble from France, pink velvet counter tops held gloves for trying on, rose-beige leather panels covered {{the walls of the}} shoe salon and the same leather served as covering for sofas and chairs that were provided by Neel D. Parker, interior designer and Pflueger's fellow club member from The Family. Grover Magnin continued to work with Pflueger on three more stores into the 1940s.|$|E

40|$|In Hong Kong, {{approximately}} {{one million people}} are affected by severe road traffic noise. It is crucial to estimate the vertical distribution of traffic noise levels at different levels in high-rise buildings during the planning and design stages for new residential buildings. The Calculation of Road Traffic Noise (CRTN) has been adopted in Hong Kong to estimate traffic noise from the road. However, there have been criticisms of the CRTN model?s accuracy and suitability for predicting road traffic noise in Hong Kong. This study examines and evaluates {{the accuracy of the}} CRTN method in predicting the vertical distribution of traffic noise level LA 10 at different <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> of a 20 -storey residential building in Hong Kong. Also, measurements have been conducted of the traffic noise <b>levels</b> at each <b>floor</b> <b>level</b> of the building. Both the predicted and measured LA 10 show a similar trend: the higher the <b>floor</b> <b>level,</b> the lower the traffic noise levels. However, the predicted LA 10 at the building façade has a tendency of overestimation, especially at the higher <b>floor</b> <b>levels,</b> with a mean difference of + 2. 0 dBA between the predicted and measured results. A correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 9331 between the predicted and the measured LA 10 indicates that the predicted levels correlate closely with the measured levels. The CRTN is therefore a useful tool in predicting traffic noise <b>levels</b> at different <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> during the building planning stage. Practical application: This study provides an evaluation of the accuracy of the CRTN method in predicting the vertical distribution of traffic noise <b>level</b> at different <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> of a residential building. It suggests that the CRTN is a useful tool in predicting traffic noise <b>levels</b> at different <b>floor</b> <b>levels</b> during the building planning stage.
