40|$|The {{influence}} of the type and size of solid particles on their emptying from the stomach was studied using isotopically <b>labelled</b> <b>chicken</b> liver and inert particles in normal subjects and in patients who had undergone gastric surgery. In normal subjects, initial emptying of the liver was slower than that of inert particles both for large liver cubes (1 cm) and small cubes (0. 3 cm). Liver emptying subsequently accelerated to be faster than emptying of the inert particles. Overall emptying of the liver given as small cubes was faster than large cubes; 50 % emptied in 50 minutes and 70 minutes respectively. In the postoperative subjects, emptying of the liver and of the inert particles was identical. The {{findings are consistent with}} the hypothesis that solid foods such as liver are ground down and 'liquified' by the action of gastric peristalsis before being discharged to the duodenum. Ingested particle size appears to influence the rapidity of this process, which should be distinguished from the propulsive function of the stomach where small solid particles are concerned...|$|R

An impaired cellular response to Candida albicans was found in all patients by the cytotoxicity test, using specifically activated lymphocytes which were reacted against 51 Cr <b>labelled</b> <b>chicken</b> red cells. Migration of guinea-pig macrophages was not inhibited by supernatants from stimulated leucocyte cultures in eleven out of twelve patients and similar results were found when these patients were skin tested for delayed hypersensitivity.

Responses to unrelated antigens, such as PPD and Herpesvirus hominis Type 1 were also impaired in some patients but {{to a lesser extent}} than to Candida albicans. It is suggested that chronic muco-cutaneous candidosis shows a spectrum of increasing cell-mediated immunodeficiencies which can be ranked into six grades. Chronic oral candidosis has a limited cellular immune defect (Grades A, B and C) whereas in the muco-cutaneous candidosis a more severe immunodeficiency is found (Grades D, E and F).

40|$|Bovine {{mononuclear}} {{cells in}} the presence of bovine anti-chicken erythrocyte sera at high dilutions induce release of chromium- 51 from <b>labeled</b> <b>chicken</b> erythrocytes. Bovine effector cells are capable of recognizing both bovine immunoglobulin G 1 and bovine immunoglobulin G 2; in contrast, human effector cells only recognize immunoglobulin G 1. Effector cell activity of bovine mononuclear cells is equally distributed between peripheral blood and spleen. As in other species, thymus and lymph node cells exert no antibody-dependent effect, although some direct cytotoxicity by lymph node cells may be observed. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a bovine cell line can also be detected. By using a tannic acid technique, it was found that chicken erythrocytes coated with Theileria parva piroplasm antigen or with Trypanosoma rhodesiense variant-specific coat antigen form suitable targets for bovine antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays. By using such targets, a moderate degree of direct cytotoxicity by bovine mononuclear cells, in the absence of antibody, is always observed; this may be reduced by choosing optimal conditions of tannic acid treatment and antigen sensitization and by the use of short incubation periods for the cytotoxicity assay. Observations have been made on the variant specificity, time course of appearance, and association with immunoglobulin G 1 of the antibody activity responsible for cell-dependent cytotoxicity against chicken erythrocytes coated with T. rhodesiense antigens. The potential usefulness of this technique in the analysis of protective immune responses against protozoal infections is discussed...|$|R

It is important to monitor water sources {{in order to maintain}} the quality of our drinking water and to avoid disease outbreaks. Targeting Escherichia coli as a faecal indicator is a widely used procedure, but the current methods are time consuming and not adequate to prevent spreading of faecal influence.   This Master thesis demonstrates the development of a near infrared fluorescence flow cytometer sensor system targeting Escherichia coli, using fluorescently <b>labeled</b> <b>chicken</b> IgY antibodies. The near infrared light was chosen to avoid fluorescence from blue-green algae that are present in the water source.   The hardware was developed with a 785   nm laser line to detect Alexa Fluor 790 labeled antibodies, using a photomultiplier tube or two different CMOS cameras. The antibodies were labeled using a commercial labeling kit, and evaluated using antibody binding assays and the developed hardware.   The IgY antibodies were successfully labeled with Alexa Fluor 790 and the function was maintained after the labeling process. The result demonstrates the principles of the sensor system and how it solved to the problem with fluorescence from blue-green algae. An aperture was used to overcome the suboptimal laser and filter setup, and to increase the sensitivity of the system. However, only a small fraction of the cells could be detected, due to challenges with the focal depth and loss of sensitivity in the photomultiplier tube at near infrared wavelengths. Further development is required to create a working product...|$|R

Whether {{the presence or absence}} of symptoms of upper gastrointestinal dysfunction correlated with objective measures of gastric emptying in insulin dependent diabetic subjects was investigated. Twenty one insulin dependent diabetic patients underwent a solid phase gastric emptying scintiscan using in vivo <b>labelled</b> <b>chicken</b> liver. Thirteen patients had symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal dysfunction (nausea, vomiting, early satiety, or constipation), while eight patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Eleven patients had orthostatic hypotension. All patients had been diabetic since childhood or adolescence. As a group, the diabetic patients showed a half time (T 50) of gastric emptying (mean (SD) 150. 0 min (163. 7) that was not significantly different from that of 12 healthy control subjects (148. 1 min (62. 4)). Those diabetic patients without gastrointestinal symptoms and without orthostatic hypotension, however, showed a gastric emptying half time (70. 1 min (41. 6)) that was significantly faster than that of the control subjects. Conversely, those diabetic patients with nausea, vomiting, and early satiety (or early satiety alone) showed T 50 values that were significantly greater than those of the diabetic patients without these symptoms. No correlation was found between the T 50 value and the duration of diabetes, the fasting blood glucose at the time of study, or the respiratory variation in heart rate (E:I ratio). These observations indicate that highly variable rates of gastric emptying occur in insulin dependent diabetic patients, and that accelerated gastric emptying may occur in diabetic patients who have no symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of a lag phase during the gastric emptying of solid foods is controversial. It has been hypothesised that among other early events, the stomach requires {{a period of time}} to process solid food to particles small enough to be handled as a liquid. At present no standardised curve fitting techniques exist for the characterisation and quantification of the lag phase or the emptying rate of solids and liquids. We have evaluated the ability of a modified power exponential function to define the emptying parameters of two different solid meals. Dual labelled meals were administered to 24 normal volunteers. The subjects received meals consisting of either Tc- 99 m in vivo <b>labelled</b> <b>chicken</b> liver or Tc- 99 m-egg, which have different densities, and In- 111 -DTPA in water. The emptying curves were biphasic in nature. For solids, this represented an initial delay in emptying or lag phase followed by an equilibrium emptying phase characterised by a constant rate of emptying. The curves were analysed using a modified power exponential function of the form y(t) = 1 -(1 -e-kt) beta, where y(t) is the fractional meal retention at time t, k is the gastric emptying rate in min- 1, and beta is the extrapolated y-intercept from the terminal portion of the curve. The length of the lag phase and half-emptying time increased with solid food density (31 +/- 8 min and 77. 6 +/- 11. 2 min for egg and 62 +/- 16 min and 94. 1 +/- 14. 2 min for chicken liver, respectively). After the lag phase, both solids had similar emptying rates, and these rates were identical to those of the liquids. In vitro experiments indicated that the egg meal disintegrated much more rapidly than the chicken liver under mechanical agitation in gastric juice, lending further support to the hypothesis that the initial lag in emptying of solid food is due to the processing of food into particles small enough to pass the pylorus. We conclude that the modified power exponential model permits characterisation of the biphasic nature of gastric emptying allowing for quantification of the lag phase and the rate of emptying for both solids and liquids...|$|R

40|$|The chicken {{brain is}} more than twice as big as the bobwhite quail brain in adulthood. To {{determine}} how this species difference in brain size emerges during development, we examined whether differences in neurogenesis timing or cell cycle rates account for the disparity in brain size between chickens and quail. Specifically, we examined the timing of neural events (e. g. neurogenesis onset) from Nissl-stained sections of chicken and quail embryos. We estimated brain cell cycle rates using cumulative bromodeoxyuridine <b>labelling</b> in <b>chickens</b> and quail at embryonic day (ED) 2 and at ED 5. We report that the timing of neural events is highly conserved between chickens and quail, once time is expressed as a percentage of overall incubation period. In absolute time, neurogenesis begins earlier in chickens than in quail. Therefore, neural event timing cannot account for the expansion of the chicken brain relative to the quail brain. Cell cycle rates are also similar between the two species at ED 5. However, at ED 2, before neurogenesis onset, brain cells cycle faster in chickens than in quail. These data indicate that chickens have a larger brain than bobwhite quail mainly because of species differences in cell cycle rates during early stages of embryonic development...|$|R

40|$|The rate of {{disappearance}} of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the circulation {{is an important}} parameter in studying {{the dynamics of the}} hormone and in interpreting the significance of both circulating and pituitary hormonal levels. This rate is most frequently expressed in terms of the half-life of LH in the circulation (see Parlow, 1968). The estimation of the half-life of circulating LH in birds has been made feasible by the availability of purified chicken gonadotrophins (Stockell Hartree & Cunning-ham, 1969; Scanes & Follett, 1972), together with a radioimmunoassay for avian LH(Follett, Scanes & Cunningham, 1972). The half-life of LH in the domestic fowl was determined by following the dis=req- appearance ofeither unlabelledLH or 125 I-labelled LH from the circulation of the bird. In the case of the <b>labelled</b> hormone, a <b>chicken</b> LH fraction of high ovarian ascorbic acid depleting activity and low thyrotrophin content (fraction AEI, Scanes & Follett, 1972) was labelled with Na 125 I by the method of Greenwood, Hunter & Glover (1963) and the iodinated hormone was separated from free iodine by adsorption chromato¬ graphy on Whatman CF 11 grade cellulose (Hunter, Willoughby & Strong, 1968). The birds were given single injections of either 25 ng labelled hormone (mean sp. act...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{appendage}} formation {{represents a}} process of regulated new growth. Bromodeoxyuridine <b>labeling</b> of developing <b>chicken</b> skin demonstrated the presence of localized growth zones, which first promote appendage formation and then move within each appendage to produce specific shapes. Initially, cells proliferate all over the presumptive skin. During the placode stage they are organized to form periodic rings. At the short feather bud stage, the localized growth zones shifted to the posterior and then the distal bud. During the long bud stage, the localized growth zones descended through the flank region toward the feather collar (equivalent to the hair matrix). During feather branch formation, the localized growth zones were positioned periodically in the basilar layer to enhance branching of barb ridges. Wnts were expressed in a dynamic fashion during feather morphogenesis that coincided with the shifting localized growth zones positions. The expression pattern of Wnt 6 was examined and compared {{with other members of}} the Wnt pathway. Early in feather development Wnt 6 expression overlapped with the location of the localized growth zones. Its function was tested through misexpression studies. Ectopic Wnt 6 expression produced abnormal localized outgrowths from the skin appendages at either the base, the shaft, or the tip of the developing feathers. Later in feather filament morphogenesis, several Wnt markers were expressed in regions undergoing rearrangements and differentiation of barb ridge keratinocytes. These data suggest that skin appendages are built to specific shapes by adding new cells from well-positioned and controlled localized growth zones and that Wnt activity is involved in regulating such localized growth zone activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study the effect of using flour residue from the {{manufacture}} of acerola juice was to evaluate (Malpighia punicifolia) on productive performance, on carcasses and meat characteristics and on the digestive system of pasture raised broiler <b>chickens</b> (<b>Label</b> Rouge). A total 150 males and females birds were distributed in a completely randomized design with three treatments (0, 10 and 20 % acerola meal) and five replicates. The productive performance was assessed by weighing the feed and poultry. After 87 days the birds were slaughtered and their intestinal measured portions and certain the carcass yield and its composition: the percentage of the main cuts of meat, the viscera and abdominal fat. Later carcasses were sampled and analyzed for texture, color and breast samples were collected for sensory analysis. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of 10 % flour acerola to the diet of the birds did not alter the performance parameters, but there was a decrease in carcass yield of birds that consumed the product, tested in two levels of supplementation. The biometric evaluation demonstrated that the use of acerola flour duodenum stimulated the development of the poultry, and consequently, the total length of the intestine. The addition of the acerola flour in the diet of the birds did not affect the color, texture, flavor and appearance of meat. Therefore, despite some negative effects associated with supplementation of acerola meal in the diet of birds, this work can contribute to extend the vision of the producers and suggest alternatives for the production of chicken meat colonial typ...|$|R
40|$|Bioassay and {{immunological}} {{studies have}} detected {{the presence of}} opioid peptides in the nervous system of representatives of all classes of vertebrates. The present study evaluates the expression and localization of preproenkephalin (PPE) mRNA to determine the sites of synthesis of the enkephalin peptides in the adult chicken and pigeon telencephalon using in situ hybridization histochemistry. We used a 500 -base-pair chicken RNA probe corresponding to chicken PPE cDNA. In both the chicken and the pigeon telencephalon, the highest concentration of PPE mRNA-containing cells was observed in the lobus parolfactorius, paleostriatum augmentatum, nucleus accumbens, and septum. Distinct populations of labeled cells were also detected in the hyperstriatum accessorium, hippocampus, area parahippocampalis, nucleus of the diagonal band, cortex dorsolateralis, and cortex piriformis. Differences in PPE mRNA expression between chicken and pigeon were observed in several telencephalic regions. For instance, the bulbus olfactorius was heavily labeled in the pigeon, but was not <b>labeled</b> in the <b>chicken,</b> and numerous PPE mRNA-containing cells {{were present in the}} area parahippocampalis of pigeons but not of chickens. In contrast, in the hyperstriatum dorsale and hyperstriatum ventrale, numerous PPE mRNA-expressing cells were detected in the chicken but not in the pigeon. Overall, PPE mRNA-expressing cells were more numerous than enkephalin-immunoreactive cells described in previous studies. In addition, our results suggest that the general pattern of enkephalin expression in the avian telencephalon is similar to that found in other vertebrates. Finally, {{the results of the present}} study illustrate some differences in the pattern of PPE mRNA distribution between closely related species, indicating the existence of species-specific neurochemical pathways, which may influence and perhaps mediate different behaviors characteristics of these species...|$|R
