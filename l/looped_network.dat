40|$|Hydraulic and hydrologic {{analysis}} in urban catchments is typically {{accompanied by a}} number of uncertainties, such as a lack of required information for modeling purposes or complex loops inside a drainage network. In this article, Gibbs’ stochastic network model is utilized in order to achieve a dendritic network that corresponds to a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> in terms of the peak of the runoff hydrograph at the outlet. A synthetic catchment with a drainage network composed of 8 × 8 grids is introduced to investigate the behavior of a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> for a given rainfall event using the Storm Water Management Model. Dendritic networks are generated from the Gibbsian model for a given value of the parameter, β. The results showed that the shape of the hydrograph and the peak flow of a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> are heavily dependent on the catchment slope. Moreover, the results showed {{that it is possible to}} find the corresponding dendritic networks generated by the Gibbsian model that match the fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> depending on the catchment slope in terms of peak flows. The results of this study imply the potential improvement of drainage network analysis providing a relationship between the catchment slope of a fully <b>looped</b> <b>network</b> and the corresponding dendritic network generated by the Gibbsian model...|$|E

They are widely used in the design of local area networks, multimodule memory organizations, data alignments in parallel memory systems, and supercomputer architecture. In this paper, we give a systematic and unified method of solutions in the design and implementation of these networks. We show that doubly linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks</b> with transmission delay {{less than or equal to}} (1 +ε) √ 3 N can be constructed asymptotically for sufficiently large N, the number of nodes in the network. This is close to the optimal value within a number which is small as compared to N. We then give several infinite classes of values of N for which optimal doubly linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks</b> can be actually designed. The method is then generalized to obtain a new upper bound for possible transmission delays in multiply linked <b>loop</b> <b>networks.</b> Routing and rerouting algorithms are designed for the optimal <b>loop</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
