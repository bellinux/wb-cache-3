5000|$|In semiconductors, {{valence bands}} are well {{characterized}} by 3 Luttinger parameters. At the Г-point {{in the band}} structure, [...] and [...] orbitals form valence bands. But spin-orbit coupling splits sixfold degeneracy into high energy 4-fold and lower energy 2-fold bands. Again 4-fold degeneracy is lifted into heavy- and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> bands by phenomenological Hamiltonian by J. M. Luttinger.|$|E
40|$|Minority carrier {{diffusion}} {{lengths in}} low-doped n-InGaAs using InP/InGaAs double-heterostructures are reported using a simple electrical technique. The contributions from heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> are also extracted using this methodology, including minority carrier mobilities and lifetimes. Heavy holes are shown to initially dominate the transport {{due to their}} higher valence band density of states, but at large diffusion distances, the <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> begin to dominate due to their larger diffusion length. It is found that heavy holes have a diffusion length of 54. 5 +/- 0. 6 microns for an n-InGaAs doping of 8. 4 x 10 ^ 15 cm- 3 at room temperature, whereas <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> have a diffusion length in excess of 140 microns. Heavy holes demonstrate a mobility of 692 +/- 63 cm 2 /Vs and a lifetime of 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 microsec, whereas <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> demonstrate a mobility of 6200 +/- 960 cm- 2 /Vs and a slightly longer lifetime of 2. 6 +/- 1. 0 microsec. The presented method, which is limited to low injection conditions, is capable of accurately resolving minority carrier transport properties. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} semi-classical motion of holes by exact {{numerical}} {{solution of the}} Luttinger model. The trajectories obtained for the heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> agree well with the higher order corrections to the abelian and the non-abelian adiabatic theories in Ref. [1] [S. Murakami et al., Science 301, 1378 (2003) ], respectively. It is found that the hole trajectories contain rapid oscillations reminiscent of the "Zitterbewegung" of relativistic electrons. We also comment on the non-conservation of helicity of the <b>light</b> <b>holes.</b> Comment: 4 pages, 5 fugure...|$|R
40|$|Interband {{photoconductivity}} measurements {{have been}} performed on a "Quasi-Graded-Gap" Superlattice (QGGSL). A number of features, both sharp and broad, are observed in the photoresponse, corresponding to transitions between the quasi-bound states of the superlattice. These features are described by a calculation, within an envelope-function approximation, of the pseudo-stationary states of the QGGSL. It is found that the electrons chiefly tunnel through the barriers in the device via states associated with the X-conduction band minimum of AlAs. The calculation also shows that the emission lines seen in electroluminescence spectra are due to recombinations between electrons and <b>light</b> <b>holes,</b> as the <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> tunnel through the QGGSL much more readily...|$|R

Part of it is the Macocha Gorge, its {{sinkhole}} is about 138.7 meters deep and also the deepest of its kind (<b>light</b> <b>hole</b> type) in Central Europe. It is a popular tourist attraction for casual visitors to the region, in addition to cavers and advanced technical divers.|$|E

It is part of the Punkva Caves and the Punkva River flows through it.The sinkhole is about 138.7 meters deep and also the deepest of its kind (<b>light</b> <b>hole</b> type) in Central Europe.It is a popular tourist attraction for casual visitors to the region, in addition to cavers and advanced technical divers.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} is tiny (35 square meters) and very plain, and when originally built, {{the church had}} only walls and a roof, earth floor and no windows. It has been modified and added {{to a couple of}} times, gaining wooden floor in 1735 and the present windows in 1781. Before that it only had a small <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> (lysglugg). In 1901 its exterior was restored to be as original as possible, but the windows were kept. In 1934-35 the interior was restored, and when removing the inner walls an altar painting was discovered. It was painted directly on the wall. A more advanced restoration took place in the 1990s. The church was raised some 70 centimetres, and the old wooden ground was replaced.|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature optical {{transmission}} spectra of several In(x) Ga(1 -x) /GaAs strained MQWs with x = 0. 13 - 0. 19 and well widths of 85 - 213 A have been measured. The excitonic transitions up to 3 C- 3 H were observed along with steplike structures corresponding to band-to-band transitions, identified as 1 C- 1 L transitions. By fitting experimental {{results to the}} calculations, it is concluded that the <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> are in the GaAs barrier region (type II MQW), and the valence-band offset is determined to be 0. 30. Attention is given to a possible {{system in which the}} transition from type I to type II for <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> might be observed...|$|R
40|$|From flicker-noise data versus {{applied voltage}} and current-voltage {{measurements}} on a p+πp+ planar silicon device at 78 K we calculated Hooge's parameter α for flicker noise {{as a function}} of the electric field strength E 0 applied along the 1, 0, 0 crystallographic direction. We found that α(E 0) decreases with increasing field. For E 0 3 × 104 V/m the following relation holds: α(E 0) = α(0) /[1 + (E 0 /Ecℓ) 2]. Ecℓ is the field where the drift velocity of the <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> is within 10 % of the sound velocity. This particular α(E 0) dependence indicates the connection between α(E 0) and the scattering of <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> by acoustic phonons...|$|R
40|$|Conductivity of p-Si and p-Ge is {{considered}} for the two-band model with due regard for mutual drag of <b>light</b> and heavy <b>holes.</b> It is shown that for small and moderate temperatures this drag significantly diminishes the drift velocity of <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> and, as a result, the whole conductivity of crystal. The drag effect considered here appears also {{in the form of}} non-monotonous dependences of conductivity on temperature and carrier concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structures of}} the zinc-blende GaN/Ga 0. 85 Al 0. 15 N compressively strained superlattices and quantum wells are investigated using a 6 x 6 Hamiltonian model (including the heavy hole, <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> and spin-orbit splitting band). The energy bands, wavefunctions and optical transition matrix elements are calculated. It is found that the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> couples with the spin-orbit splitting state even at the k= 0 point, resulting in the hybrid states. The heavy hole remains a pure heavy hole state at k= 0. The optical transitions from the hybrid valence states to the conduction states {{are determined by the}} transitions of the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> and spin-orbit splitting states to the conduction states. The transitions from the heavy hole, <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> and spin-orbit splitting states to the conduction states obey the selection rule Delta n= 0. The band structures obtained in this work will be valuable in designing GaN/GaAlN based optoelectronic devices. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limite...|$|E
3000|$|In addition, due to {{the high}} tensile strain in the GeNW, the Γ-valley is below the L-valley while the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> band maxima becomes the valence maxima [28]. The bandgap in such a high tensile-strained GeNW will be the {{difference}} between the Γ-valley and the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> band maxima at the Γ-point. Thus, the spatially distributed bandgap as well as the band edge energies at the Γ-point which is k= 0 including conduction band, heavy hole band, and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> band are calculated by eight-band k.p theory [29]. We ignore the quantum effect since it is very weak in our GeNW model with a 40 -nm basal width. The result can be applied to study the electron-hole recombination in the tensile-strained GeNW as well as the mechanism of mobility enhancement. Generally, the electron or hole mobility can be given by μ=e [...]...|$|E

Several transitions are detected showing heavy hole and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> character. The heavy hole transitions are more polarized along the [(- 2) 33] direction whereas the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> ones are more polarized along the [01 (- 1) ] direction. According to the calculation based on an empirical tight binding model, the observed optical anisotropy {{is related to the}} different components of the superlatices valence band wave functions...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{selective}} magneto-luminescence measurements of donor-acceptor pairs in n-type GaAs are discussed. The experimental data are {{compared with the}} calculated energy levels of a hydrogen-like atom in a magnetic field, enabling us to identify {{a large number of}} high angular momentum states of the hydrogen-like impurity in magnetic fields. It is shown that in addition to intra-donor transitions, the spin-flip excitations of donor-acceptor pairs involving heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> can be observed, yielding information about g-factors for heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes.</b> For the pairs with separations smaller than the donor Bohr radius, a strong modification of the SPL spectrum is observed. This effect is discussed in terms of modification of the acceptor ground state induced by the interaction with a neighbouring donor centre...|$|R

Chaotic behavior occurs if the heavy-hole state in the first well is aligned with the light-hole state in the second well under a significant in-plane vector k k.

The means of producing of the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> overpopulation in pure p-Ge samples at low lattice temperatures in strong electric and magnetic fields {{are discussed in}} the report. The overpopulation of <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> subband arises due to accumulation of light holes in the specific regions of the momentum space where the energy of holes is smaller than the optical phonon energy. The results of Monte Carlo simulation of the overpopulation are also presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|The excitonic {{properties}} of cubic ZnS quantum wells in ZnMgS are studied by reflectivity and magneto-optics. A remarkable {{improvement in the}} quality of the samples grown by MBE on Gal? substrates has allowed the observation of heavy and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> exciton transitions with values for the FWHM as narrow as 5 meV The 2 s state of the heavy hole exciton is identified and exciton binding energies as high as 55 meV are deduced, indicating that for quantum wells narrower than 3. 5 nm the exciton-LO phonon scattering can be suppressed. Zeeman splittings; of the order of 10 meV for both the light and heavy hole exciton transitions appear in magneto-reflectivity spectra in magnetic fields up to 54 T. Large <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> exciton g-values of the order of four for all quantum wells are obtained due to the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> being the uppermost valence band in these tensile strained quantum wells.

We found a small tensile strain 0. 107 % in the c-plane separated the heavy hole and <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> bands and makes the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> band jump above the heavy hole band. This effect results in a reduction in the {{acceptor activation energy}} and an increase of hole concentration. The quantitative values of effective mass, mobility and conductivity with different strain are also presented in this work.

40|$|A self-consistent {{electronic}} structure calculation {{based on the}} Luttinger-Kohn model is performed on GaMnAs/GaAs multilayers. The Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor layers {{are assumed to be}} metallic and ferromagnetic. The high Mn concentration (considered as 5 % in our calculation) makes it possible to assume the density of magnetic moments as a continuous distribution, when treating the magnetic interaction between holes and the localized moment on the Mn(++) sites. Our calculation shows the distribution of heavy <b>holes</b> and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> in the structure. A strong spin-polarization is observed, and the charge is concentrated mostly on the GaMnAs layers, due to heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> with their total angular momentum aligned anti-parallel to the average magnetization. The charge and spin distributions are analyzed in terms of their dependence on the number of multilayers, the widths of the GaMnAs and GaAs layers, and the width of lateral GaAs layers at the borders of the structure.

The confinement shift for diodes with different well width, the shift due to a central potential spike in a well, and magnetotunnelling spectroscopy demonstrate that the first two resonances are due to tunnelling through heavy hole levels, whereas {{there is no sign}} of tunnelling through the first <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> state. This demonstrates for the first time the conservation of the total angular momentum in valence band resonant tunnelling. It is also shown that conduction through <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> states is possible in many structures due to tunnelling of carriers from bulk emitter states. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|The 6 ? 6 {{effective}} mass Hamiltonian for semiconductor heterostructures grown on (11 N) -oriented substrates is derived and is {{compared with the}} 4 ? 4 model. The hole subbands of InGaAs/InP single quantum wells grown on (11 N) -oriented substrates with N=? (that is, (001) ], 0, 1 are calculated using the {{effective mass}} Hamiltonian as an example. The spin-orbit coupling affects the light-hole subband at k||= 0, but it affects all subbands at finite k|| for all substrate orientations. In the 4 ? 4 model (without spin-orbit coupling), the coupling between the heavy hole and the <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> is overestimated. At a critical uniaxial stress, {{the position of the}} first heavy hole and the first <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> as the highest energy level cross over. The separation between the first heavy hole and the first <b>light</b> <b>hole</b> is overestimated at the uniaxial stress below the critical value and is underestimated above the critical stress in the 4 ? 4 model. The spin-orbit coupling greatly affects the valence band structures of the semiconductor heterostructures resulting in the modifications of the optical transitions anisotropy for structures grown on (11 N) -oriented substrates...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} is studied the {{influence}} of uniaxial deformation of GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well structures to photoluminescence. Uniaxial deformation was applied along [110] and polarization ratio of photoluminescence at T = 77 K and 300 K was measured. Also the physical origin of photoluminescence lines in spectrum was determined and the energy band splitting value between states of heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes</b> was estimated. It {{was found that the}} dependencies of polarization ratio on uniaxial deformation for bulk GaAs and GaAs/AlGaAs are different. Two observed lines in photoluminescence spectrum are induced by free electron recombination to energy sublevels of valence band corresponding to heavy and <b>light</b> <b>holes.</b> Those sublevels are splited due to the combination of size quantization and external pressure. The quantum splitting energy value was estimated.
