A combination of novel polymer development, nanoscale morphology control and processing optimization has led to over 8 % of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for BHJ PSCs with a conventional device structure. Attempts to develop PSCs with an <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> structure as required for achieving high PCEs and good stability have, however, met with limited success. Here, we report that (1) solution-processed zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film as an electron extraction layer for inverted polymer solar cells.

However, a significantly degradation was observed from the PSCs without ZnO buffer layer after illuminating the devices only for 1  h. Furthermore, PSCs with ZnO buffer layer also show very good shelf stability; only 10 % degradation observed in PCEs after 6 months; (2) a high PCE of 8. 4 % under AM 1. 5 G irradiation was achieved for BHJ PSCs with an <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> structure. This high efficiency was obtained through interfacial engineering of solution-processed electron extraction layer, ZnO, leading to facilitate electron transport and suppress bimolecular recombination.

By adapting a solution processed PEI layer {{on top of a}} aluminum doped zinc oxide (Al:ZnO) nanoparticle (NP) film, the leakage current of the <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> was substantially suppressed. In addition, the electron injection into the conduction band edge (CBE) of InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs was also facilitated by the low work function (WF) of the Al:ZnO film which was realized by the strong interfacial dipoles of the thin film of PEI. As a result, the charge balance in the <b>inverted</b> <b>devices</b> was controlled by the change of surface roughness, the WF and the thickness of neighboring layers via spin-coating the PEI dissolved in alcohol mixture on the Al:ZnO layer such that the current efficiency was dramatically increased from 0. 07 [*]cd/A to 3. 17 [*]cd/A.

This study reveals the essential role of pre-conditioning of materials in the encapsulation of organic photovoltaic devices.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the behaviour of inverted poly(3 -hexylthiophene) : [6, 6]-phenyl-C- 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (P 3 HT : PCBM) solar cells with different active layer thickness upon changing light intensity. Using white-light bias external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements and photocurrent transient measurements we explain the different thickness dependence of <b>device</b> performance of <b>inverted</b> (ITO/ZnO/P 3 HT : PCBM/WO 3 /Ag) and standard (ITO/PEDOT : PSS/P 3 HT : PCBM/Ca/Al) cells. Whereas for <b>inverted</b> <b>devices</b> where high EQEs of up to 68 % are measured under low light intensities (similar to 3. 5 mW cm(- 2)), a dramatic reduction in EQE is observed with increasing white-light bias (up to similar to 141. 5 mW cm(- 2)) accompanied by a severe distortion of the EQE spectrum. For the <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> this spectral distortion {{is characterized by a}} dip in the EQE spectrum for wavelengths corresponding to maximum light absorption and becomes more prominent with increasing active layer thickness. For regular P 3 HT : PCBM devices, in contrast, a less dramatic reduction in EQE with increasing light intensity and only a mild change in EQE spectral shape are observed. The change in EQE spectral shape is also different for standard devices with a relative reduction in EQE for spectral regions where light is absorbed less strongly. This asymmetry in device behaviour is attributed to unbalanced charge transport with the lower mobility carrier having to travel further on average in the <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> structure. Thus at high light intensities charge recombination is more pronounced at the front half of the device (close to the transparent electrode) for inverted cells where most of the light is absorbed, and more pronounced at the back half of the device for standard cells. Our results therefore indicate that bulk charge transport mobilities rather than vertical composition gradients are the dominant factor in determining the performance of standard and inverted P 3 HT : PCBM cells...|$|R

For the first time, the dielectric properties of organic materials are derived from electron energy loss spectroscopy. A correlation between electron diffraction and current transient measurements of the solution processed polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene) indicates that the semicrystalline structure of the polymer leads to anisotropic charge transport. The study further investigates the structural properties of co-evaporated small molecule blends of fluorinated zincphtalocyanine (F 4 ZnPc) and fullerene (C 60) on different substrates. Energy filtered TEM reveales strong fullerene agglomeration for all substrates considered here, which is shown to be facilitated by an elevated substrate temperature (100 °C). These agglomerates are still largely amorphous if the blend is grown on a pristine F 4 ZnPc layer as required for non-inverted solar cells. However, on an underlying C 60 -layer, as is typically used for <b>inverted</b> <b>devices,</b> a pronounced order of the fullerene is observed.

In this dissertation, an integrated approach is taken to improve the overall performance of polymer solar cells by the development of new polymer materials, device architectures, interface engineering of the contacts between layers, and new transparent electrodes. First, several new classes of polymers are explored as potential light harvesting materials for solar cells. Processing has been optimized and efficiency as high as 6. 24 % has been demonstrated.

30|$|Spherical Au–silica {{core shell}} NPs were {{synthesized}} by Huang et al. [25] using a two-step process. Au NPs were first {{prepared by the}} chemical reduction of HAuCl 4 using sodium citrate as reducing agent [25]. After stabilization by PVP molecules, the Au NPs with a typical diameter of 14  nm were added to a mixture of ammonia and ethanol. In the second stage, the silica precursor tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added dropwise to the mixture and a silica shell ~ 13  nm thick was formed by an improved Stober process [25]. These Au–silica NPs have one LSPR absorption peak at 528  nm which is red shifted with respect to that of Au NPs because of the silica shell [25]. For the investigation of plasmonic effects, an inverted cell structure consisting of ITO/ZnO/P 3 HT:PC 61 BM/Ag was used. In the <b>inverted</b> OPV <b>device</b> structure, holes are extracted from the top electrode. The ZnO layer has a nanowire like morphology to increase the contact area with the BHJ layer. Au–silica NPs {{were introduced to the}} BHJ layer at an optimized concentration of 3  wt% with respect to P 3 HT. When measured under standard test conditions, the PCE of this <b>inverted</b> plasmonic OPV <b>device</b> was 2.17 % [25]. By comparison, the reference device had a PCE of 1.95 %. The PCE of the plasmonic <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> was improved mainly because of a 27 % enhancement in J sc. In an additional experiment, Huang et al. embedded Au NPs (no shell) into the BHJ of the <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> and found that the PCE of this device (2.44 %) was even higher than the device with Au–silica NPs. This is due to a higher V oc and FF for the device with Au NPs in the BHJ. Two useful observations can be inferred from this study. First, the incorporation of Au–silica NPs can only have a positive effect with respect to photocurrent generation. Due to the insulating nature of the silica shell, the FF can decrease with the introduction of Au–silica to the BHJ. Second, the incorporation of Au NPs can enhance both J sc and V oc for the P 3 HT:PC 61 BM system. (Note that {{this is consistent with the}} finding by Wang et al. [46]). However, due to ohmic losses in metal, the gain in J sc may be smaller than in the case of Au–silica NPs.|$|R

By incorporat-ing a cross-linked fullerene interlayer, C-PCBSD, to further modulate the interface characteristics, the ICBA:P 3 HT-based <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> exhibited an improved short-circuit current and fill factor, yielding a record high PCE of 6. 2 %. Polymeric solar cells (PSCs) offer great potential for fabrication of large-area, lightweight, and flexible organic solar cells by using low-cost printing and coating technologies. 1 A conventional bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSC with an active layer sandwiched by a low-work-function aluminum cathode and a hole-conducting poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxylenethiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS...|$|R

Chemical treatment of the as-deposited PEDOT layers with tetrakis(dimethylamino) ethylene or cesium carbonate reduces the work function by up to 0. 8 [*]eV. Inserting these PEDOT layers at the indium tin oxide cathode results in improved electron collection and efficiencies of up to 2. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 2 %, approaching the 3. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 3 % of the conventional device. This illustrates the potential for efficient polymer cathode materials and <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> architectures compatible with either solution or vacuum processing.

30|$|Hybrid organic-inorganic {{perovskite}} {{solar cell}} {{has been recognized}} as a very promising new-generation thin film solar cells based on remarkable improvement in its photovoltaic performance with a present efficiency of as high as 22.1 % [1]. Long-term environmental stability could also be obtained with a time scale of several hundred to a thousand hours [2, 3]. In the large family of perovskite solar cells, planar heterojunction with an <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> skeleton has been highly emphasized and intensively researched because of its appealing potential in mild fabrication process and easily accessible flexibility [4 – 7]. Typically for this device structure, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between the anode and cathode buffer layers to form a p-i-n-layered energy level alignment. In this structure, the n type layer plays {{a critical role in}} accepting electrons and inhibiting holes from the perovskite layer.|$|R
40|$|All-solution {{processed}} organic {{solar cells}} with <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> architecture were demonstrated. Devices contain opaque bottom electrodes and semitransparent top electrodes, resulting in top illuminated devices. Nanoparticles-based Ag ink {{was used for}} inkjet printing both top and bottom electrodes. Semi-transparent top electrode consists of high conductivity PEDOT:PSS and Ag current collecting grids. Printed electrodes were compared to evaporated Ag electrodes (both top and bottom) and to ITO electrode in terms of transmittance, roughness, sheet resistance and device performance. All-solution processed devices with top illumination have average PCE of 2. 4 %, using P 3 HT:PCBM as photoactive layer. Top-illuminated <b>devices</b> with <b>inverted</b> architecture and bottom-illuminated device with conventional architecture, containing the identical layers, but in the reverse sequence, were then compared.

50|$|Polymer {{solar cells}} usually consist of an electron- or hole-blocking layer {{on top of}} an indium tin oxide (ITO) {{conductive}} glass followed by electron donor and an electron acceptor (in the case of bulk heterojunction solar cells), a hole or electron blocking layer, and metal electrode on top. The nature and order of the blocking layers - as well as the nature of the metal electrode - depends on whether the cell follows a regular or an <b>inverted</b> <b>device</b> architecture. In an inverted cell, the electric charges exit the device in the opposite direction as in a normal device because the positive and negative electrodes are reversed. Inverted cells can utilize cathodes out of a more suitable material; inverted OPVs enjoy longer lifetimes than regularly structured OPVs, but they typically don’t reach efficiencies as high as regular OPVs.|$|R
