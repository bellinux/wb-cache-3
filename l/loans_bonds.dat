5000|$|A Mortgage Revenue <b>Bond</b> <b>Loan</b> or <b>bond</b> <b>loan</b> {{is a type}} of {{mortgage}} loan where the cost of borrowing is partially subsidized by a mortgage revenue bond. Although details differ between programs, mortgage revenue <b>bond</b> <b>loan</b> programs are in general designed to lower the cost of homeownership for low to medium income borrowers, sometimes for targeted occupations or neighborhoods. In the United States, mortgage revenue <b>bond</b> <b>loans</b> have supported an average of 100,000 home purchases for low-income buyers between 1986 and 2006.

5000|$|The {{bond market}} {{is part of}} the credit market, with bank loans forming the other main component. The global credit market in {{aggregate}} is about 3 {{times the size of the}} global equity market. [...] Bank loans are not securities under the Securities and Exchange Act, but bonds typically are and are therefore more highly regulated. Bonds are typically not secured by collateral (although they can be), and are sold in relatively small denominations of around $1,000 to $10,000. Unlike bank <b>loans,</b> <b>bonds</b> may be held by retail investors. Bonds are more frequently traded than loans, although not as often as equity.|$|E
50|$|In 1793, the French Revolution caused wars with Austria, Prussia, Great Britain and Spain. The {{government}} {{continued to}} function during {{the economic and}} political crises by a series of <b>loans,</b> <b>bonds</b> and tax increases; an increasingly large amount of paper money issuance was a vain attempt to stimulate the economy. In many ways, the law actually exacerbated the problem, as the new price setting led to many food producers lowering their production or halting altogether, while many of those who continued to produce held onto their inventories, rather than sell at the legal price, which was often below the cost of production. This led to continued food shortages and recurring famines throughout the country. The Committee of Public Safety responded by sending soldiers into the countryside to arrest farmers and seize their crops. This temporarily alleviated the shortages in Paris, however it led to shortages becoming more intense {{in the rest of the}} country.|$|E

2500|$|The {{originator}} initially {{owns the}} assets {{engaged in the}} deal. [...] This is typically a company looking to either raise capital, restructure debt or otherwise adjust its finances (but also includes businesses established specifically to generate marketable debt (consumer or otherwise) {{for the purpose of}} subsequent securitization). Under traditional corporate finance concepts, such a company would have three options to raise new capital: a <b>loan,</b> <b>bond</b> issue, or issuance of stock. However, stock offerings dilute the ownership and control of the company, while <b>loan</b> or <b>bond</b> financing is often prohibitively expensive due to the credit rating of the company and the associated rise in interest rates.|$|R
5000|$|Debt {{is money}} owed by one party, the {{borrower}} or debtor, {{to a second}} party, the lender or creditor. The borrower may be a sovereign state or country, local government, company, or an individual. The lender may be a bank, credit card company, payday loan provider, or an individual. Debt is generally subject to contractual terms regarding the amount and timing of repayments of principal and interest. A simple way to understand interest is {{to see it as}} the [...] "rent" [...] a person owes on money that they have borrowed, to the bank from which they borrowed the money. <b>Loans,</b> <b>bonds,</b> notes, and mortgages are all types of debt. The term can also be used metaphorically to cover moral obligations and other interactions not based on economic value. For example, in Western cultures, a person who has been helped by a second person is sometimes said to owe a [...] "debt of gratitude" [...] to the second person.|$|E
