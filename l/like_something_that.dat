500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, who got the story from {{another member of the}} writing staff, Mike Scully. When the show runners of this season, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, took over the job from David Mirkin, they wanted to [...] "take the show back" [...] to the Simpson family. Their goal was to have at least 15 episodes per season that {{revolved}} around the family or a member of the family, but they still wanted to do the annual Halloween episode, a Sideshow Bob episode, an Itchy and Scratchy episode, and a [...] "format bending" [...] episode, which in this season was [...] "22 Short Films About Springfield". They wanted the family episodes to be realistic, and Oakley thought [...] "Homer the Smithers" [...] was a good example. When Scully pitched the idea to the writers, Oakley was surprised that it had not been done earlier on the show. He thought the story sounded <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> would have been done by the third season because it was [...] "simple" [...] and [...] "organic".|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Scherzinger was {{planning}} to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole, however, the release of four singles, including [...] "Whatever U Like" [...] (featuring T.I.) and [...] "Baby Love" [...] (featuring will.i.am) all failed to significantly impact on US charts. [...] "Baby Love" [...] was moderately successful reaching top-twenty in Europe. After a number of pushbacks, the entire project was scrapped {{at the request of}} Scherzinger. In May 2010, Rap-Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an [...] "empowering" [...] ballad called [...] "Nobody Can Change Me". The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition, Dancing with the Stars, and was mastered on May 23, 2010, ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest's KIIS FM radio show the following day. Idolator was unimpressed with the [...] "treacly pop tune" [...] saying that the lack of sexiness, [...] "uninspiring message" [...] and [...] "squeaky vocals" [...] did Scherzinger no favors. However, Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song, stating that [...] "there’s none of the Pussycat Doll’s forced sexiness here; instead, it sounds <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album (that is sort of supposed to be a compliment, yeah)." ...|$|E
500|$|New York Magazine put [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as {{third of}} its list of [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Lost Episodes", {{claiming}} that [...] "because with all his other problems, daddy issues don't feel <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> needs to be thrown at Hurley" [...] and David could have been written as a positive character [...] "just to add some variation to the bad-dad overkill on this show". IGN ranked [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as the second worst Lost episode, above only [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", explaining [...] "Is there a better metaphor that Lost was running in circles {{at this point in}} Season 3 than seeing several of the castaways driving in circles on the island, with goofy grins on their faces?... With a dull story on the island and flashbacks weakly giving Hurley the requisite daddy issues so many of the other characters already had, it was clear Lost needed to make a big change soon to recapture what was special about the show. Thankfully, they did." [...] A similar list by the Los Angeles Times ranked the episode much higher at 31, writing [...] "The haters need to shut up. This is a nearly pure embrace of the Lost ethos. You make your own fate up until the moment when you don't." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{described}} [...] "Migrate" [...] as [...] "a frivolous, funky, self-referential jam". The New York Sun Jayanthi Daniels {{thought the}} track sounded <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> R. Kelly would release, {{and continued to}} write that Carey [...] "is no longer looking for a 'Dreamlover' to come and rescue her, as she did in 1993: In 'Migrate,' she's already rescued, and enjoying the after-party". He {{also said that the}} song is [...] "much stronger" [...] than E=MC²s lead single, [...] "Touch My Body". Writing for The Wichita Eagle, Mary Moore's review on the song was positive, calling it as [...] "an irresistible hip-hop groove that works". The Guardians Alex Macpherson labelled the track as [...] "sinister". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters was critical of [...] "Migrate", and called it [...] "grating" [...] and [...] "a tepid and uninvolving attempt at a club anthem". He continued to write that the song is void of a proper melodic structure and expressed disapproval of its use of processed vocal filters. Sawdey concluded by writing that despite the added production from Danja and guest vocals by T-Pain, [...] "it serves as a painfully dull opener". Similarly, J. Freedom du Lac felt that the Auto-Tune [...] "needlessly distorts [...] greatest gift". Jim Farber of the Daily News felt that the use of processed vocals was more appropriate for [...] "stars" [...] who cannot sing.|$|E

500|$|Murdock {{begins the}} season {{wearing a black}} costume (called the [...] "vigilante outfit" [...] by production), {{inspired}} by the one worn by the character in Frank Miller's The Man Without Fear, rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops. Marvel Comics' Chief Creative Officer Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications. On the design process, DeKnight revealed that [...] "we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented {{with a lot of}} different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right." [...] DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the [...] "real-world" [...] of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit. Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to [...] "look <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store." [...] Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that [...] "really conform to his head" [...] but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{we want to hear}} when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Perala from Anchorage Daily News complimented the video, saying [...] "If {{you have}} a secret fondness for pop singer Madonna, {{you would want to}} check out her Ciao Italia, the singer's concert film from Italy. You can be pleasantly {{surprised}} at how amazing she is." [...] Heather Phares from Allmusic said: [...] "Madonna's Ciao Italia: Live From Italy captures a performance from her 1988 world tour and features hits like 'Lucky Star', 'True Blue', 'La Isla Bonita', 'Like a Virgin', and 'Material Girl'. A much simpler, less choreographed performance than her later extravaganzas like The Girlie Show World Tour, Ciao Italia is still entertaining in its own right, and will definitely please fans nostalgic for some old-school Madonna hits." [...] Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times gave a positive review, saying [...] "A festive Italian stadium show featuring the Material Girl, who's turned into a first-rate entertainer, strutting and singing in flashy production-number renditions of her recent most Billboard topping songs, is indeed a delight. The video captures the enormity of Madonna as a performer, and her theatrics, oomph and chutzpah." [...] Tom Shales from The Washington Post said that [...] "Ciao Italia works wonderful because it makes Madonna look like she's at home, with her Italian family all around her. [...] A Turin soccer stadium became the sexual center of the universe last year when Madonna, one of our naughtiest superstars, taped this concert there before 75,000 gyrating Italians. Ebullient and insouciant, Madonna sings her hits-including the darkly beautiful 'Live to Tell'—in cavernous stereo; dances engagingly with 14-year-old Chris Finch, the quintessential Lucky Little Boy; and crowns herself queen of teases, bending over to reveal 'Kiss' printed on her underpants [...] Sheer showmanship is present in her performances as well as the camera work of this video." [...] Jim Farber from Rolling Stone said that [...] "this version of Madonna's Who's That Girl Tour returns the star to the medium where she excels best. On videocassette, however, Madonna makes manipulation seem like an exciting message indeed." [...] Colin Jacobson from the DVD Movie Guide however, gave a negative review of the album, saying [...] "Possibly the biggest problem with Ciao Italia regarded the sloppy manner in which the program was assembled. I can’t recall if Italia appeared as a TV special that aired live or if it was taped and edited specifically for future broadcast screenings, but it certainly looked <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was created on the fly. Sloppy camerawork and editing abound, as those two factors don’t flow together terribly well. It felt as though they tried their best to get appropriate material at the time but that they failed to massage it after the fact." ...|$|E

This hand has more muscle and bone texture to it, the blades are shinier and in one case, are retractable. Everything about this glove has a much cleaner look to it, it's more a natural part of his hand than a glove." [...] The new glove has five claws.|$|E

2500|$|When Jim Doyle, {{the creator}} of Freddy's claw, asked Craven what he wanted, Craven responded, [...] "It's kind of like really long fingernails, I want the glove to look <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> someone could make who has the skills of a boilermaker." [...] Doyle explained, [...] "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, {{we thought it would}} look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were {{actually}} using the knife upside down." [...] Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.|$|E
2500|$|Wake Up! {{follows the}} {{releases}} of Legend's Evolver (2008) and The Roots's How I Got Over (2010). Legend and The Roots were inspired {{to record a}} collaborative album by the 2008 United States presidential election. In an interview for Billboard, Legend explained {{the reason for the}} album's conception at the time, stating [...] "I {{was in the middle of}} campaigning for Barack Obama and feeling inspired by the atmosphere in the country at the time, so I wanted to do something musically that reflected that moment. The original idea was to do some sort of covers EP, but the more I got into it with the Roots, it felt <b>like</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> should be heard and marketed on its own".

2500|$|The {{programme}} {{was originally}} conceived in 1998, when screenwriters Matthew Graham and Ashley Pharoah were sent on {{a break to}} the English seaside resort of Blackpool by Kudos Film & Television to think up programme ideas. Originally titled Ford Granada after the 1970s car, the series {{was rejected by the}} BBC. In response, Graham stated: [...] "Back then, broadcasters just weren't comfortable with <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> wasn't set in the real world and that had a fantasy element to it." [...] According to Graham, the initial idea was for a humorous, pre-watershed programme that overtly mocked the styles and attitudes of the 1970s, with the comic actor Neil Morrissey envisaged as the central character.|$|R
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt <b>like</b> <b>something,</b> <b>that</b> brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E

Allen had just about given up writing any more movies from beginning to end, preferring to do lucrative rewrites. It had stopped being fun for her. Script 'development' translated to 'scripts written by committee', but the upside was that [...] "developed" [...] scripts tend to need rewrites – from outside the [...] "development circle"."A production rewrite means that the project is in production.

If you go for credit on somebody else's work, you have to completely dismantle the structure. Who wants a job where you have to completely dismantle the structure? I only take things that I think are in reasonable shape. The director and the producer and the studio may not necessarily agree with me, but I think the script is in reasonable shape.
