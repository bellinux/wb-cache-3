5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|In another essay, {{he refers}} to James Baldwin's {{struggle}} to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation {{that he needed to}} take control of the language and expand it. The Nigerian poet and novelist Gabriel Okara <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> process of language-expansion to the evolution of jazz music in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as {{the lobby of the}} church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} design and decoration, Mavrodinov <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> church to the Church of St Pantaleon in Gorno Nerezi near Skopje, today in the Republic of Macedonia. It is also {{compared}} to the Church of St Theodore in nearby Boboshevo. The Church of St Nicholas features a multitude of two-stepped vaults on its outside walls. The interior was originally entirely covered with frescoes, though only fragments survive. It was enlisted as a monument of culture of national importance in 1968, with a publication in Bulgaria's newspaper of record, the State Gazette, issue 77.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to focus attention on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{feature of}} the Church of Christ Pantocrator is the rich and {{colourful}} decoration of its exterior walls. The most lavishly decorated part {{of the church is}} the east side with the apse, and as a whole all sides of the church exhibit different ornamentation. Interchanging strips of three or four rows of bricks and carved stones, which create an optical pattern, are the most basic type of decoration used. Rows of blind arches, four-leaved floral motifs, triangular ornaments, circular turquoise ceramics and brick swastika friezes run along the east wall. Ousterhout <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> appearance of the church's superimposed arcades to an aqueduct; an earlier example of that configuration can be observed in the Cappadocian church of Çanlı Kilise near Aksaray, Turkey. The inclusion of swastikas in the decoration is considered unusual and curious to tourists. It is explained by the medieval use of the swastika {{as a symbol of the}} Sun.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense of strength and power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
500|$|In 1851 the {{archaeologist}} Charles Robert Cockerell {{published his}} analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as [...] "a calendar for unlearned men" [...] illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.|$|E
500|$|The opening chorus resembles an Italian violin concerto. The musicologist Julian Mincham <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> [...] "solo violin's persistent, rocking, wave-like idea" [...] to {{the waves}} of the Jordan River. Alfred Dürr compares the vocal {{sections}}, all with the solo violin, to the solo sections of a violin concerto, {{as opposed to the}} tutti sections with the orchestra. John Eliot Gardiner interprets the movement as a French overture, [...] "replete with grandiloquent baroque gestures to suggest both the processional ...|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} {{opens with}} Harrison's acoustic guitar and an electric piano riff that creates [...] "a sense of foreboding", according to Inglis, who <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> intro to Three Dog Night's 1970 hit single [...] "Mama Told Me Not to Come". Along with Harrison, the musicians {{on the basic}} track were Jim Keltner (drums), Nicky Hopkins (electric piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass). Part of Harrison's guide vocal from the basic track was retained for the official release.|$|E
500|$|... (And is risen) is {{expressed}} by a five-part choral movement with trumpets. The concerto on ascending motifs renders the resurrection, the ascension {{and the second}} coming, all separated by long instrumental interludes and followed by a postlude. [...] "" [...] (and will come again) {{is given to the}} bass only, for Bach the vox Christi (voice of Christ). Wenk <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> movement to a Réjouissance dance, a [...] "light festive movement in triple meter, upbeat three eighth notes".|$|E
500|$|... (Osanna in the Highest) {{is set for}} two choirs and {{a festive}} orchestra, in the same key and time as the {{previous}} movement. The movement is based, as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata , probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata Es lebe der König, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh 11, of 1732. The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development. Wenk <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> movement to the Passepied, a dance in [...] "fast triple meter with an upbeat".|$|E

500|$|Cusack {{compares the}} Church of the SubGenius to the Ranters, a radical 17th-century pantheist {{movement}} in England. She notes {{that they made}} statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has [...] "legitimate pedigree {{in the history of}} Western religion". The American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> Church to the Moorish Orthodox Church of America, a 20th-century American syncretic religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{instance of}} a liquid-driven escapement {{was described by}} the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (fl. 3rd century) in his technical treatise Pneumatics (chapter 31) where he <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> escapement mechanism of a washstand automaton with those as employed in (water) clocks. Another early clock to use escapements was built during the 7th century in Chang'an, by Tantric monk and mathematician, Yi Xing, and government official Liang Lingzan. An astronomical instrument {{that served as a}} clock, it was discussed in a contemporary text as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{takes the form}} of a {{reconciliation}} with a loved one after a long period of estrangement. Theologian Dale Allison considers that, given the [...] "cryptic" [...] nature of the lyrics, it is only through Harrison's subsequent comments that the listener knows that he is addressing God rather than a woman. Allison <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> song's message to that of later Harrison compositions such as [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] and [...] "Heading for the Light", through its conveying of a [...] "conversion experience".|$|E

Allison <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> song to Harrison's 1971 compositions [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] and [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", and suggests that in the choruses to [...] "Far East Man", Harrison is stating [...] "his determination to help impoverished and oppressed peoples half a world away".|$|E
500|$|Billy Childish wrote a song {{entitled}} [...] "Louis Riel", {{which was}} performed by Thee Headcoats. Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled [...] "Louis Riel," [...] which appeared on the album S.D.Q. '98.

And all around Regina they talk about him still – why did they have to kill Louis Riel?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the song serve as a {{confession}} in which Harrison details how he has lost his way. Author Ian Inglis describes [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as an autobiographical account of a musician [...] "who succumbs to the temptations of 'sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll' that are stereotypically linked with the mythology of rock". Leng <b>likens</b> <b>the</b> track to contemporary work by Neil Young, particularly [...] "Yonder Stands the Sinner", adding that Harrison arrives at [...] "the same impasse" [...] as the Canadian singer: [...] "decadence, dependency, and despair".|$|E
