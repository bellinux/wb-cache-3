She offered to forego alimony and child support if he let her move to Arizona with the children, but he refused.|$|E
25|$|Pamela Barnes Ewing was {{severely}} {{injured in a}} car accident in the tenth season finale in 1987, and left Bobby and Christopher due to her apparent inability to <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> her in such a physically disfigured fashion. Nevertheless, while Victoria Principal never returned again to the series, Margaret Michaels, a Principal look-alike, played the character in a season 12 episode. Having undergone plastic surgery which explained the difference in her appearance, it was revealed that Pam was dying of a disease, though only she and her doctor knew. After this, Pam is never seen in Dallas again. Unable to reach a salary agreement, it was Principal's own decision to not renew her Dallas contract.|$|E

[...] After a second crowd was convinced to disperse by Patriot leaders, Dunmore reacted angrily, warning on April 22 that if attacked, he would [...] "declare Freedom to the Slaves, and reduce the City of Williamsburg to Ashes." [...] He also told a Williamsburg alderman that he had [...] "once fought for the Virginians" [...] but [...] "By God, I would <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> that I could fight against them." ...|$|E

500|$|The book uses a {{first person}} memoir style with Smith and MacKinnon taking turns writing each chapter. The authors {{purposely}} avoided writing a self-help book {{in favour of}} the memoir style, saying, [...] "We wanted to show readers that process, and how it affected us and <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> it through our eyes." [...] The topics sometimes go beyond the motivations and challenges of the diet into more personal relationship issues. Prior to writing the book they created a general plan on where the narrative would lead. They took turns writing so they could monitor each other's progress. As the two alternate there are shifts in perspectives, though the overall theme of [...] "traceability" [...] persisted. The general tone {{has been described as}} charming, innocent, and sometimes funny. Smith's chapters have been said to demonstrate more honesty and vulnerability, while MacKinnon's were more [...] "show pieces, little tours de force". The final chapter was authored together by Smith and MacKinnon writing as a disembodied third-person narrator to summarize and conclude the book.|$|E

2500|$|Fifteen-year-old Eckford {{tried to}} enter the school, while {{soldiers}} of the National Guard, under orders from Arkansas Governor Faubus, stepped in her way to prevent her from entering. Eventually, she gave up and tried to flee to a bus stop through the mob of segregationists who surrounded and threatened to lynch her. Once Eckford got to the bus stop, she couldn't stop crying. A reporter, Benjamin Fine, having in mind his own 15-year-old daughter, {{sat down next to}} Eckford. He tried to comfort her and told her, [...] "don't <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> you cry."

2500|$|On April 21, 1775, {{he seized}} colonial {{ammunition}} stores, {{an action that}} resulted in the formation of an angry mob. The colonists argued that the ammunition belonged to them, not to the British Crown. That night, Dunmore angrily swore, [...] "I have once fought for the Virginians and by God, I will <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> that I can fight against them." [...] This {{was one of the first}} instances that Dunmore overtly threatened to institute martial law. While he had not formally passed any rulings, news of his plan spread through the colony rapidly. A group of slaves offered their services to the royal governor not long after April 21. Though he ordered them away, the colonial slaveholders remained suspicious of his intentions.|$|E
2500|$|When the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was {{approaching}} completion, {{the directors of}} the railway ran a competition to decide whether stationary steam engines or locomotives would be used to pull the trains. The Rainhill Trials were arranged as an open contest that would <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> all the locomotive candidates in action, with the choice to follow. Regardless of whether or not locomotives were settled upon, a prize of £500 was offered to the winner of the trials. Three notable figures from the early days of engineering were selected as judges: [...] John Urpeth Rastrick, a locomotive engineer of Stourbridge, Nicholas Wood, a mining engineer from Killingworth with considerable locomotive design experience and John Kennedy, a Manchester cotton spinner and a major proponent of the railway.|$|E

"If {{a gentleman}} {{is also a}} medical man," [...] I answered, [...] "his sense of duty towards his brother {{practitioners}} would, of course, prevent him from interfering in their proper sphere, or putting upon them the unmerited slight of <b>letting</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> him preferred before them." ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{help the}} composers {{understand}} the aesthetic of Deadly Premonition, the developers hummed ideas for songs, <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> concept designs, and played music that matched a certain {{feeling that they}} wished to convey. [...] "Life is Beautiful", which uses whistling to evoke a calm walk in the countryside, was easily composed, along with [...] "York and Zach", which appears during York's monologues. [...] "Miss Stilletto Heels", the second theme of the game, and [...] "Red Tree", a song meant to symbolize madness, proved more difficult to create, particularly its improvisation section. The sound effects were outsourced to another company, as Access Games lacked a department {{to deal with the}} sound. More than six thousand lines of dialogue were recorded over two weeks at WebTone Studio in San Jose, California, [...] three thousand of which were lines for York's voice actor, Jeff Kramer.|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} which locomotives would be suitable, the directors organised the Rainhill Trials. These were arranged as an open contest that would <b>let</b> <b>them</b> <b>see</b> all the locomotive candidates in action, {{with the choice}} to follow. A prize of £500 was offered to {{the winner of the}} trials. The trials were won by Rocket, built by George and Robert Stephenson. Rocket was the first locomotive to use a multi-tubular boiler, which allowed more effective heat transfer from the exhaust gases to the water. It was also the first to use a blastpipe, where used steam from the cylinders discharges into the smokebox beneath the chimney in order to increase the draught of the fire. With these innovations, Rocket averaged , with a top speed of [...] hauling 13 tons, and was declared the winner of the trials. The Stephensons were accordingly given the contract to produce locomotives for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway.|$|E
