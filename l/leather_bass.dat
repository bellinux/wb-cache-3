40|$|Courtship and {{spawning}} {{behavior is}} described for the <b>Leather</b> <b>Bass,</b> Dermatolepis dermatolepis, from observations {{made from a}} manned submersible at Cocos Island, Costa Rica on 19  days between November 2006 and February 2007. Spawning occurred in the evening (16 : 00 – 18 : 30  h) in subgroups of 10 – 32 individuals that formed within aggregations of 50 – 70 individuals. The mating sequence was characterized by subgroup formation and crowding behavior followed by a brief vertical spawning rush, gamete release, and the rapid separation of participants. The aggregation was present on all dives, and spawning was not restricted to specific lunar phases...|$|E

50|$|Viennese pianos, {{including}} Graf's, {{are known}} for effective damping of sound after the key is released. Graf achieved this result {{by a variety of}} means. The dampers were graded in size (larger in the bass), and used different materials for different ranges (wool in the treble, <b>leather</b> in the <b>bass).</b> The weight of the dampers was also controlled: dampers for lower notes were made of a heavier wood (beech), vs. lime in the treble. The lowest 13-17 dampers were weighted with lead.|$|R
