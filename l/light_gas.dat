25|$|Memphis's primary utility {{provider}} is the Memphis <b>Light,</b> <b>Gas</b> and Water Division (MLGW). This {{is the largest}} three-service municipal utility in the United States, providing electricity, natural gas, and pure water service to all residents of Shelby County. Prior to that, Memphis was served by two primary electric companies, which were merged into the Memphis Power Company. The City of Memphis bought the private company in 1939 to form MLGW, which was an early customer of electricity from the Tennessee Valley Authority.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{natural gas}} was usually {{obtained}} as {{a by-product of}} producing oil, since the small, <b>light</b> <b>gas</b> carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If {{there was not a}} market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive to pipe to the end user.|$|E

5000|$|After relaxation, {{the speed}} of some low mass members can be greater than the escape {{velocity}} of the cluster, which results in these members being lost to the cluster. This process is called evaporation. (A similar phenomenon explains the loss of <b>lighter</b> <b>gases</b> from a planet, such as hydrogen and helium from the Earth—after equipartition, some molecules of sufficiently <b>light</b> <b>gases</b> {{at the top of}} the atmosphere will exceed the escape velocity of the planet and be lost.) ...|$|R

These models {{can also be used}} in the design or modification of chemical reactors to optimize product yield, more efficiently separate products, and eliminate environmentally harmful by-products. When performing catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and <b>light</b> <b>gas,</b> for example, kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur.|$|E

2500|$|It may {{be noted}} that railgun {{velocities}} generally fall {{within the range of}} those achievable by two-stage light-gas guns; however, the latter are generally only considered to be suitable for laboratory use while railguns are judged to offer some potential prospects for development as military weapons. Another <b>light</b> <b>gas</b> gun, the Combustion <b>Light</b> <b>Gas</b> Gun in a 155mm prototype form was projected to achieve 2500m/s with a [...]70 caliber barrel. In some hypervelocity research projects, projectiles are [...] "pre-injected" [...] into railguns, to avoid the need for a standing start, and both two-stage light-gas guns and conventional powder guns have been used for this role. In principle, if railgun power supply technology can be developed to provide safe, compact, reliable, combat survivable, and lightweight units, then the total system volume and mass needed to accommodate such a power supply and its primary fuel can become less than the required total volume and mass for a mission equivalent quantity of conventional propellants and explosive ammunition. Arguably such technology has been matured with the introduction of the EMALS aircraft launch system (albeit that railguns require much higher system powers, because roughly similar energies must be delivered in a few milliseconds, as opposed to a few seconds) [...] Such a development would then convey a further military advantage in that the elimination of explosives from any military weapons platform will decrease its vulnerability to enemy fire.|$|E
2500|$|Cluster mass {{estimates}} {{determined by}} lensing are valuable because the method requires no assumption about the dynamical state or star formation {{history of the}} cluster in question. Lensing mass maps can also potentially reveal [...] "dark clusters," [...] clusters containing overdense concentrations of dark matter but relatively insignificant amounts of baryonic matter. Comparison of the dark matter distribution mapped using lensing with {{the distribution of the}} baryons using optical and X-ray data reveals the interplay of the dark matter with the stellar and gas components. A notable example of such a joint analysis is the so-called Bullet Cluster. The Bullet Cluster data provide constraints on models relating <b>light,</b> <b>gas,</b> and dark matter distributions such as Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and Λ-Cold Dark Matter (Λ-CDM).|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, Lux Research, Inc. {{issued a}} report that stated: [...] "The dream of a {{hydrogen}} economy ... is no nearer". It concluded that [...] "Capital cost ... will limit adoption to a mere 5.9 GW" [...] by 2030, providing [...] "a nearly insurmountable barrier to adoption, except in niche applications". The analysis concluded that, by 2030, PEM stationary market will reach $1 billion, while the vehicle market, including forklifts, will reach a total of $2 billion. Other analyses cite {{the lack of an}} extensive hydrogen infrastructure in the U.S. as an ongoing challenge to Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle commercialization. In 2006, a study for the IEEE showed that for hydrogen produced via electrolysis of water: [...] "Only about 25% of the power generated from wind, water, or sun is converted to practical use." [...] The study further noted that [...] "Electricity obtained from hydrogen fuel cells appears to be four times as expensive as electricity drawn from the electrical transmission grid. ... Because of the high energy losses [...] cannot compete with electricity." [...] Furthermore, the study found: [...] "Natural gas reforming is not a sustainable solution". [...] "The large amount of energy required to isolate hydrogen from natural compounds (water, natural gas, biomass), package the <b>light</b> <b>gas</b> by compression or liquefaction, transfer the energy carrier to the user, plus the energy lost when it is converted to useful electricity with fuel cells, leaves around 25% for practical use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1396. Yet it {{is evident}} that the {{difference}} is not due to specific gravity, for though hydrogen is the lowest, and therefore lower than oxygen, oxygen is much beneath nitrogen, or olefiant gas; and carbonic acid gas, though considerably heavier than olefiant gas or muriatic acid gas, is lower than either. Oxygen as a heavy, and olefiant as a <b>light</b> <b>gas,</b> are in strong contrast with each other; and if we may reason of olefiant gas from Harris's results with air (1365.), then it might be rarefied to two-thirds its usual density, or to a specific gravity of 9.3 (hydrogen being 1), and having neither the same density nor pressure as oxygen, would have equal insulating powers with it, or equal tendency to resist discharge.|$|E
60|$|You may {{easily see}} that {{although}} we obtained from water {{twice as much}} in volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen, {{it does not follow}} that we have twice as much in weight--because one is heavy, and the other a very <b>light</b> <b>gas.</b> We have means of weighing gases or air; but without stopping to explain, that, {{let me just tell you}} what their respective weights are. The weight of a pint of hydrogen is three-quarters of a grain; the weight of the same quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains. This is a very great difference. The weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is one-twelfth of an ounce; and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third. And so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the balance, and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to tons, as you will see almost immediately.|$|E

50|$|Much {{of recent}} turbo pump {{development}} {{has been focused on}} improvement of the effectiveness of the drag stages. As gas is removed from a pumped space, the <b>lighter</b> <b>gases</b> hydrogen and helium become a larger proportion of the remaining gas load. In recent years it has been demonstrated that the precise design of the surface geometry of the drag stages can have a marked effect on pumping of these <b>light</b> <b>gases,</b> improving compression ratios by up to two orders of magnitude for given pumping volume. As a result, it is possible to use much smaller backing pumps than would be required by pure turbomolecular pumps and/or design more compact turbomolecular pumps.|$|R

"The whole {{aspect of}} this monster was {{formidable}} and threatening, and it kept changing its colour from a very light mauve to a dark, angry purple so thick that it cast a shadow as it drifted between my monoplane and the sun. On the upper curve of its huge body there were three great projections which I can only describe as enormous bubbles, and I was convinced as I looked at {{them that they were}} charged with some extremely <b>light</b> <b>gas</b> which served to buoy up the misshapen and semi-solid mass in the rarefied air. The creature moved swiftly along, keeping pace easily with the monoplane, and for twenty miles or more it formed my horrible escort, hovering over me like a bird of prey which is waiting to pounce. Its method of progression--done so swiftly that it was not easy to follow--was to throw out a long, glutinous streamer in front of it, which in turn seemed to draw forward the rest of the writhing body. So elastic and gelatinous was it that never for two successive minutes was it the same shape, and yet each change made it more threatening and loathsome than the last.|$|E

If it be hydrogen, it will remain here while I hold this jar inverted. [A light was then applied, when the hydrogen burnt] What is there now in the other jar? You know that the two together made an explosive mixture. But what can this be which we find as the other constituent in water, and which must therefore be that substance which made the hydrogen burn? We know that the water we put into the vessel consisted of the two things together. We find one of these is hydrogen: what must that other be which was in the water before the experiment, and which we now have by itself? I am about to put this lighted splinter of wood into the gas. The gas itself will not burn, but it will make the splinter of wood burn. [The Lecturer ignited the end of the wood, and introduced it into the jar of gas.] See how it invigorates the combustion of the wood, and how it makes it burn far better than the air would make it burn; and now you see by itself that every other substance which is contained in the water, and which, when the water was formed by the burning of the candle, must have been taken from the atmosphere. What shall we call it, A, B, or C? Let us call it O--call it [...] "Oxygen:" [...] it is a very good distinct-sounding name. This, then, is the oxygen which was present in the water, forming so large a part of it.|$|E
