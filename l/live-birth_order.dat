The crude birth rate was 14. 2, up slightly from the previous year; the general fertility rate was 68. 5, up 3 percent. Birth rates increased for women in nearly all age groups, with the largest increases for teenagers and for women aged 20 – 24 and 40 – 44 years. Teenage childbearing increased, interrupting the 14 -year decline from 1991 – 2005. The mean age at first birth for U. S. women was down in 2006, to 25. 0 years. The total fertility rate increased to 2, 100. 5 births per 1, 000 women. All measures of unmarried childbearing reached record levels in 2006. Women were less likely to receive timely prenatal care in 2006. The cesarean delivery rate climbed to 31. 1 percent, another all-time high.

Selected data by mother 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s state of residence are shown, as well as data on month and day of birth, sex ratio, and age of father. Trends in fertility patterns and maternal and infant characteristics are described and interpreted. Methods: Descriptive tabulations are presented of data reported on the birth certificates of the 4. 3 million births that occurred in 2007. Preliminary 2008 data are based on 99. 9 percent of births occurring in 2008. Denominators for population-based rates are postcensal esti 2 mates derived from the U. S. 2000 census. Results: A total of 4, 316, 233 births were registered in the United States in 2007, the largest number of births ever reported. The general fertility rate increased 1 percent to 69. 5 per 1, 000. Birth rates increased for women in nearly all age groups. The rate for teenagers rose 1 percent for the year and is up 5 percent from 2005. The total fertility rate increased 1 percent to 2, 122. 0 births per 1, 000 women. Prelimi 2 nary data for 2008, however, suggest a decline in the number and rate of births overall, and for most age groups under age 40 years. All measures of unmarried childbearing reached record levels in 2007. The cesarean delivery rate rose to another all-time high: 31. 8 percent. Preterm and low birthweight rates declined slightly, and twin and triplet and higher-order multiple birth rates were essentially unchanged. Pre 2 liminary findings for 2008 suggest that these trends continued for cesarean delivery, unmarried childbearing, and preterm births. Suggested citation: Martin JA, Hamilton BE, Sutton PD, et al.
