50|$|Wet {{granulation}} is {{a process}} of using a <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> to lightly agglomerate the powder mixture. The amount of liquid has to be properly controlled, as over-wetting will cause the granules to be too hard and under-wetting will cause them to be too soft and friable. Aqueous solutions have the advantage of being safer to deal with than solvent-based systems but may not be suitable for drugs which are degraded by hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the impact of <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution on granule properties during the wet granulation process. A new parameter, namely the <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> transfer coefficient, is used to characterize <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution. The relationships between <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution coefficient and granule size distribution are discussed. Granules are made of lactose alpha-monohydrate (97. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 31 μm) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (2. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 89 μm) and are manufactured in a Mi-Pro high shear mixer (Pro-C-epT, Belgium). Nigrosine is incorporated as a tracer in the <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> in order to detect its distribution in the granules during the process. The results show that the <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> is heterogeneously distributed at the beginning of the process whereas it tends to be evenly distributed in the powder during the process. The <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> transfer in granule classes obeys a first-order law and the <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> transfer coefficient appears to be related to operating conditions: high rotation speed, low liquid flow rate and low liquid viscosity favour the achievement of high liquid transfer coefficient. In addition, the higher the coefficient, the earlier the homogenization and the wider the granule mean diameters. Thus, granule size distribution can be controlled by the <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution process. A <b>binder</b> <b>liquid</b> distribution mechanism is proposed, which makes it possible to discuss the influence of the operating parameters on the granule construction process...|$|R

50|$|Powder {{printers}} work in {{a similar}} manner to SLS machines, and typically use powders that can be cured, hardened, or otherwise made solid by the application of a <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> that is delivered via an inkjet printhead. Common materials are plaster of paris, clay, powdered sugar, wood-filler bonding putty, and flour, which are typically cured with water, alcohol, vinegar, or some combination thereof. The major advantage of powder and SLS machines is their ability to continuously support all parts of their objects throughout the printing process with unprinted powder. This permits the production of geometries not easily otherwise created. However, these printers are often more complex and expensive. Examples of printers using this method are the ZCorp Zprint 400 and 450.|$|E
50|$|While not {{necessarily}} employing conventional inkjet technology, various other powder-binder combinations may be deployed to form objects by chemical or mechanical means. The resulting parts may then {{be subjected to}} different post-processing regimes, such as infiltration or bakeout.

Depending on the material, full color printing {{may or may not}} be an option. As of 2014, inventors and manufacturers have developed systems for forming objects from sand and calcium carbonate (forming a synthetic marble), acrylic powder and cyanoacrylate, ceramic powder and a <b>liquid</b> <b>binder,</b> sugar and water (for making candies), etc.|$|E

40|$|The {{wettability}} {{of tungsten}} carbide by <b>liquid</b> <b>binders</b> with various carbon contents and infiltration of WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbide by such binders were examined. The wettability of tungsten carbide by the <b>liquid</b> Co-based <b>binder</b> is complete at low carbon contents and becomes incomplete when increasing the carbon content. The wettability of WC by the Co-based binder alloy saturated with carbon is relatively poor with a wetting angle of about 15 °. The well-known phenomenon of Co migration from carbide regions with high carbon contents into regions with low carbon contents is presumably caused mainly by {{the variance in}} capillary forces related to the different wettability rates of WC by <b>liquid</b> <b>binders</b> with various carbon contents. The Co-based binders with various carbon contents are found to have different behaviors with respect to infiltrating WC-WC grain boundaries in cemented carbides during sintering.

The Chumash made paint from a mixture of mineralized soil, stone mortar, and some kind of <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> like blood or oil from animals or mashed seeds.

40|$|Spray {{granulation}} {{is commonly}} used to improve the flow of drug formulation powders by adding <b>liquid</b> <b>binders.</b> We have discovered a new granulation process whereby <b>liquid</b> <b>binders</b> are added as aqueous foam. Initial experiments indicate that foam granulations require less binder than spray granulations, less water {{is added to the}} powder mass, rates of addition of foam can be greater than rates of addition of sprayed liquids, and foam can be added in a single batch {{to the surface of the}} powder mass for incorporation at some later stage in the process. This new process appears to have no detrimental effects on granulate, tablet, or in vitro drug dissolution properties. In addition, the elimination of spray addition reduces the complexity of the process and avoids the plugging problems associated with spray nozzles. Several formulations were successfully scaled up from laboratory scale (1. 5 kg) to pilot scale (15 kg). Process control was good and there was no detrimental effect on tablet and drug dissolution properties.

40|$|A {{population}} balance model is {{developed for the}} growth of pre-formed agglomerates in a fluidized bed with several agglomeration mechanisms considered. Primary agglomeration takes place when dry particles collide with the wet surface of the original agglomerate. Secondary agglomeration occurs either by wet particles colliding with the dry surface of agglomerates, or by liquid migration to the top layer of an agglomerate and subsequent collisions with dry particles. The properties of the <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> determine the dominant mechanism. The new agglomeration model for high-and low-viscosity liquid binders is implemented in ANSYS FLUENT commercial software. Model predictions agree reasonably well with available experimental results without altering the previously published parameters of the sub-models employed. It is found that the viscosity of the <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> and surface asperities play notable roles in the agglomeration.

The study focused on the effects of its chemical structure on its interaction with surfactants (PEG 200 and Synperonic TM PE/L- 61) in liquisolid systems and, consequently, on its release into water dissolution medium.

This paper presents the study of {{wet granulation}} of microcrystalline cellulose powder, MCC (Avicel PH 101) using high-shear mixer granulator. It aims at understanding the effect of operating parameters (impeller rotational speed, <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> flow ate) and of physicochemical properties (viscosity, wettability) of a binder solution on solid particles surfaces, on the agglomeration kinetics. The experiments are carried out with water, aqueous solutions of sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylméthylcellulose or a non ionic surfactant oxo-C 10 C 6 at a critical micellar concentration. Concerning the process variables the experimental results show that an optimal interval of impeller speed operation exists ranging from 150 to 200 rpm for granule growth. Below, an uncontrollable agglomerate size and localised over-wetting occur, and above granule breakage occurs. Increasing the <b>liquid</b> <b>binder</b> flow rate reduces the extension of the non growth regime, but does not affect the granule mean size. The effect of the physicochemical properties is evaluated using a modified capillary viscous number, Ca′, that we define as the ratio between the viscous forces (μLU) and the work of adhesion Wa=γL(1 +cosθ). For Ca′b 1, the viscosity of the solution does not significantly affect the granulation process.

For comparison, experiments on dry sand are also performed with a modified configuration of the viscometer. The numerical model involves spherical, monodisperse particles with contact forces and a simple liquid bridge model for individual capillary bridges between two particles. Different liquid content and properties lead to different flow rheology when measuring the shear stress-strain relations. In the experiments of the weakly wetted granular material, the apparent shear viscosity TeX scales inversely proportional to the inertial number TeX, for all shear rates. On the contrary, in the dry case, an intermediate scaling regime inversely quadratic in TeX is observed for moderate shear rates.
