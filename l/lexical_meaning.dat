25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (big and small), hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E

Complete inflected words like verbs, nouns or adjectives are formed by adding further morphemes to a root.|$|E

2500|$|Right {{after the}} nominal marker can come a [...] "version" [...] marker. Phonologically, version markers consist {{of any one}} of the vowels except for /o/. Version markers are semantically diverse. They can add either an {{unpredictable}} <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> to the verb, or a functional meaning including causativity, passive voice, subjective version, objective version and locative version. For example, while v-ts'er means [...] "I write it", v-u-ts'er means [...] "I write it to him/her" [...] (objective version), v-a-ts'er means [...] "I write it on him/her" [...] (locative version), and v-i-ts'er means [...] "I write it (for myself)" [...] (subjective version).|$|E

2500|$|English is {{a highly}} nominalised language, and thus <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> is largely carried in nominal groups. This is {{partly because of the}} {{flexibility}} of these groups in encompassing premodifiers and qualification, and partly because of the availability of a special resource called the thematic equative, which has evolved as a means of packaging the message of a clause in the desired thematic form (for example, the clause [...] is [...] is structured as [...] = [...] ). Many things are most readily expressed in nominal constructions; this is particularly so in registers {{that have to do with}} the world of science and technology, where things, and the ideas behind them, are multiplying and proliferating all the time.|$|E
2500|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{virtually}} unpredictable whether the change in meaning (as compared to the mere sum of its elements) is attributed to one element or the whole compound. For example, élő adás ’live programme’ is written as two words, even though the word élő is used differently from its basic meaning – probably because {{it was decided that}} this component can carry the change of meaning, so writing the compound as one word is not necessary. On the other hand, gyorsétterem ’fast food restaurant’ (lit. ’fast restaurant’) is written as one word – probably because the change of meaning was attributed to the whole compound, leaving the <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word gyors intact. Some phrases without any change of meaning are written as one word, e.g. útitárs ’travel companion’, while most other phrases are written regularly: úti cél ’travel destination.’ ...|$|E

During this time Genie also used a few verb infinitives in her speech, in all instances clearly treating them as one word, and began adding the pronoun my to her possessive sentences and using the marker [...] 's [...] to indicate possession. Curtiss also noted that Genie never confused gender, although she only marked it through gender-specific nouns.|$|E

5000|$|For an {{understanding}} of this process, a distinction {{needs to be made}} between lexical items, or content words, which carry specific <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning,</b> and grammatical items, or function words, with little or no <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning,</b> which serve to express grammatical relationships between the different words in an utterance. Grammaticalization has been defined as [...] "the change whereby lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and, once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions". Simply said, grammaticalization is the process in which a lexical word or a word cluster loses some or all of its <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> and starts to fulfil a more grammatical function. Where grammaticalization takes place, nouns and verbs which carry certain <b>lexical</b> <b>meaning</b> develop over time into grammatical items such as auxiliaries, case markers, inflections, and sentence connectives.|$|E
50|$|Integrational Semantics treats <b>lexical</b> <b>{{meanings}}</b> (i.e., {{meanings of}} morphological or syntactic paradigms and their forms) as entities entirely different from syntactic meanings (meanings of simple or complex syntactic constituents obtained through syntactic meaning composition). Consequently, meaning composition, too, is construed differently for lexical and for syntactic <b>meanings.</b> Integrational <b>Lexical</b> Semantics (with Integrational Morphosemantics and Integrational Word Semantics as its parts) combines {{the psychological and}} the realist traditions in semantics. <b>Lexical</b> <b>meanings</b> are construed as concepts in a psychological sense: an n-place concept (with n > 0) is the property of being a (human) perception or conception in whose content a certain non-empty set of n-place attributes of real-world entities occurs as a subset. The set of attributes is called the (n-place) intension of the concept, and the set of real-world entities that have all attributes is called its (n-place) extension. The extension but not the intension may be empty. In {{the case of a}} 1-place concept, the attributes in the intension are properties, and the extension is a set of individual real-world objects. If n > 1, the attributes are n-place intensional relations between real-world entities, and the extension is the set of n-tuples of real-world entities among which the n-place relations in the intension hold. Such 'relational concepts' typically occur as <b>lexical</b> <b>meanings</b> of verbs and adpositions (prepositions, etc.) but also of other kinds of relational words. The only concept for which the notions of intension and extension are not defined is the (0-place) 'empty concept,' occurring as the <b>meaning</b> component of <b>lexical</b> words such as auxiliaries and modal particles, and of all affixes, that is, of linguistic entities whose contribution to meaning composition is not based on <b>lexical</b> <b>meanings.</b> Given the notion of empty concept, the IL conception of concepts is both flexible and powerful enough to assign <b>meanings</b> to <b>lexical</b> words of any kind.|$|R

However, there are also several methods of automated {{extraction of}} semantic properties of language units from corpora. In the paper we focus on emerging potentialities of these methods, {{as well as on}} their identified limitations. Evidence that can be collected from corpora is confronted with the existing models of formalised description of <b>lexical</b> <b>meanings.</b> Two basic paradigms of lexical semantics extraction are briefly described. Their properties are analysed on the basis of several experiments performed on Polish corpora. Several potential applications of the methods, including a system supporting expansion of a Polish wordnet, are discussed.

This orthodox picture seems to be in trouble these days, as an increasing number of authors now hold that semantics does not deal with thought-contents. Some of these authors have embraced a “thin meanings” view, according to which <b>lexical</b> <b>meanings</b> are too schematic to enter propositional contents. I will suggest that it is plausible to adopt thin semantics for a class of words.
