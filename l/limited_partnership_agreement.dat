40|$|The {{intricate}} procedural and data-driven decision {{trees that}} {{play a critical}} role in complex financial contracts like cash distribution waterfalls in structured finance agreement indentures (e. g., collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)), master <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreements,</b> and private equity fund agreements are inefficiently depicted as written contracts. As Professor Henry Hu explains in Too Complex to Depict?, the difficulty of translation—or depiction—between original mathematical models, plain English prospectuses, legal contracts, and programmed execution means that often the written depictions that form the basis of disclosures do not accurately define the act of execution. To overcome this, the SEC proposed an amendment to Regulation AB that would require disclosure of special-made cash flow waterfalls programs for asset-backed securities (ABS) to escape the limitations of language. British and Australian regulators have already implemented a similar code disclosure regime. Likewise, Professor Hu goes further and supports a “perfect information ” model that presumably would require disclosure of the actual computer programs used by, e. g., CDO trustees to execute cash distributions. These proposals and implementations create a new problem: perception. In the status quo...|$|R

For purposes of comparison, the article draws on patterns of dispute that are common in the older organizational forms that limited liability companies may supersede, specifically general and <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> and closely held corporations. The article is not comprehensive in its treatment; it concentrates on circumstances that test the force of norms and illustrate interrelationships among bodies of legal doctrine. Despite their differences, many LLC statutes defer substantially to the terms of the parties 2 ̆ 7 agreement, a fact that makes the craft of drafting organizational documents more important than in an organization that is more invasively structured by statute. In a contract-dominated organization, drafting failures - glitches, snafus, failures to anticipate the risk of opportunistic conduct - may well shape the resolution of subsequent disputes among participants that implicate fundamental aspects of their relationship. The article explores problems in the fit between contract law doctrine and issues likely to arise under LLC agreements, based on recent litigation involving comparable questions under <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{private equity}} {{industry}} receives {{billions of dollars}} in income each year from a variety of fees that it collects from investors as well as from companies it buys with investors' money. This fee income has come under increased scrutiny from investigative journalists, institutional investors in these funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the tax-paying public. Since 2012, private equity firms have been audited by the SEC; as a result, several abusive and possibly fraudulent practices have come to light. This report provides an overview of these abuses [...] the many ways in which some private equity (PE) firms and their general partners gain at the expense of their investors and tax-payers. Private equity general partners (GPs) have misallocated PE firm expenses and inappropriately charged them to investors; have failed to share income from portfolio company monitoring fees with their investors, as stipulated; have waived their fiduciary responsibility to pension funds and other LPs; have manipulated the value of companies in their fund's portfolio; and have collected transaction fees from portfolio companies without registering as broker-dealers as required by law. In some cases, these activities violate the specific terms and conditions of the <b>Limited</b> <b>Partnership</b> <b>Agreements</b> (LPAs) between GPs and their limited partner investors (LPs), while in others vague and misleading wording allows PE firms to take advantage of their asymmetric position of power vis-à-vis investors and the lack of transparency in their activities. In addition, some of these practices violate the U. S. tax code. Monitoring fees are a tax deductible expense for the portfolio companies owned by PE funds and greatly reduce the taxes these companies pay. In many cases, however, no monitoring services are actually provided and the payments are actually dividends, which are taxable, that are paid to the private equity firm...|$|R

50|$|The {{independent}} producer usually initiates the production—finding {{the script and}} starting the process. The producer finds the director and pursues the primary goals, to balance and coordinate business and financial aspects {{in the service of}} the creative realization of the playwright's vision. This may include casting, but often only includes casting approval. The producer may secure funds for the production, either through their own company or by bringing investors into the production in a <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement.</b> In this business structure, the producer becomes the general partner with unlimited liability, and because of this, often brings in other general partners. The producer probably has optioned the play from the playwright, which includes rights to future production for film and television. The producer earns the right to future ventures because the original theatrical production enhances the value of an artistic property. This right to further options may be included in the royalty agreement. In other duties, the producer may work with theatrical agents, negotiate with unions, find other staff, secure the theatre and rehearsal hall, obtain liability and workers' compensation insurance, and post bonds with unions.|$|E
5000|$|AFL {{football}} {{operations and}} training was overseen by veteran college and pro head coach, Mouse Davis, {{the father of}} the famed [...] "run and shoot" [...] offense, (which became the basis for the high scoring arena football offense still in use today). The other two 1987 teams were the Chicago Bruisers and the Denver Dynamite, (the ArenaBowl I champions). As the AFL grew into an established league with close to 20 teams, it defined itself as a major market pro sports product and welcomed commissioner C. David Baker (1996 - 2008). In the early 2000s the league appeared to have financially strong team ownership including NFL owners, as well as major names in the entertainment world, and, for a while, a weekly Sunday afternoon broadcast on NBC starting the week after the Super Bowl, during the stadium-played game's off season. The growth and establishment of the AFL as a major market league spawned a developmental league that Foster also helped co-found, a minor league called Arena Football 2 (af2), in 2000. The league was set up to operate in medium size markets around the U.S. where it has enjoyed growth under the guidance of af2 president, Jerry Kurz. Other people have started their own indoor football minor leagues. These leagues do not technically play arena football or use the proper name [...] "Arena Football" [...] which is a registered trademark, and initially because of the patent on the rules (specifically for the rebound nets, and related rules) that Foster obtained in 1990 (which was actually held by Gridiron Enterprises, Inc. of which Foster is one of three partners). The other two partners were Chicago based lawyers Bill Niro and Jerry Kurz, who in early 1987 joined Foster to help secure the patents on the Arena Football game system and re-establish the Arena Football League in early 1990 as a franchised league after successfully removing a small group of limited partners for multiple breaches of the <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement</b> that was the basis for operating the AFL during the 1988 season. The patents expired in 2007. The trademarks only cover the words [...] "arena football" [...] in succession; since 2017, other indoor leagues have described themselves as [...] "arena" [...] leagues in their name without official endorsement from Gridiron Enterprises (for example, the National Arena League and Arena Pro Football).|$|E
40|$|Insight {{into the}} flow of capital into venture capital (VC) funds is {{fundamental}} {{to our understanding of}} the overall flow of capital into entrepreneurial ventures. To understand the processes and criteria utilized by limited partners (LPs) in the selection of the VC funds in which they invest we studied 21 European fund-of-fund investment management firms that actively invest in VC funds. We have demonstrated that such LPs utilize structured selection processes and criteria that are comparable to those used by VCs themselves, but with important differences. Notably, we found that LPs build early consensus within the investment team via a stage we have termed ratification. In selecting VCs, quantitative measures of reputation via historical performance are important, consistent with previous findings, but we found that reputation also captures opinions from entrepreneurs, other LPs and other VCs. We found that nurturing informal relationships outside the formal <b>limited</b> <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement</b> is an important component of LPs' decisions to invest and that LPs may pre-allocate capital to VCs with whom a relationship exists already. We conclude that early relationship building with potential LPs is an essential prerequisite for VCs aiming to raise a first fund. ...|$|E
50|$|Forms {{of legal}} {{ownership}} structures that non-profits create include general <b>partnerships,</b> <b>limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> and <b>limited</b> liability companies (LLC). In a general partnership, {{two or more}} entities come {{together to form a}} new business entity where each partner is jointly and severally liable for all legal and financial obligations. Also,each member has a right to participate in all partnership decisions unless specified otherwise in the <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement.</b> <b>Partnerships</b> are not tax entities, so all tax consequences are passed directly to individual partners; partners agree to shares of tax consequences, as well as cash flow and appreciation of the project. <b>Limited</b> <b>partnerships</b> are similar to a general partnership except that one or more partners act as a general partner, {{and the rest of the}} partners are limited partners. Limited partners are treated differently than general partners in that they are only liable for the capital invested and cannot participate in routine operations or decisions of the partnership without losing their limited liability protection. The <b>partnership</b> <b>agreement</b> defines the responsibility of each partner and how the share profits and tax consequences. An LLC combines the advantages of a corporation for personal liability purposes (liability is limited to the amount of capital invested) and those of a partnership for tax purposes (the entity is not taxed).|$|R
