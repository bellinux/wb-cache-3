5|$|Stela 5 was {{situated}} {{at the base of}} Structure 1 in the East Plaza. It was carved with a rounded frame containing a figure in profile facing to the left. The figure is standing with the <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> and is wearing a feathered headdress and bears a zoomorphic head on its back, from which hang more feathers. The hands of the figure are extended forward and appear to bear a staff of rulership. The stela bears a hieroglyphic panel with an incomplete dedicatory date that must fall within the range from December 740 to November 805. The text also contains the name of the king who dedicated the stela, Shield Jaguar, and the Emblem Glyph of El Chal.|$|E

25|$|Legs and Feet: Receptive negotiators {{sit with}} <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> or one leg {{slightly}} {{in front of}} the other. When standing, they distribute weight evenly and place hands on their hips with their body tilted toward the speaker. Non-receptive negotiators stand with legs crossed, pointing away from the speaker.|$|E

50|$|The {{anterior}} intercondylar area (or anterior intercondyloid fossa) {{is an area}} on the tibia, a bone in {{the lower}} <b>leg.</b> <b>Together</b> with the posterior intercondylar area it makes up the intercondylar area.|$|R

25|$|Unlike when {{a person}} is {{suspended}} by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their <b>legs</b> <b>together,</b> or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|E
25|$|Whitley was a {{longtime}} alcoholic, who began drinking {{early in his}} career at bluegrass gigs, long before he was legally allowed to drink alcohol. Many times, he had attempted to overcome his alcoholism, but failed; and his pre-existing depression made it more challenging for him to quit. Moreover, Whitley preferred to drink alone, making it difficult for anyone to detect that he had a problem. According to Lorrie Morgan, she tried to conceal all alcoholic beverages from him at the home they shared, even going to the extent of binding their <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> before going to bed to make it impossible for Whitley to awaken {{in the middle of the}} night to consume a drink without her knowledge - only to discover that he would drink various items such as perfume and nail polish remover to get intoxicated.|$|E

2500|$|Paddy Doyle of Finglas, {{who lost}} his daughter, son-in-law, and two infant granddaughters in the Parnell Street explosion, {{described}} the scene inside Dublin's city morgue as having been like a [...] "slaughterhouse", with workers [...] "putting arms and <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> {{to make up a}} body".|$|E
2500|$|Stacked Pad Slide: When a goaltender {{is on the}} angle, often {{a sudden}} pass close to the net will leave the net {{relatively}} unguarded. Stacking the pads is a desperation move in which the goaltender slides feet-first, with <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> (and consequently, [...] "stacked"), across the crease, attempting to cover as much space as possible.|$|E
2500|$|A beast salient (Latin: saliēns, [...] "leaping") (also springing) is leaping, {{with both}} hind <b>legs</b> <b>{{together}}</b> {{on the ground}} and both forelegs together in the air. This is a very rare position for a lion, but is also used of other heraldic beasts. The stag and other docile animals in this position are often termed springing. Certain smaller animals are sometimes blazoned as saltant rather than salient.|$|E

"Bucking and gagging" [...] {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of sitting a soldier on the ground, gagging him, then tying his arms and <b>legs</b> <b>together,</b> knees between his arms and a rod or stick inserted over his elbows and under his knees. [...] A [...] "barrel shirt" [...] refers to a barrel that had holes for the soldier's arms, which he wore to indicate that he had committed some offense.|$|E
2500|$|Volant {{describes}} an eagle in profile shown in flight with wings shown addorsed and elevated and its <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> and tucked under. It is considered in bend ("diagonal") {{as it is}} flying from the lower sinister (heraldic left, from the shield-holder's point of view) to the upper dexter (heraldic right, from the shield-holder's point of view) of the field. However, the term [...] "in bend" [...] is not used unless a bend is actually on the field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legs are}} splayed at angles fore-and-aft (rake) {{as well as}} {{side-to-side}} (splay) to provide actual and visual support of the person sitting. [...] Early chairs made in America usually have stretchers connecting {{the front and back}} legs and a cross stretcher connecting the two side stretchers, creating what is known as an [...] "H" [...] stretcher assembly. A common misconception about this assembly is that the stretchers hold the <b>legs</b> <b>together</b> in order to keep them from pulling apart. In the traditional Windsor design, the wedged tenon joint which joins each leg to the seat is strong enough in itself to prevent the legs from creeping outward. The stretcher system actually pushes the legs apart to retain the necessary tension which reduces slack.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the Italian was again at hand. In one pocket he carried a thin but strong line, in a twinkle he had tied one fore and one hind <b>leg</b> <b>together,</b> so that the bear, when he got up again, could do little but hobble along. Then from another pocket he drew a leather muzzle, which he buckled over the beast's head. But the bear had had all of the ugliness knocked out him and was once more as docile as ever.|$|R
