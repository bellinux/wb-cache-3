[...] Washington moved down to a more exposed position, assuming Howe was going to embark his army on ships. [...] Howe then launched a lightning strike designed to cut Washington's retreat off. [...] This attempt was foiled by the Battle of Short Hills, which gave Washington time to retreat to a more secure position. [...] Howe then did in fact embark his army and sailed south with his brother's fleet. [...] Howe maintained an effective secrecy surrounding the fleet's destination: not only did Washington not know where it was going, neither did many British rank and file.|$|E

The investigative work comprised a survey of selected practices in the city of Nis, with a questionnaire and visits to examine <b>light</b> <b>units.</b> 40 <b>light</b> <b>units</b> were examined in 27 practices according to a standardized protocol. The use and care of the <b>light</b> <b>units</b> included in the study were found to be very variable.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{investigated}} the effect of infection control barrier thickness on power density, wave-length, and light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units.</b> Materials and Methods: Infection control barrier (Cleanwrap) in one-fold, two-fold, four-fold, and eight-fold, and a halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Optilux 360) and a light emitting diode (LED) <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> (Elipar FreeLight 2) were used in this study. Power density of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> with infection control barriers covering the fiberoptic bundle was measured with a hand held dental radiometer (Cure Rite). Wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> fixed on a custom made optical breadboard was measured with a portable spectroradiometer (CS- 1000). Light diffusion of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was photographed with DSLR (Nikon D 70 s) as above. Results: Power density decreased significantly as the layer thickness of the infection control barrier increased, except the one-fold and two-fold in halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit.</b> Especially, when the barrier was four-fold and more in the halogen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit,</b> the decrease of power density was more prominent. The wavelength of <b>light</b> curing <b>units</b> was not affected by the barriers and almost no change was detected in the peak wavelength. Light diffusion of LED <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> was not affected by barriers, however, halo-gen <b>light</b> curing <b>unit</b> showed decrease in light diffusion angle when the barrier was four-fold and statisti...|$|R

50|$|Each <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> {{consists}} {{of one or}} more light sources, red filters and lenses. Each <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> emits a high-intensity beam. The lower segment of the beam is red, and the upper part is white. The transition between the two colours must take place over an angle not greater than three minutes of arc. This characteristic makes the color change very conspicuous, a key feature of the PAPI signal. To form the PAPI guidance signal, the color transition boundaries of the four units are fixed at different angles. The lowest angle is used for the unit furthest from the runway, the highest for the unit nearest to the runway. The designated glideslope is midway between the second and third <b>light</b> <b>unit</b> settings. Depending on the position of the aircraft relative to the specified angle of approach, the lights will appear either red or white to the pilot. The pilot will have reached the normal glidepath (usually 3 degrees) when there is an equal number of red and white lights. If an aircraft is beneath the glidepath, red lights will outnumber white; if an aircraft is above the glidepath, more white lights are visible.|$|E

The effect will have been unremarkable to North American drivers, but triggered comment in Europe.
