5000|$|In Canada, {{motor vehicle}} <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> are {{issued by the}} {{transportation}} department in each province and territory. They honour veterans by issuing a special type of <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> that is available only to veterans. Between 2002 and 2005, a trend struck the licence authorities which prompted them to issue veteran <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b> The only territory {{that does not have}} a veteran <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> is Nunavut. A common feature of these veteran <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> is the image of a red poppy or the word [...] "veteran" [...] (or both). Only veteran <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> issued by the Northwest Territories do not have any of the features mentioned above.|$|R

Domestic plates were issued by the DND after 1968. By contrast, tactical vehicles of the United States military do not bear <b>licence</b> <b>plates,</b> even if they travel regularly on public streets and highways.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the problem}} of recognising vehicle <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> of which the sym¬bols can not be segmented by standard image processing techniques is addressed. Most <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> recognition systems proposed in the literature do not compensate for dis¬torted, obscured and damaged <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b> We implemented a novel system which uses a neural network/ hidden Markov model hybrid for <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> recognition. We implemented a region growing algorithm, which was shown to work well when used to extract the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> from a vehicle image. Our vertical edges algorithm was not as successful. We also used the region growing algorithm to separate the symbols in the <b>licence</b> <b>plate.</b> Where the region growing algorithm failed, possible symbol borders were identified by calculating local minima of a vertical projection of the region. A multilayer perceptron neural network was used to estimate symbol probabilities of all the possible symbols in the region. The <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbols were the inputs of the neural network, and were scaled to a constant size. We found that 7 x 12 gave the best character recognition rate. Out of 2117 <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbols we achieved a symbol recognition rate of 99. 53 %. By using the vertical projection of a <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> image, {{we were able to}} separate the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbols out of images for which the region growing algorithm failed. Legal <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> sequences were used to construct a hidden Markov model contain¬ing all allowed symbol orderings. By adapting the Viterbi algorithm with sequencing constraints, the most likely <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbol sequences were calculated, along with a confidence measure. The confidence measure enabled us to use more than one <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> and symbol segmentation technique. Our recognition rate increased dramatically when we com¬bined the different techniques. The results obtained showed that the system developed worked well, and achieved a <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> recognition rate of 93. 7 %.

25|$|Vehicle <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> in Singapore are {{the same}} 520mm x 110mm size found in many European countries. Red <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> {{indicate}} that the car may be driven only during off-peak times unless a daily fee is paid. Off peak times are from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. on weekdays and all day on Saturdays and Sundays. Since the end of January 2010, off-peak car usage is no longer restricted on Saturday, Sunday, and the days before public holidays. Off-peak <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> cost less than regular ones.

5000|$|Many provinces {{distinguish}} their <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> through distinctive colour {{schemes and}} logos, which {{have historically been}} changed annually. For example, the reigning monarch's crown has appeared on every Ontario <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> - including customized plates with no [...] "dash", {{in the form of}} a second validation sticker - since 1937. <b>Licence</b> <b>plates</b> of the Yukon have long featured a prospector panning for gold.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of a system for detection and recognition of license plates. The work {{is divided into three}} basic parts: <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> detection, finding of character positions and optical character recognition. To fullfill the goal of this work, a new dataset was taken. It contains 2814 license plates used for training classifiers and 2620 plates to evaluate the success rate of the system. Cascade Classifier was used to train detector of <b>licence</b> <b>plates,</b> which has success rate up to 97. 8 %. After that, pozitions of individual characters were searched in detected pozitions of <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b> If there was no character found, detected pozition was not the <b>licence</b> <b>plate.</b> Success rate of <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> detection with all the characters found is up to 88. 5 %. Character recognition is performed by SVM classifier. The system detects successfully with no errors up to 97. 7 % of all <b>licence</b> <b>plates.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{optimising}} the recognition of ve-hicle <b>licence</b> <b>plates</b> with multiple segmentation methods. Two different <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> search algorithms and seven symbol seg-mentation techniques are compared. The two search algorithms are: a region-growing algorithm (RGA) and an algorithm based on vertical edge detection (VEDA). The two search algorithms identify a <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> region in the image, from which the sym-bol segmentation techniques extract the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbols. Once the region in which the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> is located is iden-tified, seven algorithms are used to segment the <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbols. These algorithms comprise different combinations of simple segmentation, thresholding on the vertical projection, single and double frame Viterbi searches and filtering the data. Once the symbols have been identified, a multilayer perceptron neural network is used to estimate symbol probabilities of all the possible symbols. Legal <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> sequences are used to construct a Markov model containing all allowed symbol order-ings. By adapting the Viterbi algorithm with sequencing con-straints, the most likely <b>licence</b> <b>plate</b> symbol sequences are cal-culated, along with a measure of their likelihoods. Each tech-nique generates a recognition confidence score, which allows for combining and weighing the different methods to achieve the best segmentation results. Our results presented in this pa-per show that by combining the pre-segmentation techniques, the average score and the recognition rate improves. 1...|$|R
