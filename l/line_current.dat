Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC <b>line</b> <b>current</b> waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required to brake the motor.|$|E

Past Newton, Route 31 continued northeast to the New York state <b>line</b> (<b>current</b> US 206 {{north of here}} was Route S31). In the original version of the renumbering bill, Route 31 was to reach the border via Sussex, incorporating pre-1927 Route 8 (now Route 284) from Sussex to the state line. However, in the final version, Route 31 ran via Hamburg, using the same alignment as a planned spur of pre-1927 Route 8 from Lafayette to North Church.

25|$|Power factors below 1.0 {{require a}} utility to {{generate}} more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the apparent power would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. <b>Line</b> <b>current</b> in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to {{the square of the}} current). Alternatively all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current.|$|E

[...] A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical.

[...] Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. [...] This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor [...] with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground.
