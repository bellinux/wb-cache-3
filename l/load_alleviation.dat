40|$|Wake vortex encounters, {{occurring}} in air transport operations, involve substantial loads, which {{can result in}} aggravated flight-path upsets. In order to explore flight control system design for alleviation, the alleviatory effects of conventional flight control surface deflections, upon wake vortex encounter loads has been examined. For this, data was gathered during NRC T 33 wake turbulence flight research, of Heavy and Super Category jet transports engaged in enroute operations. Comparative data consists of stick-fixed wake vortex encounters and manually-applied alleviatory control inputs to conventional flight control surfaces. For the alleviatory control-input case, the inputs are experience-based, fully-learned, in other words categorised as instinctive. As such, they were of a high frequency-band, for manual control inputs. Thus, they represent a close-to-limit ability to alleviate wake vortex encounter loads, for the T 33 with manual control inputs. The reduction in loads between the two cases, stick-fixed and stick-alleviatory was {{of the order of}} 50 - 60 %.

Piezoelectric materials have been extensively used for active vibration control of engineering structures. In this paper, piezoelectric materials further attempt {{to suppress the}} vibration of the aeroelastic wing caused by gust. The motion equation of the flexible wing with piezoelectric patches is obtained by Hamilton’s principle with the modal approach, and then numerical gust responses are analyzed, based on which a gust <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> (GLA) control system is proposed. The gust <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> system employs classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers which treat piezoelectric patches as control actuators and acceleration as the feedback signal.

40|$|An {{investigation}} into two distinct novel adaptive structures concepts is performed {{with a view}} to improving the aerodynamic efficiency of aircraft wings. The main focus of the work is on the development of a rotating spars concept that enables the adaptive aeroelastic shape control of aircraft wings in order to reduce drag. By altering the orientation of the internal wing structure, it becomes possible to control the flexural and torsional stiffnesses of the wing, as well as the position of the elastic axis. It follows then that control of the aeroelastic deformation is also possible. Consequently, the aerodynamic performance can be tailored, and more specifically the lift-to-drag ratio can be maximised through continuous adjustment of the structure. To gain a thorough understanding of the effect of the concept on a wing, an assumed modes static aeroelastic model is developed, and studies are performed using this. These studies establish guidelines with regards to the effective design of a wing incorporating the rotating spars concept. The findings of these studies are then used to establish a baseline design for a wind tunnel model. A finite element model of this is constructed and aeroelastic analyses are used to improve the model and arrive at the final experimental wing design. The wind tunnel tests confirm analytical trends and the robustness of an approach to automaticallyadapt the structure to maintain an aerodynamic performance objective. The remainder of the work investigates the application of an all-moving wing tip device with an adaptive torsional stiffness attachment as a passive <b>loads</b> <b>alleviation</b> system. Through consideration of the attachment stiffness and position, it is possible to tune the device throughout flight in order to minimise the loads that are introduced into the aircraft structure in response to a gust or manoeuvre. A dynamic aeroelastic wing model incorporating the device is developed and used to perform parameter studies; this gives an insight into the sizing and placement of the device. Next, a finite element representation of a conceptual High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aircraft is used as a baseline platform for the device. Aeroelastic analyses are performed for the baseline and modified models to investigate the effect of the attachment stiffness and position on the gust response and aeroelastic stability of the system. The reduced loading within thestructure of the modified aircraft then enables the model to be optimised {{in order to reduce the}} mass of the aircraft.

40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable energy production methods {{is an important}} aspect in lowering the emission of greenhouse gases and exhaustion of fossil fuels. Wind energy is recognized globally {{as one of the}} most promising sustainable forms of electricity generation, but the cost of offshore wind energy does not meet the level of fossil-based energy sources. An opportunity for wind energy cost reduction is the deployment of two-bladed wind turbines at offshore locations. Two-bladed turbines save the mass and cost of one rotor blade, which allows the entire wind turbine construction to be designed lighter, and in effect leads to lower initial costs. Moreover, reduction of harmonic fatigue loads on blades and other turbine parts using Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is a way to extend the turbine lifetime. This type of control, using a feedback control structure incorporating the Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC) transformation, is capable of mitigating the most dominant periodic loads. It is generally known that significant turbine load reductions can be achieved using IPC, however, it is unclear to what extent the MBC pitch signal is optimal in terms of <b>load</b> <b>alleviations.</b> The main goal of this thesis is to develop a self-learning feedforward IPC strategy for a state-ofthe- art two-bladed wind turbine. This IPC strategy will be compared to the conventional feedback IPC implementation. By making use of properties of the MBC transformation, implementations of yaw control by IPC in different configurations are evaluated in terms of performance and stability. As a preparation for the comparison between conventional feedback and self-learning feedforward IPC strategies, a linear control-oriented model from blade pitch angles to harmonic blade loads is identified and used throughout this work for two main purposes. The first purpose is to reveal the level of interaction between both blades, which turns out to be negligible. On the basis of this reasoning, an appropriate cost-function is implemented for optimization of the feedforward controller. The second purpose of the linear model is the simplified and faster {{development of}} the Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) algorithm, which is later implemented in high-fidelity non-linear wind turbine simulation software. IFT is a self-learning model-free algorithm, and is used to optimize the rotor-position dependent feedforward IPC implementation. It is shown that the self-learning algorithm succeeds in optimization of the feedforward controller at all constant wind speeds, but also in more realistic turbulent wind conditions in the above-rated region. As the feedforward controller generates a constant amplitude pitch signal for each wind speed, the amplitude of the feedforward pitch signal is gain-scheduled on exogenous load signals, in an effort to improve feedforward performance. Results show that the conventional IPC strategy is optimal in terms of load reductions in steady state wind conditions, as the IFT algorithm optimizes to the exact same pitch signal at various constant wind speeds. In turbulent wind conditions, performance results indicate that the constant amplitude feedforward controller is able to attain significant load reductions, but that the performance of the conventional feedback control method is still superior. Comparing the pitch signals of both controllers in turbulent wind conditions, reveals that the conventional method continuously changes the phase of the implemented pitch signal, which is not driven by the varying rotor speed. To see how these changing pitch periodics have an effect on the load reduction capabilities, the feedforward (rotor speed dependent) pitch signal amplitude is scheduled on exogenous signals in various ways. This scheduling shows only minor performance improvements, and it can be concluded that the frequency changes in the pitch signal imposed by MBC, help to actively mitigate periodic blade loads. Using both the azimuth and blade load measurements, the conventional IPC strategy seems to actively track and mitigate the current present blade load harmonic, and it appears to be a serious challenge to develop control strategies that can improve performance already attained by MBC.

Numerical studies are conducted to investigate the beneficial effects on the aerodynamic characteristics of the quasi “Global Hawk” airfoil using arrays of jets during the gust process.

An unsteady surface transpiration boundary condition is enforced over a user specified portion of the airfoil's surface to emulate the time dependent velocity boundary conditions.

Specific bacterial genomes that were correlated with urine levels of these detrimental co-metabolites were found to encode enzyme genes for production of their precursors by fermentation of choline or tryptophan in the gut. When transplanted into germ-free mice, the pre-intervention gut microbiota induced higher inflammation and larger adipocytes compared with the post-intervention microbiota from the same volunteer. Our multi-omics-based systems analysis indicates a significant etiological contribution of dysbiotic gut microbiota to both genetic and simple obesity in children, implicating a potentially effective target for alleviation. Research in contextPoorly managed diet and genetic mutations are the two primary driving forces behind the devastating epidemic of obesity-related diseases. Lack {{of understanding of the}} molecular chain of causation between the driving forces and the disease endpoints retards progress in prevention and treatment of the diseases. We found that children genetically obese with Prader–Willi syndrome shared a similar dysbiosis in their gut microbiota with those having diet-related obesity. A diet rich in non-digestible but fermentable carbohydrates significantly promoted beneficial groups of bacteria and reduced toxin-producers, which contributes to the alleviation of metabolic deteriorations in obesity regardless of the primary driving forces...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNatural Laminar Flow (NLF) is, in aerodynamics, {{one of the}} key {{technologies}} that could lead to the most important improvement in aircraft performance at cruise, with significant reduction of fuel consumption and consequently of environmental pollutants emission. Within the GRA ITD project this technology has been applied and assessed to Regional Aircraft concepts of 130 passengers for a range of 3, 000 nm, cruise Mach 0. 74 and Flight level 35, 000 ft, with rear fuselage engine installation. Aircraft preliminary design studies have delivered challenging top-level performance requirements, at cruise and low speed, general geometrical characteristics and weight assessment. In order to meet such requirements the wing design has been achieved in three steps: aerodynamic design at cruise trying to maximise the benefit of NLF technology, aeroelastic and structural design by multi-disciplinary optimisation (MDO), aerodynamic and kinematic design of high lift devices (HLD). The aerodynamic wing design was performed with the objective of an extended laminar flow at cruise, with constraints on buffet margins and maximum lift in low speed conditions. This design was done with high fidelity CFD methods. Different design loops were performed. Despite the limitations due to low speed constraints, it was possible to obtain laminar flow extent over 60 % chord and lift-to-drag ratio around 25 for the wing-fuselage configuration at cruise design point. Surface roughness, being a critical issue for laminar flows, was investigated and manufacturing requirements were defined. A further step in the design was the development of wing aeroelastic model. It was done by an MDO process to reduce wing bending moment design loads through tailored torsional stiffness, so to minimise wing box structural weight, by taking into account aerodynamics, static/dynamic loads and aeroelasticity. The next step was the numerical aerodynamic design and the definition of preliminary kinematic systems of several HLDs, matching the maximum lift requirement at landing. A slotted flap concept combined with a Krueger slat was selected after a down-selection process, relying on the results of 3 D CFD/CAA analyses, 2 D WT tests results and by also considering structural impact, complexity issues, maturity level, etc. The aerodynamic and aeroelastic wing designs will be validated through transonic WT tests on a (1 : 3) scale half-wing innovative flexible model reproducing the wing structural static deformation, to assess laminar flow extent at cruise and <b>load</b> control & <b>alleviation</b> devices performances in high-speed off-design conditions under a realistic high-Reynolds experimental environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} gusts and {{turbulence}} do not only affect adversely the passenger comfort but also create significant aircraft loads. That´s why gust <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> {{plays an important}} role for the development of load control strategies. DLR has a comprehensive know-how in the field of control systems design for aerospace applications especially the design of gust <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> systems, their demonstration and assessment. Based on this experience a gust <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> system (GLAS) was designed within the frame of the European AWIATOR project based on a feed-forward disturbance compensation. To follow this concept the determination of the disturbances respective the gusts/turbulence is essential. Assuming to have direct lift control surfaces available the reduction of vertical accelerations and alleviation of loads can be envisaged. Thus, {{it is not necessary to}} determine the complete three dimensional air mass motion but to compute precisely its vertical fluctuation. This can be done by usingsimplified flight mechanics relations. The computed vertical gust component is used to trigger the GLAS. The principle design of the GLAS is focused on reduction of vertical accelerations (nz) caused by turbulence. This design in mainly related to the improvement of passenger comfort. Simulation results have shown that this design yields an overcompensation of structural loads caused by turbulance. To avoid this overcompensation, we performed an optimization based tuning of the GLAS. The simulation results for this advanced GLAS show very good performance for <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> and also improvement of passenger comfort. However, depending on the flight case it may be interesting to choose between parameterizations of the GLAS, e. g. focus on passenger comfort improvement in cruise condition and focus on <b>load</b> <b>alleviation</b> on points of the flight envelope where already high loads arise (sizing cases). In addition, Pareto-bounds were calculated to allow a choise between compromise solutions for wing load and HTP load reduction. The advanced GLAS also contains dynamics filters to consider the structural modes and to avoid the unintentional excitations of the aircraft structure stimulated by the gust and turbulance or by GLAS itself...|$|E
