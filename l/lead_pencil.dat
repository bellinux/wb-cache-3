5|$|The {{first edition}} was {{illustrated}} with paintings by the Swiss artist Samuel Hieronymus Grimm, engraved by W. Angus and aquatinted. Grimm {{had lived in}} England since 1768, and was quite a famous artist, costing 2½ guineas per week. In the event, he stayed in Selborne for 28 days, and White recorded that he worked very hard on 24 of them. White also described Grimm's method, which was to sketch the landscape in <b>lead</b> <b>pencil,</b> then {{to put in the}} shading, and finally to add a light wash of watercolour. The illustrations were engraved (signed at lower right) by a variety of engravers including William Angus and Peter Mazell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wine}} {{regions of the}} Left Bank, the Cabernet {{influence}} of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Estèphe and Pessac-Léognan, the grape develops more mineral flavors. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong <b>lead</b> <b>pencil</b> scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavors while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavors, though in less intense wines over all. The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on terroir and the winemakers styles {{as well as the}} vintage. The First Growth estates of Château Mouton Rothschild and Château Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentage of Cabernet— often around 75%.|$|E
25|$|Munroe {{had then}} made a {{business}} out of making lead pencils. He made the graphite formula for his pencils in secret, with only {{the help of his}} wife. The business was quite successful. By 1814 he had made nearly 175,000 pencils, which sold for about six thousand dollars, a very large amount of money at the time. When the war with England ended there were better pencils available from Europe and his profits were erased by these better imports. Munroe figured it was pointless to try to compete against these superior products so took up his normal trade of cabinet-making. He also made tooth brushes and watchmaker's brushes, also the first made in the United States. During this interim time {{he went back to the}} drawing board to do further experimenting with his secret <b>lead</b> <b>pencil</b> paste. One thing led to another until he came up with a powdered graphite paste product that would make its mark.|$|E

The planned artwork will cover the west wall of the station with depictions of architectural features found in the University District, including fire escapes and windows with screens that display historic images of the neighborhood.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, St Andrew's {{suffered}} 20 direct {{hits from}} Luftwaffe bombing, which destroyed {{the roof of}} the Kop, badly damaged the Railway End, and forced the team to play elsewhere. It was therefore a surprising choice of venue for a wartime international match between England and Wales; on safety grounds, spectators were required to purchase tickets in advance, and numbers were limited to 25,000. Three months later, the Main Stand, which was being used as a temporary National Fire Service station, burned down, destroying the club's records and equipment – [...] "not so much as a <b>lead</b> <b>pencil</b> was saved from the wreckage" [...] – when a fireman mistook a bucket of petrol for water when intending to damp down a brazier. The team returned to the ground in 1943.|$|E

It might be the instrument of the crime. Only, there isn't any crime. The only other things are a few old missals and little Catholic pictures, which the Ogilvies kept, I suppose, from the Middle Ages--their family pride being stronger than their Puritanism. We only {{put them in the}} museum because they seem curiously cut about and defaced." ...|$|R
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, <b>pencil</b> <b>leads</b> in wooden <b>pencils</b> {{have never been}} made from <b>lead.</b> When the <b>pencil</b> {{originated}} as a wrapped graphite writing tool, the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago (literally, act for lead or lead mockup).|$|R
2500|$|De Cort {{is known}} for his {{topographical}} views of English and Welsh landscapes. [...] These were painted in an Italianate idiom indebted to the style of Gaspar Dughet. He often painted on specially prepared mahogany panels. [...] His style was described by the painter Joseph Farington as follows: 'his ground prepared light, this to draw his outline with black <b>lead</b> <b>pencil,</b> then to pass oil over it, and on that tint to glaze his shadows and embody his lights'. Some traces of under drawing and pentimenti are visible in this work.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|With over [...] planted under vine, the Loire Valley {{is about}} two-thirds {{the size of}} the Bordeaux wine region. Due to its {{location}} and marginal climate, the overall quality of a vintage has a dramatic effect {{on the quality of the}} region's winesmore so than with other French wine regions. The most common hazard is that the cool climate will prevent the grapes from ripening fully and developing the sugars needed to balance the naturally high acidity of the grapes. During these cool vintages the Sauvignon blanc based wines are lighter in color, less fruity and have more pronounced mineral notes. The Cabernet franc based wines are also lighter in color with more vegetal or [...] "weed"-like aromas. In riper vintages, a Loire Cabernet franc will develop aromas of raspberries and <b>lead</b> <b>pencil</b> shavings.|$|E
2500|$|... "Bolte", {{the then}} Premier of Victoria, Sir Henry Bolte, {{considered}} this objectionable. A front-page article in The Age on 4 May 1967 reported that, {{in response to}} Bolte's protests, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Frank Woods, had apologised by letter to the premier, clarifying that the inscription had neither {{been included in the}} original design brief nor had any [...] "official authorisation". The article {{went on to say that}} the offending words had been erased, although the vicar, Harry Smythe (1923-2005), refused to confirm just how this had been done. Zika remained unrepentant. [...] There are various theories as to how the inscription was hidden including the rubbing of a burnt cork over the offending words or similarly the covering of the etched inscription using a soft <b>lead</b> <b>pencil.</b> [...] Cleaning of the window over the years has revealed the inscription – the [...] "removal" [...] was achieved in 1967 by filling in the etching with a soft leaded pencil. Today, however, the Latin inscription is visible once again.|$|E

2500|$|... 835 works survived into {{modern times}} in {{original}} form and partly in prints engraved on metal and wood by Russian {{and other foreign}} engravers, while some works survived as copies done by painters while Shevchenko still lived. There is data on over 270 more works which were lost and have not been found yet. Painted and engraved works {{at the time of}} completion are dated 1830-1861 and are territorially related to Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan. The genres are - portraits, compositions on mythological, historical and household themes, architectural landscapes and scenery. The techniques used for that were oil painting on canvas, watercolor, sepia, inking, <b>lead</b> <b>pencil,</b> as well as etching on separate sheets of white, colored and tinted paper of different sizes and in five albums. A significant part of Shevchenko's artistic heritage consists of completed paintings, however there are also sketches, etudes and outlines which are no less valuable for understanding Shevchenko's methods and artistic path. Of all Shevchenko's paintings only a small part has any authorial signatures or inscriptions and even smaller part has dates.|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{initiated}} with a curiosity to investigate the elemental composition and magnetic response of different grades of <b>lead</b> <b>pencils</b> (6 B, 2 B, HB, 2 H, 5 H) that people use in daily life. Interestingly, experimental results landed with a great achievement of observing soft magnetism in <b>lead</b> <b>pencils,</b> indicating a wide scope of magnetic tuning for room temperature applications. A novel magnetic composite has been synthesized by mixing different concentration of CoFe 2 O 4 (CF) nanoparticles in 5 H and 6 B pencils for studying the magnetic tailoring aspects using pencils. Our results showed different possibilities of controlling disorder induced ferromagnetic parameters and a simple approach of producing sufficiently high coercive magnetic composite using pencils...|$|R
