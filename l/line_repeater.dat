50|$|Belevitch {{obtained}} complete {{solutions for}} conference matrices for all values of n up to 38 and provided circuits {{for some of}} the smaller matrices. An ideal conference network is one where the loss of signal is entirely due to the signal being split between multiple conference subscriber ports. That is, there are no dissipation losses within the network. The network must contain ideal transformers only and no resistances. An n-port ideal conference network exists if and only if there exists a conference matrix of order n. For instance, a 3-port conference network can be constructed with the well-known hybrid transformer circuit used for 2-wire to 4-wire conversion in telephone handsets and <b>line</b> <b>repeaters.</b> However, there is no order 3 conference matrix and this circuit does not produce an ideal conference network. A resistance is needed for matching which dissipates signal, or else signal is lost through mismatch.As mentioned above, a necessary condition for a conference matrix to exist is that n&minus;1 must be the sum of two squares. Where {{there is more than one}} possible sum of two squares for n&minus;1 there will exist multiple essentially different solutions for the corresponding conference network. This situation occurs at n of 26 and 66. The networks are particularly simple when n&minus;1 is a perfect square (n = 2, 10, 26, …).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} transmission in relatively wide-stretched {{power line communication}} (PLC) networks, where repeaters are required to bridge the source-to-destination distance. In particular, {{it is assumed that}} each network node is a potential repeater and that multihop transmission is accomplished in an ad hoc fashion without the need for complex routing protocols. In such a scenario, due to the broadcasting nature of the power <b>line</b> channel, multiple <b>repeater</b> nodes may receive and retransmit the source message simultaneously. It is shown that, if no further signal processing is applied at the transmitter, simultaneous retransmission often deteriorates performance compared with single-node retransmission. We therefore advocate the application of distributed space–time block codes (DSTBCs) to the problem at hand. More specifically, we propose that each network node is assigned a unique signature sequence, which allows efficient combining at the receiver. Most notably, DSTBC-based retransmission does not require explicit collaboration among network nodes for multihop transmission and detection complexity is not increased compared with single-node retransmission. Numerical results for multihop transmission over PLC networks show that DSTBC-based retransmission achieves a considerably improved performance in terms of required transmit power and multihop delay compared with alternative retransmission strategies.

40|$|Repeaters {{are often}} used to drive high {{impedance}} interconnects. These lines have become highly inductive and can affect signal behavior. The line inductance should therefore be considered in determining the optimum number {{and size of the}} <b>repeaters</b> driving a <b>line.</b> The optimum <b>repeater</b> system uses uniform repeater insertion in order to achieve the minimum propagation delay. A tradeoff exists, however, between the transient power dissipation and the minimum propagation delay in sizing long interconnects driven by the optimum repeater system. Optimizing the line width to achieve the minimum power delay product, however, can satisfy current high speed, low-power design objectives. A reduction in power of 65 % and delay of 97 % is achieved for an example repeater system. The Power-Delay-Area-Product (PDAP) criterion is introduced as an efficient technique to size the interconnect within a repeater system. A reduction in buffer area of 67 % and interconnect area of 46 % is achieved based on the PDAP. r 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
