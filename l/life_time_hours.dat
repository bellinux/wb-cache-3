40|$|JENOPTIK Laser, Optik, Systeme GmbH has {{developed}} the first industrial all-solid-state Red-Green-Blue laser system for large image projection systems. Compact in design (0. 75 m 3, 180 kg, 3 kW power consumption), the system {{consists of a}} modelocked oscillator amplifier subsystem with 7 ps pulse duration and 85 MHz pulse repetition frequency, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), and several non-linear stages to generate radiation at 628 nm, 532 nm and 446 nm with an average output power above 18 W. Each of the three colors is modulated with the video signal in a contrast ratio of 1000 : 1 and coupled into a common low order multi mode fiber. The system architecture relies on efficiently manufacturable components. With the help of FEM analysis, new engineering design principles and subsequent climatic and mechanical tests, a length stability below 50 µm and an angle stability below 10 µrad have been achieved. The design includes efficient laser diodes with integrated thermo-electric cooler and a <b>life</b> <b>time</b> above 10000 <b>hours.</b> The stability of the output power is better than + /- 2 % in a temperature range from 5 0 C to 40 0 C.
