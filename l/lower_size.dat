40|$|Abstract- Most {{educators}} and policy-makers believe that <b>lower</b> class <b>size</b> means better education. It ain’t neces-sarily so, according to Solmon and Firetag. In fact, most research is inconclusive, {{or at least}} highly situational. As the authors write “At most one can conclude that Class Size Reduction produces gains in the lowest grades, in the poorest schools and in certain subjects, ” {{but there are no}} more gen-eral improvements. <b>Lower</b> class <b>size</b> is unlikely to bring improvements unless coupled with changes in teaching methods. Further, initia-tives to <b>lower</b> class <b>size</b> force school systems to hire more teachers, which may weaken teacher quality. As a charter school operator, your school might work better with 10 great, well paid teachers than with 15 pretty good, pretty well paid teachers.
