Eating disorders have been believed to occur primarily among white women; in fact, the limited preliminary data available suggest that black women may be as likely as white women to report binge eating. OBJECTIVE: To examine race differences in prevalence of behavioral symptoms of eating disorders and clinically significant recurrent binge eating. DESIGN: Community survey. SETTING: General community in Connecticut and Boston, Mass. PARTICIPANTS: A community sample of 1628 black women and 5741 white women (mean age, 29. 7 years) participated in a telephone survey designed to ascertain the presence, during the preceding 3 months, of binge eating and extreme weight control behaviors (vomiting, <b>laxative</b> or diuretic <b>abuse,</b> or fasting).

RESULTS: Black women were as likely as white women to report binge eating or vomiting during the preceding 3 months, and {{were more likely to report}} fasting and the <b>abuse</b> of <b>laxatives</b> or diuretics. Recurrent binge eating was more common among black women than among white women. In both race groups, recurrent binge eating was associated with elevated body weight and increased psychiatric symptoms.

40|$|Summary This Bachelor {{thesis is}} devoted to {{problems}} of eating disorders that today affect {{a large percentage of}} the young population worldwide. Especially young girls and women aged from 15 to 30 years. There are many studies dealing with eating disorders in recent days, but we still know very little about them. Anorexia nervosa is a disorder based mainly on the mental condition of the patient. Persons suffering from anorexia nervosa have a distorted idea about their own bodies and depending on this they refuse food. The extensive effort to lose weight results in over-exercising and/or using different medications such as anorectics and diuretics. There can also occur various forms of chronic illness, some symptoms may be overlooked or underestimated for a long time. Anorexia can cause many health problems and the risk of death is greatly increased in individuals with this disease. Bulimia nervosa is characterized mainly by recurrent bouts of overeating (binge eating). It is also associated with excessive weight control. Subsequent feature is usually the guilt of overeating followed by compensatory behaviour such as vomiting. Therefore some frmale patients <b>abuse</b> <b>laxatives</b> or diuretics. Individuals with bulimia nervosa have due to induced vomiting swollen salivary glands, and bad teeth. Compared with anorexia nervosa there are no symptoms of malnutrition and frequent deaths. Treatment of eating disorders is very complicated. Due to the different forms it is very difficult to recognize whether it is really an eating disorder. Preconditions for healing are the patients´ cooperation and motivation, together with the help and support of family and friends. Unfortunately, there is no treatment method, medication or surgery, which would have been clearly effective for all disorders. Prevention should decrease the risk of occurrence of eating disorders from an early age already. However, nowadays where the media play very important role, and the cult of beauty are models who themselves usually suffer from one of the eating disorders, the task to create a quality and effective prevention is almost impossible. There is a citizens association called Anabell in our county that offers advice, consultancy and therapy. Prevention should be increased especially at primary schools, where there are the target groups in danger of these diseases...|$|R

40|$|Anthranoid-containing {{laxatives}} [...] aloe, cascara, frangula, and rheum [...] {{may play}} a role in colorectal cancer. This risk is particularly important in view of the wide abuse of self administered laxatives for chronic constipation. There are data on the genotoxic potential of anthranoids and there is evidence of a tumourigenic potential in rodents. A case report and clinical-epidemiological studies have evaluated the cancer risk in patients who have abused anthranoid laxatives over a long period. Pseudomelanosis coli is a reliable parameter of chronic <b>laxative</b> <b>abuse</b> (> 9 - 12 months) and is specific for anthranoid drugs. In a retrospective study of 3049 patients who underwent diagnostic colorectal endoscopy the incidence of pseudomelanosis coli was 3. 13 % in patients without pathological changes. In those with colorectal adenomas, the incidence increased to 8. 64 % (p < 0. 01), and in those with colorectal carcinomas it was 3. 29 %. This lower rate was probably caused by incomplete documentation of pseudomelanosis coli in those with carcinoma. In a prospective study of 1095 patients, the incidence of pseudomelanosis coli was 6. 9 % for patients with no abnormality seen on endoscopy, 9. 8 % (p = 0. 068) for patients with adenomas, and 18. 6 % for patients with colorectal carcinomas.
