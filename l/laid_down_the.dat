NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988) to Los Angeles. After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award. By trading Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> fundaments of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{painting}} fresco, the plaster was laid {{in a new}} section every day, called a giornata. At {{the beginning of each}} session, the edges would be scraped away and a new area <b>laid</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> edges between giornate remain slightly visible; thus, they give a good idea of how the work progressed. It was customary for fresco painters to use a full-sized detailed drawing, a cartoon, to transfer a design onto a plaster surface—many frescoes show little holes made with a stiletto, outlining the figures. Here Michelangelo broke with convention; once confident the intonaco had been well applied, he drew directly onto the ceiling. His energetic sweeping outlines can be seen scraped into some of the surfaces, while on others a grid is evident, indicating that he enlarged directly onto the ceiling from a small drawing.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied.

They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first <b>laid</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying wooden frame.|$|E

These were the only orders that the Austro-Hungarian Navy had placed for any part of the four battleships. It was assumed that following a victorious conclusion to the war in just two months, work on the battleships would resume. As the war continued, four of the main guns that were ordered from the Skoda works were handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Army for use on the Italian Front. The rest of the completed main guns were later taken by the French as a war prize following the end of the war. In late 1917, the construction on all four vessels was canceled.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and aragonite. Sometimes, the aragonite forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and aragonite are <b>laid</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of aragonite. The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|Littorio {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ansaldo shipyards in Genoa on 28 October 1934 to commemorate the Fascist Party's March on Rome in 1922. Her sister Vittorio Veneto was <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> same day. Changes to the design {{and a lack of}} armor plating led to delays in the {{building}} schedule, causing a three-month slip in the launch date from the original plan of May 1937. Littorio was launched on 22 August 1937, during a ceremony attended by many Italian dignitaries. She was sponsored by Signora Teresa Ballerino Cabella, the wife on an Ansaldo employee. After her launch, the fitting out period lasted until early 1940. During this time, Littorios bow was modified to lessen vibration and reduce wetness over the bow. Littorio ran a series of sea trials over a period of two months between 23 October 1939 and 21 December 1939. She was commissioned on 6 May 1940, and after running additional trials that month, she transferred to Taranto where shealong with Vittorio Venetojoined the 9th Division under the command of Rear Admiral Carlo Bergamini.|$|E
5|$|Tectonic {{movement}} by the Indian Plate {{caused it to}} pass over a geologic hotspot—the Réunion hotspot—now occupied by the volcanic island of Réunion. This resulted in a massive flood basalt event that <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Deccan Traps some 60–68Ma, {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period. This may have contributed to the global Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which caused India to experience significantly reduced insolation. Elevated atmospheric levels of sulphur gases formed aerosols such as sulphur dioxide and sulphuric acid, similar to those found in the atmosphere of Venus; these precipitated as acid rain. Elevated carbon dioxide emissions also contributed to the greenhouse effect, causing warmer weather that lasted long after the atmospheric shroud of dust and aerosols had cleared. Further climatic changes 20 million years ago, long after India had crashed into the Laurasian landmass, were severe enough to cause the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in blockage of frigid Central Asian air, preventing it from reaching India; this made its climate significantly warmer and more tropical in character than it would otherwise have been.|$|E

5|$|Though Sachsen entered {{service in}} 1878, she only participated in one annual fleet exercise, in 1880, before all four ships were {{assigned}} to the 1884 maneuvers. This was due to the poor performance of Sachsen in the 1880 maneuvers and the negative reputation of the class. Among the problems associated with the Sachsen-class ships was a tendency to roll dangerously due to their flat bottoms, which greatly reduced the accuracy of their guns. The ships were also poorly armored, compared to their contemporaries. In addition, they were slow and suffered from poor maneuverability. The four ships served rotations with the fleet for the next two years, though in 1886, all four were demobilized as the Reserve Division in the Baltic. Aside from the Sachsens half-sister , the German Navy took a hiatus on capital ship building until the late 1880s when the first of the s were <b>laid</b> <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> poor performance of the sortie corvettes, coupled with the rise of the Jeune École, led Leo von Caprivi to abandon capital ship construction in favor of torpedo boats.|$|E
5|$|Geologists {{believe that}} coast of western India {{came into being}} around 100 to 80mya after it broke away from Madagascar. Soon after its detachment, the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot, a {{volcanic}} hotspot in the Earth's lithosphere near the island of Réunion. An eruption here some 66mya {{is thought to have}} <b>laid</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Deccan Traps, a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India. This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops, such as the Gilbert Hill, that are seen at various locations in the city. Further tectonic activity in the region {{led to the formation of}} hilly islands separated by a shallow sea. Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age. The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island, Parel, Mazagaon, Mahim, Colaba, Worli, and Old Woman's Island (also known as Little Colaba). The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784. By 1000 BCE, the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia. The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands. They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau, Gujarat, and Konkan. In Mumbai, there were three or four of these tribes. Their religious practices could be summed up as animism.|$|E
