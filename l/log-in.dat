40|$|BACKGROUND: Two online {{self-management}} {{programs for}} patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) or food allergy (FA) were developed {{with the aim of}} helping patients cope with their condition, follow the prescribed treatment regimen, and deal with the consequences of their illness in daily life. Both programs consist of several modules containing information, personal stories by fellow patients, videos, and exercises with feedback. Health care professionals can refer their patients to the programs. However, the use of the program in daily practice is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the use and characteristics of users of the online self-management programs "Living with eczema," and "Living with food allergy," and to investigate factors related to the use of the trainings. METHODS: A cross-sectional design was carried out in which the outcome parameters were the number of <b>log-ins</b> by patients, the number of hits on the system's core features, disease severity, quality of life, and domains of self-management. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sample characteristics and to describe number of <b>log-ins</b> and hits per module and per functionality. Correlation and regression analyses were used to explore the relation between the number of <b>log-ins</b> and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Since the start, 299 adult patients have been referred to the online AD program; 173 logged in for at least one occasion. Data from 75 AD patients were available for analyses. Mean number of <b>log-ins</b> was 3. 1 (range 1 - 11). Linear regression with the number of <b>log-ins</b> as dependent variable showed that age and quality of life contributed most to the model, with betas of. 35 (P=. 002) and. 26 (P=. 05), respectively, and an R(2) of. 23. Two hundred fourteen adult FA patients were referred to the online FA training, 124 logged in for at least one occasion and data from 45 patients were available for analysis. Mean number of <b>log-ins</b> was 3. 0 (range 1 - 11). Linear regression with the number of <b>log-ins</b> as dependent variable revealed that adding the self-management domain "social integration and support" to the model led to an R(2) of. 13. The modules with information about the disease, diagnosis, and treatment were most visited. Most hits were on the information parts of the modules (55 - 58 %), followed by exercises (30 - 32 %). CONCLUSIONS: The online self-management programs "Living with eczema" and "Living with food allergy" were used by patients in addition to the usual face-to-face care. Almost 60 % of all referred patients logged in, with an average of three <b>log-ins.</b> All modules seemed to be relevant, but there is room for improvement in the use of the training. Age, quality of life, and lower social integration and support were related to the use of the training, but only part of the variance in use could be explained by these variables...|$|R

25|$|On 9 December 2014, {{police in}} Stockholm raided the company's {{premises}} and seized servers and other computers and equipment, {{which resulted in}} the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps that went down. One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email <b>log-in</b> details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services. On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015. The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.|$|E

The DELT Program is a blended program in that it has both face-to-face and distance education components. The first two years are face-to-face while the last two years are through distance education. The distance education component {{in the last two years}} consists of courses which provide students with methodological and theoretical background essential for language teachers. The main instructional materials are textbooks and study guides. As there are no instructors in the distance education component, students are provided with online support which is designed to supplement the course books.

The aim of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between frequency of <b>log-ins</b> and student grades. Analysis of average overall grades and frequency of <b>log-ins</b> showed that as the frequency of <b>log-ins</b> increases the grades also increase...|$|R

40|$|Background This article {{reports a}} pilot study of a new smoking {{cessation}} website (‘StopAdvisor’), which has been developed {{on the basis of}} PRIME theory, evidence, web-design expertise and user-testing. The aims were to i) evaluate whether cessation, website usage and satisfaction were sufficiently high to warrant a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and ii) assess whether outcomes were affected by socio-economic status. Methods This was an uncontrolled pilot study. Two hundred and four adult daily smokers willing to make a serious quit attempt were included. All participants received support from ‘StopAdvisor’, which recommends a structured quit plan and a variety of evidence-based behaviour change techniques for smoking cessation. A series of tunnelled sessions and a variety of interactive menus provide tailored support for up to a month before quitting through until one-month post-quit ([URL] The primary outcome was self-report of at least 1 month of continuous abstinence collected at 2 months post-enrolment and verified by saliva cotinine or anabasine. Usage was indexed by <b>log-ins</b> and page views. Satisfaction was assessed by dichotomous ratings of helpfulness, personal relevance, likelihood of recommendation and future use, which were collected using an online questionnaire at 2 months post-enrolment. Outcomes according to socio-economic status were assessed. Results At 8 weeks post-enrolment, 19. 6 % (40 / 204) of participants were abstinent according to the primary outcome criteria (95 % C. I. = 14. 1 % to 25. 1 %). Participants viewed a mean of 133. 5 pages (median = 71. 5) during 6. 4 <b>log-ins</b> (median = 3). A majority of respondents rated the website positively on each of the four satisfaction `ratings (range = 66. 7 % to 75. 3 %). There was no evidence of an effect of socio-economic status on abstinence (OR = 1. 01, C. I. = 0. 50 – 2. 07), usage (page-views, t(202) = 0. 11, p =. 91; <b>log-ins,</b> t(202) = 0. 21, p =. 83), or satisfaction (helpfulness, OR = 1. 09, C. I. = 0. 41 – 2. 88; personal relevance, OR = 0. 55, C. I. = 0. 20 – 1. 56; recommendation, OR = 0. 98, C. I. = 0. 34 – 2. 81; use in future, OR = 1. 45, C. I. = 0. 49 – 4. 27). Conclusions The systematic application of theory, evidence, web-design expertise, and user-testing has resulted in a website that shows sufficiently promising efficacy and usability to warrant evaluation in a RCT. The website appears to be similarly effective and acceptable to users across the social spectrum...|$|R
