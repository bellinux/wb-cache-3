40|$|Across three experiments, I {{investigated}} the role <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection in rejecting false suggestions using the misinformation paradigm. The use of model-based measurement <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection {{was extended to}} the misinformation paradigm. I manipulated two factors, delay and feedback, that are known to influence the use <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Recollection rejection was used to reject false suggestions in the misinformation paradigm. Manipulating delay time {{did not affect the}} acceptance of misinformation or the use <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Warning participants about false information reduced misinformation acceptance but did not lead to increased rates <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> rejection. Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for recollection rejection in rejecting misleading suggestions about events...|$|R

40|$|What is {{conscious}} recollection? Is it {{special to}} humans or do animals have this capacity as well? What brain circuitry supports {{the kinds of}} information processing that constitute recollection? This review will outline recent evidence from studies on rodents, monkeys and humans bearing on these questions. This review focuses on a comparative approach that identified features <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> that can be studied across species, explores these elements <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> in animals, and examines in animals {{the role of the}} medial temporal areas that are critically involved in conscious recollection in humans. Substantial evidence indicates that animals exhibit all the fundamental features <b>of</b> <b>recollection,</b> that these abilities depend on the hippocampus in animals as well as humans, and that neuronal representations in the hippocampus reflect information processing fundamental to the features <b>of</b> <b>recollection.</b> In addition, the functional circuitry of the hippocampal system is largely conserved across species, and its organization suggests information processing mechanisms that support the features <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> are common across species. Aristotle (350 BC) contended that “…other animals (as well as man) have memory, but, of all that we are acquainted with, none, we venture to say, except man, shares in the faculty <b>of</b> <b>recollection.</b> ” Here Aristotle distinguishes “memory, ” as an elementary matching of current sensation...|$|R

The mental prostration which had followed the parting scene was soon complicated by physical suffering--by fever on the brain. To the surprise of all who attended her, she lived through the shock, recovering with the complete <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> one faculty, which, in her situation, poor thing, was a mercy and a gain to her--the faculty of memory. From that time to this she has never had the slightest gleam <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> anything that happened before her illness. In her happy oblivion, the veriest trifles are as new and as interesting to {{her as if she}} was beginning her existence again. Under the tender care of the friends who now protect her, she lives contentedly the life of a child. When her last hour comes, may she die with nothing on her memory but the <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> their kindness! ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT—Memory {{for complex}} {{everyday}} events involv-ing vision, hearing, smell, emotion, narrative, and lan-guage cannot be understood without considering {{the properties of}} the separate systems that process and store each of these forms of information. Using this premise as a starting point, my colleagues and I found that visual memory plays a central role in autobiographical memory: The strength <b>of</b> <b>recollection</b> <b>of</b> an event is predicted best by the vividness of its visual imagery, and a <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> visual memory causes a general amnesia. Examination of auto-biographical memories in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) suggests that the lack of coherence often noted in memories of traumatic events is not {{due to a lack of}} coherence either of the memory itself or of the narrative that integrates the memory into the life story...|$|R
