50|$|The Los Alerces National Park (Parque Nacional Los Alerces) is a {{national}} park in Chubut Province, Argentina, some 30 miles (50 km) from Esquel. It is a park of 2,630 square kilometres {{along the border with}} Chile, best known for the alerce (<b>lahuán)</b> trees (Fitzroya cupressoides) from which the park takes its name.|$|E
5000|$|Fitzroya is a {{monotypic}} genus in {{the cypress}} family. The single living species, Fitzroya cupressoides, is a tall, long-lived conifer {{native to the}} Andes mountains of southern Chile and Argentina, where {{it is an important}} member of the Valdivian temperate rain forests. Common names include alerce ("larch" [...] in Spanish), <b>lahuán</b> (Spanish, from the Mapuche Native American name lawal), and Patagonian cypress. The genus was named in honour of Robert FitzRoy.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, D. spinosa was {{described}} {{for the first}} time as having been observed growing as a (fully autotrophic) epiphyte, the host tree in question being the <b>lahuán</b> / alerce - the gigantic and extremely long-lived conifer Fitzroya cupressoides. The epiphyte communities of the largest substrates (Substrate (biology)) (deep soil mats some 34 m (111 ft) up in the Fitzroya crowns), featured not only Desfontainia, but also the shrub Pseudopanax laetevirens (Araliaceae) and two tree species, namely Tepualia stipularis (Myrtaceae)and Weinmannia trichosperma (Cunoniaceae). These normally terrestrial species were thriving in their epiphytic existence - even a 4 m tall specimen of Tepualia showed no sign of stress. Some Fitzroya crowns sported such large epiphytic trees as to give the impression of a 'double crown effect.' ...|$|E
