5|$|The {{result was}} the 1981 {{dismissal}} of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the Progressive <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> (PLP). Pilgrim's government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the United Workers Party to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His Progressive <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> won only a single seat.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{announced}} on 10 May 2010 {{that he would}} stand down as Labour Leader, {{with a view to}} a successor being chosen before the next <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> Conference in September 2010. The following day, negotiations between the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and the Liberal Democrats to form a coalition government failed. During the evening, Brown visited Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation as Prime Minister to Queen Elizabeth II and to recommend that she invite the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, to form a government. He resigned as leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> with immediate effect.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, 1923, the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> {{broke out of}} the Comintern.

Arbeideren was then taken away from Labour, as the {{supervisory}} council decided by a 65 to 5 vote that it should follow the Communists. Arbeideren was one of thirteen Labour newspapers that broke away from the party and followed the Communists (one, Nordlys, later returned to Labour). Since 15 February 1924 the newspaper was published under the name Arbeideren og Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad, as the Communist Party had seen fit to merge Arbeideren with Lillehammer-based Gudbrandsdalens Arbeiderblad.|$|E

40|$|<b>Labour</b> <b>parties</b> are not {{all that}} common in {{democratic}} systems and as such <b>labour</b> <b>parties,</b> with their explicit ties to unions, have not been fully accounted for in the literature exploring the evolution of political parties. In this paper I will draw on interviews conducted with union officials and party activists in Australia, Britain and Sweden to explore {{the extent to which}} the <b>labour</b> <b>parties</b> in these three countries have moved away from Duverger’s ‘mass party model’ and instead adopted features more associated with electoralist parties. 1 I will begin by examining the environment in which these three parties operate before examining the strategies they have adopted to maintain their electability. I seek to discover if there are commonalities in the way <b>labour</b> <b>parties</b> have evolved, as well as explore the role of unions in either forming a barrier, or providing additional pressure, for party change. This paper is not meant to provide definitive answers, but rather to spark a debate about whether <b>labour</b> <b>parties</b> should be seen as a distinct party family that face similar pressures and opportunities...|$|R

5|$|After initial {{rises in}} opinion polls {{following}} Brown becoming Prime Minister, Labour's popularity declined {{with the onset}} of a recession in 2008, leading to poor results in the local and European elections in 2009. A year later, Labour lost 91 seats in the House of Commons at the 2010 general election, the party's biggest loss of seats in a single general election since 1931, making the Conservatives the largest party in a hung parliament. Brown remained in office as Labour negotiated to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats. On 10 May 2010, Brown announced he would stand down as leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party,</b> and instructed the party to put into motion the processes to elect a new leader. Labour's attempts to retain power failed and on 11 May, he officially resigned as Prime Minister and Leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b> He was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, and as Leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> by Ed Miliband.|$|E

5|$|At the election, Labour lost 91 {{seats in}} the House of Commons, but the Conservatives failed to achieve an overall majority, {{resulting}} in the first hung parliament since 1974. Under the constitution governing {{what happens in the}} event of a hung parliament, Brown remained temporarily as Prime Minister, while the Liberal Democrats and Conservatives entered into talks aimed at forming a coalition government. Talks between the Liberal Democrats and Labour also took place. On 10 May, Brown announced his intention to resign as leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and instructed the party to initiate the election of a new leader. Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen an obstacle to the negotiation of a Labour-Liberal Democrat deal. By 11 May, the possibility of a deal was becoming less likely as talks between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats continued. After a telephone conversation with his predecessor Tony Blair where Blair informed Brown that the election had shown that the British voters had lost faith in both him and the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> and that the United Kingdom would not accept him continuing as Prime Minister. With this he concluded that he would not be able to form a government, Brown announced his resignation as Prime Minister. He also resigned as leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party</b> with immediate effect. Brown was succeeded as Prime Minister by David Cameron, while Harriet Harman became acting leader of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|E
