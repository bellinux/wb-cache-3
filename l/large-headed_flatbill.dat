40|$|ABSTRACT Southwestern Amazonia {{has great}} bird {{diversity}} which includes birds specialized in bamboo forests. In this region, bamboo {{is considered a}} key element of the landscape. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate and describe the foraging behavior of the <b>Large-headed</b> <b>Flatbill,</b> Ramphotrigon megacephalum (Swainson, 1835) and the Dusky-tailed Flatbill, Ramphotrigon fuscicauda Chapman, 1925, which occur sympatrically in the region and are considered bamboo specialists. This study was conducted between November 2013 and September 2014, within two fragments in the eastern portion of the state of Acre: Fazenda Experimental Catuaba, in the municipality of Senador Guiomard; and Reserva Florestal Humaitá, in Porto Acre. A total of 109 and 97 foraging events were registered, for the <b>Large-headed</b> <b>Flatbill</b> and the Dusky-tailed Flatbill, respectively. The two species frequently used bamboos for searching and capturing their prey. However, the <b>large-headed</b> <b>Flatbill</b> was more specialized in bamboo substrates. Both species use similar foraging techniques and the differences found between the two are minor, but when taken together, these differences may explain their ability to co-exist...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a five-month survey of the birds of Paragominas, Pará, a {{municipality}} in eastern Brazilian Amazonia that lies within the Belém center of endemism. We recorded 440 species, sampling habitats across a gradient of disturbance, ranging from ?undisturbed? primary forest, through logged and burnt forest, patches of varyingly aged secondary forest, cattle pastures and intensive mechanized agriculture. Given the potential for species miss-identifications in avian inventories, we paid special attention to obtaining voucher documentation (photographs and sound recordings) and here provide a unique collection of publically-accessible digital vouchers for 418 species recorded (95 % of the total). Many of the species reported here are poorlyknown or represent notable range-extensions, and we present data on their status and distribution, both within the municipality and elsewhere in the Belém center of endemism. Notable amongst these include the first records for Pará and Amazonia of Spotted Piculet (Picumnus pygmaeus), trans-Tocantins range-extensions for <b>Large-headed</b> <b>Flatbill</b> (Ramphotrigon megacephalum) and Yellowshouldered Grosbeak (Parkerthraustes humeralis) and multiple observations of the threatened paraensis subspecies of Cinnamonthroated Woodcreeper (Dendrexetastes rufigula). 201...|$|E
