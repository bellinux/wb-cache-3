50|$|Between October 1940 and 1973 the UK had a {{consumption}} <b>tax</b> called <b>Purchase</b> <b>Tax,</b> {{which was}} levied {{at different rates}} depending on goods' luxuriousness. <b>Purchase</b> <b>Tax</b> {{was applied to the}} wholesale price, initially at a rate of 33%. This was doubled in April 1942 to 66%, and further increased in April 1943 to a rate of 100%, before reverting in April 1946 to 33% again.

On 1 January 1973 the UK joined the European Economic Community and as a consequence <b>Purchase</b> <b>Tax</b> was replaced by Value Added Tax on 1 April 1973. The Conservative Chancellor Lord Barber set a single VAT rate (10%) on most goods and services.|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of three pricing policy {{options in the}} Netherlands for reducing CO 2 emissions from passenger cars was determined in an investigation carried out jointly by the RIVM and the environmental consultant agency, Muconsult. The first option, differentiation in the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax</b> on new cars, will allow owners of new, relatively fuel-efficient cars (in relation to size) a rebate in the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax.</b> However, owners of new cars which are {{in relation to their}} seize not fuel-efficient will be confronted with a surcharge on the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax.</b> Three different levels of differentiation are taken into consideration. The second option is to have the yearly vehicle tax based on fuel use instead of weight of the vehicle. The third option will provide a premium for owners of new cars which will have a green energy label. Two premium levels are taken into account. The main conclusion of this study is: the <b>purchase</b> <b>tax</b> and the premium options will result in CO 2 emission reductions of 0. 1 to 1. 5 % compared to the passenger car emissions in 2010 and 2020 without the measures proposed. The yearly tax option based on fuel use will have no effect...|$|R
