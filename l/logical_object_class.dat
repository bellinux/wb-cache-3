40|$|Using ODA for Translating Multimedia Information The {{purpose of}} this RFC is to inform implementors of {{multimedia}} systems about our experiences using ISO 8613 : Office Document Architecture (ODA). Because ODA is being proposed as an encoding format for use in multimedia mail and file exchange, implementors wishing to use ODA in an open systems environment may profit from our experiences. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify any standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2. Overview ODA is a recently approved ISO (8613) and CCITT (T. 410) standard for representing documents containing multifont text, raster images and geometric graphics. This encoding has been specified {{for use in a}} number of related standards, such as X. 400. However, ODA is a very abstract standard, defining entities such as "composite <b>logical</b> <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> " and not common entities, such as "paragraphs". Therefore, effective use of ODA as an interchange medium requires the definition of a document application profile (dap) that defines some common entities and a map between ODA entities defined in the dap and entities used in the interchanged systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} part-based {{approaches to}} <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection in single 2 D images, relying on pre-built CAD models {{as a source}} of synthetic training data. Part-based models, representing an <b>object</b> <b>class</b> as a deformable constellation of object parts, have demonstrated state-of-the-art results with respect to <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection. Typically, the majority of part-based approaches rely on real training images of publicly available image data sets and consequently, the positive output of those detectors is restricted to the viewpoints which are represented by those real training images. However, progress in the domain of computer graphics enables the generation of photo-realistic renderings on demand from a database of CAD models, which can serve as training source for learning an <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection approach. In this thesis, we present part-based <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection methods which are based on synthetically generated positive training images and real negative training images, thereby combining the advantages of the two domains described above. More specifically, photo-realistic object parts, representing the <b>object</b> <b>class</b> being trained, are learnt in an unsupervised way without requiring any manual bounding box, object part, or viewpoint annotations during the training process. The established object parts are efficiently combined into an <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection framework relying on two part-based models with different learning paradigms. In addition, we outline an extension of our detection framework which is able to cope with multiple <b>object</b> <b>classes.</b> The approaches to <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection are evaluated on standard benchmark data sets and achieve state-of-the-art results with respect to <b>object</b> <b>class</b> detection in single 2 D images...|$|R

40|$|Generally, {{training}} {{images are}} essential for a computer vision model to classify specific <b>object</b> <b>class</b> accurately. Unfortunately, there exist countless number of different <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> in real world, and {{it is almost impossible}} for a computer vision model to obtain a complete training images for each of the different <b>object</b> <b>class.</b> To overcome this problem, zero-shot learning algorithm was emerged to learn unknown <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> from a set of known <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> information. Among these methods, attributes and image hierarchy are the widely used methods. In this paper, we combine both the strength of attributes and image hierarchy by proposing Attributes Relationship Model (ARM) to perform zero-shot learning. We tested the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on Animals with Attributes (AwA) dataset and manage to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy (50. 61 %) compare to other recent methods.

40|$|In recent years, {{impressive}} {{results have}} been reported for the recognition of individual <b>object</b> <b>classes,</b> based on the combination of robust visual features with powerful statistical learning techniques. As a result, the simultaneous recognition of many <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> is coming into focus, posing challenges with respect to both model complexity {{and the need for}} increasing amounts of training data. Reusing once acquired information in the context of related recognition tasks, effectively transferring knowledge between <b>object</b> <b>classes,</b> has been identified as a promising route towards scalable recognition. Besides increasing scalability, knowledge transfer has been shown to enable novel tasks, such as the recognition of <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> for which no training data are available, termed zero-shot recognition. In this case, missing training data is compensated by exploiting additional, complementary sources of knowledge, such as linguistic knowledge bases. Based on these encouraging prospects, this thesis explores four different dimensions of knowledge transfer in <b>object</b> <b>class</b> recognition. First, we investigate the role of visual features as a low level representation of transferable knowledge. Based on an extensive evaluation of existing state-of-the-art local feature detectors and descriptors, we identify shape-based features in connection with powerful spatial models as a promising candidate representation. Building upon this result, we further introduce a novel flavor of local shape-based features, as well as a generic appearance descriptor based on shading artifacts. Second, we highlight the connection between knowledge transfer and generalization across basic-level object categories, by recognizing objects according to potential functions or affordances. In particular, we demonstrate that visually distinct hints on affordances, modeled as collections of local shape features, can be shared and hence transfered between <b>object</b> <b>classes.</b> Third, we design shape-based <b>object</b> <b>class</b> models for knowledge transfer, representing <b>object</b> <b>classes</b> as spatially constrained assemblies of parts, including pair-wise symmetry relations. These models are both compositional and incremental, allowing for knowledge transfer either on the level of entire <b>object</b> <b>class</b> models or restricted to a subset of model components. While knowledge transfer in these models has to be guided by manual supervision, we demonstrate the benefit of knowledge transfer for <b>object</b> <b>class</b> recognition when learning from scarce training data. And fourth, we demonstrate that exploiting additional sources of knowledge besides real world training images can aid <b>object</b> <b>class</b> recognition, effectively transferring knowledge between different representations. In particular, we use linguistic knowledge bases in connection with semantic relatedness measures to automatically determine potential sources and targets of knowledge transfer for zero-shot recognition, and show the successful learning of shape-based <b>object</b> <b>class</b> models from collections of 3 D computer aided design (CAD) models, not using any real world training images of the <b>object</b> <b>class</b> of interest. In summary, this thesis achieves encouraging results with respect to four different dimensions of knowledge transfer, namely, specialized visual feature representations, generalization across basic-level categories, compositional <b>object</b> <b>class</b> models, and the exploitation of additional sources of knowledge, confirming the benefits of knowledge transfer. As a side effect, we are able to obtain <b>object</b> <b>class</b> recognition results often superior to or en par with prior work...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found a larger neural {{activation}} for stimuli which are more extreme exemplars of their stimulus class, than for stimuli which are more prototypical.

The results clearly indicate that finding an atypical instance of an <b>object</b> <b>class</b> amongst more typical ones is easier and faster than the other way around. These effects require several presentations of the <b>object</b> <b>class,</b> especially for the novel objects, which suggests that they are not due to short-term adaptation from individual stimuli in previous trials but are linked to habituation for the <b>object</b> <b>class</b> as a whole.
