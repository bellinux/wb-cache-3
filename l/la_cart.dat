50|$|Until 2009, {{hot dogs}} and pre-cooked {{sausages}} were {{the only kind of}} street food allowed by law. These types of hot dogs are often referred to as 'street meat' by locals, and are normally flame-grilled. The law sets extremely high requirements for street food vendors. However, there was an initiative to allow more varied and nutritious street food, which resulted in the introduction of Toronto a <b>la</b> <b>Cart</b> in 2009. Toronto a <b>la</b> <b>Cart</b> allowed vendors to sell Halal foods such as Kebab, Falafel and Shawarma. However, by 2010 Toronto a <b>la</b> <b>Cart</b> was deemed a failure by local politicians and discontinued.|$|E

50|$|In general, <b>las</b> carretas are <b>carts</b> {{pulled by}} oxen {{as a means}} for {{transportation}} of goods across many different terrains. They can have either two wheels or four and can be attached to oxen with a rope or chain. The front of the cart has a section where the driver and one passenger can sit and the back section has room for the cargo that needs to be transported. They can navigate through multiple different terrains including mountains, beaches, swamps, rivers, etc. Today, las carretas are mainly used for celebrations and art rather than their original purpose, transporting goods. They are considered one of the traditional and cultural icons for Costa Rica.|$|R

For {{the purpose of this}} paper we distinguish four types of knowledge and correspondingly we introduce four metaphors of knowledge sharing: the four knowledge restaurants. In buffets ready-made knowledge is offered for self-service; there are restaurants in which the knowledge broker fulfils the role of the waiter offering a <b>la</b> <b>cart</b> menus; in some very expensive restaurants we can try what is recommended by the chef; finally, we sometimes make our own coffee in the coffee room and, obviously, have a chat along...|$|E
