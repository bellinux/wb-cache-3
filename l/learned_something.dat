Will, who received offers from forty-five collegiate schools, committed to the University of Arkansas in September 2014 and signed with the institution in December.|$|E
5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking delight in the goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

25|$|Craig Miller has {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} Swedenborg influenced Joseph Smith, as there are similarities between some of their teachings. He concludes that Smith may have <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> about Swedenborg through third parties, but was unlikely to have read much if any of Swedenborg's works for himself. Among Smith's connections was Sarah Cleveland, who {{was married to a}} Swedenborgian {{at the time of her}} plural marriage to Smith in 1842. It was shortly afterwards, in July 1843, that Smith recorded receiving a revelation regarding eternal marriage in Doctrine and Covenants 132.|$|E
25|$|Daw Amar nudges up to Ba Zaw’s {{connection}} to both Saya Chone and Ba Ohn. She states that Ba Zaw {{was very good}} at painting Traditional Burmese arabesque, one of the skills which Min Naing claims he learned from Saya Chone. She also mentions that Ba Ohn was the first Burmese painter to illustrate school textbooks, and that when Ba Ohn’s illustrations became outdated, Ba Zaw was hired by Macmillan to illustrate “Burmese Peacock” readers, but she stoutly emphasizes that Ba Zaw accomplished these illustrations on his own, without instruction. She goes on to say, however, that Ba Ohn learned painting techniques from B.H. Wiles (a European painter in Burma who also taught Maung Maung Gyi) and adds that Ba Zaw was also friendly with Wiles. One must wonder if these three painters sometimes kept company, and if Ba Zaw not only <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> from Ba Ohn but also Wiles.|$|E

500|$|Several episodes {{center around}} Cartman's greed and his get-rich-quick schemes, {{although}} his numerous attempts to attain wealth generally fail. His extreme disdain for hippies serves to satirize the counterculture of the 1960s {{and its influence}} in contemporary society, reflecting Parker's real-life antipathy towards hippies. Though the role is customarily taken by Stan or Kyle, Cartman will occasionally {{be the one to}} reflect on the lessons learned during the course of an episode with a speech that often begins with [...] "You know, I've <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> today...".|$|E
500|$|Kenny's {{deaths have}} been subject to much {{critical}} analysis in the media and literary world. In the book , an essay by Southern Illinois University philosophy professor Dr. Randall Auxier, entitled [...] "Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death", suggests that the fashion of the recurring gag serves to help the viewer become more comfortable with the inevitability of their own death. In the book South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I <b>Learned</b> <b>Something</b> Today, University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point professor Karin Fry wrote an essay concerning the parallels between Kenny's role in the show and the different concepts of existentialism.|$|E

When I gave the lecture about supply-side economics, I thought they were applauding. Everybody on the set applauded. I thought they were applauding because they had <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> about supply-side economics. But they were applauding because they thought I was boring...It was the best day of my life", Stein said.|$|E

Kyle acknowledged this trend in the season five (2001) episode [...] "Cartmanland" [...] when he states that he often gives the speech each week in an attempt to [...] "try and better myself", and again in the season seven (2003) episode [...] "Butt Out" [...] where he repeatedly reminds his friends that they continuously allow potentially riotous events to occur, and are only able to defuse the situation by giving such a speech to the gathered townsfolk.|$|E
500|$|The Samoan {{team was}} not feeling downhearted after the game, and even embraced and sang to the {{audience}} as the game finished. Salapu declared that he enjoyed the game. [...] "I wasn't embarrassed because we all <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> from it. If we had all our players maybe {{it would have been}} only five or six goals, because I was without my best defenders and there was nothing I could do." [...] Tony Langkilde also defended the goalkeeper, saying that he [...] "kept the score down with a magnificent display". He also added that [...] "now we are recognised by FIFA, it has really helped spark an interest in football on the islands". Samoan manager Tunoa Lui commented that football was being played in the Samoan elementary and high schools and [...] "in five years we will be competitive." ...|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule took a {{more positive}} view of the two coins. [...] Commenting on the half dollar obverse, he praised its technical aspects, showing the Mint had <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> from earlier attempts at coin redesign. He admired the reverse, calling the bell and the lettering [...] "jewels of precision". For the quarter eagle obverse, with its figure of a robed Liberty standing on a globe, Vermeule suggested that Sinnock [...] "revert {{in part to the}} allegorical iconography of the nineteenth century." [...] He felt that the Liberty allegory is too blatant, with scroll and torch, and noted that Sinnock eventually found a more proper place for his torch on the Roosevelt dime (1946). The figure itself, despite classical robes, [...] "looks more like a 'flapper' of the 1920s. [...] Her cloth cap accentuates this," [...] according to Vermeule. The reverse, in Vermeule's view, was part of a tradition of realistic views of structures on U.S coins that would repeat itself with the Jefferson nickel (1938).|$|E

500|$|Parker and Stone {{insist that}} the show is still more about [...] "kids being kids" [...] and [...] "what it's {{like to be in}} [...] in America", stating that the {{introduction}} of a more satirical element to the series {{was the result of the}} two adding more of a [...] "moral center" [...] to the show so that it would rely less on simply being crude and shocking in an attempt to maintain an audience. While profane, Parker notes that there is still an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the child characters, and Time described the boys as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence." [...] Usually, the boys and/or other characters ponder over what has transpired during an episode and convey the important lesson taken from it with a short monologue. During earlier seasons, this speech would commonly begin with a variation of the phrase [...] "You know, I've <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> today...".|$|E
500|$|Ted Shackelford, {{who plays}} Gary, {{described}} the love story, [...] "I can't complain. I mean, Gary spent {{six or seven}} years being led down the primrose path by one stupid broad after another. So with Val... You'd think after 13 years, at the age they are [...] and the amount of bullshit they've been through, they would have <b>learned</b> <b>something!</b> They'd probably have a very comfortable life by now. But it makes for a dead story line." [...] When asked about working with Van Ark, he said: [...] "I don't know how it could get any better. [...] She's remarkable, and I'm not blowing smoke up your ass. I'd tell you if I thought she was a pain in the ass, although sometimes she is a pain in the ass. But my best work is done with Joan." [...] Van Ark also discussed Valene's relationship with her daughter, Lucy Ewing. She said, [...] "The spine or the beginning of the series was Gary and Val, coming over from Dallas, so maybe there should have been more Lucy. I do know that CBS and the producers of both shows wanted to keep the two shows separate but in the beginning you had Larry Hagman and others going over to Knots." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{there she}} was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of Lord Lovat) and his men through Perthshire. At Balquhidder, {{according}} to MacGregor tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins. [...] The existence of St Fillan's Pool on the River Fillan near Tyndrum would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious. The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through Glen Coe to Loch Ness and then through Glen Garry to Loch Hourn on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the Monach Isles. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was {{in the company of}} men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few of them spoke any English at all. [...] Their native Gaelic would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> of the language. She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that [...] "they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me".|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively in The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "Apparently someone {{connected with the}} Thanhouser Company has <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> of ward politics, and the methods of controlling a convention are very clearly and bluntly stated. It isn't always possible to expose plots {{such as this one}} was exposed, {{but it would have been}} a good thing if it could be done.... The situations are dramatically worked out and the interest never flags from the beginning to the end. A love story adds a certain degree of interest to the picture, and the development of the plot is strengthened by the young people's lovemaking." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror disagreed with the plausibility of the depicted political manipulation, but found the picture to be interesting and the acting to be adequate. Later publications would also reference the film for its content, like The Columbia Companion to American History on Film which cites it as an example of a political machine based on graft and deceit. Neither graft nor deceit is actually in play with the production, for pure bribery is the method upon which the politician uses to gain political power. Kay Sloan, author of The Loud Silents: Origins of the Social Problem Film, states that the film explored the problem of political corruption and critics approved because they saw was a realistic portrayal. Another release dealing with political corruption was The Girl Reporter, released by Thanhouser on August 16, 1910.|$|E
500|$|Stan {{is modeled}} after Parker, while Kyle is modeled after Stone. Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is {{intended}} to reflect the real-life friendship between Parker and Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. The two do have their disagreements, but always reconcile without any long-term damage to their friendship. As {{is the case with}} his other friends and classmates, Stan is frequently at odds with Cartman, resenting Cartman's behavior and openly mocking his weight. Stan also shares a close friendship with Kenny, while Kenny professes that Stan is one of [...] "the best friends a guy could have". Stan can understand Kenny's muffled voice perfectly, and typically exclaims the catchphrase [...] "Oh my God! They killed Kenny!", following one of Kenny's trademark deaths, allowing Kyle to follow up with [...] "You bastards!" [...] Stan is the only character in the group to have had a steady girlfriend, Wendy Testaburger, and their relationship was a recurring topic in the show's earlier seasons. Despite reconciling and declaring to be a couple again in the season 11 (2007) episode [...] "The List" [...] after Wendy had dumped him in the season seven (2003) episode [...] "Raisins", their relationship has received relatively less focus in recent seasons. As a running gag, a nervous Stan often vomits whenever Wendy approaches to kiss or speak to him. In many episodes, Stan contemplates ethics in beliefs, moral dilemmas, and contentious issues, and will often reflect on the lessons he has attained with a speech that often begins with [...] "You know, I <b>learned</b> <b>something</b> today...".|$|E
