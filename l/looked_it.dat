2500|$|Harlan Ellison long {{maintained}} that the ancient ruins {{were the result of}} someone's misreading his description in the script of the city as [...] "covered with runes." [...] When informed that the word [...] "runes" [...] did not appear in any version of his treatments or script, Ellison responded in Edge Words, the letter column of IDW's comic book adaptation of his original script, by admitting that his memory was faulty, and that he actually told Matt Jefferies that the set should appear [...] "Ancient, incredibly ancient, with runes everywhere..." [...] He surmises that he perhaps slurred the word [...] "runes" [...] and Jefferies misheard him. Fontana later explained that Jefferies was not working that week due to an illness, and so Rolland Brooks, the chair of the Art Department, took over set design duties. He had been drinking while reading the script and failed to understand what [...] "rune stones" [...] were. He <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> up in a dictionary, and drunkenly reached [...] "ruin" [...] first, which resulted in a set filled with broken columns. Brooks had also been responsible for the creation of the Guardian of Forever, to which Jefferies exclaimed [...] "What the hell is this?" [...] when he returned to work, too late to change it.|$|E

2500|$|On August 19, The Washingtonian {{magazine}} {{reported on}} its Web site that Chief Ellerbe had an alleged confrontation with a firefighter over a picture {{taken of the}} burning Medic 27 vehicle. According to the report, Ellerbe arrived {{at the scene of}} the ambulance fire and noticed a firefighter with a smartphone in his hand. The magazine said that Ellerbe demanded that the firefighter hand over camera phone, grabbed it from the firefighter's hand, <b>looked</b> <b>it</b> over, and returned it. Ellerbe denied the incident categorically, saying he went to the scene of the fire only because [...] "I thought my presence would initiate a faster response in removing the vehicle from public view". He requested the phone, and the firefighter willingly handed it over. Ellerbe says that when he saw the phone was not functioning, he returned it immediately. The magazine did not identify the firefighter who made the accusation. However, Ellerbe requested and received an internal investigation into the accusation. However, a week later, firefighter Sean C. Griffith, filed a criminal complaint with the D.C. police alleging that Rubin assaulted him, causing him harm that required him to seek medical treatment and spend more than a week on sick leave. A spokesman for Deputy Mayor Paul Quander called the allegation suspect and accused the firefighters' union of fabricating the incident to embarrass the department.|$|E
