25|$|A voltage <b>level</b> <b>detector</b> can be {{obtained}} if a reference voltage Vref is applied {{to one of the}} op-amp's inputs. This means that the op-amp is set up as a comparator to detect a positive voltage. If the voltage to be sensed, Ei, is applied to op amp's (+) input, the result is a noninverting positive-level detector: when Ei is above Vref, VO equals +Vsat; when Ei is below Vref, VO equals −Vsat. If Ei is applied to the inverting input, the circuit is an inverting positive-level detector: When Ei is above Vref, VO equals −Vsat.|$|E

50|$|FSK usually employs two {{distinct}} frequencies to modulate data. For example, Frequency F1 to indicate bit 0 and frequency F2 to indicate bit 1.

40|$|We propose clauselets, sets of {{concurrent}} {{actions and}} their temporal relationships, and explore their application to video event analysis. We train clauselets in two stages.

In the second stage, we apply the first <b>level</b> <b>detectors</b> to training videos, and discriminatively learn temporal patterns be-tween activations that involve more actions over longer du-rations and lead to improved second level clauselet models. We demonstrate the utility of clauselets by applying them {{to the task of}} “in-the-wild ” video event recognition on the TRECVID MED 11 dataset. Not only do clauselets achieve state-of-the-art results on this task, but qualitative results suggest that they may also lead to semantically meaningful descriptions of videos in terms of detected actions and their temporal relationships. 1...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the zero}} {{crossing}} detector, the detector with hysteresis does not switch when Vin is zero, rather the output becomes Vsat+ when Va becomes positive and Vsat- when Va becomes negative. Further {{examination of the}} Va equation reveals that Vin can exceed zero (positive or negative) by a certain magnitude before {{the output of the}} detector is caused to switch. By adjusting the value of R1, the magnitude of Vin that will cause the detector to switch can be increased or decreased. Hysteresis is useful in various applications. It has better noise immunity than the <b>level</b> <b>detector,</b> so it is used in interface circuits. Its positive feedback has a faster transition, so it is used in timing applications such as frequency counters. It is also used in astable multivibrators found in instruments such as function generators.|$|E

40|$|DDoS {{has become}} one of the thorniest {{problems}} in the Internet, and aims to deny legitimate users of the services they should have. In this paper, we introduce novel dual- level framework that consist of attack detection (D-LAD) and characterization scheme for defending against the DDoS attacks. The macroscopic <b>level</b> <b>detectors</b> (MaLAD) attempt to detect voluminous congestion inducing attacks which cause apparent slowdown in network functionality. The macroscopic level characterization process identifies these large volumes attacks that have been detected early in transit domain by MaLAD. The microscopic <b>level</b> <b>detectors</b> (MiLAD) detect sophisticated attacks that cause network performance to degrade gracefully and remain undetected in transit domain. Microscopic level characterization process identifies such attacks that have been detected at border routers in stub domain near the victim by Mi-LAD. We employ the concepts of change point detection on entropy with time to improve the detection rate. Honeypots help achieve high detection and filtering accuracy. Use of honeypots is proposed that help achieve high detection accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our framework with simulations on AT&T topology in ns- 2 on a Linux platform. Results demonstrate that in addition to being competitive than other techniques, our framework works well in the presence of different DDoS attacks. The compromise of detection and characterization accuracy and time of confirming is a critical aspect and proposed technique provides the demanded solution...|$|R

Therefore the first level detectors are trained by using motor normal signals, and the second level detectors are trained by using several types of fault signals. During the process of detecting, only the test results of first level detectors are abnormal, the second level detectors are activated and implement fault detection to identify fault type. In this paper, normal vibration signals of motor bearing and three types of fault signals from American Case Western Reserve University bearing fault database are used to verify the fault diagnosis method.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to robustly detect humans in video {{is a critical}} component of automated visual surveillance systems. This paper describes a bilattice based logical reasoning approach that exploits contextual information and knowledge about interactions between humans, and augments it with the output of different low <b>level</b> <b>detectors</b> for human detection. Detections from low <b>level</b> parts-based <b>detectors</b> are treated as logical facts and used to reason explicitly about {{the presence or absence of}} humans in the scene. Positive and negative information from different sources, as well as uncertainties from detections and logical rules, are integrated within the bilattice framework. This approach also generates proofs or justifications for each hypothesis it proposes. These justifications (or lack thereof) are further employed by the system to explain and validate, or reject potential hypotheses. This allows the system to explicitly reason about complex interactions between humans and handle occlusions. These proofs are also available to the end user as an explanation of why the system thinks a particular hypothesis is actually a human. We employ a boosted cascade of gradient histograms based detector to detect individual body parts. We have applied this framework to analyze the presence of humans in static images from different datasets. 1...|$|R

50|$|So in {{oscillators}} {{that must}} produce a very low-distortion sine wave, {{a system that}} keeps the gain roughly constant during the entire cycle is used. A common design uses an incandescent lamp or a thermistor in the feedback circuit. These oscillators exploit the resistance of a tungsten filament of the lamp increases in proportion to its temperature (a thermistor works in a similar fashion). The lamp both measures the output amplitude and controls the oscillator gain at the same time. The oscillator's signal level heats the filament. If the level is too high, then the filament temperature gradually increases, the resistance increases, and the loop gain falls (thus decreasing the oscillator's output level). If the level is too low, the lamp cools down and increases the gain. The 1939 HP200A oscillator uses this technique. Modern variations may use explicit <b>level</b> <b>detectors</b> and gain-controlled amplifiers.|$|R

40|$|Human neurone system encodes all stimuli into {{series of}} spike trains and our brain reconstructs the {{stimulus}} {{back from the}} spikes. Main {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify the suitability of conventional filters to mimic the process of original stimulus reconstruction from neural spike trains as brain does. As human brain receives periodic and aperiodic types of signals, in this paper we have used pulse oximetry waveforms (periodic) and Gaussian signal (aperiodic) as the stimuli. For the neural spike train generation two different neurone models have been used, one model was very simple single threshold <b>level</b> crossing <b>detector</b> and the other one was an advanced simulated stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire neurone model with dynamical threshold. <b>Level</b> crossing <b>detector</b> model is used to generate spike trains from periodic signal whereas both neurone models have been used to generate spike trains for aperiodic Gaussian signal. A simple low-pass Butterworth filter and an advanced Wiener-Kolmogorov filter have been used for reconstructing the stimuli from spike trains. Comparison of the results has been done by the measure of cross correlation coefficients between the actual stimulus and the reconstructed counterpart. Comparison of the results reveal that simple <b>level</b> crossing <b>detector</b> model along with an advanced Wiener-Kolmogorov filter can achieve reconstruction of periodic signal up to 98. 91 % whereas combination of the advanced simulated neurone models with an advanced Wiener-Kolmogorov filter does not achieve reconstruction of more than 55 % for aperiodic signal. This study proves that conventional filters are good for periodic signal reconstruction from their neural spike trains but they are not suitable for aperiodic signals. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
