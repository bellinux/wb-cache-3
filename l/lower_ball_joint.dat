50|$|Another {{example is}} the Ford Focus, which uses MacPherson struts, and the {{anti-roll}} bar is connected directly to the strut, so the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> is only carrying fore and aft traction/braking and lateral cornering loads.|$|E
50|$|The {{caster angle}} or castor angle is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the upper ball joint to the centre of the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint)</b> and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the upper and lower ball joints of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the strut bearing, and the bottom point is the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the scrub radius can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Important {{safety related}} change to front {{suspension}} <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on all cars in September 1983.|$|R
50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|R

40|$|The Lower Control arm is {{the most}} vital {{component}} in a suspension system. It is usually a steel bracket that pivots on rubber bushings mounted to the chassis. The other end supports the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> Significant amount of loads are transmitted through the control arm while it serves to maintain the contact between the wheel and the road and thus providing precise control of the vehicle. The finite element analysis of the control arm using NEiNASTRAN is presented. Inertia relief analysis was carried out as the measured road loads were in self equilibrium. The zone of maximum stress {{in most of the}} load cases studied is close to the left strut bush and around the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> bush. Since the stresses exceed the material yield strength, a nonlinear static analysis of the control arm was also carried out using NEiNASTRAN and the results are compared well with MSC. NASTRAN and ABAQUS analysis. Multi-axial Fatigue analysis using NEiNASTRAN and WINLIFE is discussed. ...|$|E
50|$|Other {{vehicles}} of the 1960s era, including some Vauxhalls, had <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> with considerable end float, because the joint {{was always in}} tension as the spring and damper loads were applied via the lower control arm and were always non-zero.|$|R
50|$|The first Styluses used a {{modified}} Fury chassis, afterwards a purpose built chassis {{was made to}} accommodate the lowered doors. The front rocker arms were upgraded with needle bearings and the front lower arms got redesigned to prevent the <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> being damaged. As with most Sylva models, various engines can be fitted.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like the}} second-generation GM F-body 1970-1981 and X-body vehicles, the GM M-van (Astro/Safari) had a bolt-on subframe. For the M-van, the front {{suspension}} shares most components with the GM B-body station wagon (Chevrolet Caprice, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser) with a leaf-spring rear suspension. The <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were larger than their B-body counterparts (similar to 1977-96 Cadillac D platform vehicles, e.g., Fleetwood limousines). These <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were later {{used in the}} final Chevrolet Caprice 9C1 (police package) cars manufactured in 1995 and 1996. They also shared many mechanical similarities to the GMT 325/330 midsize S/T pickups and utility vehicles.|$|R
5000|$|According to Lincoln advertising, a quality-control regimen {{was used}} at the factory. According to the marketing, final {{assembly}} included dynamometer testing of the engine/transmission, a water spray test to pinpoint body leaks, and a simulated road test. The Versailles featured [...] "matched and balanced" [...] driveline elements, low-friction <b>lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> double isolated shocks, reinforced chassis areas, sound insulation, and balanced forged 14" [...] aluminum wheels with Michelin whitewall X-radials. Bodywork received the first clearcoat paint on a regular production car.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> {{are called}} the [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower <b>ball</b> joint". <b>Lower</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or entirely by the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> as the spring load. The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> It may be taken by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was widened for driver comfort with 2 more inches {{either side of}} the foot pedal, the steering rack-and-pinion moved to rear steer position of the front spindles (unlike Bill's 1st design front steer position on the 1964 model), the front frame section had 7°caster built into it, the front shock tower area had new diagonal tubing installed to limit chassis flex, the front upper and <b>lower</b> a-arms had <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> and the rear chassis area was enlarged to allow for more fuel capacity. The project was never finished by Thomas because of Chevrolet's decision to withdraw its support.|$|R

5000|$|Sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> do {{not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R
50|$|A dual <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> {{suspension}} uses {{a pair of}} arms, one in tension, one in compression, {{to replace}} a wishbone, in a MacPherson or SLA suspension. The outer end of each arm terminates in a <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> hence the name.|$|R
50|$|SLAs can be {{classified}} as short spindle, in which the upper <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> on the spindle is inside the wheel, or long spindle, in which the spindle tucks around the tire and the upper <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> sits above the tire.|$|R

50|$|While {{there is}} no exact {{lifespan}} that can be put on sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> they can fail as early as 80000 miles km in modern vehicles, and much sooner in older vehicles. Signs of a failing <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> may start with a sudden burst sound {{as a result of}} <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> dismantling. Then it keeps on with clicking, popping or snapping sound when the wheel is turned and eventually turn into a squeaking sound {{at the end of a}} stop, when the gas pedal is used and/or also when hitting bumps. Another symptom could be 'thud' noises coming from front suspension when going over bumps. Dry <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> have dramatically increased friction and can cause the steering to stick or be more difficult.|$|R
50|$|To {{permit a}} high degree of freedom, the control {{cylinders}} resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> and threaded rod. This <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes.|$|R
50|$|The two arms, the spindle, and the body, form a four-bar link. Use of {{the linkage}} {{at the lower}} {{suspension}} connection of either a MacPherson strut or a short long arms suspension readily gives an effective virtual <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> outboard of the spindle, which is very useful for a suspension designer, allowing negative scrub radius whilst allowing the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to move in and thus {{out of the way}} of the brakes. Some manufacturers use a double <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> arm to replace both wishbones on a short long arms suspension. This provides further opportunity for optimising the geometry.|$|R
