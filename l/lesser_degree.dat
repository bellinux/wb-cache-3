Furthermore, the area is visited by birdwatchers from Sweden, Norway and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Automotive {{manufacturers}} {{often use}} patterns to disguise upcoming products. This camouflage {{is designed to}} obfuscate the vehicle's visual lines, and is used along with padding, covers, and decals. The patterns' purpose is to prevent visual observation (and to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> photography), that would subsequently enable reproduction of the vehicle's form factors.|$|E
5|$|More {{sophisticated}} classification {{arrangements were}} proposed by Pseudo-Geber (in the Geber corpus, c. 1310), Paracelsus (De Natura Rerum libri nonem, 1525–6; and later works), Basil Valentine (Conclusiones, 1624), and Boerhaave (Elementa Chemiæ, 1733). They attempted {{to separate the}} more characteristic metals from substances having those characteristics to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Such substances included zinc, antimony, bismuth, stibnite, pyrite and galena. These were all then called semimetals or bastard metals.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other fungi}} {{pathogenic}} to insects in the Ophiocordyceps genus, O. unilateralis targets a specific host species, the Camponotus leonardi ant.

5|$|Tires {{have a large}} {{influence}} over bike handling, especially on motorcycles, but also on bicycles. Tires influence bike dynamics in two distinct ways: finite crown radius and force generation.

Increasing the crown radius of the rear tire has the opposite effect, but to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{decreases}} {{blood clotting}} by blocking an enzyme called vitamin K epoxide reductase that reactivates vitamin K1. Without sufficient active vitamin K1, clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X have decreased clotting ability. The anticlotting protein C and protein S are also inhibited {{but to a}} <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> A few days are required for full effect to occur and these effects can last {{for up to five}} days.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} there were about forty Jesuit colleges (secondary schools) {{scattered}} throughout the Commonwealth. They were educating mostly szlachta, burgher sons to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Jan Zamoyski, Chancellor of the Crown, who built the town of Zamość, established an academy there in 1594; it had functioned as a gymnasium only after Zamoyski's death. The first two Vasa kings were well known for patronizing both the arts and sciences. After that the Commonwealth's science experienced general decline, which paralleled the wartime decline of the burgher class.|$|E

5|$|Heilmann's {{articles}} were later collected and published {{as a book}} in Danish in 1916 with the title as in his series, Vor Nuvaerende Viden om Fuglenes Afstamming ("our present knowledge {{about the origin of}} birds"). This met the same lack of interest and is thought to have been a result of publishing in Danish, as this made it inaccessible to many scientists working in the U.S. and much of Europe. The field of paleontology at the time was dominated by American and English scientists, and the discipline in continental Europe was dominated by Germany and to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> France.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of other fruit trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree.</b> Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> than new facts or memories.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{tradition of}} Buddhist practice is {{preserved in the}} nikāya/āgamas, and is adhered to by the Theravāda lineage.

5|$|Luxury {{items were}} in high demand among the {{increasingly}} prosperous nobility, and to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> among the wealthy town merchants.

5|$|Manta {{rays are}} members of the order Myliobatiformes which {{consists}} of stingrays and their relatives. The genus Manta is part of the eagle ray family Myliobatidae, where it is grouped in the subfamily Mobulinae along with the Mobula devil rays. In 2017, an analysis of DNA—and, to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> morphology—found that Mobula was paraphyletic with respect to the manta rays, and they recommended treating Manta as a junior synonym of Mobula.|$|E
5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, {{but it is also}} clear that she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree,</b> Rose.|$|E

5|$|Research {{indicates}} that the salinity of the Euphrates water in Iraq has increased considerably since the nearly simultaneous construction of the Keban Dam in Turkey and the Tabqa Dam in Syria. This increase can, among other things, {{be related to the}} lower discharge of the Euphrates {{as a result of the}} construction of the Keban Dam and the dams of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (GAP) in Turkey, and to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> of the Tabqa Dam in Syria. High-salinity water is less useful for domestic and irrigation purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{east has}} a more {{continental}} climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur.

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a <b>lesser</b> <b>degree</b> in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E

2500|$|ACS {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from stable angina, which develops during exertion and resolves at rest. In contrast with stable angina, unstable angina occurs suddenly, often at rest or with minimal exertion, or at <b>lesser</b> <b>degrees</b> of exertion than the individual's previous angina ("crescendo angina"). [...] New onset angina is also considered unstable angina, since it suggests a new problem in a coronary artery.|$|R
