25|$|The {{artist has}} broken down the picture plane into facets, {{presenting}} multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910—since considered a founding principle of Cubism—would soon {{find its way into}} the foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, <b>lot</b> <b>no.</b> 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. It is now in the Royal Collection of Paintings and Sculpture at the museum.|$|E
500|$|North American Philips Corporation built a [...] {{plant at}} 100 Providence Pike, North Smithfield, Rhode Island (Slatersville) on a [...] plot in 1959. The 15-acre {{property}} is {{recorded by the}} Town of North Smithfield Tax Assessor as <b>Lot</b> <b>No.</b> 60 on Plat No. 4, and <b>Lot</b> <b>No.</b> 385 on Plat No. 5. There are five buildings located on the property. The property is bordered to the north by Industrial Drive; to the south by Comstock Road, to the east by a grassy area; and to the west by Providence Pike. The plant was operated by one of Philips' fully owned subsidiaries, Amperex Electronics, to supply IBM, one of Philips' largest customers, with high speed, gold-doped germanium logic diodes. Millions of these diodes were manufactured at the Slatersville plant every year. With the advent of silicon diodes in 1962 there was a decreasing demand for these germanium diodes, so Philips transferred their germanium Post Alloy Diffused Transistor (PADT) manufacturing to Slatersville {{to take advantage of}} the site's capacity.|$|E

500|$|In most {{reports the}} sale was {{announced}} in advance, perhaps by advertisement in a local newspaper. It usually {{took the form of}} an auction, often at a local market, to which the wife would be led by a halter (usually of rope but sometimes of ribbon) around her neck, or arm. Often the purchaser was arranged in advance, and the sale was a form of symbolic separation and remarriage, as in a case from Maidstone, where in January 1815 John Osborne planned to sell his wife at the local market. However, as no market was held that day, the sale took place instead at [...] "the sign of 'The Coal-barge,' in Earl Street", where [...] "in a very regular manner", his wife and child were sold for £1 to a man named William Serjeant.
