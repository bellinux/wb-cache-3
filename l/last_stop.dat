5|$|Adjacent to {{the main}} station is , the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the South Eastern main line towards London before the {{terminus}} at Charing Cross. Waterloo East has four platforms, which are lettered A–D rather than numbered to avoid confusion with the numbered platforms in the main station by staff who work at both stations. Waterloo East is managed and branded separately from the main station. Trains go to southeast London, Kent and parts of East Sussex. All regular services are operated by Southeastern.|$|E
5|$|After six weeks' {{training}} in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the Maritz Rebellion was all but over {{by the time the}} Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at Bloemfontein. The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein for about a month, then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the South-West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E
50|$|Kamikawa {{is one of}} the <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> on {{the main}} JR line running east from Sapporo, {{therefore}} a wide range of rail services are available.|$|R
60|$|And {{the poor}} boy, who {{considered}} {{that he was}} making confession of a deadly and shameful sin, blushed scarlet, and stammered, and at <b>last</b> <b>stopped.</b>|$|R
60|$|The yellow {{platform}} {{lights came}} into the field of view, passing first rapidly, then slowly, and at <b>last</b> <b>stopping</b> with a jerk. Dim shapes of men passed to and fro without.|$|R
5|$|At Carroll Street, {{the express}} tracks ramp up {{to rejoin the}} local tracks, and all four tracks rise onto the Culver Viaduct, curving onto Ninth Street. East of Fourth Avenue station towards Park Slope, the tracks become a subway once again. Past 7th Avenue, the local tracks diverge, curving south to 15th Street and Prospect Park West, while the express tracks take a direct route beneath Prospect Park. This {{is one of two}} places in the subway where the express tracks diverge from the local tracks, the other being on the IND Queens Boulevard Line between 65th Street and 36th Street. The express tracks rejoin the {{right-of-way}} at approximately Terrace Place and Prospect Avenue, running on a lower level under Prospect Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway near the Prospect Park Parade Grounds, then rise up as the line curves onto McDonald Avenue. The line then parallels the route of the original Culver Line surface railroad into Church Avenue station, the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> of the original IND service.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Washington left on {{his third}} trip, to the South, largely to promote {{national}} unity amid uproar over Hamilton's economic plan, as well as slavery. The trip began on March 20, 1791, when Washington and {{a small group of}} aides began sailing down the Severn River. After sailing through a large storm, they arrived in Annapolis. From Annapolis he traveled to Mount Vernon, and from there to Colchester, Virginia, to Richmond, Virginia. After leaving Richmond, he went to Petersburg, than Emporia, Virginia. He left Virginia and went to Craven County, North Carolina, then New Bern. Washington's <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> in North Carolina was Wilmington, which upon leaving he promptly arrived in Georgetown, South Carolina, subsequently travelling to Charleston. After South Carolina, Washington arrived in Georgia, going to (among others) Augusta. In late May, Washington turned around, stopping at many Revolutionary War battle sites. On July 11, 1791, they arrived back at Mount Vernon.|$|E

60|$|I {{know what}} it is; he has caught sight of a church. I pretend not to notice any change in him, and {{endeavour}} to hurry him on. He lags more and more behind, however, and at <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> altogether.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of all created shiftlessness, this beats everything! Why couldn't we {{have taken}} in enough wood to last the ten miles farther to the {{terminus}} when we <b>last</b> <b>stopped?</b> And why in thunder, with all this firing up, can't we go faster?" ...|$|R
50|$|While it is {{now known}} that Romanis are {{ultimately}} of northwestern Hindustani origin (an area today shared between India and Pakistan), many did enter Europe via a generations-long migration which included Egypt {{as one of their}} <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> before their arrival into Europe.|$|R
25|$|On August 3, {{the torch}} relay started in Sichuan after a devastated {{earthquake}} that killed almost 70,000 people in May. Sichuan was the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> {{before returning to}} Beijing for the opening ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Xuanzang now {{returned}} northward to Shravasti Bahraich, travelled through Terai in {{the southern}} part of modern Nepal (here he found deserted Buddhist monasteries) and thence to Kapilavastu, his <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> before Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha.|$|E

5000|$|The {{railway station}} is located under street level. At street level, {{there are the}} <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> of tram route 55 and bus route 59, which offer a {{connection}} with regional transport. Bus routes 45 and 69 also stop at the Bordet railway station.|$|R
50|$|The manor {{was one of}} the <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> for the Underground Railroad before {{entering}} into Canada. There are still tunnels under the manor that lead to the nearby river. There have been reported sightings of an African American spirit near the manor.|$|R
50|$|The {{county was}} {{also part of}} a route on the Underground Railroad, {{and was one of}} the <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> before {{entering}} Canada. Slaves would meet and hide just outside Aroostook or in deserted areas. Friends Quaker Church near Fort Fairfield was often a final stop.|$|R

25|$|Often the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> after a {{night of}} alcohol-lined {{entertainment}} for youths and businesspeople alike, noraebangs are also a favorite family pastime, and many are surprisingly dry venues. People also frequent noraebangs as a form of stress relief, and some noraebangs cater to those who seek to sing alone.|$|E
50|$|Dayanatpur is {{a village}} in the Ghaziabad District {{of the state of}} Uttar Pradesh, India. It is one of the <b>last</b> <b>stops</b> towards the river Ganges from the New Delhi side. The {{historic}} Kutchesar Fort lies just a couple of miles from the small settlement of Dayanatpur.|$|R
50|$|The {{legend of}} the origin of the shrine states that the hero Yamatotakeru-no-Mikoto, who turned into a white swan upon his death, <b>last</b> <b>stopped</b> at the future site of the Otori Taisha. It is said that the people nearby built the shrine in order to worship white swans.|$|R
60|$|It was {{now much}} past eight o'clock, and, {{from the nature}} of the evening, dusk. The <b>last</b> <b>stopping</b> up-train was about ten, so that half-an-hour could well be afforded for looking round. Ethelberta went to the gate, which was found to be {{fastened}} by a chain and padlock.|$|R
25|$|After North White Plains, {{the next}} station is Valhalla {{adjacent}} to the Taconic State Parkway. The double-track railroad then curves to follow the Saw Mill River Valley and the eponymous parkway. Rail and road briefly separate at Mount Kisco, but then remain close by at the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> along the Saw Mill, Bedford Hills (although the parkway cannot {{be seen from the}} station).|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Ann and Nancy {{returned}} to the road with a brand-new Heart lineup that included Scott Olson, Ben Smith, Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez, and keyboardist Tom Kellock. In 2003, Heart released a DVD of their <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> in the tour as Alive in Seattle. Also in 2003, Gilby Clarke (ex-Guns N' Roses) and Darian Sahanaja replaced Olson and Kellock for an American tour.|$|E
25|$|The Roman bathhouse {{consisted}} of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite {{thousands of years of}} earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{for some}} hours," [...] I replied. [...] "The driver {{told me there}} were no houses between {{the place where we}} <b>last</b> <b>stopped</b> and the railroad-station, and I am sure he will not turn back until he reaches a place where he can get either a new pole or another vehicle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you boys}} dry up!" [...] was the reply {{from the man}} with the long nose, and now they {{recognized}} him as a fellow they had met in a hotel at their <b>last</b> <b>stopping</b> place. The man had had a row with a porter, and had made himself generally disagreeable.|$|R
60|$|After {{wandering}} {{about for}} nearly an hour in this state of uncertainty, Roy at <b>last</b> <b>stopped,</b> and, putting his arm round his sister's waist, said that he had lost himself altogether! Poor Nelly, whose heart had been gradually sinking, fairly broke down; she hid her face in her brother's bosom, and wept.|$|R
25|$|The {{next two}} stops, Harlem Valley–Wingdale and Dover Plains, are roughly eight miles (13km) apart, the longest {{distance}} between any two {{stops on the}} Harlem Line. From 1972 to 2000, Dover Plains was the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on the line, but then tracks remaining from the NYCRR era {{that had not yet}} been torn up were renovated and the line was extended to Tenmile River and its new northern terminus, Wassaic. A small yard where diesel trains await their routes just past the station marks the end of the line.|$|E
25|$|When {{domestic}} air routes {{were established}} in 1935, there only went months from the approval to the services commenced. Permission was granted in April, at which time a suitable site for an aerodrome {{had yet to be}} identified. As an interim solution a buoy was founded for the first season. Norwegian Air Lines set up Tromsø as the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> on its coastal service north of Bergen. Using a Junkers W 34, the route was inaugurated on 7 July and ran three times weekly for four weeks in the first season. Travel time to Bergen was ten and a half hours.|$|E
25|$|Though Riccarton Road {{was part}} of the route, the first stop for {{outbound}} services and the <b>last</b> <b>stop</b> for inbound services were in Picton Avenue meaning there was no connection with the Riccarton tramline. This issue became moot on 1 August 1960 when a route alteration diverted Wharenui buses down Deans Avenue and Blenheim Road before rejoining the old route. There were many changes to the route over the next three decades including extensions that took it well beyond Wharenui. New destinations included Curletts Road and Springs Road and after the route ended up connecting with Hornby Mall in the 1980s it was combined with existing Templeton, Lincoln, and Southbridge routes.|$|E
