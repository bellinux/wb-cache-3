Third, noting the limitation of continuum strain gradient crystal plasticity models, two-dimensional discrete dislocation simulation results suggest that the hardness in the nanocontact regime is governed synergistically by a combination of strain gradients and source-limited plasticity.

40|$|A gradient-enhanced crystal {{plasticity}} {{model is}} presented that explicitly {{accounts for the}} evolution of the densities of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) on individual slip systems of deforming crystals. The GND densities are fully coupled with the crystal slip rule. Application of the model to two distinct and technologically important crystal types, namely hcp Ti and ccp Ni, is given. For the hcp crystals, slip is permitted with a-type slip directions on basal, prismatic and pyramidal planes and c + a-type slip directions on pyramidal planes. First, a single crystal under four-point bending is simulated as the uniform strain gradient expected in the central span provides a good validation of the code. Then, uniaxial deformation of a model near-a Ti polycrystal has been analysed. The resulting distributions of GND densities that develop on the various slip system types have been compared with independent experimental observations. The model predicts that GND density on the c + a systems is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that for a-type systems in agreement with experiment. For the ccp case, slip is considered to take place on the { 111 } slip systems. Thermal loading of a single-crystal nickel alloy sample containing carbide particles of size approximately 30 mm has been analysed. Detailed comparisons are presented between model predictions and results of high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements of the micro-deformations, <b>lattice</b> <b>rotations,</b> curvatures and GND densities local to the nickel-carbide interface. Qualitatively, good agreement is achieved between the coupled and decoupled model elastic strains with the EBSD measurements, but <b>lattice</b> <b>rotations</b> and GND densities are quantitatively well predicted by the coupled crystal model but are less well captured by the decoupled model. The GND coupling is found to lead to reduced <b>lattice</b> <b>rotations</b> and plastic strains in the region of highest heterogeneity close to the Ni matrix/particle interface, which is in agreement with the experimental measurements.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{experimental}} efforts such as electron back scattering technique and three-dimensional X-ray structural microscopy have revealed the intriguing formation of sectors of <b>lattice</b> <b>rotation</b> fields under indentation. In the case of wedge indentation, the in-plane rotation changes sign from one sector to another. Although the <b>lattice</b> <b>rotation</b> fields {{can be used to}} compute the geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) densities, it remains unclear how these sectors can be related to the hardness and therefore to the indentation size effects, i. e., the increase of indentation hardness with the decrease of indentation depth. Crystal plasticity simulations in this work reproduce the experimental findings at large indentation depth. On the contrary, discrete dislocation plasticity can only capture the sectors found experimentally when there is a high obstacle density and large obstacle strength. Obstacle density and strength, however, have little effect on the hardness. In other words, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the <b>lattice</b> <b>rotation</b> patterns and the indentation size effects. The presence of obstacles favors the dislocation arrangements that lead to the experimentally found rotation sectors.

Some have attributed the ISE to the existence of strain gradients and the geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs). Since the GND density {{is directly related to the}} local lattice curvature, the Scanning X-ray Microdiffraction ({mu}SXRD) technique, which can quantitatively measure relative <b>lattice</b> <b>rotations</b> through the streaking of Laue diffractions, can used to study the strain gradients.

The <b>lattice</b> <b>rotations</b> of aluminium single crystals have been determined with the help of stereographic projections (i). Supposing a (101) [101] slip system, during single slip the tensile axis (TA) rotates toward [i 01] which is the slip direction. However when the TA reaches the boundary [001]-[111] of the stereographic triangle [001]-[011]-[111], the primary and the conjugate systems are activated and duplex slip should occur. Consequently, the TA should rotate toward [112]. These considerations would apply to a polycrystalline material only if the individual grains could rotate independently from each other. The individual grains of a polycrystalline material, however, cannot rotate freely due to the interaction between adjacent grains.

The transition is characterized as a Z_ 2 vortex dissociation in the isotropic case, whereas it {{can be viewed as a}} Z vortex dissociation in the anisotropic case. Remarkably, the latter is continuously connected to the former as the magnitude of anisotropy decreases, in contrast to the recent work by Misawa and Motome [J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 79 (2010) 073001. ] in which both the transitions were found to be continuous. Comment: 11 pages, 16 figures, accepted to JPS...|$|R

Shear strain and <b>lattice</b> <b>rotation</b> within the crystalline lattice are observed at {{the boundaries between}} the SiGe and Si regions. The experimental results are compared to micromechanical modeling simulations to understand the mechanisms of elastic relaxation on all the modes of deformation at a sub-micron length scale.
