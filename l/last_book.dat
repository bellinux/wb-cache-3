5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} <b>last</b> <b>book,</b> Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand.

5|$|Martin {{believes}} {{the last two}} volumes of the series will be big books of 1500 manuscript pages each. The sixth book will be called The Winds of Winter, taking {{the title of the}} <b>last</b> <b>book</b> of the originally planned trilogy. Displeased with the provisional title A Time for Wolves for the final volume, Martin ultimately announced A Dream of Spring as the title for the seventh book in 2006. Martin said in March 2012 that the final two novels will take readers farther north than any of the previous books, and that the Others will appear in the book.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the {{character}} she fantasized about the most, the <b>last</b> <b>book</b> in the series, Beebo Brinker, published in 1962, was Bannon's prequel to Odd Girl Out.

5|$|The Goražde {{printing}} house {{was one of}} the earliest among the Serbs and the first in the territory of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina.

5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her <b>last</b> <b>book</b> in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E

5|$|Although Amir {{had little}} {{correspondence}} {{with his friends}} in Java, his poems– most {{of which had been}} written in Java– continued to be published in Poedjangga Baroe. His first poetry collection, Nyanyi Sunyi (Songs of Silence), was published in the magazine's November 1937 edition. Nearly two years later, in June 1939, the magazine published a collection of poems Amir had translated, entitled Setanggi Timur (Incense from the East). In June 1941 his last collection, Buah Rindu (Fruits of Longing), was published. All were later republished as stand-alone books.

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns the economic and social effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His <b>last</b> <b>book</b> before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E

5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the <b>last</b> <b>book</b> was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had been rejected by a publisher.|$|E
5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her <b>last</b> <b>book</b> Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the <b>last</b> <b>book</b> {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating {{that it would have}} been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E

5|$|Hinton {{followed}} the advice {{given to her}} and wrote her second novel, That Was Then, This Is Now in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, Rumble Fish; {{it was published in}} 1975 after she had published a short story version in a 1968 edition of University of Tulsa's Alumni Magazine. Four years later in 1979, Tex was published and would be Hinton's <b>last</b> <b>book</b> for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel Taming the Star Runner was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after Taming the Star Runner, Hinton released her first children's book, Big David, Little David, which followed with the release of The Puppy Sister in 1995. In 2004, Hawkes Harbor, Hinton's first adult novel, was released. Hinton's most recent book, Some of Tim's Stories, was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book. Overall, Hinton has written nine published books.|$|E
5|$|His Dwie drogi (Two ways, 1959) {{about the}} January Uprising of the 1860s {{represent}} the latest historical period he has tackled. His other popular historical books include Trzej kronikarze, (Three chroniclers; 1964), {{a book about}} three medieval chroniclers of Polish history (Thietmar of Merseburg, Gallus Anonymus and Wincenty Kadłubek), in which he discusses the Polish society through ages; and Ostatnia z rodu (Last of the Family; 1965) about the last queen of the Jagiellon dynasty, Anna Jagiellonka. His Rozważania o wojnie domowej (1978; Thoughts on Civil War) were the <b>last</b> <b>book</b> he has finished; unlike majority of his other works, this book is ostensibly about the civil war (Chouannerie) in Brittany, France. This work does however contains numerous arguments applicable to more modern Polish history; arguments that Jasienica thought {{would not be allowed}} by the censors if the book discussed Polish history.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Clark {{worked as}} the {{assistant}} to the entomologist on probation in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture, but in 1920, he took on this position full-time. He started to publish his first articles about pest insects and ants from 1921; in 1926 he became an entomologist at the National Museum in Melbourne, remaining there for 20 years. Clark continued to publish more articles until he resigned from the National Museum of Victoria in 1944. Living in poverty, Clark lived a reclusive life, publishing his <b>last</b> <b>book</b> in 1951. He died on 1 June 1956 {{at the age of}} 71, survived by his six children. One of Clark's most notable achievements was describing Nothomyrmecia macrops, the most primitive living ant. Several ants have been named after him in recognition of his contributions.|$|E
