5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the <b>local</b> <b>currency,</b> the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{consider}} Zelizer’s {{theory of money}} in a market setting. Do people create and use market money to express social values? <b>Local</b> <b>currencies,</b> which circulate in competition with national <b>currencies</b> in <b>local</b> economies around the world, provide the case studies. I survey the research literature on <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> and find important limits on Zelizer’s theory for market money. While people create and use <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> for both economic and noneconomic reasons, most people stop using them when economic benefits are not realized. Sustained use of <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> is uncommon. The few successes are limited in scope, and such successes cannot simply be credited to commitment based on social values. I briefly discuss policy implications of this finding for community currency as a development alternative. ...|$|R

5|$|The Mikea {{struggle}} {{to ensure the}} quality of life they seek. While the forest has long provided for their basic needs, deforestation and population growth are straining resources. In addition, Mikea are increasingly seeking to obtain better quality material goods for themselves, such as clothing, which necessitates greater engagement with the external economy through trade and wage labor to earn <b>local</b> <b>currency.</b> Lack of access to social services such as education and health clinics are also taking their toll: with only one health clinic in the Mikea Forest area and low access to water for bathing, rates of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and skin disease are disproportionately prevalent.|$|E

40|$|Although today's main {{organisation}} {{principle of}} monetary spaces is the nation-state's one, everyone {{can see it}} is not totally the case because of the existence {{and the development of}} <b>local</b> and social <b>currencies</b> and other sorts of parallel currencies. European history gives very useful lessons on this matter. One can distinguish, indeed, three historical periods : firstly, an “old regime” with a great diversity of money, including forms of local currencies; secondly, the building of nation states and, consequently, what Benjamin Cohen (1998) calls a “westphalian model of geography of money”, centred on the principle of one nation, one money, excluding <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> different from national currencies; thirdly, the contesting of such a regime of monetary sovereignty. European history gives, then, evidences that the contemporary dynamics of <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> is not a new one, but that it is undoubtedly the most important of the third period. European history leads however to make significant differences between forms of monetary localisms. Those differences are analyzed within the following framework. First, we have to make a distinction between the nature of issuers : public authorities, groups of citizens, businesses and banks. Monetary localisms before the Westphalian era were mainly organized by public authorities (lords) and religious orders, whereas today's monetary localisms mainly come from citizens and businesses (except from emergency issues and secessions logics). Second, we have to make a distinction between the rationales for monetary localisms : sovereignty, seignoriage and financing needs, protecting spaces, revitalizing spaces, transforming the nature of exchanges and money. Monetary localisms before the Westphalian era were mainly organized in order to capture money and dynamize spaces, whereas one can find the four rationales in today's monetary localisms. The paper, after presenting the analytical framework, concentrates on three sorts of <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> : <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> as a result of necessities, <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> issued by banks and <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> aiming to change money. It concludes on the differences between <b>local</b> <b>currencies</b> in European history and contemporary <b>local</b> <b>currencies.</b> <b>Local</b> currencies;monetary history;Europe;Owen;Gesell;Banks of issue...|$|R
