Concentrations of mercury in muscle of <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>circularis</b> (n =  20; 23 – 110. 5  cm total length, 157 – 490  m water depth) and L. fullonica (n =  24; 28. 5 – 100  cm total length, 130 – 426  m water depth) were 0. 02 – 1. 8 and 0. 04 – 0. 61  mg kg−  1, respectively. Concentrations of both As and Hg increased with total length. Only the largest specimen had {{a concentration of}} Hg in muscle >  1. 0  mg kg−  1. Data were limited for specimens >  90  cm long, and further studies on contaminants in larger-bodied skates could usefully be undertaken...|$|E

40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Dipturus nidarosiensis (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>circularis</b> (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low. Raja brachyura was recorded {{for the first time in}} the survey area...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., Dipturus nidarosiensis, Dipturus oxyrinchus, <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>circularis,</b> Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, Raja montagui, Raja radula, Raja polystigma, Raja undulata, Rostroraja alba, Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|E
40|$|The {{availability}} of updated biological information {{is essential to}} any successful fisheries management plan. An example could be to analyze the main size conversion factors, commonly used to estimate values from one or more known body measurements and particularly helpful when a specimen is damaged and may {{also serve as a}} tool for species identification. In the Mediterranean Sea, limited morphometric information on skates (Rajidae) has been reported, mainly in association with reproduction and growth studies. The goal {{of this paper is to}} estimate relationships between different body measurements to increase the information relative to the most common skate species in Sardinian seas (Central-Western Mediterranean) : Dipturus oxyrinchus, <b>Leucoraja</b> <b>circularis,</b> Raja asterias, R. brachyura, R. clavata, R. miraletus and R. polystigma. For each species, total length (TL), disc width (DW), disc length (DL) and length up to the first dorsal fin (D 1 L), all in millimeters, and total weight (TW), in grams, were taken. An exploratory analysis of morphometric ratios (DW:TL, DL:TL, DL:DW, D 1 L:TL) was performed and the least-squares method was used to estimate the parameters of the linear expressions TL=aDW+b, TL=aDL+b, TL=aD 1 L+b and DW=aDL+b. The relationship between TW and TL was fitted and the function was log-transformed. All species showed an allometric growth (b> 3). Differences in the morphometric ratios were observed within species. L. circularis and D. oxyrinchus showed the most distinctive shapes, relative to the other species: the former showed a narrower disc in relation to TL, the latter had the disc longer in relation to TL. Both skates had the disc longer than wide. The results indicated that the conversion factors were useful to determinate catch size, explore life history change. Moreover, these factors could made morphological comparisons between different species from different geographical areas and should be considered an useful tool to discriminate skate species...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that the cardiac outflow tract of sharks and chimaeras does not consist of a single {{myocardial}} component, the conus arteriosus, as classically accepted, but two, namely, the myocardial conus arteriosus and the non-myocardial bulbus arteriosus. However, the anatomical composition of the outflow tract of the batoid hearts remains unknown. The present study was designed to fill this gap. The material examined consisted of hearts of two species of rays, namely, the Mediterranean starry ray (Raja asterias) and sandy ray (<b>Leucoraja</b> <b>circularis).</b> They were studied using scanning electron microscopy, and histochemical and inmunohistochemical techniques. In both species, the outflow tract consists of two components, proximal and distal with regard to the ventricle. The proximal component is the conus arteriosus; it is characterized by the presence of compact myocardium in its wall and several transverse rows of pocket-shaped valves at its luminal side. Each valve consists of a leaflet and its supporting sinus. Histologically, the leaflet has two fibrosas, inner and outer, and a middle coat, the spongiosa. The distal component lacks myocardium. Its wall consists of smooth muscle cells, elastic fibers and collagen. Thus, it shows an arterial-like structure. However, it differs from the aorta because it is covered by the epicardium and crossed by coronary arteries. These findings indicate that the distal component is morphologically equivalent to the bulbus arteriosus of sharks and chimaeras. In contrast to foregoing descriptions, the valves of the first transverse row are distally anchored to the bulbus arteriosus and not to the ventral aorta. Our findings give added support to the notion that presence of a bulbus arteriosus at the arterial pole of the heart is common to all chondrichtyans, and not an apomorphy of actinopterygians as classically thought.
