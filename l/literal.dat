40|$|In {{this paper}} I extend the {{standard}} first-order resolution method with special reasoning mechanisms for sorts. Sorts are one place predicates. <b>Literals</b> built {{from one place}} predicates are called sort <b>literals.</b> Negative sort <b>literals</b> can be compiled into restrictions of the relevant variables to sorts or can be deleted if they fulfill special conditions. Positive sort <b>literals</b> define the sort structure for sorted unification. Sorted unification exploits the sort restrictions of variables. As the occurrence of sort <b>literals</b> is not restricted, it might be necessary to add additional <b>literals</b> to resolvents and factors and to dynamically change the set of positive sort <b>literals</b> used by sorted unification during the deduction process. The calculus I propose thus extends the standard resolution method by sorted unification, residue <b>literals</b> and a dynamic processing of the sort information. I show that this calculus generalizes and improves existing approaches to sorted reasoning. Finally I give some applications to automated theorem proving and abduction...|$|R

5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their <b>literal</b> interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as he doubted their apostolic origin.

We offer examples of how reification allows <b>literals</b> {{to participate in a}} variety of relations enabling a marked increase in expressivity. We begin with a case study in reified person names, and then extend this analysis to reified dates and simple reified scalar values. We show benefits for name matching and temporal analysis such as would be of interest to the Intelligence Community (IC). We then show how these same sorts of analyses can drive or inform any decision as to whether to reify <b>literals...</b>|$|R

5|$|The book {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of religious responses at a time of changing ideas and increasing secularisation. The issues raised were complex and there was a large middle ground.

40|$|AND-parallel {{execution}} of logic programs {{turns out to}} be an intricate matter whenever clause <b>literals</b> are linked by shared variables. Shared variable dependencies call for special precautions to prevent processes from computing inconsistent bindings while working on clause <b>literals</b> simultaneously. Therefore, most systems restrict AND-parallelism to its producer/consumer style by allowing only independent <b>literals</b> to run in parallel. These <b>literals</b> then act as producers of variable bindings which will be consumed by dependent <b>literals</b> in subsequent steps. However, to implement producer/consumer parallelism efficiently, appropriate methods must be available for detecting dependencies caused by shared variables. Concerning such dependencies this paper presents a methodology which may serve as a basis for efficient dependency checking by performing compile and run-time analysis of program clauses...|$|R
