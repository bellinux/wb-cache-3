25|$|As {{the safety}} car was exiting turn 11, an {{approaching}} Lamborghini Gallardo GT3 drastically reduced its speed {{in response to}} the unusually slow safety car. However, a BMW a few seconds behind came around the blind turn at speed, colliding with the Gallardo and safety car. The collision destroyed the Gallardo and sent the BMW into a number of rolls. The safety car was sent off the track into the Armco at great speed. In the chaos, a Marcos LM600 coming around turn 11 locked up its brakes and spun into the wet grass {{on the inside of the}} track. Sliding back onto the track, it was hit from the side by a BMW Z3. Furthermore, two E46 BMW M3 GTRs were damaged: one on the outside <b>line</b> <b>hit</b> the rear of the Marcos, and the other, on the inside line, slightly damaged its front right. The second M3 continued around the track, while the first slid into the grass before turn 12. The race was stopped, and there were no serious injuries to any of the drivers.|$|E
500|$|While {{making its}} first landfall, Allison's large {{circulation}} dropped severe rains on southwest Louisiana. [...] Days later, Allison hit {{the state as}} a subtropical storm, dropping more heavy rains to the area. Rainfall totals peaked at 29.86inches (758mm) in Thibodaux, the highest rainfall total in Louisiana from a tropical cyclone since another Tropical Storm Allison in 1989. Most of the southeastern portion of the state experienced over 10inches of rain (255mm). Winds were generally light, peaking at 38mph (61km/h) sustained in Lakefront with gusts to 53mph (85km/h) in Bay Gardene. The storm produced a storm surge of 2.5feet (0.75m) in Cameron as it was making landfall in Texas. While moving northward through Texas, the outer bands of the storm produced an F1 tornado near Zachary, damaging several trees and a power line. A man was killed when a damaged power <b>line</b> <b>hit</b> his truck.|$|E

2500|$|On June 24, 1885, The Sporting Life {{reported}} that the Cincinnati Reds had made an offer to Burns. [...] Burns opted instead to sign with [...] the St. Louis Maroons of the National League. Burns appeared in 14 games for the Maroons, 14 games in the outfield (principally center field) and three innings as a relief pitcher in one game. [...] A newspaper account of his first game for St. Louis, on July 6, 1885, noted: [...] "Dick Burns made his inaugural appearance {{as a member of}} the St. Louis Club, and distinguished himself in the sixth inning by making a remarkable running backward catch of a <b>line</b> <b>hit</b> from Gilligan's bat, which really saved the game." [...] Again facing tougher competition in the National League, Burns' batting average dropped 84 points from the prior season to [...]222. [...] He appeared in his final major league game on July 23, 1885, a 15–3 loss to the New York Giants in which Burns played center field, had no hits in four at bats, and committed two errors in three chances for the Maroons.|$|E
60|$|Salisbury, a poor batter, {{apparently}} {{shut his}} eyes and swung with all his might. All present heard the ringing crack of the bat, but few saw the ball. Raymond leaped lengthwise {{to the left and}} flashed out his glove. There was another crack, of different sound. Then Raymond bounded over second base, kicking the bag, and with fiendish quickness sped the ball to first. Kern, the umpire, waved both arms wide. Then to the gasping audience the play became clear. Raymond had caught Salisbury's <b>line</b> <b>hit</b> in one hand, enabling him to make a triple play. A mighty shout shook the stands. Then strong, rhythmic, lusty cheers held the field in thrall for the moment, while the teams changed sides.|$|E

50|$|A line {{connecting}} {{this point}} to the opposite corner of the square is drawn. Where this (blue) <b>line</b> <b>hits</b> {{the side of the}} square, a horizontal line is drawn, representing the farthest edge of the square. The line just drawn represents the ray of light traveling from the farthest edge of the square to the viewer's eye. This step is key to understanding perspective drawing. The light that passes through the picture plane obviously can not be traced. Instead, lines that represent those rays of light are drawn on the picture plane. In the case of the square, the side of the square also represents the picture plane (at an angle), so there is a small shortcut: when the <b>line</b> <b>hits</b> the side of the square, it has also hit the appropriate spot in the picture plane. The (blue) line is drawn to the opposite edge of the foremost edge because of another shortcut: since all sides are the same length, the foremost edge can stand in for the side edge.|$|R
