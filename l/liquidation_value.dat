25|$|In {{situations}} where the <b>liquidation</b> <b>value</b> of the assets exceeds a secured creditor's lien, the assignee is not normally required to obtain the consent of a secured creditor or any other creditor prior to the assignment process. Cooperation of the secured creditor may however affect the assignee's ability to liquidate an asset. An assignee in practice may obtain {{the consent of the}} secured creditors in advance of the assignment to ensure that the assignee can liquidate the asset or assets in a timely manner without a secured party stopping or holding up the assignment process. Secured party consent in this case is optional, not necessary.|$|E
40|$|Asset <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> are an {{important}} determinant of distress costs and therefore optimal capital structure. Capital structure theories typically assume <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> are exogenous {{even though they may}} be determined in part by the debt choices of firms in the industry (Shleifer and Vishny, 1992; Pulvino, 1998). We develop a model in which high industry debt leads to a greater supply of assets for sale by distressed firms but also lower demand for assets from relatively healthy firms because of debt overhang. Thus, high industry debt lowers expected asset <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> and provides an incentive for individual firms to take on less debt to take advantage of attractive future buying opportunities. The indirect effect of equilibrium asset prices tempers, and sometimes reverses, the effect of parameters on optimal capital structure choices compared to models with exogenous prices. For example, we show that firms may choose lower debt ratios when assets are more redeployable, contrary to standard intuition (Williamson, 1988). ∗We thank Sergei Davydenko, Barney Hartman-Glaser, Sebastian Gryglewicz and seminar participants a...|$|R

25|$|The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{authorized}} Conrail {{to abandon}} {{part of this}} line, which it called the Meadville Line, between Corry and Meadville in August 1994, effective {{at the end of}} the month. The on-line municipalities of Corry, Union City, Cambridge Springs, Saegertown, and Meadville filed an offer of financial assistance that month to purchase the line for its net <b>liquidation</b> <b>value</b> of $2.9 million, and the abandonment authority was rescinded. Through the newly created Northwest Pennsylvania Rail Authority they acquired the property on October 31, 1995, after some delay, for operation by the Oil Creek and Titusville Lines (OCTL), and operations began soon after. But the courts ruled in August 1996 that the ICC had no authority to force the sale, since they had authorized abandonment again in April 1995, and so the line was to pass back to Conrail, who wanted to keep it from falling into the hands of a competitor. In the midst of talks between Conrail and the two companies that were buying its assets, CSX Transportation and the Norfolk Southern Railway, the authority reached an agreement with Conrail in June 1997, allowing it to keep the line.|$|E

50|$|<b>Liquidation</b> <b>value</b> is {{the likely}} price of an asset {{when it is}} allowed {{insufficient}} time to sell on the open market, thereby reducing its exposure to potential buyers. <b>Liquidation</b> <b>value</b> is typically lower than fair market value. Unlike cash or securities, certain illiquid assets, like real estate, often require {{a period of several}} months in order to obtain their fair market value in a sale, and will generally sell for a significantly lower price if a sale is forced to occur in a shorter time period. <b>Liquidation</b> <b>value</b> may be either the result of a forced liquidation or an orderly liquidation. Either value assumes that the sale is consummated by a seller who is compelled to sell and assumes an exposure period which is less than market normal.|$|E
40|$|I {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} assets' <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> on capital structure by exploiting the diversity of track gauges in nineteenth-century American railroads. The abundance of track gauges limited the redeployability of rolling stock and tracks to potential users with similar track gauge. Moreover, potential demand for both rolling stock and tracks was further diminished when many railroads went under equity receiverships. I find that the potential demand for a railroad's rolling stock and tracks were significant determinants of debt maturity {{and the amount of}} debt that was issued by railroads. The results are consistent with <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> models of financial contracting and capital structure. The Author 2008.

Good aggregate states lead to excessive risk-taking while bad aggregate states suf-fer from fire-sale liquidation – economic surplus is destroyed in both cases. In the competitive equilibrium with endogenous <b>liquidation</b> <b>values,</b> the two-sided inefficiency reinforces itself through a feedback effect.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three self-contained essays in microeconomics. The first chapter studies the rollover risk of financial institutions. It presents a competitive-equilibrium model of financial institutions optimally choosing their debt maturity structure. Rollover risk arises endogenously from the interaction of creditors in a global-game framework. When only idiosyncratic risk is present short-term debt acts as an effective disciplining device but once aggregate risk is added a two-sided inefficiency arises. Good aggregate states lead to excessive risktaking while bad aggregate states suffer from fire-sale liquidation. In the competitive equilibrium with endogenous <b>liquidation</b> <b>values,</b> the two-sided inefficiency reinforces itself through a feedback effect. It increases the volatility of <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> and thereby amplifies the impact of aggregate risk. The second chapter is coauthored with Martin Schmalz and studies the effects of anxiety in decision-making. We model an anxious agent as one who is more risk averse for imminent than for distant risk. Such preferences can lead to dynami...|$|R

50|$|Value investors {{look for}} bargains — cheap stocks {{that are often}} out of favor, such as {{cyclical}} stocks {{that are at the}} low end of their business cycle. A value investor is primarily attracted by asset-oriented stocks with low prices compared to underlying book, replacement, or <b>liquidation</b> <b>values.</b> There is also a diversification effect: Returns on growth stocks and value stocks are not highly correlated. By diversifying between growth and value, investors can help manage risk and still have high long-term return potential.|$|R

40|$|Why {{does the}} market {{discipline}} that banks face seem too weak during {{good times and}} too strong during bad times? This paper shows that using rollover risk as a disciplining device is effective only if all banks face purely idiosyncratic risk. However, if banks' assets are correlated, a two-sided inefficiency arises: Good aggregate states have banks taking excessive risks, while bad aggregate states suffer from fire sales. The driving force behind this inefficiency is an amplifying feedback loop between asset <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> and market discipline.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how uncertainty affects corporate investment under {{varying degrees of}} asset redeployability. We develop new measures of asset redeployability by accounting for the usability of assets within and across industries. We identify plausibly exogenous shocks to economic uncertainty by using major economic and political events. We find that after an increase in uncertainty, firms using less redeployable capital reduce investment more. More redeployable assets exhibit higher recovery rates and are traded more actively in secondary markets. Overall, our results suggest that frictions in redeploying assets affect <b>liquidation</b> <b>values</b> and therefore make firms cautious about investment decisions under uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of the {{interaction}} between the entry of lenders and the real sector. The high liquidation skills of incumbent lenders render them too tough in terminating high-risk/return projects. Being "foreign" to the market, newcomers have lower ability to liquidate than incumbents. This makes them softer in liquidating high-risk/return projects but renders their funding more costly. We show that the entry of lenders and the share of high-risk/return projects can reinforce each other through firms' <b>liquidation</b> <b>values.</b> This interaction dampens the output impact of liquidity shocks. Hence, financial liberalization can enhance stability. Copyright 2007 The Ohio State University. ...|$|R

This suggests {{that the use of}} cross-acceleration provisions increases when the costs of cascading defaults are lower, the conflicts between creditor classes are higher, and the benefits of delegating monitoring to banks are higher. We also find a lower interest rate on public debt contracts with cross-acceleration provisions, but the rate reduction depends on borrowers' financial reporting quality...|$|R
