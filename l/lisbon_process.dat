40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} of the phenomenon of increasing gender inequalities that happen at old age regarding women’s pension. Moving from recent life-course theories and studies, this study analyzes the reasons behind gender-biased pension levels and how their cumulative effects result in (continuous) significant gender gaps. The article presents a European overview of pension gender gap, focusing on family and work-life issues in Italy. This is one of the first critical reviews of the small but growing literature and national data concerning the effect of gender inequalities related to pension gaps in Italy. In the past, research on the balance of welfare provision between State, family, and market has ignored gender, while more recent studies have barely explored how gender roles, changing over time, interact with the shifts in pension policies. Considering the effects of work-life balance policies since the 2000 <b>Lisbon</b> agenda <b>process</b> and its development, the study especially focuses on the Italian case within the European context. The article examines how the choices in work-life balance policies vary between different national contexts and welfare regimes, by highlighting the Italian case. In this country, welfare and social policy regimes remain very unbalanced, showing a lack of awareness of family and women’s needs, as in many Southern countries, and Italy is not able to give appropriate answers to these problems and to the question of the growing gender gap. This article finally shows the poignancy of structural and cultural reasons for gender differentiated pension levels in Italy, within the European context, according to patterns of employment, marital, and maternal status between earlier and later generations of women...|$|R

The two main arguments that are often presented in order to explain why the EU {{has not been able to}} counter ‘enlargement fatigue’, namely the insufficiently tight conditionality applied to prospective members and the EU's crisis of confidence and accountability after the failed attempt to introduce the Constitutional Treaty and prolonged <b>Lisbon</b> Treaty ratification <b>process,</b> are insufficient to explain why fatigue has been so persistent a phenomenon. This article argues that the EU's failure to develop a new vision of the organisation and adjust its structural design accordingly is a reason why the Union has not dealt successfully with fatigue. Such a vision would encompass notions of “variable geometry”, “avant-garde groups” and make European borders flexible and fuzzy...|$|R
40|$|The {{consequence}} of its geographical position {{the city of}} Lisbon has developed {{a close relationship with}} the river (Tagus river) and the sea (Atlantic Ocean). Portugal was one of the pioneering nations in the Sea Discoveries (intensive maritime exploration mainly during the 15 th century). Lisbon was the port of departure for these adventures. This fact early conditioned the relationship of the city with the river and the sea, and organized the city waterfront as a space mostly devoted to economic activity and commercial trading. With the development of tourism in Europe, Portugal has established itself as a major European destination and Lisbon, as result of its historical heritage, an important city-break destination. In this conversion <b>process</b> <b>Lisbon</b> has reinvented its relationship with the river. The waterfront has been taken as a strategic point of tourism attraction and development.

40|$|The <b>Lisbon</b> <b>process</b> is {{intended}} to move the European Union (EU) towards a dynamic but socially inclusive knowledge-based economy. Policy benchmarking through the 'Open Method of Coordination' is being applied {{to a wide range}} of relevant policy areas. This article considers the benchmarking indicators that are being used in relation to the knowledge-based economy on the one hand, social inclusion on the other. It examines the indicators that have been selected, the uses to which they are being put and their appropriateness for policy coordination, policy learning and performance improvement. It explores three ambiguities or tensions that they reveal. First, the article argues that being in part the offspring of the process of monetary union, the OMC is being used to track progress towards a single future, rather than to expose the range of possible alternative futures and the trade-offs they involve. Second, whereas the goal of the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>process</b> is a dynamic knowledge-based economy, the article argues that the benchmarking indicators are remarkably static and it sets out what dynamic indicators would be more appropriate. Finally, whereas patterns of social and economic development are increasingly shaped by global processes, the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>process</b> remains focussed on action at the national level: the article argues the case for a stronger global dimension for indicators of change.

This article focuses specifically on the short-cycle/foundation degree introduced in 2003 into the pan-European Bologna Process, and considers its relevance to the European Union's Lisbon Strategy. It argues that the 'short-cycle/foundation' student represents the mid knowledge-skilled learner that is frequently missing from policies and analyses of the knowledge economy that concentrate on either 'basic skills' learners or graduates/postgraduates and that this particular learner, clearly linked to employment, is located at the intersection of vocational and academic learning. The article also considers the role of the European Commission in both the <b>Lisbon</b> and Bologna <b>Processes.</b> Based on an analysis of policy texts the article suggests that the two definitions of competency, whilst quite distinct, are, at the level of policy, very closely connected and serve to increase the Commission's activities within areas of education that are beyond their legal competence...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Portuguese entertainment market {{and the rise of}} several types of musical theatre are inextricably bound to the complex symbolic and material process through which Portugal was established, presented, developed, and commodified as a modern nation-state between 1865 and 1908. During this period, several fundamental transformations that merged urban planning, everyday life, and modernity took place in <b>Lisbon.</b> In this <b>process,</b> leisure activities began to include new forms of music theatre (such as operetta and the revue theatre) that became an important site for the display of modernity, representing and commodifying the nation. Despite its colonial possessions, Portugal was a peripheral European country where modernity developed in a specific way. The commodification of music associated with both music publishing and mechanical music fostered the creation of a transnational market for goods in a period when most of the trade was conducted with or within national economies. In this context, the Portuguese entertainment market reflected a particular form of negotiation between the local, the national and the global levels, in which gender, class, ethnicity, and technology intertwined with theatrical repertoires, street sounds and domestic music making.

Therefore, this work aims to contribute for a better understanding of which are the most important components of the image of Lisbon as a tourism destination for foreign tourists. After a brief literature review, we decided that this research should be based on the tri-dimensional model, developed by Echtner & Ritchie (1993), since it involves not only a tangible and functional perspective, but also a psychological and holistic one, allowing a complete representation of the perceived tourism destination image of Lisbon.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis shall be the European Social Dialogue and the Lisbon Strategy, or rather that {{dimension}} of the Lisbon Strategy that is most pertinant to both the Social Dialogue and to the European Union’s policies on industrial relations and employment, the ‘Social Policy Agenda’. The thesis should therefore be understood as being centred upon the Social Policy Agenda of the Lisbon Strategy realised through the European Social Dialogue. The aim {{of the study is}} based around the pursuit of two related thematic questions. Firstly, is a certain understanding of the concept of ‘Society’ being rhetorically employed by EU institutions, in discussions of the <b>Lisbon</b> reform <b>process,</b> which is reliant upon distinctly ‘modern’ categories and epistemological-ontological assumptions. The crucial issue in relation to this {{question is whether or not}} those ontological and epistemological categories, upon which this ‘modern’ conceptual idiom depends, are still extant in our current historical context at the putative ‘modern-postmodern’ boundary. Secondly, assuming that there are certain conceptual confusions in the EU's presentation of the Social Dialogue, does its consequent inability to establish a coherent and historically appropriate conceptual vocabularly create a political vacuum through which unrecognised social and economic forces operate based upon the imperatives and tendencies of highly developed capitalist society to reproduce itself on its own instrumental terms. This thesis pursues its exploratory aims by means of a historical analysis of concepts. This means it will establish concepts as an epistemological method of comprehending social and historical phenomena, and will then apply this to an analysis of the usage of concepts in the Social Dialogue, but set in the context of historical time. The thesis should also be understood as a critique of the Social Dialogue. In particular, this thesis shall be an Immanent Critique aimed at the Social Dialogue. This is a mode of enquiry in social theory that analyzes cultural and social forms by identifying and exploring contradictions in the rules and systems necessary to the production of those forms. The main results obtained are not in the form of data or verified hypotheses, but rather consist of an elaboration of the main themes toward providing exploratory conclusions. The result is therefore an elaborated confirmation of the original impressions of the Social Dialogue and Lisbon Strategy implied in the thematic questions at the outset. In this thesis the main sources shall consist of European Commission Communications on the Social Dialogue, the Social Policy Agenda, and the Lisbon Strategy. The secondary sources are theoretical and shall be drawn upon to provide arguments, ideas, theories, and criticism in the conventional manner. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Although {{relative}} {{income poverty}} rates vary {{from year to}} year, the rankings of different industrialised countries according to these poverty measures tend to be rather stable. Ireland is consistently {{among a group of}} countries with relative income poverty rates considerably above the European Union average (though not as high as the USA). This has not changed over the course of Irelands recent economic boom, since our relative income poverty rates themselves have not fallen indeed they have generally risen over that period. This study asks why Ireland has higher relative income poverty rates than many of our EU partners? More specifically, it explores what we can learn from an in-depth comparison with a number of other European countries, including some of the best performers in the European Union in terms of that indicator. This approach has parallels with a number of developments in the social and employment policy agenda at EU level. Atkinson (2000) notes that the Belgian government proposed that all member states should seek to match the performance of the three best states in combating poverty. This links closely with the open method of co-ordination agreed at <b>Lisbon,</b> a <b>process</b> in which clear and mutually agreed objectives are defined, after which peer review, on the basis of national action plans, enables EU Member States to compare practices and learn from each other. This method respects and is in fact built upon local diversity. (Vandenbroucke, 2002). Similarly, the UKs new targets for child poverty include a criterion that the UK rate should be among the best in Europe. We begin (Chapter 2) by discussing the nature of relative income poverty rates as poverty measures, their limitations and uses and their growing importance in an EU context. Chapter 3 then looks at how relative income poverty rates actually vary across EU member states, using the latest harmonised data. Chapter 4 reviews some of the main findings of previous investigations into cross-country differences in relative income poverty rates, and undertakes a new investigation of the role of wage inequality in explaining differences in relative income poverty. Our research then employs a variety of analytic approaches to see what is distinctive about Ireland. The implications for relative income poverty rates of differences in age structure, household structure, and labour market conditions are explored in Chapter 5, focusing on five countries. This is done by simulating what the relative income poverty rate would be if each of these countries shared a common age structure, household structure or pattern of unemployment and labour market participation. This exercise and other studies carried out elsewhere point towards the importance of social protection as a key influence. In Chapter 6 we therefore look in detail at social protection spending in Ireland compared with other EU countries. What would be the impact on relative poverty if the level and/or structure of social protection spending in Ireland were to become similar to that of countries with low poverty rates, such as Denmark and the Netherlands? We explore this question using SWITCH, the Irish tax-benefit model. The main findings are drawn together in Chapter 7. ...|$|R
40|$|With the <b>Lisbon</b> and Bologna <b>processes,</b> studies {{completion}} and sustainable employability of students became priorities for European universities. For the Council of European Union, {{the share of}} 30 - 40 year olds with tertiary educational attainment {{should be at least}} 40 % by 2020. The young Luxembourg University needs to understand why some students choose to leave without a diploma. Our aim was to analyse the relationships between self-perceiving of the academic employability skills (AES), self-related global quality of life (GQoL) and satisfaction towards against university services (SUS) among persisting and non-persisting students. Design: All freshmen (947) from the three Faculties of Luxembourg University (Sciences & Technology, Law & Finances and Social Sciences) were invited to participate to a cross-sectional survey that took place at beginning of the second semester. Methods: The persisting students were requested to complete an online questionnaire and those who had dropped out during the first semester (non-registered for the second semester) were contacted to responding at the same questions including socio-demographics characteristics: age; sex; nationality (yes/no); work (yes/no); father’s and mother's occupational level and education. A discriminant analysis was undertaken using: the AES scale- 6 items (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 81); the level of GQoL (1 item, values from 1 “very bad” to 5 “very good”) and the SUS scale- 3 items (Cronbach’s alpha 0. 74). Findings: 99 persisting students and 68 dropouts have responding. There's no significant age difference between these 2 groups (mean 21. 12 years old). Dropouts are more likely young men (55. 9 % vs. 39. 4 % persisting, p = 0. 036) and have a job (58. 2 % vs. 3. 6 % persisting, p = 0. 000). Their GQoL is higher (83. 3 / 100 vs. 78. 1 / 100 persisting, p = 0. 032), but their AES are lower (55. 2 / 100 vs. 67. 3 / 100 persisting, p°= 0. 000). Among them, AES and SUS are positively correlated (correlation 0. 414; p = 0. 000). Conclusions: Contrary to what described in literature, dropouts are not older than persisting students. They’ve a poorer perception of their employability skills, they're less satisfied with university services (like reputation of university, of faculty and teaching quality). However, they've a better quality of life and much of them have a gainful work. These findings are in line with recent studies suggesting that perceptions of quality of higher education have an impact on students’ satisfaction and behavioral intentions. Further researches will determine nature of links between academic services, employability skills and dropout...|$|R

The article begins with a critique of the 'new basic skills' identified at the Lisbon European Council on 23 and 24 March 2000. These were information and communication technologies (ICT), technological culture, foreign languages, entrepreneurship, and social skills. The article raises questions about the compatibility of the economic and social aims of the Lisbon Strategy. It also asks whether the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>Process</b> privileges certain forms of knowledge over others. Furthermore, who are the winners and the losers in the breathless rush towards increased economic competitiveness? The author concludes that the logic of competition inherent in the <b>Lisbon</b> <b>Process</b> may undermine rather than reinforce social solidarity; and that the chronic neglect of some really basic skills has had dire social and economic consequences.
