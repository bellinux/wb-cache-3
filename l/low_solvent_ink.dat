5000|$|Solvent inks: The main {{ingredient}} of these inks are {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), organic chemical compounds that have high vapor pressures. Color is achieved with pigments rather than dyes for excellent fade-resistance. The chief advantage of <b>solvent</b> <b>inks</b> {{is that they are}} comparatively inexpensive and enable printing on flexible, uncoated vinyl substrates, which are used to produce vehicle graphics, billboards, banners and adhesive decals. Disadvantages include the vapour produced by the solvent and the need to dispose of used solvent. Unlike most aqueous inks, prints made using solvent-based inks are generally waterproof and ultraviolet-resistant (for outdoor use) without special over-coatings. The high print speed of many solvent printers demands special drying equipment, usually a combination of heaters and blowers. The substrate is usually heated immediately before and after the print heads apply <b>ink.</b> <b>Solvent</b> <b>inks</b> are divided into two sub-categories: hard <b>solvent</b> <b>ink</b> offers the greatest durability without specialized over-coatings but requires specialized ventilation of the printing area to avoid exposure to hazardous fumes, while Mild or [...] "Eco" [...] <b>solvent</b> <b>inks,</b> while still not as safe as aqueous inks, are intended for use in enclosed spaces without specialized ventilation of the printing area. Mild <b>solvent</b> <b>inks</b> have rapidly gained popularity in recent years as their color quality and durability have increased while ink cost has dropped significantly.|$|R

50|$|Signs {{created with}} large-format {{printers}} may use <b>solvent</b> <b>inks,</b> water-based inks, latex inks or ultraviolet-curable/cured inks. The last material {{is the most}} modern, and can be printed directly onto many different substrates such as wood, metal and plastic, adhesive-backed or non-adhesive films. Adhesive-backed films are then laminated to another substrate.|$|R
5000|$|Solvent: This term {{is used to}} {{describe}} any ink that is not water-based. Piezo inkjet printers whose inks use petroleum or a petroleum by-product such as an acetone like carrier liquid. [...] "Eco-Solvent" [...] inks usually contain glycol esters or glycol ether esters and are slower drying. The resulting prints are waterproof. May be used to print directly on uncoated vinyl and other media as well as ridged substrates such as Painted/Coated Metal, Foam Board and PVC. The solvents soften the base material and allow the ink pigments to mechanically latch on to the chemically etched surface. Certain ink manufacturers have different bite based on what solvent carriers they use. Which is what makes <b>solvent</b> <b>ink</b> prints more durable than aqueous <b>inks.</b> However, <b>solvent</b> <b>inks</b> give off strong odor or fumes when drying, as the carrier fluid dissipates through applied heat from the printer's platen. There are various levels of <b>solvent</b> <b>ink</b> ranging from [...] "True or Full Solvent" [...] to [...] "Medium/Mild Solvent" [...] {{all the way down}} to [...] "Eco-Solvent". The fume and odour levels decrease accordingly, so does the surface etch of the base material. Full to Medium/Mild Solvents require fume extraction to be considered safe in the working environment. Most Eco-Solvents can be used in an office environment with minimal or tolerable odor levels.|$|R

50|$|Heat Transfer Vinyl {{comes in}} single colors, in the {{specialty}} options listed above, in full color pattern options, {{and in a}} printable version that must be used with <b>solvent</b> <b>ink</b> & a <b>solvent</b> printer. It is best used for simple designs with minimal colors since each individual color or pattern used in the design must be cut, weeded, and heat pressed. Certain Heat Transfer Vinyls can be layered to form multi-colored designs. The more layers involved, {{the harder it is}} to match up each to achieve the end result. Heat Transfer vinyl cannot be used for full color pictures or anything with gradients. There are other applications for those options.|$|R
50|$|The ink {{consumed}} in the cleaning process needs to be collected to prevent ink from leaking in the printer. The collection area is called the spittoon, and in Hewlett Packard printers this is an open plastic tray underneath the cleaning/wiping station. In Epson printers, there is typically a large absorption pad in a pan underneath the paper feed platen. For printers several years old, {{it is common for}} the dried ink in the spittoon to form a pile that can stack up and touch the printheads, jamming the printer. Some larger professional printers using <b>solvent</b> <b>inks</b> may employ a replaceable plastic receptacle to contain waste <b>ink</b> and <b>solvent</b> which must be emptied or replaced when full.|$|R

50|$|There is {{a second}} type of ink drying that most {{printers}} are unable to prevent. For ink to spray from the cartridge, air must enter to displace the removed ink. The air enters via an extremely long, thin labyrinth tube, up to 10 cm long, wrapping {{back and forth across}} the ink tank. The channel is long and narrow to reduce moisture evaporation through the vent tube, but some evaporation still occurs and eventually the ink cartridge dries up from the inside out. To combat this problem, which is especially acute with professional fast-drying <b>solvent</b> <b>inks,</b> many wide-format printer cartridge designs contain the ink in an airtight, collapsible bag that requires no vent. The bag merely shrinks until the cartridge is empty.|$|R

30|$|Potential and {{practical}} contributions of tested raw materials aqueous extracts as bio-effector candidates were discussed. The agro-food processing residues and their extracts studied above showed an interesting content, either at nutritional or biochemical level, {{and could be}} used as plant growth promoter. They are differently rich in nutrients, amino-acids, sugars, and low molecular weight molecules as demonstrated by the chemical analysis and NMR metabolic profiling. Furthermore, aqueous extraction resulted higher yield with respect to other used solvent. Water, safe and less expensive than other organic solvents, is effective for BSG, FPR, and LPR extractions under different extraction ratios. In addition, aqueous extracts were not phytotoxic but enhanced seed germination at higher solvent extraction ratio. BSG aqueous extract enhanced seed germination and root growth. FPR aqueous extract, at <b>low</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction ratio, showed low GI which increased when the solvent extraction ratio increased. LPR was very toxic at <b>low</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction ratio; therefore, higher solvent extraction ratios are required for the use of this product.|$|R
40|$|Background: White Piper nigrum is an {{important}} commodity crop containing a number of essential bioactive components with nutritional and medicinal properties when sufficiently extracted. Microwave refluxation is therefore a novel technique employed in the extraction of bioactive components from natural products of plant origin.

40|$|Since 50 s, the UV curing inks {{began to}} {{substitute}} the classical <b>solvent</b> <b>inks,</b> further more contaminant {{for the consumer}} and the environment. Nevertheless, since 2005, when the Italian authorities found ITX in baby milk from these inks, they have become a world food safety concern. The main objective of this thesis is to broaden the knowledge about the migration of photoinitiators and their byproducts into food. To deal with this problem, this thesis is divided in three parts. Firstly, a photoinitiators' food safety review is presented, explaining the photoinitiators' problematique and the possible strategies {{to deal with this}} food safety problem. Then, the different analytical methodologies for the determination of photoinitiators and byproducts developed are described: LC-DAD, GC-MS, LC-ESI-MS/MS, UHPLC/ESI-HRMS e DART-HRMS. Finally, migration kinetics studies have been carried out in order to study the migration of photoinitiators into food simulants at different temperatures from LDPE. From the data obtained a mathematical model was developed in order to predict the migration of these molecules into food...|$|R
50|$|Polyester {{fabric is}} printed mostly with dye-sub or {{disperse}} direct ink, although UV and <b>solvent</b> <b>inks</b> (including HP’s latex formulation) {{can also be}} used. The great benefit of sublimation ink {{is the fact that}} the colorants will bond with the fibre during sublimation or fixation. The colours are ‘inside’ the media and don’t stay within the coating and on top of the media, as it is the case with UV-curable formulations. Even latex inks on porous textiles can suffer from crocking issues or ‘rub-off’. Low energy sublimation ink is easier to print with, but has the disadvantage of colours fading faster; its UV resistance, or light-fastness, is less resistant than equivalents using high energy disperse direct ink. Dye-sub can also suffer from a ‘halo’ effect which results in less sharp images. The disperse direct ink is a ‘stronger’ ink than the dye-sub kind, and this is very important for outdoor use, such as for fence fabric, flags and banners: artwork will last longer.|$|R
