5|$|In Japan, the {{television}} series {{was released on}} nine DVDs by Starchild Records between August 3, 2000 and April 2, 2001, and sold over 1 million copies. Love Hina is credited with {{being one of the}} first anime series to be available unofficially as a digitally produced fansub, with multiple groups working on the series. The popularity, and widespread availability of the series in this form meant that several potential <b>licensors</b> of the series such as ADV Films had concerns over licensing the series. The series was later licensed in North America by Bandai Entertainment, who released six DVDs between February 19 and November 19, 2002. In July 2007, Funimation Entertainment announced they had acquired the license to the series after Bandai's license had expired. A new boxset of {{the television}} series across 4 discs was released by Funimation on February 24, 2009. It was then re-released as part of Funimation's Viridian Collection on July 27, 2010. In the United Kingdom, the series is licensed by MVM Films, who released the series on six DVDs between September 6, 2004 and March 7, 2005, and as a boxset on May 14, 2007. In Australia and New Zealand the series is licensed by Madman Entertainment, who also released the series across six DVDs between September 18, 2002, and February 11, 2003. A box set was later released on December 3, 2003.|$|E

25|$|The above {{reaction}} can {{be carried}} out by either of two methods: catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production. In one method, molten urea is introduced onto a fluidized bed with catalyst for reaction. Hot ammonia gas is also present to fluidize the bed and inhibit deammonization. The effluent then is cooled. Ammonia and carbon dioxide in the off-gas are separated from the melamine-containing slurry. The slurry is further concentrated and crystallized to yield melamine. Major manufacturers and <b>licensors</b> such as Orascom Construction Industries, BASF, and Eurotecnica have developed some proprietary methods.|$|E
25|$|As the unbranded Chinese {{cell phones}} {{which do not}} have International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers pose a serious {{security}} risk to the country, Mobile network operators therefore suspended the usage of around 30 million mobile phones (about 8% of all mobiles in the country) by 30 April. Phones without valid IMEI cannot be connected to cellular operators. 5â€“6 years the average monthly subscribers additions were around 0.05 to 0.1 million only and the total mobile subscribers base in December 2002 stood at 10.5 millions.

50|$|A <b>licensor</b> may grant {{a license}} under {{intellectual}} property laws to authorize a use (such as copying software or using a (patented) invention) to a licensee, sparing the licensee from {{a claim of}} infringement brought by the <b>licensor.</b> A license under intellectual property commonly has several components beyond the grant itself, including a term, territory, renewal provisions, and other limitations deemed vital to the <b>licensor.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the issue of}} optimal licensing {{from the viewpoint of}} an external public <b>licensor</b> maximizing social welfare. Our principal findings are as follows.

Tatsunoko and the East Asian <b>licensors</b> (providing Chinese subtitles) released Karas as six single-DVD packages in their regions. The collectors' editions feature a hardcover book showing the storyboard for the episode. Manga Entertainment released the English DVD edition of Karas as two eighty-five-minute feature length films, The Prophecy and The Revelation, on April 24, 2006, and October 22, 2007, respectively. Each feature consists of three original episodes joined together, and has an additional English voice track. They have also released Karas: The Prophecy on UMD. Columbia Music Entertainment published Ike's music for the show on October 24, 2007, as a 24-track audio CD. Dark Horse Comics produced a one-shot comic which went on sale, and is given free with collectors' editions and The Prophecy. The story written by Phil Amara, author of the comic Sky Ape, is an adaptation of the story in episode one.|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the project, de Campi read over 4000 pages of Archie comic books She drew {{inspiration}} for the story from the 1940s era of the series, when she says Archie Andrews' girlfriends Betty Cooper and Veronica Lodge had [...] "more edge". Her scripts were subject to notes and tweaks from Archie Comics and Fox, but de Campi described both <b>licensors</b> as [...] "extremely mellow, pleasant and easy to work with". Fox's primary concern was why the Predator, {{who is known for}} choosing challenging prey, would be interested in teenagers, but a suitable explanation was included in the story. She expected some of the notes, such as being told, [...] "Alex, you can't make jokes about child predation in an Archie book". Other times, she was surprised when she did not receive notes, such as her use of emojis for the Predator's speech. She was pleased when she got to add depth to Dilton Doiley, a character she feels is often overlooked in regular Archie comics. The choice of whether Archie Andrews would survive the series or not was changed several times during scripting, and a final decision was not made until the last draft of the script.|$|E

The <b>licensor</b> seeks to license its innovation to a set of producers that differ according to their marginal cost of producing an existing good. We show that the <b>licensor</b> is able to obtain the profit a monopolist would achieve by producing the new good. The equilibrium licensing contract specifies both a fixed fee and a royalty scheme based on the production of a licensee. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a foreign}} technology holderâ€™s licensing choices between royalty and fixed-fee scheme. We emphasize that foreign <b>licensor</b> chooses {{the quality of}} licensed technology when the licensee country does not implement perfect intellectual property protection for <b>licensorâ€™s</b> technology. We study quality choice as the foreign <b>licensorâ€™s</b> selection for a particular grade of technical skills. We show that fixed fee emerges as the equilibrium licensing scheme when both the transfer of his technology is relatively efficient and the licensee is sufficiently cost competitive in the domestic market, and that royalty licensing prevails otherwise. We further show it need not hold the general belief that welfare in the <b>licensor</b> country unambiguously rise with a stronger patenting system in the licensee country when, in particular, such patenting system in place is sufficiently lax...|$|R

Ownership incentive is defined as the incentive rooted in the <b>licensor's</b> financial equity involvement in licensee firm while contractual. incentive is the incentive provided through performance-dependent royalty arrangement stipulated by the licensing contract. This article empirically examines the effectiveness of these incentives in inducing licensors' efforts based on a survey data from 327 international technology licensing contracts. The findings are (1) (partial) ownership is a very effective incentive for the <b>licensor</b> to exert higher level of efforts; and (2) the contractual arrangement, however, is not an effective incentive.

Moreover, even if down-stream entry takes place under both regimes, fixed-fee licensing could still be superior to royalty licensing, because the <b>licensor,</b> in order {{to make room for the}} entry, cannot enjoy the full cost advantage under royalty licensing...|$|R
