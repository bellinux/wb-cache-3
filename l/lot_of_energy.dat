5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably heavier and larger-boned than females.|$|E

25|$|Norsk Hydro {{was founded}} in 1905 by Sam Eyde as a Norwegian {{fertilizer}} manufacturer, and the first factory was opened in Notodden. Fertilizer factories need a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> making {{it was necessary to}} locate the plants near hydroelectric power plants, and at Rjukan there was a large waterfall. In 1911 Rjukan Salpeterfabrikk was opened.|$|E
25|$|During {{and after}} the war there was used a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> on {{rebuilding}} the locomotives that had been sabotaged. The three Westinghouse locomotives were rebuilt to two. In addition three new locomotives were delivered from Skabo in 1950. The last steam engine was retired in 1953. In 1952 two diesel shunting engines were delivered from Ruston & Hornsby.|$|E
30|$|In {{the equal}} {{redundancy}} level (ERL) studies, {{there is a}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> residual <b>energy</b> in the areas far to sink. Thus, we are inspired to adopt high network coding based redundancy level in the areas where remained <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> So we can greatly improve the data collection reliability and not reduce the network lifetime. If we decrease the redundancy level of the nodes in the regions near to sink, the network lifetime could also be improved.|$|R

25|$|Beam Hardening: X-ray {{radiation}} {{consists of}} hard and soft particles, i.e. particles with a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and particles with little energy. Unnecessary exposure is mostly caused by soft particles, {{as they are}} to weak to pass through the body and interact with it. Hard particles, by contrast, pass through the patient. A filter in front of the x-ray tube can catch the soft particles, thus hardening the beam. This decreases dose without impacting image quality.|$|E
25|$|By 1459 the Sultan {{dedicated}} a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> {{to bringing}} prosperity to Constantinople. In several {{quarters of the}} city pious foundations were created; these areas consisted of a theological college, a school (or a Madrasa, usually connected to the mosque), a public kitchen, and a mosque. In the same year Mehmed sent out orders that any Greeks who had left Constantinople as slaves or refugees {{should be allowed to}} return. These actions led it to become a once again thriving capital city, now of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{feedback}} is a stabilising mechanism acting to oppose changes to coastal morphology and establish equilibrium. A coastal environment in equilibrium {{is able to}} dissipate or reflect incoming energy without the occurrence of sediment input or output and change to morphology. For example; when a beach in equilibrium erodes during a storm it forms an offshore bar that in turn forces waves to break over it. By doing this the waves lose a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and dissipate before reaching the shoreline, significantly reducing further erosion. When the storm calms, the bar is then re-worked back on to the beach.|$|E

25|$|Centralized {{wastewater}} treatment {{systems can be}} costly and use a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> An alternative to this process is converting waste and wastewater into fertilizer, which avoids these costs and shows other benefits. By collecting human waste at the source and running it to a semi-centralized biogas plant with other biological waste, liquid fertilizer can be produced. This concept was demonstrated by a settlement in Lubeck Germany in the late 1990s. Practices like these provide soil with organic nutrients and create carbon sinks that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offsetting greenhouse gas emission. Producing artificial fertilizer is also more costly in energy than this process.|$|E
25|$|Their {{longevity}} {{may be due}} to telomerase, {{an enzyme}} that repairs long repetitive sections of DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, referred to as telomeres. Telomerase is expressed by most vertebrates during embryonic stages but is generally absent from adult stages of life. However, unlike vertebrates, lobsters express telomerase as adults through most tissue, which has been suggested to be related to their longevity. Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting which requires a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> and the larger the shell the more energy is required. Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult. Older lobsters are also known to stop moulting, which means that the shell will eventually become damaged, infected, or fall apart and they die. The European lobster has an average life span of 31 years for males and 54 years for females.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past is the risk of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> into defences.|$|E

In this case, the electrons might gain <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> but have fewer ionizing collisions. A greater voltage is therefore required to assure ionization of enough gas molecules to start an avalanche.|$|R
50|$|Kneading of {{the sugar}} makes the paste more uniform and dense. This process {{requires}} <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and technique. Make sure that {{the temperature of the}} paste doesn't go too low, otherwise it will harden and become solid. Typically one pot produces 25 kg of sugar paste and only 3 kg of it can be kneaded each time. The process is a race against time.|$|R
5000|$|Nanaji Deshmukh {{retired from}} {{politics}} {{at the peak of}} his political career in 1977 and dedicated himself to building a rural based economic model of development. He found to his dismay that <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> the rural people were wasted in litigations, which left them both impoverished and exploited. He said [...] "If people fight amongst each other, they will have no time for development". Hence a method of sorting conflicts and differences was brought about that was based on the ancient Indian principles of consensus making and alternate conflict resolution, which has been called the Litigation Free Model.|$|R
25|$|Fynbos shrublands {{occur in}} a small belt across South Africa. The plant species in this {{ecosystem}} are highly diverse, yet {{the majority of these}} species are obligate seeders, that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have coevolved into obligate seeders as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils. Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate seeders display has led to more rapid evolution and speciation in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.|$|E
25|$|Light water {{makes an}} {{excellent}} moderator, the light hydrogen atoms {{are very close}} in mass to a neutron and can absorb a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> in a single collision (like a collision of two billiard balls). Light hydrogen is also fairly effective at absorbing neutrons, {{and there will be}} too few left over to react with the small amount of 235U in natural uranium, preventing criticality. In order to allow criticality, the fuel must be enriched, increasing the amount of 235U to an usable level. In light water reactors, the fuel is typically enriched to between 2% and 5% 235U (the leftover fraction with less 235U is called depleted uranium). Enrichment facilities are expensive to build and operate. They are also a proliferation concern as they can be used to enrich the 235U much further, up to weapons-grade material (90% or more 235U). This can be remedied if the fuel is supplied and reprocessed by an internationally approved supplier.|$|E
25|$|Normally, a wing {{with such}} a low aspect ratio will suffer from very poor {{performance}} due {{to the degree of}} induced drag created at the wingtips, as the higher pressure air below spills around the wingtip to the lower-pressure region above. In a conventional aircraft, these wingtip vortices carry a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> with them and hence create drag. The usual approach to reducing these vortices is to build a wing with a high aspect ratio, i.e. one that is long and narrow. However, such wings compromise the maneuverability and roll rate of the aircraft, or present a structural challenge in building them stiff enough. The XF5U attempted to overcome the tip vortex problem using the propellers to actively cancel the drag-causing tip vortices. The propellers are arranged to rotate in the opposite direction to the tip vortices, with the aim of retaining the higher-pressure air below the wing. With this source of drag eliminated, the aircraft would fly with a much smaller wing area, and the small wing would yield high maneuverability with greater structural strength.|$|E

40|$|Steelmaking, {{continuous}} casting and hot rolling {{are not only}} the key processes of steel production, but also the processes costing <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> Pig iron is made into slabs {{by the process of}} steel making and {{continuous casting}}. The hot rolling process makes slabs into hot coil. A slab yard is built between the two parts as a buffer area to coordinate the production rhythm. In this work flow, if the slab can&# 39;t be transferred to hot rolling process timely when it&# 39;s cast to a slab with high temperature, it will stay in the slab yard and auto-cool to room temperature. When it is called for hot rolling, the slab needs to be reheated from room temperature to about 1250 °C. It can be seen that <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> loss exists in the process of reheating slabs. This paper proposes a method based on heuristic and mathematical programming to solve this problem, as so-called, the integrated scheduling problem. Validation research is taken for the models and algorithm. The experiment result shows that this solution can solve the problem correctly and achieve a short solve time even for large scale problem...|$|R
