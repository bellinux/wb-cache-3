I also consider Rüdiger Bubner’s proposal that the legal metaphors show that the transcendental deduction is a rhetorical argument.

Three key skills in financial literacy are appropriate management of taxes, savings programs, and retirement planning. With the passing of the sixteenth amendment, income taxation became a part of life for Americans. Since then, people have grown to dread April 15. However, with a good understanding of the federal income tax system, paying taxes can be simple and less costly for a taxpayer. U. S. citizens can legally minimize the amount of taxes paid by filing under the correct status and taking advantage of <b>legal</b> <b>deductions.</b> For example, married couple should almost always file together to reduce taxes (General Electric Center for Financial Learning, scr. 3). A couple that is receiving child support from a former spouse may benefit from filing separately. Also, a financially literate citizen knows how to spread the tax burden over many years by purchasing retirement plans such as 401 (K) s and IRAs. By acquiring these tax-deferred savings and investments, a person does not have to pay taxes on the principal and the interest unti...|$|R

The other problem connected with middle terms is the “moulding” and possible manipulation {{of the meaning of}} legal terms, for arriving at desired conclusions in a given scheme of inference. It is indicated how the moulding of contested legal concepts, if not restricted, will obscure the ratio of legal rules.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{effects of}} taxation {{depend on the}} configuration of marginal tax rates. We consider here the appropriate measure of a marginal tax rate for the federal individual income tax, which has a graduated-rate structure and allows for numerous <b>legal</b> and illegal <b>deductions</b> from total income. Our conclusion is that the explicit marginal rate from the tax schedule is the right concept for many purposes. Hence, we construct approximately weighted averages of these marginal tax rates for 1916 - 80. When weighted by adjusted gross income, the arithmetic average of marginal tax rates is 5 % in 1920, 2 %in 1930, 6 % in 1940, 20 % in 1950, 23 % in 1960, 24 % in 1970, and 30 % in 1980. We also discuss the dispersion of marginal tax rates, {{as well as the}} behavior of average tax rates and deductions from taxable income. One noteworthy result concerns the fraction of adjusted gross income that accrues to families that face a marginal tax rate of at least 35 %. This fraction quadruples from 1964 to 1980. ...|$|R
40|$|This diploma work {{focuses on}} the issue of debt {{collection}} via deductions from pension payments. The theoretical part analyses the legal conditions for this type of debt collection and defines the terms related to it. The first chapters focus in general on financial literacy and the development of the system of deductions from wages. In the following chapters, based on analysis of legislation and description, the <b>legal</b> basis of <b>deductions</b> from wages is mapped, along with the calculation of the amount of deductions seized based on distraint orders and changes to the payer of income during the enforcement of a decision. The other sections of the work focus on insolvency and the recipient payers retirement in the event of deductions. The practical part presents a comparison of analysed data about the development of the number of pensions, the average amount of pensions and pensions affected by deductions seized based on distraint orders, and details are compared about the amount of income achieved during economic life and in retirement. Then the particular issues in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are compared through examination of their basic characteristics. Based on the authors own observation, the final part of the document contains suggestions of possible solutions that would reduce the number of pensions affected by asset seizure...|$|R

This paper {{tries to}} map predicaments {{that contributed to}} fiqh studies that had been claimed to be {{stagnant}} at least by a few Islamic legal scholars. The authority of Kutub al-Sittah hierarchy, in fact, has become an important problem that restricted the learned scientific community or ulama to practice ijtihad. This stemmed from the limitation of the hadits books use at the highest level. The so called Kutub al-Sittah should be properly signified as fiqh book. According to the author, this makes Kutub al-Sittah seems to be resistant to criticism, due to the sacred and intrinsic dimension in it. Therefore, it is urgent that understanding the argument of Traditions which are relevant and {{in line with the}} social dynamics should be contextualized. He also maintains that <b>legal</b> <b>deduction</b> of the text of the Traditions does not necessarily overrule the principle values of the text as a foundation for the maslahat concept. In addition, the argues that the authority of the study of Islamic jurisprudence is closely related to the normative values of the text, but nonetheless such norms could not be directly applied to the real life. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a lecture {{delivered}} during the Academy of European Law Summer School 2006. It provides an examination from a legal perspective of three current themes in the external relations of the European Union. First, the legal implications of the pillar structure for external relations, including recent case law and practical issues arising from the application of Article 47 TEU, the borderline between Community external policies and the Union’s common foreign and security policy, and practical interpillar cooperation. It concludes that it is easier to combine the pillars by means of pragmatic solutions, whereas it is much more difficult {{in the case of a}} strictly legal construction which takes into account the requirements of Union coherence and the separate character of each pillar. Second, the paper turns to the balance between Member States and the European Union/Community in external policy and in particular the application of the “AETR test” in recent case law including the “Open Skies” cases, the Lugano Convention Opinion and the “Mox Plant” case. It concludes that a proper application of the AETR remains a practical challenge that transcends the narrow issue of pure <b>legal</b> <b>deduction</b> as to whether Community competence is “affected” or not. And third, the paper considers the position of the EU within, and participation in the work of, international organisations such as the United Nations, the WHO and the WTO. The paper concludes by emphasising the need for collaboration between the institutions and for pragmatic solutions to the problems that are inevitable while the Union retains its current complex structur...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} Kant’s {{philosophy of}} matrimonial law. It {{focuses on the}} idea of this law as “possession of a person as a thing and its use as a person”: Kant conceives marriage as an interpersonal relation in an external form of real possession, in the aspect of the objective and subjective goal of such relation, but primarily in the aspect of its legal and ethical possibility. Given the naturalistic interpretation of the constitutive act for this kind of law, the <b>legal</b> <b>deduction</b> of marriage comes in a desperate contradiction with Kant’s ethics of personal dignity, because it seems to lead to a mutual instrumentalization of persons; as a matter of fact, Kant's deduction of marriage rules out the possibility of mutual personal obligations of family members. The naturalistic premise of Kant's family law, provenient from the ancient Roman property law, is as follows: marriage is mutual possession of the other's person as a thing and the use of it as a person for mutual pleasure; it seems to predetermine a necessary connection between legal use and legal posession of a person, the latter presupposing primary acquisition. This premise causes in Kantian family law an antinomy of private law and personalist ethics, which can hardly be eliminated by the own theoretical means of Kant's legal philiosophy. According to the essentials of Kant's ethics, the dignity of the other person, which is (allegedly) acquisited in matrimony, allows no possible equivalent, and its loss cannot be compensated at all events by the fact of mere mutuality of the instrumentalizing relation. The doubtfulness of this naturalistic premise of Kant's family theory means in terms of legal philosophy the doubtfulness of the premise which states the title-establishing status of primary acquisition in the field of personal law. References to the ethical idea of the absolute unity of personality, as well as the accent on “pleasure” as the necessary subjective goal of marital union, which leads the moralist an the philosopher of law upon a false trail, cannot provide a real solution of the problem. The naturalistic premise, in consequence of which the meaning of love is conceived in terms of pleasure, perpetuates the Roman contractualism in matrimonial law by understanding marriage as an external relation of persons, and prepares the soil for the seeds of a nihilistic philosophy of marriage and family. Kant's opinions about the reasons of inacceptability of false and, as a matter of fact, contractually based forms of matrimonial unions, proceed in undermining still more the basics of his positive philosophy of family, and supply additional arguments for a reform of Kantian philosophy of matrimonial law. In the expositions of Kant’s philosophy of marriage, when purified from this naturalistic premise, there can be traced some more integral notion of family union, seen as a moral unity of persons as such, in regard to which the marriage as external union of physical persons is a mere consequence and legal form. The personal union in matrimonial communication creates a relation in which there are two physical persons, but only one moral personality of the family and one legal person; not only a personal {{and at the same time}} property-related union, but a personaltranspersonal union. The specific person as an absolute monadical unity is here absolved by the personality of the family, as the absolute unity of active [...] . between persons, which has no other goal besides of and out of this union itself. When seen that way, it doesn't seem necessary any more to identify the “real-right form” of legal matrimonial union with the essence of the personal union itself, and therefore a merely contractual vision of family law can be overcome. The personalist philosophy of family retains the fruitful contents of Kant's matrimonial law theory: the notion that the matrimonial union is necessary “due to the law of humanity”, and not due to mere natural necessity; the notion of matrimonial acquisition as one accomplished neither factually, nor contractually, but “according to a law”, as a consequence of an obligation to enter a family unity. And yet, just as in Kant’s theory of law there is no ethically enriched concept of this genuine kind of union, in the individual ethics of Kant’s later years there is no ethical notion of family as a personality. Its elaboration became a task for German classical idealism...|$|E
