The inclusion kinetic calculations are coupled with weld pool thermal history to estimate the inclusion characteristics for a given welding process and composition.

In an attempt to improve the microstructure of the Al-Si alloy, in this study, six combinations of hybrid modifiers (at 0. 02 wt. %), namely, Sodium-Boron (Na-B), Sodium-Titanium (Na-Ti), Strontium-Boron (Sr-B), Sodium-Strontium (Na-Sr), Strontium-Titanium (Sr-Ti), and Titanium-Boron (Ti-B) were added to the base Al-Si alloy (unmodified LM 6).

The viscous resistance coefficient is more lager than the inertial resistance coefficient.

40|$|Solidification of Nb-microalloyed HSLA steels {{may result}} in the {{precipitation}} of niobium carbonitrides, which is hardly surprising in view of their extreme thermodynamic stability. Recently, it was proposed in literature that coarse Nb-rich particles found along the centerline of continuously cast HSLA steels originated from ferroniobium additions during <b>ladle</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> In particular, {{it was hypothesized that}} thermally stable phases formed during manufacturing of ferroniobium were released into the melt once the ferroniobium had partially fused. In this contribution, Scheil–Gulliver formalism is employed to predict the phase portrait of ferroniobium in an attempt to simulate the manufacturing process of ferroniobium. To corroborate the predictions, the microstructure of ferroniobium is characterized to determine if thermally stable particles exist in ferroniobium. Further, a model is developed to predict the dissolution rate of thermally stable phases that were observed in ferroniobium {{as well as in the}} centerline region of as-cast HSLA steel. Finally, a sample near the centreline region of a Nb-microalloyed HSLA steel is characterized and centreline compositions are measured.

Design/methodology/approach: Metallography, hot torsion test, tensile test, Charpy test have been used. Findings: It was found out that failing to attain the total static austenite recrystallization between the consecutive deformation stages results in a development of the segregation bands, causing the significant deterioration of the crack resistance of steel at the lowered temperature. Research limitations/implications: TEM investigations on structure of the steel after thermo-mechanical treatment were predicted.

Originality/value: Adjusting the interval times between the deformation cycles in the multi-pass rolling process to the total recrystallization time of the plastically deformed austenite, by employing the retention shield, and the isothermal holding of the product at the temperature of the end of hot working for time t 0. 5 before quenching, offers the possibility of obtaining the homogenous austenite structure, and therefore, manufacturing the rolled products displaying high mechanical properties...|$|R

In {{view of its}} very fine particle size, due to the transformation of b- to g-C 2 S, and the Cr content, the slag is challenging in terms of handling and disposal and is used in only few applications. The current work explores the utilisation of the LM's fine fraction in Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) clinker production. Three sets of samples containing LM slag, in 0 wt% (OPC e reference), 6 wt% (OPC 6) and 14 wt% (OPC 14), were investigated. The sintering temperature was 1450 C with 40 min soaking time. The clinkers containing LM slag, showed {{a slight increase in}} C 3 S and a decrease in C 3 A and C 4 AF. The formation of the C 3 S initiated at a lower temperature probably due to the presence of F and C 2 S. Longer setting times were found for OPC 6 and OPC 14. The compressive strength results were found to be comparable at 2 d (22 e 25 MPa), 7 d (36 e 38 MPa) and 28 d (44 MPa) of curing, falling into 42. 5 R CEM I category.

40|$|Since {{microstructure}} {{development in}} the weld metal region is controlled by various physical processes, {{there is a need}} for integrated predictive models based on fundamental principles to describe and predict the effect of these physical processes. These integrated models should be based on various tools available for modeling microstructure development in a wide variety of alloy systems and welding processes. In this paper, the principles, methodology, and future directions of modeling thermochemical reactions in liquid, solidification, and solid state transformations are discussed with some examples for low-alloy steel, stainless steel, and Ni-base superalloy. Thermochemical deoxidation reactions in liquid low-alloy steel lead to oxide inclusion formation.

This paper describes a novel approach which significantly enhances the performance of laser-based analysis and its application to <b>ladle</b> <b>metallurgy.</b> Laser-induced emission spectrometry (LIBS) uses the spectrally dispersed light emission of a plasma for the chemical analysis of solid and liquid materials. A collimated high-intensity laser beam, directed onto the material, produces the plasma. The interaction between the laser radiation of a Nd:YAG laser and the substrate (steel or steel melt) can be influenced in a definite manner by controlling the laser power output (laser modulation). Laser modulation enables plasma conditions to be created, which are advantageous in emission spectrometry. A comparison can then be made between the plasma conditions generated using laser modulation and those produced with standard laser parameters, in ord er to demonstrate the benefits of the laser modulation technique. It has been shown {{for the first time that}} the use of the laser modulation technique considerably improves the analytical performance of laser-induced emission spectrometry. Calibration curves have been determined for 15 elements. For solid samples, the detection limits range from 6 ppm (boron) to 300 ppm (nickel).

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} ultrasound-assisted mineral {{carbonation}} were investigated in this work. The objectives were to intensify the CO 2 sequestration process to improve reaction kinetics and maximal conversion. Stainless steel slags, {{derived from the}} Argon Oxygen Decarburization (AOD) and Continuous Casting / <b>Ladle</b> <b>Metallurgy</b> (CC/LM) refining steps, were used for assessing the technical feasibility of this concept, as they are potential carbon sinks and can benefit from reduction in alkalinity (pH) by mineral carbonation. Ultrasound was applied by use of an ultrasound horn into the reaction slurry, where mineral carbonation reaction took place at 50 oC for up to four hours; comparison was made to solely mechanically mixed process. It was found that sonication increases the reaction rate after the initial stage, and permits achieving higher carbonate conversion and lower pH. AOD slag conversion increased from 30 % to 49 %, and pH decreased from 10. 6 to 10. 1; CC slag conversion increased from 61 % to 73 % and pH decreased from 10. 8 to 9. 9. The enhancement effect of ultrasound was attributed to the removal of passivating layers (precipitated calcium carbonate and depleted silica) that surround the unreacted particle core and inhibit mass transfer. Significant particle size reduction was observed for sonicated powders, compared to particle size growth {{in the case of}} stirring only; D[4, 3] values increased without sonication by 74 % and 50 %, and decreased with sonication by 64 % and 52 %, respectively for AOD and CC slags.

40|$|The present {{work was}} {{to study the}} role of ladle glaze as apotential {{supplier}} of inclusions to the steel melt during theladle refining process. In this study, the total number ofinclusions {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the ladletreatment process was found to be increasing with ladle age,which is the number of heats, the ladle being used. Asubstantial increase in inclusion population was noticed aftera certain ladle age. Totally four types of inclusions named as; type- 1 (MgO),type- 2 (spinel), type- 3 (an oxide solution) and type- 4 (spinelin the center surrounded by the oxide solution of type- 3) wereobserved in the beginning of the ladle refining process. Thermodynamic calculation revealed that the type- 3 and type- 4 inclusions were generated by the reactions between EAF slag andladle glaze. Even a part of inclusions of type- 2 (spinel phase) could be formed by these reactions. Three types of inclusionswere found before casting, viz. type- 5 (oxide solution with lowcontents of MgO and SiO 2), type- 6 (small MgO islands embeddedin an oxide solution) and type- 7 (spinel in the centersurrounded by the oxide solution of type- 5). Inclusions of bothtype- 5 and type- 7 were the products of the reaction betweeninclusions of type- 2 and the liquid metal. On the other hand,the occurrence of pieces of MgO having sharp edges in the oxidesolution suggested that the type- 6 inclusions were generated bythe ladle glaze. A preliminary examination on the possibility of inclusionseparation by bubble floatation, experiments using cold modelswere also carried out. De-ionised water and silicon oil wereused as the bulk phase. Charcoal particles of different sizeranges were employed as the dispersed phase. The examination ofcharcoal-water-gas system indicated that the positivefloatation coefficient is not a sufficient condition for theinclusion separation. The experimental results were found to bein contradiction with the prediction of a typical model thatconsiders interfacial energies. The omitting of the drag forcewas believed to be the reason causing the failure of the modelprediction in the charcoal-water-gas system.

40|$|The {{homogeneity}} of composition and uniformity of {{temperature of the}} steel melt before it is transferred to the tundish are crucial in making high-quality steel product. The homogenization process is performed by stirring the melt using inert gas in ladles. Continuous monitoring {{of this process is}} important to make sure the action of stirring is constant throughout the ladle. Currently, the stirring process is monitored by process operators who largely rely on visual and acoustic phenomena from the ladle. However, due to lack of measurable signals, the accuracy and suitability of this manual monitoring are problematic. The actual flow of argon gas to the ladle may not be same as the flow gage reading due to leakage along the gas line components. As a result, the actual degree of stirring may not be correctly known. Various researchers have used one-dimensional vibration, and sound and image signals measured from the ladle to predict the degree of stirring inside. They developed online sensors which are indeed to monitor the online stirring phenomena. In this investigation, triaxial vibration signals have been measured from a cold water model which is a model of an industrial ladle. Three flow rate ranges and varying bath heights were used to collect vibration signals. The Fast Fourier Transform was applied to the dataset before it has been analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS). PCA was used to unveil the structure in the experimental data. PLS was mainly applied to predict the stirring from the vibration response. It was found that for each flow rate range considered in this study, the informative signals reside in different frequency ranges. The first latent variables in these frequency ranges explain more than 95 pct of the variation in the stirring process for the entire single layer and the double layer data collected from the cold model. PLS analysis in these identified frequency ranges demonstrated that the latent variables of the response and predictor variables are highly correlated. The predicted variable has shown linear relationship with the stirring energy and bath recirculation speed.

The mathematical representation involves the simultaneous solution of Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic fields, and the turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer equations. In solving the arc and bath regions it was assumed (and justified) that the arc-bath interactions are dominated by the behavior of the arc. In contrast to previous modeling investigations, this work relaxes some critical assumptions and provides a more realistic and comprehensive representation of the system. This work also examines and compares the relative merits of alternative electromagnetic and turbulence formulations, and addresses the role of induced currents and compressibility effects in the representation of the arc. Furthermore, due allowance was made to represent and analyze the effect of gas injection, the presence of a slag layer in the bath and changes in anode configuration {{at the bottom of the}} reactor. Because of a lack of experimental information on actual or pilot plant DC-EAF systems, different aspects of the model were validated using several sources of experimental data reported in the literature for related systems. These included measurements on welding arcs, laboratory scale high-intensity carbon arcs, electromagnetically driven metallic systems, and <b>ladle</b> <b>metallurgy</b> physical models. It was found that, in general, the agreement between measurements and predictions was good. A detailed analysis was carried out to examine the effect of process parameters (e. g., arc current, arc length, bath dimensions, anode arrangements, etc) on the behavior of the furnace (e. g., heat transfer to the bath, heating efficiency, mixing times in the bath, etc). Predictions from the arc model show that all the arc characteristics are strongly coupled and that the arc physics is governed by the expansion of the arc. From a parametric study it was found that when the arc region (defined by the 10, 000 K isotherm) is plotted in dimensionless form, a universal shape for the arc can be defined, regardless of the values of arc current or arc length. This universality was restricted to the range of conditions analyzed in this thesis, to arcs struck between graphite cathodes in air, and does not include the jet impingement region on the bath surface. This common arc expansion behavior suggested the universal nature of other arc characteristics. Universal maps of temperature, magnetic: flux density, and axial velocity are also reported in terms of simple analytical expressions. The practical effects of the two main process parameters of the arc region,. i. e. the arc current and the arc length, were analyzed. It was found that increasing the arc length significantly increases the arc resistance and, consequently, the arc power, although this behavior reached asymptotic values at larger arc lengths. Increasing the arc current, however, does not affect the arc voltage. Thus, it is found that increasing the arc power increases the amount of energy transferred into the bath, but the heat transfer efficiency decreases. Therefore, the shorter the arc the more efficient is the heat transfer to the bath. It is also recognized that heat transfer from the arc to the bath is controlled by convection, although radiation can become an important mechanism, especially for large arc lengths. Results of the bath model indicate that, in the absence of inert gas stirring and with no slag present in the system, electromagnetic body forces dominate and are responsible for the fluid flow patterns in the system. The effects of the arc determine the distributions of temperature and other mixing characteristics in the bath. The bath model was used to evaluate the effect of the main process parameters and design variables on mixing, refractory wear, temperature stratification, and heat transfer efficiency. An increase in the arc length is detrimental to mixing but increases the rate of heating in the melt as a result of the increased arc power. Increasing arc current improves mixing and the heat transferred to the bath, but is likely to be detrimental to the life of the bottom refractory. The results also suggest that high furnace aspect ratios (taller and thinner arc furnaces) are highly recommended because an increase in the aspect ratio increases mixing, prevents refractory wear, and promotes arc heating efficiency. The arc configuration in the furnace can be changed to control fluid flow patterns in the bath to meet specific needs, such as better mixing, or to prevent refractory wear. The presence of a top layer of slag reduces mixing and increases overall liquid temperatures. Injection of gases through the bottom in eccentric operations generates complex flow patterns that improve mixing in regions away from the symmetry axis. It is the author's belief that this model is a useful tool for process analysis in the DC-EAF. It has the capability to address many issues of current and future concern and represents one component of a fundamental approach to the optimization of DC-EAF operations. by Marco Aurelio Ramírez.
