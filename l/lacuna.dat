5|$|McCarthyism {{is one of}} the {{subjects}} of Barbara Kingsolver's novel The <b>Lacuna.</b>|$|E
5|$|After a <b>lacuna</b> in the {{manuscript}} of the poem, Hymiskviða abruptly picks up again with Thor and Hymir in a boat, out at sea. Hymir catches a few whales at once, and Thor baits his line {{with the head of}} the ox. Thor casts his line and the monstrous serpent Jörmungandr bites. Thor pulls the serpent on board, and violently slams him in the head with his hammer. Jörmungandr shrieks, and a noisy commotion is heard from underwater before another <b>lacuna</b> appears in {{the manuscript}}.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through quotations. They {{also noted that the}} book filled a literary <b>lacuna</b> in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist Christian school.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a few}} classifications of <b>lacunas</b> in existence. Astrid Ertelt-Vieth (2005) labels {{the first}} {{dimension}} (three major categories as: mental <b>lacunas,</b> activity <b>lacunas</b> and object <b>lacunas)</b> and the second dimension (axiological <b>lacunas)</b> of all <b>lacunas.</b>|$|R

5|$|Hellyeah headlined a tour in {{the spring}} of 2010 with: Seether, Five Finger Death Punch, Drowning Pool, and <b>Lacuna</b> Coil. The first date was May 11, 2010 in Madison, WI. They were also {{confirmed}} to play the main stage at Download Festival 2010. In 2009, the band revealed that they were in the studio recording a new album, later revealed to be titled Stampede.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{enactment}} of Article 100, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted during the Second Reading of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment No. 2) Bill that the Singapore Constitution had no provisions for referring questions of constitutional interpretation to the courts for an advisory ruling, especially those relating to new and complex provisions of the Constitution. Article 100 was intended to address this perceived <b>lacuna</b> in the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Shadows Fall toured {{in support}} of Threads of Life, {{including}} making appearances at the Jägermeister tour with Stone Sour and <b>Lacuna</b> Coil, the Operation Annihilation tour with Static-X, 3 Inches of Blood, and Divine Heresy, and the Black Crusade tour with Trivium, Machine Head, Dragonforce, and Arch Enemy. The band {{was a part of}} the Soundwave tour in Australia and in Asia in February 2008, along with Killswitch Engage, As I Lay Dying, and Bleeding Through.|$|E
50|$|Located deeper {{within the}} <b>lacunae</b> are {{branching}} mucous tubules called the glands of Littre. The <b>lacunae</b> of Morgagni are named after Italian anatomist Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771).|$|R
40|$|Processed animal {{proteins}} (PAP) {{detection and}} identification in feedstuffs {{can be difficult}} in distinguishing among land animals, i. e. poultry and mammals. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the potential application of image analysis in PAP identification. For this purpose four reference samples containing poultry meals and four reference samples containing mammalian meat and bone meals were used. Each sample was analyzed using the microscopic method (98 / 88 /EC). Bone fragments are characterized by similar morphological features (colours, shape, <b>lacunae</b> shape, <b>lacunae</b> distribution, etc.) that make it diff i c u l t to distinguish between poultry and mammals. Through a digital camera and an image analysis software a total of 30 bone fragment <b>lacunae</b> images at X 400 were obtained. For each image 29 geometric parameters related to the <b>lacunae</b> and 3 geometric parameters related to the canaliculae of <b>lacunae,</b> were measured using the image analysis software obtaining 960 observations. Of the 32 descriptors used two, the area of the <b>lacunae</b> and their perimeter, were able to explain 96. 15 % of the total variability of the data, even though their contribution was different (83. 97 % vs. 12. 18 %, respectively). Through these two descriptors it was possible to distinguish between mammalian and poultry <b>lacunae,</b> except in two cases (6. 6 %), in which poultry <b>lacunae</b> were wrongly classified as mammalian. This latter can be related with higher variability in the <b>lacunae</b> area recorded for mammals compared to poultry. On the basis of the present study, it can be concluded that image analysis represents a promising potential tool in PAP identification, that may provide accurate and reliable results in feedstuffs characterisation, analysis and control...|$|R
40|$|Matrix strains due to {{external}} loading {{are different in}} bones of different pathologies with different bone mineral density (BMD), and are likely sensed by the osteocytes, the putative bone mechanosensors. The mechanosensitivity of osteocytes appears to be strongly influenced by their morphology. In this study, we explored the possibility that osteocyte morphology might {{play a role in}} various bone pathologies with different BMD. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and nano-CT were used to quantitatively determine 3 D morphology and alignment of osteocytes and osteocyte <b>lacunae</b> in human proximal tibial bone with relatively low (osteopenic), medium (osteoarthritic), and high (osteopetrotic) BMD. Osteopenic osteocytes were relatively large and round (lengths 8. 9 : 15. 6 : 13. 4 microm), osteopetrotic osteocytes were small and discoid shaped (lengths 5. 5 : 11. 1 : 10. 8 microm), and osteoarthritic osteocytes were large and elongated (lengths 8. 4 : 17. 3 : 12. 2 microm). Osteopenic osteocyte <b>lacunae</b> showed 3. 5 fold larger volume and 2. 2 fold larger surface area than osteoarthritic <b>lacunae,</b> whereas osteopetrotic <b>lacunae</b> were 1. 9 fold larger and showed 1. 5 fold larger surface area than osteoarthritic <b>lacunae.</b> Osteopetrotic osteocyte <b>lacunae</b> had lower alignment than osteopenic and osteoarthritic <b>lacunae</b> as indicated by their lower degree of anisotropy. The differences in 3 D morphology of osteocytes and their <b>lacunae</b> in long bones of different pathologies with different BMD might reflect an adaptation to matrix strain due to different external loading conditions. Moreover, since direct mechanosensing of matrix strain likely occurs by the cell bodies, the differences in osteocyte morphology and their <b>lacunae</b> might indicate differences in osteocyte mechanosensitivity. The exact relationship between osteocyte morphology and bone architecture, however, is complex and deserves further stud...|$|R

In November, the band brought Gigantour to Australia with a lineup including Static-X, DevilDriver and <b>Lacuna</b> Coil.|$|E
5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that follows from a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a <b>lacuna</b> between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

5|$|The biographies {{cover the}} {{emperors}} from Hadrian to Carinus and Numerian. A section covering the reigns of Philip the Arab, Decius, Trebonianus Gallus, Aemilian {{and all but}} {{the end of the}} reign of Valerian is missing in all the manuscripts, and {{it has been argued that}} biographies of Nerva and Trajan have also been lost at the beginning of the work, which may suggest the compilation might have been a direct continuation of Suetonius. It has been theorized that the mid-3rd-century <b>lacuna</b> might actually be a deliberate literary device of the author or authors, saving the labour of covering Emperors for whom little source material may have been available.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant work on astrology that is extensive, coherent, {{and mostly}} intact, the Astronomica describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich {{seems to have}} been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the Astronomica features a <b>lacuna,</b> which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued that whole books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} <b>lacuna,</b> Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row back to shore. On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot be taken at face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work <b>lacuna</b> is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|In {{support of}} the new album, the band toured North America and Australia {{in the spring of}} 2008 for the Taste of Chaos tour {{alongside}} Atreyu, Blessthefall and Avenged Sevenfold. Bullet for My Valentine cut short the Canada portion of the tour and flew back home to support the daughter of James who was in hospital.

In late 2008, the band toured Europe, supported by <b>Lacuna</b> Coil, Bleeding Through, and Black Tide.

He is also absent from the Turin canon (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a <b>lacuna</b> affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.|$|E

30|$|Dissection and {{microscopic}} examination exhibited that honeycomb type aerenchyma, {{characterized by the}} irregular and large air spaces, was observed in the shoots of A. ulvaceus (Fig.  2 c, d). Freshly cut transverse sections of leaf midrib revealed that {{a large proportion of}} the cellular volume is occupied by an air-filled <b>lacunae</b> system (Fig.  2 d). Parenchyma cells that surround the <b>lacunae</b> and at least seven vascular bundles occupied the remaining cellular volume. The same midrib cross section showed the presence of small hexagonal diaphragm cells in some of the <b>lacunae</b> (Fig.  2 e). Together, these results demonstrate the successful adaptation of A. ulvaceus to a submerged aquatic environment, as anatomical modifications of the shoot such as the existence of air-filled aerenchyma, the extensive <b>lacunae</b> system and cellular diaphragms are evident.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{clarify the}} fine {{structure}} of the avian choroid and thus help explain the mechanisms for normal and abnormal eye function and growth. METHODS: Eyes from normal chickens and from experimental chickens subjected to unilateral paracentesis were fixed either by perfusion or in situ, with or without post-fixation by microwave irradiation, and then processed for light and electron microscopic analysis. RESULTS: The avian choroid contains thin-walled <b>lacunae,</b> whose fine structure is identical to that of lymphatic vessels. The <b>lacunae</b> are much smaller toward the anterior chamber and the Schlemm's canal than posteriorly in the eye bulb. Large <b>lacunae</b> are situated primarily in the suprachoroidea, and their blind-ended capillary branches enter the choriocapillaris and the walls of large veins. The walls of the large veins contain villous structures that protrude into their lumina and are penetrated by thin lacunar branches and by side lines of the venous lumen. In normal chickens, the <b>lacunae</b> usually are devoid of blood cells. After paracentesis of the anterior eye chamber, the <b>lacunae</b> become filled with erythrocytes on the side that was operated on, {{but not on the}} contralateral side. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that the <b>lacunae</b> of the avian choroid represent a system of posterior short lymphatic vessels, which drain intraocular fluids directly into the eye's venous system, and that the villous structures are sites of communication between <b>lacunae</b> and veins. The demonstration of a choroidal lymphatic system opens new insights into the processes of fluid removal, control of intraocular pressure, and regulation of choroidal thickness in the avian eye under normal and experimental conditions...|$|R
5|$|The first biographical {{sketch of}} Friedrich Accum's life {{was written by}} the American {{agricultural}} chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which {{he was able to}} complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in Bückeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (August 26, 1873 – September 15, 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the <b>lacuna</b> in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today.|$|E
