5000|$|June 4, 1989 - The Ufa train disaster: Sparks {{from two}} passing trains detonated gas leaking from a <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> near Ufa, Russia. At least 575 people were {{reported}} killed.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, GAIL {{commissioned}} the world's longest and India's first cross country LPG transmission pipeline running from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni in Uttar Pradesh. The total length of this <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> is 1415 km.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, GAIL {{commissioned}} the world's longest, and India's first, cross-country LPG transmission pipeline, from Jamnagar to Loni. GAIL's LPG transmission business includes the 1927-km <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> network {{that connects the}} western, northern and southern parts of India. This includes the world's longest exclusively <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> from Jamnagar, Gujarat, to Loni, near Delhi (another 70 km having been added to this system between Kandla and Samakhiali, in Gujarat, to facilitate the transportation of LPG imported at Kandla port). GAIL's LPG pipelines can transport 3.8 MMTPA of LPG, and {{have the capacity to}} supply more than 20% of the LPG consumed in the country. There are huge gas distribution terminals in Loni. Indane and Bharat gas are supplying cooking gas from here to north India.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the timing of}} optimal investment in <b>LPG</b> <b>pipelines</b> when {{the goal is to}} maximize consumer surplus less private cost and social of transporting LPG. The loss of consumer surplus is small. The important elements are the private cost of transporting LPG and the congestion created by trucks. ...|$|R
50|$|The TTM project {{consists}} of the gas pipeline project and the Songkhla Gas Separation Plant project geared to making <b>LPG.</b> The <b>pipeline</b> has a diameter of 34 to 42 in.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} control valve {{is a very important}} instrument in cylinder filling. It allows <b>LPG</b> in <b>pipeline</b> to be at a predetermined pressure. When the pressure exceeds this value the valve opens and sends the flow to return line.|$|R
50|$|Sonatrach {{operates}} over 2400 mi {{of crude oil}} pipelines in the country. The most important pipelines carry crude oil from the Hassi Messaoud field to export terminals. Sonatrach also operates oil condensate and <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> networks that link Hassi R'mel and other fields to Arzew. Sonatrach is expanding the Hassi Messaoud-Azrew pipeline, the longest in the country. The project entails a second, parallel line that will {{more than double the}} capacity of the existing line.|$|E
50|$|GAIL is {{the first}} company in India to own and operate {{pipelines}} for LPG transmission. It has 2038 km <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> network 1,415 km of which connects the western and northern parts of India and 623 km of networks is {{in the southern part}} of the country connecting Eastern Coast. The LPG transmission system has a capacity to transport 3.8 MMTPA of LPG. LPG transmission through pipelines was 3145 TMT in the year 2013-14.|$|E
5000|$|The 661 km long {{pipeline}} {{consists of}} three sections. As a first section, the liquefied petroleum gas (<b>LPG)</b> <b>pipeline</b> from the production facility in Urucu to Coari was switched to carrying natural gas, while parallel to this a new 285 km long 10 in LPG (GLPduto) pipeline was constructed. [...] The second section connects Coari and Anamã and third section connects Anamã-Manaus. In addition to the main trunkline, the pipeline has seven branches.|$|E
50|$|GAIL {{owns the}} country's largest {{pipeline}} network, the cross-country 2300 km Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline with {{a capacity to}} handle 33.4 MMSCMD gas. Today the company owns and operates more than 11000 km long cross country natural Gas Pipeline in India having presence in 22 states in the country. It also owns and operates more than 2000 km long LPG pipelines {{in the country and}} has the pride to operate one of the world's longest exclusive <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> in the country from Jamnagar in Gujarat to Loni in Uttar Pradesh. The company also owns and operates seven mega LPG recovery plants in the country today and has to its credit almost 20% of domestic LPG produced and supplied for the domestic usage through its sisters PSUs like IOCL, BPCL and HPCL. GAIL {{is one of the major}} petrochemical conglomerates in the country today with India's largest gas based petrochemicals in operation since 1999. In petrochemicals it has its own gas based integrated petrochemical plant and also the ownership of 70% in dual fuel petrochemicals in Assam, Brahamaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and one of the major equity partners in OPal.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, an 8-inch-diameter steel <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{operated}} by Koch Pipeline Company ruptured near Lively, Texas, a community about 50 {{miles southeast of}} Dallas, and began leaking butane gas. The vapor cloud ignited when two residents drove their pickup truck across a creek near a pipeline (then-unknown to local residents) while {{on their way to}} a neighbor's house to call 9-1-1 and report the smell of gas. The two were killed in the explosion, and approximately 25 families were later evacuated from the neighborhood without injury, including a parent who had witnessed his daughter's death. An investigation conducted by the NTSB found that the pipe section which failed had not been shown to have excessive corrosion in a 1995 inspection. Regulations at the time did not provide criteria for [...] "adequate cathodic protection." [...] Koch also stated that the bacteria-induced corrosion acted quicker than had ever previously been recorded in the industry. The explosion was the only event of its kind in the company’s history. In 1999, a Texas jury found that negligence had led to the rupture of the Koch pipeline and awarded the victims' families $296 million.|$|E
40|$|Abstract − Radiofrequency {{methods and}} devices for online {{measurement}} of technological parameters of {{liquefied petroleum gas}} (LPG) in a pipeline are suggested. RF temperature-independent LPG density measuring device is considered. Designed automated system for determination of LPG density and water content under <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline</b> transportation and water removal from LPG is described...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} a {{scheme based on}} high-gain observers to detect and locate leaks in subterranean pipelines of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). In fact, sub-observers connected in cascade are used to generate residuals that allow to detect when a leak occurs and, above all, to isolate {{the region of the}} pipeline where the leak is located. Once the region is identified, a dedicated observer is employed to more precisely estimate the leak position as well as its coefficient. The approach is validated with data from a real industrial <b>LPG</b> <b>pipeline...</b>|$|E
