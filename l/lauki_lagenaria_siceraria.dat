40|$|<b>Lagenaria</b> <b>siceraria</b> (Cucurbitaceae), {{popularly known}} as bottle gourd, lauki or ghiya, is a {{climbing}} plant, which bears hard-shelled and bottle-shaped gourds as fruits. Ghiya forms an excellent diet for people having digestive problems being rich in vitamins, iron and minerals. Since, it contains low calories, bottle gourd is an awesome foodstuff for shedding extra calories. The fruit possesses diuretic, emetic, and refrigerant properties. The ghiya (lauki) juice is helpful in constipation, premature graying hair, urinary disorders and insomnia. However, there are no reports in literature pertaining to CNS actions of <b>Lagenaria</b> <b>siceraria</b> fruit. In the light of above, {{the present study was}} undertaken to test the anti-depressant potential of <b>Lagenaria</b> <b>siceraria</b> juice (LSJ). <b>Lagenaria</b> <b>siceraria</b> juice was administered at various concentrations ranging from 4 %- 16 % v/v orally to Swiss mice (30 g), once daily for 15 successive days.
