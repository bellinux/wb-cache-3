5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{diversification}} in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and sustained its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of <b>livestock</b> <b>products</b> produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E

Between 1995 / 96 and 2005 / 06, the livestock subsector’s share averaged 24 percent of agricultural GDP and 11 percent of national GDP (Ethiopia, NBE 2006). The contribution of <b>livestock</b> and <b>livestock</b> <b>product</b> exports to foreign exchange earnings is also significant.

25|$|However, , {{there was}} still a {{significant}} amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than <b>livestock</b> <b>products.</b> Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among <b>livestock</b> <b>products</b> than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have decided}} that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, {{agricultural}} production in Lijiang replaced livestock breeding as the main occupation of the people. The production of agricultural, handicraft, mineral, and <b>livestock</b> <b>products</b> led to considerable prosperity, and during this period a number of slave-owning groups in Ninglang, Lijiang, and Weixi counties developed into a feudal caste of lords.

25|$|Because its {{monopoly}} licence {{granted by}} the British Government forbade any activity besides the fur trade, the HBC created the PSAC to sidestep this issue. The PSAC was formed to produce or manufacture enough agricultural and <b>livestock</b> <b>products</b> to meet the Russian supply demands. In correspondence with British officials, the PSAC was long touted {{as a means to}} promote the British position in the Oregon boundary dispute with the United States. For years now the British had insisted that the Pacific Northwest be partitioned along the Columbia River, rather than a westward extension of the 49th parallel. This would have left most of modern Washington state under British control, notably the important Puget Sound. Through its company stations, the PSAC would promote settlement by British subjects in this disputed area, although it largely failed in this particular aspect.|$|E
25|$|Apart from gas fields, an {{alternative}} {{method of obtaining}} methane is via biogas generated by the fermentation of organic matter including manure, wastewater sludge, municipal solid waste (including landfills), or any other biodegradable feedstock, under anaerobic conditions. Rice fields also generate large amounts of methane during plant growth. Methane hydrates/clathrates (ice-like combinations of methane and water on the sea floor, found in vast quantities) are a potential future source of methane. Cattle belch methane accounts for 16% of the world's annual methane emissions to the atmosphere. One study reported that the livestock sector in general (primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs) produces 37% of all human-induced methane. Early research has found a number of medical treatments and dietary adjustments that help slightly limit the production of methane in ruminants. A 2009 study found that at a conservative estimate, at least 51% of global greenhouse gas emissions were attributable to the life cycle and supply chain of <b>livestock</b> <b>products,</b> meaning all meat, dairy, and by-products, and their transportation. More recently, a 2013 study estimated that livestock accounted for 44 percent of human-induced methane and 14.5 percent of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. Many efforts are underway to reduce livestock methane production and trap the gas to use as energy.|$|E

Tubas, unlike the villages {{in the rest of the}} district, depended on livestock and not olives for income. <b>Livestock</b> <b>products</b> included cheese, clarified butter, woolen rugs, tents, ropes, and cloth bags.

500|$|After the 1997 provincial election, Klein {{appointed}} Stelmach Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural development. While he {{held this}} office, his department encouraged {{the establishment of}} feedlots. The opposition parties charged {{that the government was}} not regulating these sufficiently, but Stelmach responded that municipalities had the authority necessary to effectively regulate them. On the Canadian Wheat Board controversy, Stelmach sided with farmers who wanted an end to the federal body's monopoly on grain sales in the western provinces. Legislatively, Stelmach sponsored five bills while in the Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development portfolio, all of which passed through the legislature. [...] 1997's Meat Inspection Amendment Act required meat inspectors to acquire a search warrant before entering a private dwelling, but also allowed for fines to be voluntarily paid without requiring a court case. It was called by Liberal agriculture critic Ken Nicol [...] "a really good bill". The Livestock and <b>Livestock</b> <b>Products</b> Amendment Act of the same year eliminated government guarantee of the Livestock Patrons' Assurance Fund, designed to protect cattle producers from payment defaults by livestock dealers, in favour of leaving the Fund entirely {{in the hands of the}} industry. It too was supported by the Liberals, with Nicol calling it [...] "very easy for us to accept". [...] In 1998, Stelmach sponsored the Agriculture Statutes (Penalties) Amendment Act, which overhauled the penalty system for violation of various agricultural statutes, setting maximum fines and leaving the precise amount up to judges on a case by case basis. It also passed with Liberal support, as MLA Ed Gibbons said that it [...] "really makes a lot of sense". Another 1998 bill was the Marketing of Agricultural Products Amendment Act, which allowed provincial agricultural marketing boards to revise their marketing plans, and was supported by the opposition. [...] Finally, Stelmach initiated the Agriculture Statutes (Livestock Identification) Amendment Act, which allowed the government to delegate the inspection of branding to the cattle industry. The bill was the subject of considerable debate on second reading, but was ultimately supported by the Liberals on the third and final reading.|$|E
