500|$|On 14 December 2012, the ASO {{announced}} that the English historic county of Yorkshire would host the 2014 edition's early race stages (known as the Grand Départ). Further details {{of the first three}} stages held in the United Kingdom were released on 17 January 2014. This was the fourth Tour to contain stages in the United Kingdom, after 1974, 1994 and 2007. The entire route was announced by the ASO on 23 October 2013 at the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour, described the route as [...] "fairly soft". Notable features of the route were fifth stage's sections of <b>sett</b> <b>paving,</b> the five high altitude stage finishes and the lack time trialling, with only stage twenty's [...] individual time trial.|$|R
50|$|There were 21 {{stages in}} the race, {{covering}} a total distance of 3660.5 km. The longest mass-start stage was the seventh at 234.5 km, and stage 17 was the shortest at 124.5 km. Nine stages were officially classified as flat, five as medium mountain and six as high mountain. Stage five, although classified as medium mountain, was flat with <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> sections. There were five summit finishes: stage 10, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 13, to Chamrousse; stage 14, to Risoul; stage 17, to Saint-Lary Pla d’Adet; and stage 18, to Hautacam. The highest point of the race was the 2360 m-high Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage 14. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 10, in the Besançon, and after 15, in Carcassonne.|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} motor bus tyres (which {{at that time}} were solid rubber) on the road surface was an early issue. Reimbursement for {{repairing}} {{the damage to the}} roads in Holyrood Park by the tour charabancs was laid down as a condition of operating there in the 1921 season. In 1921 the city deputy surveyor found that no undue damage was being done by buses on tarmacked roads, with some not damaged at all, but water-bound macadam surfaces and <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> without concrete underlay were vulnerable to rutting and other issues. On one hilly route, after residents complained of vibration caused by the buses, various remedies were deployed - limiting the speed to 8mph, descent in gear, and the fitting of super-cushion tyres (Dunlop and North British). The 8mph limit was also necessary in granite paved sections of running, which were extensive in Edinburgh.|$|R

40|$|Autorica prikazuje povijesna popločenja Trogira od razdoblja antike, preko srednjovjekovne kaldrme, do popločenja XVIII. i XIX. stoljeća, nastalih sustavnim obnovama gradskih ulica. Među sačuvanim popločenjima, pločnik izveden šezdesetih godina XVIII. stoljeća u dvorištu palače Garagnin-Fanfogna, reprezentativan je primjer umjetničke i tehničke izvrsnosti kojom su majstori rješavali problem odvodnje na nepravilno oblikovanim površinama trogirskih dvorišta i ulica. The author {{presents}} {{different types}} of historic street pavement in Trogir and its neighboring municipalities. A short view of the past begins with the ancient pavement of the city 2 ̆ 7 s core, found in excavations, then moves onto the <b>sett</b> <b>paving</b> technique of medieval era which, with some alterations, survives well into {{the first half of}} the 20 th century, when industrially shaped paving slabs are introduced. Stone pavement technique changes little throughout history, mostly in the thickness and size of stone blocks which are laid onto the bedding layer of coarse grit sand, with or without joint mortar. A few examples of surviving historic pavements are described and analyzed. Amongst these, a well documented and preserved paving executed in the courtyard of the Garagnin-Fanfogna Palace in Trogir by Ignacije Macanović in the 1760 s is exemplary of the skill and artistry with which master masons solved the problem of drainage. Streets of the surrounding settlements of Trogir were generally not paved, but traces of historic pavements are found within enclosed open spaces of courtyards...|$|R

50|$|Badger colonies often utilize several setts: a <b>large</b> main <b>sett</b> {{usually in}} {{the central part of}} a colony's {{territory}} and occupied by most of a colony's members as well as one or more smaller outlier setts. Outlier setts may have only two or three entrances and may be used by a small number of colony members when nearby food sources are in season or in autumn when the main sett is crowded with the year's young.|$|R
2500|$|The {{country rock}} {{of the mine}} is granite. The <b>large</b> mining <b>sett</b> (about [...] ) is crossed by many tin-bearing lodes which are {{substantially}} vertical and trend east-north-east. Most of the mine's excavations were made into just three of these lodes and were relatively shallow. The formation of the lodes was accompanied by extensive metasomatism which converted much of the plagioclase feldspar in the surrounding granite into the soft mineral kaolinite, and made excavation easier {{than it would have}} been in unaltered rock.|$|R
50|$|The {{season was}} a {{stunning}} success. Westward won every race in German waters and eight of nine in England. Cochran sold Westward to a German syndicate in 1911, having {{become interested in}} larger yachts. He was already having a <b>large</b> three-masted schooner <b>Sett</b> Call designed for him by William Gardner. Cochran decided to become an America's Cup contender and asked Gardner to also work on an America's Cup prospect for him. Vanitie was the result. Both Vanitie and Sett Call were built by the George Lawley and Sons Corporation of Boston.|$|R
40|$|The {{attitude}} estimation {{and control}} system is completely dependent on sensor input {{to perform its task}} {{of finding the}} satellites orientation and rotation rate. The three types of sensors need to complete such a task with sufficient accuracy to point the satellite, is assumed to be a Gyroscope for measurement of rotation rate. A Sun sensor for measurement of the first reference vector, and a Magnetometer providing the last reference vector needed for a full orientation estimate. Large uncertainties where present in regards to the accuracy of the Sun sensor prototype consisting of 6 photodiodes mounted {{on each side of the}} satellite. The accuracy problem stems from the known fact that reflected light from Earth often gives large errors on the measured Sun vector. Also this prototype of the Sun sensor has no redundancy a problem that absolutely needed to be alleviated. Because of this the following work has been done on the Sun sensor. \begin{compItemize} 	\item \textbf{Simulation} of Sun irradiance and Earth irradiance incident on a satelite in Earth orbit 	\item \textbf{A improvement} to the Sun sensor prototype has been suggested and simulated with Sun irradiance and Earth irradiance as the only error source. It is shown that the new configuration of photodiodes allows for both redundancy and limiting of field of view(FOV). Alternative photodiodes have been reviewed and two new photodiodes has been sugested and are expected to improve measurements significantly. 	\item \textbf{Two new Sun vector estimation} algorithms have been suggested for the new configuration of photodiodes. They use the FOV limits physically applied to the photodiodes and the redundant design, improving mean error peaks to bellow $ 5 [deg]$ for the majority of Sun lit orbit time \end{compItemize} It was discovered in past work that the attitude controller was very sensitive to error in the rotation rate. Significant work was therefor completed with regards to the choice of a new gyroscope. \begin{compItemize} 	\item \textbf{Microelectromechanical} systems(MEMS) Gyroscope possible Error sources and models where thoroughly investigated and it was found that datasheets where wholly unreliable for choosing a final gyroscope to the NUTS Cube Satellite. The issue of finding a off-the-shelf gyroscope with both good noise characteristics and bias stability with respect to temperature variations was discovered. 	\item \textbf{Three Gyroscopes} are suggested for further investigation to find out if they are sufficiently good to make the attitude controller work. These gyrocsopes where chosen from a <b>larger</b> <b>sett</b> putt together from all relevant manufacturers of gyroscopes found. \end{compItemize...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} 3 year's data from farmers using the Adaptive Yam Minisett Technique (AYMT) to produce seed yams in Nigeria. A total of 30 sites were established each year between 2013 and 2015 in the Idah area (Kogi State) of Nigeria and 58 plots in the Amoke area (Benue State) in 2015. Each site had yam setts (80 to 100 g) untreated and treated with a pesticide ‘dip’ prior to planting and farmers (male and female) were free to select the variety and manage the sites as they wished. In line with previous research, {{the results suggest that}} treatment does increase the weight of tubers produced by a sett but not necessarily the number of tubers. Varietal differences were also observed. For the first time, the results suggest that the time of planting does {{have a significant impact on}} seed tuber weight, with later planting leading to small tubers. Also, the gender of the farmer had an impact on some of the agronomic variables, with male owners of the site generally producing more and <b>larger</b> tubers per <b>sett</b> planted and sprouted than female owners. Various mechanisms for the latter are discussed in the paper...|$|R
