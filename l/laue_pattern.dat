The X-ray Laue microdiffraction technique available at beamline BM 32 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility is ideally suited for probing elastic strains (and associated stresses) in deformed polycrystalline materials with a spatial resolution smaller than a micrometer. However, the standard technique used to evaluate local stresses from the distortion of <b>Laue</b> <b>patterns</b> lacks accuracy for many micromechanical applications, mostly due to (i) the fitting of Laue spots by analytical functions, and (ii) the necessary comparison of the measured pattern with the theoretical one from an unstrained reference specimen. In the present paper, a new method for the analysis of Laue images is presented. A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique, which is essentially insensitive to the shape of Laue spots, is applied to measure the relative distortion of <b>Laue</b> <b>patterns</b> acquired at two different positions on the specimen.

We show that oscillations of a soliton is described by the Klein-Gordon equation with an external potential.
