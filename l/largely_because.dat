5|$|A {{second study}} in 1989 {{indicated}} higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders. The state bought Amtrak's New Haven maintenance facility in May 1989 {{and signed a}} service contract with Amtrak in November. (Metro-North Railroad was not considered for several reasons, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> Amtrak already owned the rail line east of New Haven). Construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in April 1990.|$|E
5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> of its high visibility, and its association with danger, while green was chosen <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|However, the Guatemalan {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E

5|$|Like much of {{the rest}} of French West Africa, the colony had a number of {{policies}} regarding Islam and the Muslim communities. The Arabic language and Islamic law were preferred in the colony by the French in the establishment of colonial government, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> both were codified, and thus easy to standardize.|$|E
5|$|The lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> {{of the diversity}} of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area around the lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).|$|E
5|$|The oldest, {{on which}} most {{currently}} available drug therapies are based, is the cholinergic hypothesis, which proposes that AD {{is caused by}} reduced synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective. Other cholinergic effects have also been proposed, for example, initiation of large-scale aggregation of amyloid, leading to generalised neuroinflammation.|$|E

50|$|The Keuper Uplands are <b>largely</b> forested <b>because</b> {{the soils}} that {{form on the}} keuper are not very fertile. Island clearings are found {{especially}} on the fertile loess or lias soils.|$|R
5|$|The {{second part}} of the strategy, {{contrasting}} Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. Lakeland College historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.|$|E
5|$|Amadi played {{high school}} {{football}} at Alief Hastings High School. He recorded 80 tackles and three interceptions in 1999 before being named an all-district player as a senior in the 2000 season. Amadi was {{also a member of}} Alief Hastings' track and field team. Following his senior season, Amadi was recruited by several programs, including Texas Tech and Indiana. He committed to play for the Kansas Jayhawks in early 2001, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> Kansas also recruited his brother, with whom he played in high school.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (<b>largely</b> <b>because</b> the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> of a struggle in the U.S. Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of Max Shachtman, Martin Abern and James Burnham. The secretariat was composed of those committee members {{who happened to be}} in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman. The disagreement centred on the Shachtmanites' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy, and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.|$|E
5|$|Blagdon Lake is {{designated}} a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) of , created in 1971, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> {{of the variety}} of species and habitats. The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine, Cedar, Larch, Spruce, Oak, Beech, Chestnut, Willow, Lime, Holly and Maple. A variety of orchids including green-winged orchid (Anacamptis morio) and southern marsh-orchids can be seen on the borders of the lake.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, gray wolves were {{widespread}} {{in many parts}} of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River. However, they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> of persecution by farmers. The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century, with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern Asir, northern rocky areas bordering Jordan, or areas surrounding Riyadh.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of the ITA (specially the left artery) is <b>largely</b> recognized <b>because</b> it is often used for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to bypass the left anterior descending or the circumflex artery [3].|$|R
50|$|Ammonium sulfate {{has been}} used as a wood preservative, but due to its {{hygroscopic}} nature, this use has been <b>largely</b> discontinued <b>because</b> of associated problems with metal fastener corrosion, dimensional instability, and finish failures.|$|R
50|$|Donohue {{syndrome}} {{was first}} identified in 1948 by Canadian pathologist William L. Donohue (1906-1985). The name leprechaunism has been <b>largely</b> abandoned <b>because</b> of {{the perception of}} the name by some parents of patients as insulting.|$|R
5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before the signature of the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E
5|$|Georgetown University hosts notable {{speakers}} each year, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> of {{the success}} of the Georgetown Lecture Fund and the Office of Communications. These are frequently important heads of state who visit Georgetown while in the capital, as well as scholars, authors, U.S. politicians, and religious leaders. Many prominent alumni are known to frequent the main campus. The Office of the President hosts numerous symposia on religious topics, such as Nostra aetate, Pacem in terris, and the Building Bridges Seminar.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 Selfe {{published}} {{proposals for}} a city underground railway, with stations at Wynyard, the Rocks and Circular Quay, and a loop to Woolloomooloo and the eastern suburbs. The proposal included a bridge across Sydney Harbour for trains, vehicles and pedestrians. He presented these schemes to the Royal Commission on City and Suburban Railways in 1890; but nothing was to come of it, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> the 1890s depression brought public works initiatives to a standstill.|$|E
50|$|Three {{theories}} exist {{about the}} abandonment of Pampa Grande. However, Shimada explains that these theories have issues because the “available data pertaining to this problematic time period are <b>largely</b> ambiguous <b>because</b> of their fragmentary nature…”.|$|R
50|$|The {{closeness}} of Labor Day and Youth Day {{resulted in an}} unexpectedly long break for schools in 2008 - the Youth Day half-holiday entitlement had been <b>largely</b> forgotten <b>because</b> it has been subsumed into the Golden Week.|$|R

5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. <b>Largely</b> <b>because</b> of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E
5|$|In February 1685, King Charles II died without {{legitimate}} issue, and George's father-in-law, the Roman Catholic Duke of York, became king as James II in England and Ireland and James VII in Scotland. George {{was appointed}} to the Privy Council and invited to attend Cabinet meetings, although he had no power to alter or affect decisions. William of Orange refused to attend James's coronation <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> George would take precedence over him. Although they were both sons-in-law of King James, George was also the son and brother of a king and so outranked William, who was an elected stadtholder of a republic.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other species}} of Pokémon, Pikachu are often {{captured}} and groomed by humans to fight other Pokémon for sport. Pikachu {{are one of the}} most well-known varieties of Pokémon, <b>largely</b> <b>because</b> a Pikachu is a central character in the Pokémon anime series. Pikachu is regarded as a major character of the Pokémon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years. It is also seen as one of the major mascots for Nintendo.|$|E
25|$|Rome would rely on {{brute force}} and sheer numbers when in doubt. The {{soldiers}} {{were trained to}} memorize every step in battle, so discipline and order could not break down into chaos. They were <b>largely</b> successful <b>because</b> of this.|$|R
50|$|CPU shims are {{nowadays}} <b>largely</b> obsolete <b>because</b> {{most modern}} processors designed for home users since {{the introduction of}} the Athlon 64 and Pentium 4 have an Integrated Heat Spreader (IHS) which prevents the CPU core from being accidentally broken.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans were largely oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia was <b>largely</b> absent <b>because</b> of low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|R
