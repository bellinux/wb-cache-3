In order to maintain this favorable status, every effort needs to be made to use <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>materials</b> wherever possible. The tritium breeder blanket is a focal point of system design engineers who must design environmentally attractive blankets through the use of <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>materials.</b> Of the several candidate lithium-containing ceramics being considered for use in the breeder blanket, Li{sub 2 }O, Li{sub 2 }TiO{sub 3 }, are attractive choices because of their low activation.

A comparison of the 14 C activity induced by CTR blankets and by natural and artificial sources as nuclear tests and power fission reactor is given in the report. It is recommended to minimise the nitrogen content in beryllium and in the low activated structural materials below 0. 01 wt %.

40|$|SPECT {{radioisotope}} producers generally utilize commercial cyclotrons which output proton beams in the 20 - 50 MeV range. To {{separate the}} target radiation environment {{from that of}} the cyclotron, beamlines are used to transport the extracted beams to one or more shielded target rooms. Industrial beamline systems pose an interesting engineering challenge. Such beamlines must focus the beam to customer dictated target specifications, often over a significant energy, and current range. Dual or single beam extracion may be required, and particles other than protons may also require transport to target. Beam spill in all primary and secondary lines must be kept low (usually less than 5 %), and beam must be maximized to target.

40|$|Detailed activation, decay {{heat and}} waste {{disposal}} calculations of the ARIES-AT design are performed {{to evaluate the}} safety aspects of the device. The high initial activity of the SiC highly irradiated components translates directly into a higher initial decay heat for these structures than for the well-protected steel-based components. However, after a one-hour cool-down period, the SiC decay heat drops by two decades to levels comparable to the steel-based components. The decay heat of the LiPb coolant was found to exceed that of the SiC components for several days after shutdown. This implies that a loss of flow accident (LOFA) event is more critical than a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) event for LiPb/SiC systems. Regarding waste disposal, all structures can easily meet the Class C Low-Level Waste (LLW) requirements established for the ARIES power plants. Many components could qualify as Class A LLW after a 100 -year storage period after selection of <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> <b>materials</b> and control of the Nb and Mo impurities in ferritic steel.

In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced light-water reactors. In addition, progress in the development of advanced, <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> structural <b>materials</b> supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement.

In the present study, technologies for large scale manufacturing of high purity V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti alloy were developed by improving the present commercial production processes of vanadium metal, and optimizing alloying, plating, sheeting and wiring techniques. Efforts were focused on reducing carbon, nitrogen and oxygen impurities, which are known to deteriorate workability, weldability and radiation resistance of vanadium alloys. Especially, improvements were made in atmospheric control during calcination, aluminothermic reduction, vacuum arc remelting, and hot forging and rolling. A medium size (30 kg) high purity V- 4 Cr- 4 Ti ingot was produced and designated as NIFS-HEAT- 1.

40|$|The lower hybrid (LH) {{launcher}} configuration {{has been}} redesigned {{to integrate the}} functions of the vertical four-way power splitter and the front waveguide array (front array). This permits 256 waveguide channels to be fed by only 64 waveguides at the vacuum window interface. The resulting configuration is a more compact coupler, which incorporates the simplicity of a multijunction coupler while preserving the spectral flexibility of a conventional lower hybrid launcher. Other spin-offs of the redesign are reduction in thermal incompatibility between the front array and vacuum windows, improved maintainability, in situ vacuum window replacement, a reduced number of radio frequency (rf) connections, and a weight reduction of 7300 kg. There should be a significant cost reduction as well. Issues associated with the launcher design and fabrication have been addressed by a research and development program that includes brazing of the front array and testing of the power splitter configuration to confirm that phase errors due to reflections in the shorted splitter legs will not significantly impact the rf spectrum.

40|$|On daily basis, {{individuals}} {{are faced with}} uncontrollable negative events. Accordingly, acceptance of and adjustment to one’s circumstance becomes paramount to the promotion and sustainment of positive psychological outcomes (Rothbaum, Weisz, & Snyder, 1982). The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine the ability of a person’s current affective state to promote the use of accommodation when challenged with an uncontrollable, negative environment. Following a brief online interaction with a confederate, participants rated their chat partner and received negative feedback regarding their likability. Affect valence and activation were manipulated through musical induction techniques, forming four conditions: <b>low</b> <b>activation,</b> positive affect; <b>low</b> <b>activation,</b> negative affect; high activation, positive affect; and high activation negative affect. It was expected that positive valence and <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> affective states would signal that the negative feedback was satisfactory or benign, and increase an individual’s ability to focus on the positive aspects of the situation. Therefore, main effects of affect valence and activation were predicted, such that positive valence and <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> affective states were expected to facilitate acceptance of and adjustment to the negative feedback. However, no significant main effects of affect valence or activation were observed. Despite this, a significant Valence X Activation interaction emerged, such that <b>low</b> <b>activation,</b> positive affect promoted accommodative responding through the acknowledgement that it is not possible to get along with everyone.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the results of}} NMR relaxation studies of fast ion glasses {{in the light of}} variable frequency electrical conductivity measurements.

Other characteristics of the constant frequency conductivity in this <b>low</b> <b>activation</b> energy regime, such as the unphysically low pre-exponent, match with the corresponding observations for NMR measurements. Since the activation energy observed at constant frequency in the frequency-dependent regime for conductivity depends on the characteristic departure from exponential relaxation for the conductivity process, we conclude that the NMR activation energy is likewise a simple consequence of the nonexponential character of ionic relaxation in the glass.
