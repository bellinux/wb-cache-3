40|$|Environmental Science and EngineeringDuring {{the past}} decade, the {{procedure}} for quantification of forest parameters using LiDAR data has been rapidly improved. Among various forest parameters, biomass is the paramount in understanding the potentials productivity of forests. Various methods {{have been developed to}} estimate biomass at both plot and individual tree levels. In order to quantify biomass at the individual tree level, tree crown delineation must be conducted, which is sometimes challenging especially for multi-layer dense forests in rugged mountainous areas. In this study, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were used to delineate tree crowns and estimate biomass in a mountainous forest. Firstly, a novel algorithm was proposed to identify individual tree crowns using the concept of <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratios</b> based solely on LiDAR data. Then, above ground biomass (AGB) was estimated using machine learning approaches based on tree crowns delineated in the previous step. LiDAR-derived metrics related to forest parameters such as tree height and crown areas as well as topographic characteristics extracted based on the delineated tree crowns were used to estimate AGB. Three machine learning models— random forest, Cubist, and support vector regression—were evaluated for AGB estimation and relative importance of input variables was examined. ope...|$|R

However, whether intra-specific differences in crown characteristics in mixed stands compared to pure stands {{are dependent on}} site conditions remains poorly understood. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to examine the differences in Fagus sylvatica crown characteristics at four sites, each of which contained pure stands of F. sylvatica and their mixture with Pinus sylvestris. These sites covered {{the area where the}} mixture occurs in Europe from south to north, representing a gradient of F. sylvatica productivity, defined as the mean increment of annual volume growth in pure F. sylvatica stands. Despite the large range in productivity, F. sylvatica trees in mixtures had larger crowns regardless of site conditions, with a higher proportion of their crown volume in the lower canopy compared to trees in pure stands. Larger crown volumes were related to higher <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratios</b> and greater <b>crown</b> expansion, depending on the site. The magnitude of the mixing effect was variable among the crown characteristics evaluated, but overall our findings provide evidence that for a given species combination and density, the effect of mixture increased in the two most productive sites. TLS-derived novel crown metrics revealed that the mixing effect was affected by productivity, which was not captured by traditionally measured crown variables...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Society of American Foresters and can be found at: [URL] strategies such as thinning may minimize productivity losses from a variety of forest disturbances, including forest insects. This study analyzed the 10 -year postthinning response of stands and individual trees in thinned white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) plantations in northern Minnesota, USA, with light to moderate defoliation from eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens). Using the Forest Vegetation Simulator, model results suggested overprediction of stand basal area growth and tree diameter increment in these stands. Growth modifiers indicated that trees growing in unthinned stands and with greater defoliation levels (i. e., 20 ‐ 32 %) would need the largest adjustment for diameter increment. Modifiers for height were similarly specified to compensate for the underprediction of height increment in these stands. Thinned stands continued to maintain target <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratios</b> in excess of 0. 40, suggesting long-term productivity. Results highlight the need for simulation models that represent appropriate responses to stands and trees affected by forest insects and diseases.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Stem growth, stem form development, and the {{dynamics}} of crown recession in young red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) were studied by analyzing annual growth rings of stems and knots, annual height increments, projected crown areas, and branch diameters. Forty-one trees were sampled from three plantation spacing studies, representing ages 1 through 12 years and square spacings from 0. 94 x 0. 94 m to 8. 6 x 8. 6 m. Data from the spacing studies were used to develop non-linear functions describing height-age and diameter-age relationships, and one-year stem diameter growth rates, in relation to spacing and site index. Linear functions were developed that describe the variation in responses to spacing of stem taper, <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratios,</b> projected <b>crown</b> areas, stem diameters at <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> bases, and mean branch diameters. At age 27 years, nine trees were sampled from a thinning study; naturally established red alder were thinned at age 14 years to square spacings of 4. 2 X 4. 2 m and 5. 8 x 5. 8 m, or left unthinned as control. A non-linear function was developed, describing height-age relationships as affected by thinning intensity. Linear functions were developed that describe the variation in responses to thinning of stem taper, projected crown areas, stem diameters at <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> bases, heights to <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> bases, and mean branch diameters. Stem diameter growth of planted red alder increased faster and culminated earlier at intermediate (3 to 4 m) spacings than at wider spacings. Total diameter growth of trees planted at spacings closer than 3 x 3 m and wider than 6 x 6 m was markedly reduced. The greatest height growth was attained by trees planted at 2, 3, and 4 m spacings; significant long-term height growth reductions occurred in trees planted at {{the high and low}} ends of the density spectrum. Planting density strongly affected crown development; trees planted at high densities developed short, narrow crowns, and small branches, while trees planted at progressively wider spacings had progressively wider and longer crowns, and larger branches. Stem growth patterns were subsequently affected. Trees planted at high densities developed cylindrical form, and widely-spaced trees developed stems with significant taper. Results from the thinning study showed that in response to thinning, crown recession slowed, crown areas expanded, more branch wood was produced, and height growth was reduced. These effects were more pronounced in trees thinned to the widest spacing. Further, stem taper increased significantly after thinning. With increased growing space, allocation of growth to crown expansion appears to occur at the expense of stem height growth; thus, the capacity to produce large crowns has important implications for lumber recoverability and wood quality in red alder...|$|R

Sapwood area was an effective T. cunudensis LA surrogate, though nonsapwood-based models using stem cross-sectional area and modified <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> produced results comparable to sapwood-based models. Equations for predicting tree-level stemwood volume increment (AVINC) were derived, and implied growth efficiencies (GE) {{were used to assess}} magnitude and pattern of GE change between strata and species. AVINC was effectively modeled using LA alone, and the slightly peaking GE- LA relationships approximated those previouslyconceptualized for shade-tolerant species. A. bulsamea and trees in upper strata were most efficient.

The data from 37 viable installations were {{used to evaluate the}} crown ratio and relative spacing relationship of loblolly pine plantations. The effects of planting density, site quality, and cultural intensity on the relationship were investigated with a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach. The crown ratio and relative spacing relationship is exceedingly predictable. When loblolly pine plantation stands reached the average <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> of 0. 40, a critical point representing a generally acceptable level of tree vigor, the corresponding relative spacing index ranged from 0. 11 to 0. 20, mainly depending on initial planting density.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Ages, {{diameter}} growth, density, tree size, {{and species}} were studied in old-growth, plantation, and young natural Douglas-fir stands in three areas in western Oregon: {{the western and}} eastern Coast Range and the western Cascades. The purpose was to compare {{the development of these}} three stand types and to determine whether plantations and young natural stands would develop old-growth structures and characteristics. The Douglas-fir age ranges in plantations (8 to 15 yr) were much narrower and than the ranges of tree ages found in the young natural (21 to 102 yr) and in the old-growth stands (300 to 354 yr). This wide range of tree ages, along with diameter growth rates and tree and stand structural characteristics, supported the hypothesis that old-growth developed at low initial stand densities. These low initial stand densities, probably the result of prolonged stand establishment, likely enabled height and crown size advantages among old and younger trees. Dominant and large codominant trees maintained <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratios</b> and sustained diameter growth resulting in large stable trees indicated by low height-to-diameter ratios. The mean diameters of the dominant trees in the old-growth and the dominant trees in the young natural stands were not significantly different at age 40 and 100, indicating the young natural stands appear to be growing at the same rates as the old-growth in its first 100 years. The mean dominant diameters in the plantations and old-growth at age 40 and 100 were significantly different, indicating the plantations are growing and developing differently than young natural and old-growth forests. Plantations had grown rapidly for the first 20 to 30 years, and computer simulation indicated that a significant rapid decline in radial growth would occur between ages 30 and 55. Simulations also indicate that during this period, the mean diameters of the dominant plantation trees would fall below those of the old-growth in two of the three stands by age 85. Pre-commercial thinning 20 to 25 years ago in the plantations has helped sustain high early growth rates {{for a longer period of}} time than would have occurred if thinning had not been performed. Additional thinning in the future is likely needed to maintain rapid current rates. When simulated to age 250 both the young natural stands and the plantations maintained higher densities of smaller diameter trees than the old-growth stands. This simulation result indicates the possible inability of these stands to self-thin to the densities found in old-growth stands without some sort of density-reducing disturbance. The broad range of tree ages in the old-growth stands suggests that stand disturbances are a normal part of old-growth development on these sites. Five different plantation thinning options were also simulated to age 250, including additional options with thinning of understory trees and ingrowth. The projections indicate that when the plantations are left unthinned they would generally develop trees with small <b>live</b> <b>crowns</b> and mean diameters but still produce stable dominant overstory trees (low H:D ratios). Shade tolerant understory trees and ingrowth, such as western hemlock, are a key part of old-growth development. These trees may reduce the rate of growth and alter crown structure of the overstory trees over extended periods of time (200 + years). Additional thinning, possibly in multiple entries, in both the overstory and understory may be necessary for dense plantations to develop the tree size heterogeneity found in local old-growth forests. I also demonstrated a methodology to determine site-specific management targets or goals for creating old-growth structure from plantations. This was performed using past and current forest structure and composition information within a local landscape scale of 500 to 1000 acres, typical of the public land checkerboard ownership pattern. Stand types making up the historical landscape are identified and described retrospectively using historical and current aerial photographs and digital orthophotos, cruise records, previous studies, and sample plots of standing and harvested forests. The degree of detail provided through this methodology will likely help forest managers to define complex late-successional characteristics of stands and landscapes. My results indicate that stand and project area-specific definitions of old-growth and clearly defined goals for young stand management will facilitate development of old forest characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Following the Star Fire, 287 trees {{greater than}} or equal to 75 cm {{diameter}} at breast height (DBH), were tracked for post-fire mortality. The Star Fire, located in the western Sierra Nevada, burned mostly at low to moderate intensity during late summer of 2001. The mixed conifer forest was dominated by Psuedotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir), Abies concolor (white fir), Pinus labertiana (sugar pine), and Libocedrus decurrens (incense cedar). Several Pinus jeffreyi (Jeffrey pine) and P. ponderosa (ponderosa pine) were also sampled.

We calculated mean basal area (BA; m 2 ha− 1), trees per hectare (TPH), and percent species composition for each stand and averaged across stands by stand type (pre-out-break, outbreak). We also calculated mean percent species composition for live trees using BA and for dead trees using TPH; these were also averaged across stands by stand type.

40|$|This paper reviews {{aspects of}} the {{functional}} ecology of naturally established tree seedlings in the boreal forests of North America {{with an emphasis on}} the relationship between light availability and the growth and survival of shade tolerant conifers up to pole size. Shade tolerant conifer species such as firs and spruces tend to have a lower specific leaf mass, photosynthetic rate at saturation, <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio,</b> STAR (shoot silhouette area to total needle surface area ratio), and root to shoot ratio than the shade intolerant pines. The inability of intolerant species such as the pines and aspen to survive in shade appears to be mainly the result of characteristics at the shoot, crown, and whole-tree levels and not at the leaf level. Although firs and spruces frequently coexist in shaded understories, they do not have identical growth patterns and crown architectures. We propose a simple framework based on the maximum height that different tree species can sustain in shade, which may help managers determine the timing of partial or complete harvests. Consideration of these functional aspects of regeneration is important to the understanding of boreal forest dynamics and can be useful to forest managers seeking to develop or assess novel silvicultural systems...|$|E

Most growth and crown morphological parameters investigated were strongly related to the natural light gradient investigated (3 - 83 % full sunlight), but the relationship tended to plateau at around 25 % full sunlight. The relationships were generally better for the larger size class. Intraspecific competition did not significantly affect growth and crown morphology of saplings receiving less than 25 % full sunlight, but it affected relative height growth, relative radial growth and the apical dominance ratio for those receiving more than 25 % full sunlight (R 2 = 0. 506; p< 0. 001; R 2 = 0. 403; p< 0. 002; R 2 = 0. 348; p< 0. 001, respectively).

In a field experiment we tested the suggested relationship between vigor and defense by thinning and fertilization in ten pure lodgepole pine stands in central Alberta. In the third summer after the fertilization and thinning treatment we inoculated trees with the blue stain fungus. The combination of fertilization and thinning increased GE and resin duct density but negatively impacted starch reserves. Lesion size increased with tree size in control plots, however, this relationship was lost when trees were fertilized and thinned.

MANOVA performed on these parameters estimates confirmed statistically significant differences in stem form both between the two lowest levels-of-growing stock and between these two treatments and all three regimes with higher levels of growing stock. The individual tree parameter estimates were also tested {{in the context of a}} seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) analysis. The two stem profile parameter estimates were closely related to diameter! height <b>ratio</b> and <b>crown</b> <b>ratio,</b> respectively. Indicator variables for the different density regimes did not contribute any explanatory power beyond diameter/height ratio for the first parameter or <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> for the second parameter. DBH, height and <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> are concluded to account for the variation in stem form imposed by differences in stand density management...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Quantitative {{silviculture}} is {{the application}} of biological relationships in meeting specific, quantitative management objectives. It is a two-sided approach requiring the identification and application of biological relationships. An example of quantitative silviculture is presented that uses a relationship between average-live <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> and relative stand density to manage wood quality objectives in loblolly pine...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between white spruce radial increment and wood properties were investigated {{in relation to}} tree and stand attributes using data from mature white spruce stands in the boreal forest of western Canada that experienced a range of shelterwood treatments. The model with the highest predictive ability was radial increment (adj-R 2 = 67 %) and included crown attributes, diameter at breast height (DBH), average height of competitors, and a climate index. Radial growth {{was positively related to}} <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio,</b> whereas wood density and modulus of elasticity were negatively correlated to the crown attribute. Tree slenderness had a significant negative effect on wood density and modulus of elasticity, as it reflects the mechanical stability requirement of the tree. The models consistently improved when using annual averages calculated over longer periods of time. However, when the annual averages were calculated using time periods of 5 – 10 and 10 – 20 years prior to sampling, the predictive ability of the models decreased, which indicated that the current tree and stand conditions were the best predictors of growth and wood properties up to five years prior to sampling. This study suggests that crown length equal to 2 / 3 of the tree height might represent an optimal balance between radial growth and wood quality...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} field-based {{practical}} exercise that allows students in forestry, ecology and natural resources to develop their understanding of forest stand dynamics. The exercise involves measurement of key tree growth parameters in four even-aged, single-species plantation stands of different age but occupying sites with similar soil and environmental characteristics. The selected stands represent key stages in stand development, from establishment to rotation age for maximum fibre production. In the field, students work in small teams to gather data from {{an equal number of}} plots within each stand. Tree parameters include top height, crown diameter, <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> and diameter at breast height. In addition, information on stand density and understorey vegetation is collected. Plot size and number can be varied to suit the constraints of class size and available time, though circular plots of 100 m 2 are recommended. In the classroom, data are pooled and analysis focuses on presenting tree and vegetation changes through time. The simplest way of interpreting the data is to prepare graphs and charts for each of the parameters, though more advanced statistical interpretations are possible. The project as outlined here can be modified {{to meet the needs of}} different groups, and has been successfully used in undergraduate teaching of silviculture and forest ecology, as well as in postgraduate courses in natural resources management...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} planted trees per hectare {{influences}} individual volume growth, {{which in turn}} can affect wood properties. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effect of six different plantation spacings of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) 25 years following planting on tree growth, morphology, and wood properties. Stem analyses were performed to calculate annual and cumulative diameter, height, and volume growth. For morphological and wood property measurements several parameters were analyzed: diameter of the largest branch, <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> <b>ratio,</b> wood density, and the moduli of elasticity and rupture on small clear samples. The highest volume growth for individual trees was obtained in the 1111 trees/ha plantation, while the lowest was in the 4444 trees/ha plantation. Wood density and the moduli of elasticity and rupture did not change significantly between the six plantation spacings, but the largest branch diameter was significantly higher in the 1111 trees/ha (3. 26 cm mean diameter) compared with the 4444 trees/ha spacing (2. 03 cm mean diameter). Based on this study, a wide range of spacing induced little negative effect on the measured wood properties, except for the size of knots. Increasing the initial spacing of jack pine plantations appears to be a good choice if producing large, fast-growing stems is the primary goal, but lumber mechanical and visual properties could be decreased due to the larger branch diameter...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we apply}} {{vertical}} angle count sampling {{to estimate the}} <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> of trees in unthinned forest stands. The rationale {{is to be able}} to quickly assess the relative crown size of forest stands to support thinning decisions by simply counting trees. We provide estimators and discuss their precision based on pilot studies in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantations in northern Sweden. A separate study was conducted to investigate the amount of measurement errors, i. e., how many trees are wrongly selected or overlooked when using the method. Sampling errors for estimating <b>crown</b> <b>ratio</b> were found to be remarkably low, partly due to high correlation between crown length and tree height and partly due to low variability in the study sites. Measurement errors were in the range of what is commonly obtained with horizontal angle count sampling for basal area estimation...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{changes in}} stem {{circumference}} at the 1954 and 1963 internodes of a 22 -year-old Douglas-fir were monitored using automated band dendrometers. Determinations of internal tree water potential and estimates of transpiration {{were used to}} characterize the water status of the tree. Environmental monitoring included the measurement of air temperature along the tree stem and solar radiation above the forest canopy. The {{results indicated that the}} 1963 internode, within the <b>live</b> <b>crown,</b> was relatively more sensitive to the factors affecting stem dehydration and shrinkage than was the 1954 internode below the <b>live</b> <b>crown.</b> The diurnal patterns of stem shrinkage seemed to be determined by the lag between water absorption and transpirational loss, which was in turn dependent upon soil water supply and atmospheric moisture demand. In addition, transpirational demand appeared to be partially fulfilled by water temporarily stored near the cambium...|$|R
40|$|This paper repons {{variations}} in mechanical properties of individual southern pine fibers and com-pares engineering properties of earlywood and latewood tracheids {{with respect to}} tree height and juvenility. Results indicate that latewood fibers exhibit greater strength and stiffness than earlywood fibers irrespective of tree height or juvenility. Average earlywood loblolly pine fibers had modulus of elasticity and ultimate tensile stress values of 14. 8 GPa and 604 MPa, respectively. Corresponding latewood fibers had modulus of elasticity and ultimate tensile stress value. ~ that were, respectively, 33 and 73 % higher. These differences are attributable to microfibril angles and pitting. Juvenility {{as defined by the}} mechanical properties of individual wood fibers is not a cylindrical cone surrounding the pith but appears to be biconical, tapering from the base to below the <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> and then again from the <b>live</b> <b>crown</b> to the apex...|$|R
