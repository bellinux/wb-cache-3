5000|$|CC, for [...] "CopyCat" [...] or [...] "Carbon Copy" [...] (born December 22, 2001), is a <b>brown</b> <b>tabby</b> {{and white}} {{domestic}} shorthair {{and the first}} cloned pet. CC's surrogate mother was a tabby, but her genetic donor, Rainbow, was a calico domestic shorthair. The difference in hair coloration between CC and Rainbow is due to epigenetic re-programming, which normally occurs in a fertilised embryo before implantation.|$|R
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (<b>brown</b> <b>tabby)</b> and its bushy tail. Another idea is that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|R
50|$|Urban legend {{says that}} Bobtails {{are the result}} of a {{crossbreeding}} between a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. The unusual tail is actually the result of a random spontaneous genetic mutation within the domestic cat population, and {{may be related to the}} Manx gene, which is also dominant. Yodie, a short-tailed <b>brown</b> <b>tabby</b> male, was mated with a seal-point Siamese female to create the American Bobtail's original bloodline. Most of the early bloodlines have died out.|$|R
50|$|Breed {{standards}} {{allow for}} one or more body spots {{as long as there}} is no more than 20% colour and the cat does not give the appearance of a bicolour. A few random spots are acceptable, but they should not detract from the pattern. The rest of the cat is white. Although red tabby and white is the classic van colour, the colour on a Van's head and tail can be one of the following: red, cream, black, blue, red <b>tabby,</b> cream <b>tabby,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>tabby,</b> blue tabby, tortoiseshell, dilute tortoiseshell (also known as blue-cream), brown-patched tabby, blue-patched tabby and any other colour not showing evidence of crossbreeding with the point-coloured breeds (Siamese, Himalayan, etc.). Not all registries recognise all of these colour variations.|$|R
500|$|Maine Coons {{can have}} any colors that other cats have. Colors {{indicating}} crossbreeding, such as chocolate, lavender, the Siamese pointed patterns or the [...] "ticked" [...] patterns, are not accepted by some breed standards (the 'ticked' pattern, for example, is accepted by TICA). The most common pattern {{seen in the}} breed is <b>brown</b> <b>tabby.</b> All eye colors are accepted under breed standards, {{with the exception of}} the occurrence of blue-colored or odd-eyes (i.e. two eyes of different colors) in cats possessing coat colors other than white.|$|R
5|$|In 1895, a dozen Maine Coons {{were entered}} into a show in Boston. On 8 May 1895, the first North American cat show was hosted at Madison Square Garden in New York City. A female Maine Coon <b>brown</b> <b>tabby,</b> named Cosey, was entered into the show. Owned by Mrs. Fred Brown, Cosey won the silver collar and medal and was named Best in Show. The silver collar was {{purchased}} by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Foundation {{with the help of}} a donation from the National Capital Cat Show. The collar is housed at the CFA Central Office in the Jean Baker Rose Memorial Library.|$|R
5000|$|Sam's <b>brown</b> <b>tabby</b> cat. He was a {{gift from}} Jake in [...] "The Challenger," [...] and named for the {{adolescent}} cougar that attacked Sam while riding Strawberry earlier in the book. He is most often seen racing Sam down the stairs in her ranch home or snuggling deep into her covers on cold nights. Everyone on the ranch, including Wyatt and the hands have to keep constant watch that he doesn't slip out the door with them. The cat enjoys the outdoors, but Sam worries a coyote could kill him.Cougar develops a friendship with the draft horse mustang Tinkerbell(Tinker)and Cougar would often sleep on Tinker's back in the barn.|$|R
5000|$|Opened in 2003, the {{inception}} of Tabby’s Place began with a stray <b>brown</b> <b>tabby</b> cat. Jonathan Rosenberg, then Chief Technology Officer at CNET, and his wife Sharon adopted this cat and named him [...] "Tabby." [...] The Rosenbergs lost Tabby fifteen years later to untreatable squamous cell carcinoma. In honor of Tabby, Jonathan resigned from his job, cashed in his company stock options and invested more than US$2 million {{to create a new}} 501c-3 non-profit corporation called Tabby's Place. [...] The sanctuary was established [...] "to provide refuge to cats in hopeless situations." [...] The sanctuary's 500th intake was documented in 2007 in the Westchester Times Tribune.|$|R
50|$|Females are {{medium-sized}} and elegant; however, males {{can be much}} larger. They have muscular bodies though {{females are}} slightly smaller. Their legs are long with perfectly oval paws. They have large ears. The tail has medium length with tapering toward the tip. The head appears to be round, but it is slightly longer than broad with well-defined whisker pads. Ears are large and well set. Their eyes are oval and match the coat color. The fur is short and has no undercoat, besides it lying close to the body. The coat should not be silky. The colors can be different but the most recognized are red, white, black, red and white,black and white, <b>brown</b> and <b>brown</b> <b>tabby.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{inhibited}} pigment gene, I/i. The {{dominant allele}} (I) produces tipped hairs that are fully colored {{only at the}} tip and have a white base. This allele appears to interact with other genes to produce various degrees of tipping, ranging from deeply tipped silver tabby to lightly tipped shaded silver and chinchilla silver. The inhibitor gene interacts with the non-agouti genotype (I-aa) to produce the color known as smoke. The homozygous recessive genotype when combined with the agouti gene (iiA-), produces tabby coloration, which can vary along a spectrum ranging from a deeply patterned <b>brown</b> <b>tabby,</b> to a lighter [...] "golden tabby", to the very lightly colored shaded or chinchilla golden colors. Orange cats with the inhibitor gene (I-O-) are commonly called [...] "cameo".|$|R
50|$|The TICA Chausie breed {{standard}} allows three colors: solid black, black grizzled tabby, and black (a.k.a. <b>brown)</b> ticked <b>tabby.</b> Because the Chausie breed is relatively new, Chausies are still frequently born {{that have a}} variety of other colors and patterns, and they make wonderful pets. However, only the three permissible colors are considered ideal. Only cats in the three permissible colors can be entered in new breed classes at cat shows, and only the three colors will be eligible eventually for championship classes.|$|R
50|$|The International Cat Association (TICA) breed {{standard}} calls for brown-spotted tabby (cool to warm brown, tan or gold with black or dark <b>brown</b> spots), silver-spotted <b>tabby</b> (silver coat with black or dark grey spots), black (black with black spots), and black smoke (black-tipped silver with black spots) only.|$|R
2500|$|Larry is the 10 Downing Street cat and is Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He is a <b>brown</b> {{and white}} <b>tabby,</b> {{believed}} born in January 2007. By July 2016, when Theresa May became Prime Minister, {{he had developed}} a reputation of being [...] "violent" [...] in his interactions with other local mousers, namely the Foreign Office's much younger cat Palmerston.|$|R
50|$|Black ticked tabby Chausies {{have black}} ticking, black stripes {{on the inside}} of the upper legs and to a lesser extent on the outside, black rings on the tail, a black tail tip, and black tabby {{markings}} around the eyes. They are also known as <b>brown</b> ticked <b>tabbies</b> because, although the markings are black, the background color is brownish. The background color can vary in hue across a large range. While Chausie breeders try to avoid producing the very reddish brown background color seen in the Abyssinian breed, they do produce everything else in the range. Background color may be reddish gold, it may be a light golden brown, warm beige, cold beige, and even a very cool light gray with just a hint of brown in it. The latter is a very wild looking background color. Random polygenes influence the background color. Every time a black ticked tabby kitten is born, breeders start guessing what the background color will be. But no one really knows until the cat matures.|$|R
6000|$|... "Quick child, whip on this {{gown and}} cap and hurry into bed. These prying fellows will surely have pity on a sick girl, and respect this room if no other," [...] said Mrs. <b>Brown,</b> briskly helping <b>Tabby</b> into a short night-gown and round cap, and tucking her well {{up when she}} was laid down, for between the plump feather-beds were hidden many muskets, the most {{precious}} of their stores. This had been planned beforehand, and Tabby was glad to rest and tell her tale while Aunty Brown put physic bottles and glasses on the table, set some evil-smelling herbs to simmer on the hearth, and, compromising with her conscience, concocted a nice little story to tell the invaders.|$|R
5000|$|Onstage, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer {{are usually}} costumed as orange, black and <b>brown</b> calico or <b>tabby</b> cats. Their relation, be it siblings, friends or mates, is unknown. In the {{original}} Broadway production, they wore baggy clown-like costumes seemingly made of various food wrappers as characters performing for Bustopher Jones. Generally, Mungojerrie's costume is a darker, more heavily striped tabby pattern, while Rumpleteazer is paler. However, when they perform their duet song, they have additional costume pieces that vary by which {{version of the}} song is performed: a vest and stockings for Mungojerrie and a leotard and stockings for the original Rumpleteazer, or pearls for the modern Rumpleteazer. This {{has the effect of}} making them appear almost identically marked.|$|R
5000|$|The Chausie (...) is a {{domestic}} breed of cat {{that was developed}} by breeding a few individuals from the nondomestic species jungle cat (Felis chaus) to a far greater number of domestic cats (Felis catus). The Chausie was first recognized as {{a domestic}} breed by The International Cat Association (TICA). Within the domestic breeds, the Chausie is categorized as a nondomestic hybrid source breed. Other domestic breeds in this category include the Bengal and the Savannah. Because Chausies are mostly descended from domestic cats, by about the fourth generation they are fully fertile and completely domestic in temperament. Chausies should be tall, long, and lean, with very long legs and medium boning. The torso is deep-chested with flat sides. The ears are broad, tall, and set high on the head, about two fingers apart. The cheekbones are striking—prominent, long, and angular—and the eyes are flattened on top and form a half oval below. The coat is short, and the cats can come in three colors: solid black, black grizzled <b>tabby,</b> and black (<b>brown)</b> ticked <b>tabby.</b> Gold or yellow eye color is preferred, though yellower and lighter shades of green are allowed.|$|R
