5|$|Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops after a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses {{in anticipation of a}} renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> {{of flying}} from their Half Moon Bay, California {{departure}} point, Jessica, her father, and her flight instructor arrived in Cheyenne {{the evening before}} their ill-fated flight. They were welcomed in Wyoming's capital city by Mayor Leo Pando. After some media interviews, they got a ride to their hotel in the car of a local radio station program director, who recalled them discussing the forecast weather conditions for the next day.|$|E
40|$|Two <b>long</b> <b>days</b> induced some {{flowering}} and 4 or more <b>long</b> <b>days</b> caused 100 % flowering in Silene armeria. On <b>long</b> <b>days</b> microscopically detectable flower primordia {{were first}} seen after 6 days, {{which is at}} least 1 day {{before the start of}} stem elongation. Both gibberellin A 3 and A 7 caused flowering on short days, but the results were variable and flowering was never 100 %. Three different gibberellins were detected in Silene extracts. The pattern of gibberellins extracted from plants on short and <b>long</b> <b>days</b> was qualitatively the same, but on <b>long</b> <b>days</b> gibberellin content was up to 100 % higher than on short days. Only small amounts of diffusible gibberellins were obtained from Silene shoot tips (including very young leaves) on short <b>days.</b> However, on <b>long</b> <b>days</b> the diffusible gibberellins increased by as much as 10 -fold after 4 to 6 <b>long</b> <b>days</b> but then declined somewhat after 10 <b>long</b> <b>days.</b> The gibberellins extracted from the shoot tips at the completion of the diffusion period also increased under <b>long</b> <b>days,</b> although the increase was not as large as for the diffusible gibberellins. An A 5 -like gibberellin present in extracts was not detected in diffusates...|$|R

5|$|A {{vote was}} taken after a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> of speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered {{from two to}} seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations {{voted in favor of}} independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E
5|$|Alison {{remembers a}} time when Bruce took her and her {{brothers}} to New York City and stayed in a borrowed Greenwich Village apartment. After a <b>long</b> <b>day,</b> Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings a lullaby ("Pony Girl"). He reassures his daughter that he's just {{going out for a}} paper, but he leaves to go cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce, responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her ("Ring of Keys").|$|E
5|$|In November 2005 the Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival. The {{performance}} was recorded and released as the CD/DVD package At Metro through Victory Records in February 2006. Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, Stay Down, released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became the Smoking Popes' permanent drummer {{prior to the}} album's release. In February 2010 Asian Man Records released the compilation album It's Been a <b>Long</b> <b>Day.</b> The band's sixth studio album, This Is Only a Test, was released March 15, 2011 through Asian Man.|$|E

40|$|An {{inhibitor}} {{extracted from}} short day treated Acer negundo leaves {{was compared to}} abscisic acid in 4 different solvent systems. The chromatographic properties of abscisic acid and the inhibitor were in very close agreement. Treatment of Acer negundo plants under non-hardening preconditions (<b>long</b> <b>days)</b> with either the inhibitor or abscisic acid increased hardiness after a hardening period of 3 weeks at 40 °. A gibberellin-inhibitor relationship was further studied by making comparison of extracts of plants subjected to either 4 weeks of <b>long</b> <b>days,</b> <b>long</b> <b>days</b> + 5 ° nights, or short days. These tests indicated that gibberellin-like activity was greatest when the treatment included <b>long</b> <b>days.</b> Abscisic acid-like levels were highest when the treatments consisted of short <b>days</b> or <b>long</b> <b>days</b> + 5 ° nights. Since the latter groups are the most capable of developing hardiness, the hardening process {{appears to be more}} closely related to a build-up of abscisic acid levels than a reduction of gibberellin levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} visible {{responses of}} spinach plants (Spinacia oleracea L., cv. Savoy Hybrid 612) transferred from short to <b>long</b> <b>days</b> (8 hours of high intensity light supplemented with 16 hours of low intensity illumination from incandescent lamps) were upright leaf orientation and increased elongation of the petioles. The effect of <b>long</b> <b>days</b> on growth rate was direct; i. e., {{there was no}} after-effect if the plants were transferred to short days. Gibberellin A 3 applied to plants under short days had an effect {{similar to that of}} <b>long</b> <b>days,</b> whereas application of the growth retardant AMO- 1618 [2 ′-isopropyl- 4 ′-(trimethylammonium chloride) - 5 ′-methylphenyl piperidinel-carboxylate] under <b>long</b> <b>days</b> caused a growth habit typical of short-day conditions. Gibberellin A 3 caused more stem growth in plants under <b>long</b> <b>days</b> in which the endogenous gibberellin content had been reduced by AMO- 1618 than in plants under short days not treated with the growth retardant...|$|R
5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed into the courtroom. An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a <b>long</b> <b>day.</b> The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E
5|$|Legend has it {{that the}} Cailleach was tired from a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - as seen in the goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} <b>long</b> <b>day</b> illumination and high humidity trigger gonadal growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Long</b> <b>Day's</b> Night is a live DVD by the American {{hard rock}} band Blue Öyster Cult, {{recorded}} in Chicago, Illinois on 21 June 2002. It is {{so named because}} that day was 2002's summer solstice, the <b>longest</b> <b>day</b> of the year.|$|R
40|$|Photoperiod {{is a major}} {{environmental}} factor of regulation of testosterone secretion and testicular volume. The bucks of the control batch (n= 10) remained in a open shelters under natural day light and ambient temperature while the experimental batch (n= 10) were placed in light-proof shelters and were exposed to alternations of 3 months of <b>long</b> <b>days</b> and 3 months of natural photoperiod. In light-treated batch, the photoperiodic changes by <b>long</b> <b>days</b> inhibited the testosterone secretion. Testicular volume was higher during normal <b>days</b> than <b>long</b> <b>days</b> although the amplitude of the variations was reduced compared to control groups. In photoperiod treated batch, testosterone secretion increased after 2 weeks of exposure to normal days and decreased within a 4 weeks after the beginning of exposure to <b>long</b> <b>days...</b>|$|R

5|$|While there aren’t many {{external}} morphological {{differences between}} queens and workers {{there are some}} internal traits that can be signals of a wasp’s social status. It has also been found that caste determination is irreversibly determined by temperature during the immature stages of development. In one experiment, some wasps emerging in June were kept in <b>long</b> <b>day</b> chambers, or chambers set at 26°C with 16 hours of light and 8 hours of darkness. These individuals had larger and more active ovaries as {{compared to those who}} were incubated in short day chambers, which are set at 22°C with 14 hours of light and 10 hours of darkness. It is thought that this phenomenon may occur because of a juvenile hormone secretion that determines the castes and a suppression of the workers’ ovaries by environmental or hormonal factors.|$|E
5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in the bathroom in proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E
5|$|The {{afternoon}} session {{continued with}} further spectator encroachments. After lunch, Bradman set defensive fields {{with the intent}} of restricting the scoring, and used his remaining bowlers in short spells to conserve their energy, expecting a <b>long</b> <b>day</b> in the field. The absence of Toshack also meant Loxton had a substantial workload with the ball. The English batsmen continued to accelerate, and when Bradman finally brought Johnson into the attack, they targeted him. Washbrook hit a straight six from Johnson, and Hutton followed suit to take England from 98 to 104. For the second time in the match, the English openers had put on a century stand, and the shot also brought up Hutton's 50 in 125 minutes. This feat made Hutton and Washbrook the first pair to make century opening partnerships in both innings of a Test on two occasions; they had done this for the first time against Australia in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval in 194647. Bradman replaced Johnson with Lindwall immediately, and Washbrook responded by cutting the paceman for four to reach his half-century. Lindwall responded with two bouncers. Washbrook then hooked one a short ball from Johnston and got a top edge, but Bradman failed to take the catch.|$|E
