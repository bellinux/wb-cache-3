About one-third (36. 5 %) of the donors had biological children of their own. With regard to personality, significant differences were present on harm avoidance, with lower means for sperm donors (P = 0. 002, 95 % CI - 3. 74 to - 0. 85), and on self-directedness and cooperativeness, with higher means for donors (P = 0. 002, 95 % CI 0. 97 - 4. 19; P = 0. 001; 95 % CI 0. 75 - 2. 95, respectively), compared with controls. This indicates that the donors in general feel less worried and suffer less from uncertainty, shyness and fatigability than controls. They also perceive themselves as being autonomous, with a capacity to take responsibility, to behave in a goal-directed manner, to be resourceful and sel-facceptant, and to behave in a manner guided by meaningful values and goals. Furthermore, they describe themselves as being well integrated in humanity or society, and having a good capacity for identification with and acceptance of other people. <b>less</b> thanbrgreater <b>than</b> <b>less</b> thanbrgreater thanConclusions The screening process at the clinics seems to generate a group of stable, mature and well-integrated donors, and this is a promising result for the future.
