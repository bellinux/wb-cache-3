40|$|The lateral spikelets of {{two-rowed barley}} are reduced {{in size and}} sterile, but in six-rowed barley all three spikelets are fully fertile. The trait is largely {{controlled}} by alleles at the vrs 1 locus on chromosome arm 2 HL, as modified by the allele present at the I locus on chromosome arm 4 HS. Molecular markers were developed to saturate the 4 HS region by exploiting expressed sequence-tags, either previously mapped in barley to this region, or present in the syntenic region of rice chromosome 3. Collinearity between rice and barley was strong in the 4. 8 cM interval BJ 468164 –AV 933435 and the 10 cM interval AV 942364 –BJ 455560. A major QTL for <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelet</b> fertility (the I locus) explained 44 % of phenotypic variance, and was located in the interval CB 873567 –BJ 473916. The genotyping of near-isogenic lines for I placed the locus in a region between CB 873567 and EBmac 635, and therefore the most likely position of the I locus was proximal to CB 873567 in a 5. 3 cM interval between CB 873567 –BJ 473916.

40|$|Long-day {{exposure}} of the grass Lolium temulentum may regulate flowering via changes in gibberellin (GA) levels. Therefore, we have examined both GA levels and expression of a MYB transcription factor that is specific to the GA signal transduction pathway in monocots. This MYB gene from L. temulentum shows over 90 % nucleotide identity with the barley and rice GAMYB genes, and, like them, gibberellic acid (GA 3) up-regulates its expression in the seed. Furthermore, cDNAs of both the barley and L. temulentum GAMYB show the same simple patterns of hybridization with digests of L. temulentum genomic DNA. Compared with vegetative shoot apices of L. temulentum, the in situ mRNA expression of LtGAMYB does not change during the earliest steps of “floral” initiation at the apex. However, by 100 h (the double-ridge stage of flowering) its expression increased substantially and was highest in the terminal and <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelet</b> sites. Thereafter, expression declined overall but then increased within stamen primordia. Prior to increased LtGAMYB expression, long-day exposure sufficient to induce flowering led to increased (5 - to 20 -fold) levels of GA 1 and GA 4 in the leaf. Thus, increases first in GA level in the leaf followed by increased expression of LtGAMYB in the apex suggest important signaling and/or response roles in flowering...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe have {{analyzed}} two mutants that exhibit altered panicle {{architecture in}} rice (Oryza sativa L.). In lax 1 - 2, {{which is a}} new and stronger allele of the previously reported lax mutant, initiation and/or maintenance of rachis-branches, lateral spikelets, and terminal spikelets was severely prevented. In situ hybridization analysis using OSH 1, a rice knotted 1 (kn 1) ortholog, confirmed the absence of lateral meristems in lax 1 - 2 panicles. These defects indicate that the LAX 1 gene {{is required for the}} initiation/maintenance of axillary meristems in the rice panicle. In addition to its role in forming lateral meristems, the wild-type LAX 1 gene acts as a floral meristem identity gene which specifies the terminal spikelet meristem. A comparison of the defects in lax 1 - 1 and lax 1 - 2 plants suggested that the sensitivities to reduced LAX 1 activity were not uniform among different types of meristems. In the fzp 2 mutant panicle, the basic branching pattern of the panicle was indistinguishable from that of the wild type; however, specification of both terminal and <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelet</b> meristems was blocked, and sequential rounds of branching occurred {{at the point where the}} spikelet meristems are initiated in the wild-type panicle. This resulted in the generation of a panicle composed of excessive ramification of rachis-branches. The lax 1 - 1 fzp 2 double mutants exhibited a novel, basically additive, phenotype, which suggests that LAX 1 and FZP 2 function in genetically independent pathways...|$|E
50|$|This is a tufting {{perennial}} bunchgrass {{approaching a}} meter in maximum height. It produces compact, narrow inflorescences 8 to 10 centimeters long and purplish in color. Like other barleys the spikelets come in triplets. It has two small, often sterile <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets</b> on pedicels and a larger, fertile central spikelet lacking a pedicel.|$|R
25|$|Spikelets are {{arranged}} in triplets which alternate along the rachis. In wild barley (and other Old World species of Hordeum), only the central spikelet is fertile, while {{the other two are}} reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets</b> to produce six-row barleys. Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, vrs1, is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.|$|R
40|$|Increased seed {{production}} {{has been a}} common goal during the domestication of cereal crops, and early cultivators of barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) selected a phenotype with a six-rowed spike that stably produced three times the usual grain number. This improved yield established barley as a founder crop for the Near Eastern Neolithic civilization. The barley spike has one central and two <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets</b> at each rachis node. The wild-type progenitor (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) has a two-rowed phenotype, with additional, strictly rudimentary, lateral rows; this natural adaptation is advantageous for seed dispersal after shattering. Until recently, {{the origin of the}} six-rowed phenotype remained unknown. In the present study, we isolated vrs 1 (six-rowed spike 1), the gene responsible for the six-rowed spike in barley, by means of positional cloning. The wild-type Vrs 1 allele (for two-rowed barley) encodes a transcription factor that includes a homeodomain with a closely linked leucine zipper motif. Expression of Vrs 1 was strictly localized in the lateral-spikelet primordia of immature spikes, suggesting that the VRS 1 protein suppresses development of the lateral rows. Loss of function of Vrs 1 resulted in complete conversion of the rudimentary <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets</b> in two-rowed barley into fully developed fertile spikelets in the six-rowed phenotype. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the six-rowed phenotype originated repeatedly, at different times and in different regions, through independent mutations of Vrs 1...|$|R
40|$|Background : Pycreus, Kyllinga, and Queenslandiella cluster {{together}} with Cyperus within the Cyperus s. lat. clade, {{one of the}} two large clades in Cypereae. However, in contrast with Cyperus, they have laterally flattened pistils/nutlets. Pycreus, Kyllinga and Queenslandiella form morphologically well circumscribed independent genera. In the context of a broader systematic project to work out a well supported, evolution based taxonomy for Cyperus s. lat., we present in this paper general morphological and developmental data of species of Pycreus in comparison with three species of Cyperus, including C. laevigatus with dorsiventrally flattened nutlets. Approach : Freshly collected material was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). Special attention was given to spikelet and gynoecial development. Results : SE micrographs of all species studied show an indeterminate rachilla with distichously arranged glumes, each subtending a bisexual flower. In spikelets of C. capitatus and P pumilus, the proximal glume sometimes subtends a <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelet</b> instead of a flower. In the species of Pycreus studied, each flower sits in a cavity formed by the growth of the rachilla, which is congenitally fused with the wings of the glume of the higher, alternate flower. Glumes appear successively, each soon forming a flower primordium in its axil, which develops according to a general cyperoid ontogenetic pattern. In Pycreus, the stigma branches grow out from dorsiventrally positioned primordia. During gynoecium development, a hypogynous stalklet (gynophore) appears in all species studied. Conclusion : In spikelets of Pycreus, the rachilla and wings of the glumes are congenitally fused and consequently develop with epicaulescent displacements of the glumes resulting in typical spikelets with flowers in cavities. In spikelets of Cyperus, a similar though less pronounced development results in spikelets with zigzagging rachilla. The particular positions of the stigma branches in C. laevigatus and Pycreus are explained by the development of the gynoecium from an annular primordium, which facilitates shifts in localisation of the stigma primordia. Though we consider the combination of the typical spikelet ontogeny and the independently originated laterally flattened nutlets to be strong arguments in favour of a genus Pycreus, a phylogenetic confirmation that the taxon is monophyletic is an absolute, until now unfulfilled, condition. Moreover, the consequences for the giant genus Cyperus must be taken in consideration...|$|E

Methods Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used to examine spikelets of 106 species from 33 cyperoid genera. Results Ontogenetic data presented allow a consistent cyperoid spikelet model to be defined. Scanning and light microscopic images in controversial taxa such as Schoenus nigricans, Cariceae and Cypereae are interpreted accordingly. Conclusions Spikelets in all species studied consist of an indeterminate rachilla, and one to many spirally to distichously arranged glumes, each subtending a flower or empty. <b>Lateral</b> <b>spikelets</b> are subtended by a bract and have a spikelet prophyll. In distichously organized spikelets, combined concaulescence of the flowers and epicaulescence (a newly defined metatopic displacement) of the glumes has caused interpretational controversy in the past. In Cariceae, the male (co) florescences are terminal spikelets. Female single-flowered spikelets are positioned proximally on the rachis. To explain both this and the secondary spikelets in some Cypereae, the existence of an ontogenetic switch determining the development of a primordium into flower, or lateral axis is postulated...|$|R

40|$|The complex {{nature of}} crop genomes has long {{prohibited}} the efficient isolation of agronomically relevant genes. However, {{recent advances in}} next-generation sequencing technologies provide new ways to accelerate fine-mapping and gene isolation in crops. We used RNA sequencing of allelic six-rowed spike 3 (vrs 3) mutants with altered spikelet development for gene identification and functional analysis in barley (Hordeum vulgare). Variant calling in two allelic vrs 3 mutants revealed that VRS 3 encodes a putative histone Lys demethylase with a conserved zinc finger and Jumonji C and N domain. Sanger sequencing of this candidate gene in independent allelic vrs 3 mutants revealed a series of mutations in conserved domains, thus confirming our candidate as the VRS 3 gene and suggesting that the row type in barley is determined epigenetically. Global transcriptional profiling in developing shoot apical meristems of vrs 3 suggested that VRS 3 acts as a transcriptional activator of the row-type genes VRS 1 (Hv. HOMEOBOX 1) and INTERMEDIUM-C (INT-C; Hv. TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1). Comparative transcriptome analysis of the row-type mutants vrs 3, vrs 4 (Hv.

40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The small {{primarily}} Australian commelinid monocot family Centrolepidaceae displays remarkably high structural {{diversity that}} has been hitherto relatively poorly explored. Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges. METHODS: We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution. KEY RESULTS: Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous phyllotaxy on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets.</b> Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Ontogenetic changes in phyllotaxy differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of phyllotaxy in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents {{the boundary between the}} bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological-misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event. Centrolepidaceae offer good perspectives for studies of evolutionary developmental biology. Dmitry D. Sokoloff, Margarita V. Remizowa, Matthew D. Barrett, John G. Conran, and Paula J. Rudal...|$|R
40|$|A typical barley (Hordeum vulgare) floret {{consists}} of reproductive organs three stamens and a pistil, and non-reproductive organs-lodicules and two floral bracts, abaxial called 'lemma' and adaxial 'palea'. The floret is subtended by two additional bracts called outer or empty glumes. Together these organs form the basic structural {{unit of the}} grass inflorescence, a spikelet. There are commonly three spikelets at each rachis (floral stem of the barley spike) node, one central and two <b>lateral</b> <b>spikelets.</b> Rare naturally occurring or induced phenotypic variants that contain a third bract subtending the central spikelets have been described in barley. The gene responsible for this phenotype was called the THIRD OUTER GLUME 1 (Trd 1). The Trd 1 mutants fail to suppress bract growth {{and as a result}} produce leaf-like structures that subtend each rachis node in the basal portion of the spike. Also, floral development at the collar is not always suppressed. In rice and maize, recessive mutations in NECK LEAF 1 (Nl 1) and TASSEL SHEATH 1 (Tsh 1) genes, respectively, {{have been shown to be}} responsible for orthologous phenotypes. Fine mapping of the trd 1 phenotype in an F- 3 recombinant population enabled us to position on the long arm of chromosome 1 H to a 10 cM region. We anchored this to a conserved syntenic region on rice chromosome Os 05 and selected a set of candidate genes for validation by resequencing PCR amplicons from a series of independent mutant alleles. This analysis revealed that a GATA transcription factor, recently proposed to be Trd 1, contained mutations in 10 out of 14 independent trd 1 mutant alleles that would generate non-functional TRD 1 proteins. Together with genetic linkage data, we confirm the identity of Trd 1 as the GATA transcription factor ortholog of rice Nl 1 and maize Tsh 1 genes...|$|R
40|$|TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL 1) -like {{genes are}} highly conserved in plants and {{are thought to}} {{function}} in the maintenance of meristem indeterminacy. Recently, we described six maize (Zea mays) TFL 1 -related genes, named ZEA CENTRORADIALIS 1 (ZCN 1) to ZCN 6. To gain insight into their functions, we generated transgenic maize plants overexpressing their respective cDNAs driven by a constitutive promoter. Overall, ectopic expression of the maize TFL 1 -like genes produced similar phenotypes, including delayed flowering and altered inflorescence architecture. We observed an apparent relationship between {{the magnitude of the}} transgenic phenotypes and the degree of homology between the ZCN proteins. ZCN 2, - 4, and - 5 form a monophylogenetic clade, and their overexpression produced the strongest phenotypes. Along with very late flowering, these transgenic plants produced a “bushy” tassel with increased <b>lateral</b> branching and <b>spikelet</b> density compared with nontransgenic siblings. On the other hand, ZCN 1, - 3, and - 6 produced milder effects. Among them, ZCN 1 showed moderate effects on flowering time and tassel morphology, whereas ZCN 3 and ZCN 6 did not change flowering time but still showed effects on tassel morphology. In situ hybridizations of tissue from nontransgenic plants revealed that the expression of all ZCN genes was associated with vascular bundles, but each gene had a specific spatial and temporal pattern. Expression of four ZCN genes localized to the protoxylem, whereas ZCN 5 was expressed in the protophloem. Collectively, our findings suggest that ectopic expression of the TFL 1 -like genes in maize modifies flowering time and inflorescence architecture through maintenance of the indeterminacy of the vegetative and inflorescence meristems...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{response}} of cultivars of winter wheat to foliar applications of urea was examined for grain protein content, yield, and kernel hardness. The objectives {{of this study}} were to measure the effect of urea on these three traits in diverse environments and to explain how potential responses could occur by (1) determining potential uptake of N 15 labelled urea from foliar application under greenhouse conditions using different cultivars, light duration, and soil fertility levels; (2) analyzing immature spike samples collected following foliar applications in the field during the flowering period; and (3) examining grain from primary and secondary tillers and from central and <b>lateral</b> florets within <b>spikelets.</b> Foliar applications significantly increased grain protein content over the control and standard topdressing treatment in most cultivars. For example, for a single cultivar at the Hyslop location in 1979 - 1980, protein percents of 11. 18, 12. 22, and 13. 60 were obtained for the control, standard topdressing, and foliar urea treatments respectively. Generally, foliar applications of urea failed to increase grain yield over the control, and yield was significantly below the standard topdressing treatment. However, the combination of topdressed nitrogen with foliar sprays produced yields equal to topdressing alone while significantly increasing protein. Mean yields at the Wasco location of the topdressing treatment and the combination of topdressing and one foliar application were 4. 05 and 4. 04 T/ha, whereas the grain protein content averaged 9. 34 and 10. 45 percent respectively. Foliar applications of urea did not significantly alter kernel hardness. Significant cultivar x nitrogen treatment interactions were found for protein, yield, and hardness, and split applications of foliar nitrogen did not significantly change these results. A potential uptake of 29. 2 to 61. 4 percent of actual foltar applications was found with N 15 labelled urea in a greenhouse experiment. A significant effect for light duration was observed with recovery values of 41. 4 and 46. 6 percent for 12 and 18 hour photo-periods respectively. The varieties Stephens and Centurk had a significant difference in uptake of 48. 1 and 39. 9 percent recovery respectively. Following urea sprays which were initially applied at the heading stage, nitrogen treatment differences were found within three weeks after anthesis. The ranking of treatments from immature spike analysis corresponded to grain protein analysis at harvest. Nitrogen treatments did not change the protein or hardness levels disproportionately for mature spikes in comparing grain from primary and secondary tillers or from central and lateral florets within the spikelets...|$|R
