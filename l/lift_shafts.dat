5|$|The CLR and BSWR had {{separate}} surface {{buildings and}} <b>lift</b> <b>shafts.</b> The station buildings, which remain today as exits from the station, were built on very confined plots {{on either side}} of Argyll Street {{on the south side of}} Oxford Street, just east of the circus itself. The stations as originally built were entirely separate, but connecting passages were soon provided at platform level. The surviving Central London Railway building to the east of Argyll Street is the best surviving example of stations designed by Harry Bell Measures, and the Bakerloo line building to the west is a classic Leslie Green structure. Both are Grade II listed since 20 July 2011.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of the shafts was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} public–private {{partnership}} {{arrangement for}} maintenance of the London Underground, the station was due to be refurbished by Metronet. Following the collapse of Metronet, responsibility of station upkeep was transferred to Transport for London in 2008. Works were planned to include provision of tactile strips and colour contrasted handrails for the visually impaired, installation of closed-circuit television cameras, passenger help points, new electronic departure information displays on the platforms, a new public address system, and improved lighting. Transport for London has assigned the station to the 'limited works' category and plans to complete these improvements incrementally, according {{to the need to}} preserve assets. The station does not have step free access from the platforms to the street, although there are two out of use <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> from the platforms to the booking hall.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{studies on}} a recent large {{high-rise}} building fire in Hong Kong are reported. Preliminary studies suggested that a <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> under refurbishment {{with all of its}} doors removed was the key factor in the fire spreading. This point is investigated in this paper by simulating the fire environment using a fire-zone model and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Different scenarios with a fire starting at the <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> and also starting at a higher level were considered. Five sets of zone-model simulations and three sets of CFD simulations were performed. The importance of providing a lift lobby was demonstrated. It is further confirmed that this <b>lift</b> <b>shaft</b> would create many problems. A <b>lift</b> <b>shaft,</b> even undergoing refurbishment, should not have its doors kept opened.

25|$|The present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane (formerly Colombo Court) {{behind the}} old {{building}} was constructed between 2002 and 2005. Occupying , {{it was designed}} by British architectural firm Foster and Partners and local architectural consultants CPG Corporation. The building is clad in translucent sheets of Portuguese rosa aurora marble. The liberal use of glass in atria, skylights and <b>lift</b> <b>shafts,</b> and the open layout of the building, are said to signify the ideal of transparency in the law. Operations in the building started on 20 June 2005, the first hearings took place on 27 June, and the building was officially opened by President S.R. Nathan at the Opening of the Legal Year ceremony on 7 January 2006. There are 12 civil courts, eight criminal courts and three appellate courts. High Court hearings take place in courtrooms on the second through sixth storeys, while the Court of Appeal is on the ninth storey, the highest level, in a disc-shaped structure that is a modern interpretation of the Old Supreme Court Building's dome and is intended to represent the impartiality of justice.|$|E

The music video for The Prodigy's song [...] "Firestarter" [...] was filmed in the disused eastern tunnel and one of the unused <b>lift</b> <b>shafts.</b> The station was the subject of an episode of Most Haunted in 2002.|$|E
500|$|The building's design {{complements}} many existing construction techniques with, {{what were}} considered at the time, radical solutions. The warehouses {{are supported by}} large load-bearing walls that range from being [...] thick at the base to [...] on the fourth level. One of the most advanced architectural features {{is the use of}} stressed skin roofing, which at the time of construction was virtually unheard of. Huge iron trusses are crossed with rivetted and galvanised wrought iron plates, creating a shape similar to an upturned boat hull that acts to support the roof above. The floors in the warehouses are supported by large iron columns and the spaces between were considered 'highly flexible', as new windows, stairwells and <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> could be added without risk to the building's structural integrity.|$|E

500|$|Working {{within this}} brief, they {{selected}} a triangular cross-section {{of the tower}} because it lent [...] "itself to open plan office layouts" [...] by allowing natural light to reach {{most parts of the}} working floors. Also, the stepped front of the building maximised the number of corner offices on each floor. The eastern and northern sides of the building are slip-formed concrete shear walls, and have fewer windows. These sides house the services of the building, including the <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> and stairwells. Some difficulty was encountered in the design stage with how to execute the diagonal slopes forming the top of these walls alongside the top five floors of the building, since a standard concrete pour was not possible. Instead, reinforced concrete panels were prefabricated elsewhere and subsequently attached to the structure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{focus of}} the Army's {{fortification}} efforts was initially on the outer forts at Coalhouse Point, Cliffe and Shornemead, {{and it was not}} until January 1868 that instructions were issued by the War Office to reconstruct Tilbury and New Tavern Forts. The existing magazines and ramparts were demolished and new brick emplacements were built, on which were mounted ten 9-inch and one 12-inch RML guns capable of ranges of up to [...] Seven of the emplacements were protected by iron shields. The ramparts were extensively remodelled to accommodate new magazines, which were connected via <b>lift</b> <b>shafts</b> to serving rooms adjoining the emplacements. Colonel (later General) Charles George Gordon, who was to become famous for his death in the Siege of Khartoum in 1885, lived in Fort House in the grounds of the fort between 1865-71 while he was overseeing the project.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} awarded a £6 million grant in November 2015 from Birmingham City Council and the GBSLEP, of which £4 million will be repayable subject to {{commercial}} success of the hotel.

[...] The exterior elevations were clad in non-loadbearing ox-blood red (sang de boeuf) glazed terracotta (faïence) blocks, provided by the Leeds Fireclay Company. [...] The ground floor was divided into wide bays by columns, allowing separate entrances and exits, and also providing space for retail outlets. [...] The design also featured large semi-circular windows at first floor level (occasionally with circular occuli) and a heavy dentilated cornice above. [...] A broad strip between the two floors announced the name of the station in capital letters. [...] The station buildings were constructed with flat roofs with the deliberate aim of encouraging commercial office development above, another benefit of the load-bearing structural steel frame.|$|E
