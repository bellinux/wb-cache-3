5000|$|Gastric {{adenocarcinoma}} is {{a malignant}} epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are overwhelmingly adenocarcinomas (90%). Histologically, {{there are two}} major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma ("back to back" [...] aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically [...] "empty" [...] spaces). It is poorly differentiated. If the mucus remains inside the tumour cell, it pushes the nucleus to the periphery: [...] "signet-ring cell".|$|E
40|$|Primary gastric {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} common cause of <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica.</b> Less frequently, metastatic gastric cancer from the breast, omental metastases and non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the stomach have been reported to show similar radiographic findings as for <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica.</b> A metastatic gastric cancer from bladder cancer is extremely rare.

40|$|Gastric <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> is a diffuse type {{of cancer}} which is characterised by a {{thickening}} and rigidity {{of the stomach}} wall.

40|$|Abstract. Metastases to the {{gastrointestinal}} tract rarely occur {{in breast cancer}} except in invasive lobular carcinoma. The present study reports a rare case of metastatic gastric cancer from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast mimicking primary gastric <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica.</b> A 51 -year-old premenopausal female, who {{had a history of}} partial mastectomy for right breast cancer at the age of 40, was referred to Toyama City Hospital (Toyoma, Japan) for an endoscopic diagnosis of gastric <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica.</b> Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed left hydronephrosis, while peritoneal metastasis and malignant ascites were not detected. Chest CT detected a left lung tumor, which had invaded the left upper bronchus. Biopsy specimens were obtained and the histopathological findings on both the gastric tumor and lung tumor demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, whereas the histology of the original breast cancer was IDC with a solid-tubular type. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the biopsied specimens of the gastric and lung tumors were positive for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR) and negative for human epithelial growth factor receptor- 2 (HER 2). These molecular characteristics indicated the case was metastatic gastric carcinoma from the breast cancer with lung metastasis, since the statuses of ER, PgR and HER 2 were concordant with those of the original breast cancer. However, the possibility of primary gastric cancer could not be completely ruled out. Therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed for the purpose of both diagnosis and treatment. Pathological examination of the resected specimen provided a definite diagnosis of multiple metastatic gastric carcinomas from the breast. To the best of our knowledge, metastatic gastric cancer derived from the breast presenting as <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> 11 years following the surgical removal of IDC has not been described previously...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dissemination {{of cancer}} {{cells in the}} {{abdominal}} cavity may lead to peritoneal carcinomatosis, a common event in the <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> type of gastric carcinoma. Reverse trans-criptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a sensitive technique for detecting these cells. Methods: Peritoneal washings were obtained during laparotomy from 47 consecutive <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> patients who preoperatively were considered candidates for curative resection. Together with conventional cytological examination using Papanicolaou staining, real-time RT-PCR was performed to quantitate prospectively carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA in these washings. Samples above a cutoff value for CEA mRNA were considered positive for molecular detection of disseminated cancer cells. Results: Conventional cytological examination was positive in 43 % (20 / 47). Positivity of CEA mRNA was much higher at 83 % (39 / 47) and peritoneal carcinomatosis actually was observed in 77 % (36 / 47), either at laparotomy or during postoperative follow-up. Although only two of eight patients who were negative for CEA mRNA suffered from peritoneal carcinomatosis, three more patients died of recurrences through other metastatic pathways. Multivariate analysis revealed that curability of the operation (knowledge of the CEA mRNA values excluded) and Tcategorie...|$|E

30|$|Signet ring {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} type of rectal carcinoma, {{similar to}} the mucinous type in having a mucinous component, but with more aggressive behaviour {{in the form of}} a more advanced stage of initial diagnosis, more lymphatic and local spread and poor response to surgery. The most common imaging features are long segment of concentric wall thickening and a target appearance similar to those of metastatic <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> consisting of thickened inner (mucosa and submucosa) and outer (serosa) layers and a relatively thin hypoattenuated middle layer (muscularis propria), or bowel wall thickening with homogeneous attenuation [28 – 30].|$|E

40|$|Definition. <b>Linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> {{is a term}} {{designating}} clinically a skiagraphic and, in the post-mortem room, a gross {{contraction of}} the stomach, caused most frequently by a fibrosing cancer, occasionally by syphilis, and, possibly, in rare cases, by a simple inflammatory process. The fibrosis involves chiefly the submucosa and {{to a less extent}} the other layers, sometimes extending to the connective tissue in the region bordering on the stomach. Synonyms. There are no fewer than forty-two names for this condition. Arranged in chronological order they a r e: hypertrophy of the mucous membrane (Andral 1829 (1)); hypertrophy with induration and hyper-trophic stenosis of the pylorus (Cruveilhier 1835 (24)); hypertrophy of the stomach (Hare 1853 (57)); fibroid induration (Jones 1855 (73)); sclerosis ventriculi (Snellen 1856 - 7 (124)); cirrhosis of stomach (Brinton 1857) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> is a {{gastric cancer}} of diffuse histotype that {{presents}} in the fundic gland area, and is char-acterized by thickening {{of the stomach}} wall and deformation of the stomach, resulting in a leather bottle-like appearance. A 66 -year-old female was admitted to Kagawa University Hospital (Kagawa, Japan) with epigastric pain. X-ray examination revealed reduced gastric distension and defor-mation of the stomach, which exhibited a leather bottle-like appearance. Endoscopy indicated a depressed lesion in the gastric antrum, and abnormal folds, which crossed to form a waffle‑like appearance in the upper gastric body. Analysis of biopsy specimens from the depressed lesion revealed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Morphological changes in the gastric folds indicated that the tumor had invaded the upper gastric body, therefore, a total gastrectomy was performed. Subsequent pathological findings demonstrated that the tumor had spread from the primary lesion to the upper gastric body. Therefore, the present report recommends that the diagnosis of the spread of linitis plastica-type gastric cancer should include assessments of the primary lesion, as well as evaluation of morphological changes in the gastric folds...|$|E

40|$|Gastric cancer (GC) is {{the second}} {{leading cause of death}} from cancer worldwide, with 5 -year {{survival}} rate for about 20 % of the affected individuals. Although there is a decrease in the intestinal-type GC (IGC), the incidence of diffuse-type is still increasing, and its progression is notoriously aggressive. Clinically, diffuse GCs (DGCs) propensity for invasion into adjacent tissue, with prominent stromal induction, which presents with <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica,</b> peritoneal implantation and remote metastasis, ends up in dismal prognosis, and translates into poor quality of life. So far, a few molecularly targeted drugs, including HER 2 antagonists, have been developed against GC, but most in treating IGC. Thus, DGC constitutes a poor prognosis subgroup of GC with no known promising therapies. Recent genomic characterization of GC by whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing showed {{that a large number of}} known cancer-related genes are frequently mutated in gastric malignancies.

40|$|AIMS: The {{incidence}} of oesogastric (OG) signet ring cell adenocarcinoma (SRC) is increasing in Western countries. The differential characteristics between oesophageal and gastric SRC tumours are unknown. We aimed {{to investigate the}} role of tumour location on prognosis in OG SRC. METHODS: Among 924 OG SRC resected in 21 centres from 1997 to 2010, consecutive patients who had oesophageal tumours (group OESO, n = 136) were matched to randomly selected patients who had gastric tumours (group GASTRIC, n = 363). Matching variables were gender, age, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, malnutrition, pretherapeutic clinical TNM stage and neoadjuvant treatment. Patients and tumour characteristics were compared between groups and prognostic factors were identified. RESULTS: The two groups were well matched. Tumours in group GASTRIC were more advanced at surgical exploration, with higher rates of <b>linitis</b> <b>plastica</b> (P 0. 480). Recurrences were more frequently distant (P < 0. 001) and peritoneal (P < 0. 001) in group GASTRIC. After adjustment on confounding variables, gastric location (P = 0. 034) was independently associated with a better prognosis than oesophageal location. CONCLUSION: Gastric and oesophageal SRC tumours are distinct diseases.
