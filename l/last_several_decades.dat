5|$|It is {{considered}} a threatened species in the Åland Islands of Finland. A study of the species' distribution in Sweden reported that in the 1940s and 50s, it grew in beech woods with broad-leaved grasses and herbs in topsoils with soil pH levels between 5.0 and 6.6, but the populations have since decreased owing to soil acidification during the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> Fruit bodies collected near arsenic-contaminated sites {{have been shown to}} bioaccumulate arsenic, largely in the form of arsenobetaine.|$|E
5|$|Five Points {{is a small}} {{commercial}} district {{centered on}} and around the five-way intersection between Park, Lomax, and Margaret Streets. The area was originally residential, but transitioned to commercial uses after World War I and several retail buildings were constructed. The Park Arcade Building, an Italian Renaissance revival structure with storefronts marked by variant rooflines, set the architectural tone for the district when it was completed in 1928. Other notable features include Sun-Ray Cinema, formerly Riverside Theater, which opened in 1927 as the first movie theater in Florida equipped to show talking pictures. Over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> Five Points has become known for its edgy, bohemian character and many independent shops, restaurants and businesses.|$|E
5|$|While Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) is away at an {{emergency}} Federation conference, the Enterprise crew discovers an ancient space capsule from Earth. Inside they find three humans in cryonic chambers. Lt. Cdr. Data (Brent Spiner) asks {{to move the}} chambers to the Enterprise and Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) agrees. Picard returns and orders the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone, as several Federation outposts near {{the edges of the}} zone have not responded to communications. He explains that the conference was about the potential threat of the Romulans, who have not been seen for the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> As Data and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) work to thaw the cryonically preserved humans, Picard admonishes Data for bringing them aboard during a crucial time, and puts Riker in charge of looking after them.|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of the Liao dynasty in 1125 {{following}} the Jurchen invasion, many Khitans followed Yelu Dashi's group westward to establish the Qara Khitai or Western Liao dynasty in Central Asia, which <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> before being consumed by the Mongol Empire in 1218.|$|R
50|$|By 1990, Asimov's {{remained}} the major news-stand market, but a {{diverse array of}} predominantly US-based small press markets had developed, many <b>lasting</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> and many choosing purely electronic publication post-2000. This is in common with mainstream written poetry in the US over this time.|$|R
50|$|The Ustaše {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Harry Turtledove's short alternate history story, Ready for the Fatherland. It plays a brief background role in In the Presence of Mine Enemies, an unrelated work by the same author. In both these works, the regime founded by Pavelić <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> beyond the 1940s.|$|R

25|$|While the {{offshore}} wind industry has grown {{dramatically over the}} <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> especially in Europe, {{there is still a}} great deal of uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment.|$|E
25|$|Right Whales were {{historically}} hunted in the Commander Islands heavily {{where only}} a handful of sightings are made in recent years, however, encounters with this species around the Commander Islands and off eastern Kamchatka seems to occur on a more regular basis compared to the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
50|$|This theory {{suggests}} that the Sea Peoples were populations from the city states of the Greek Mycenaean civilization, who destroyed {{each other in a}} disastrous series of conflicts <b>lasting</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> There would have been few or no external invaders and just a few excursions outside the Greek-speaking part of the Aegean civilization.|$|R
50|$|When Bernhard died around 1365, {{his widow}} {{initially}} gave his inheritance to Otto VI of Tecklenburg, {{the husband of}} her eldest daughter. In 1366, she revoked this gift and transferred the territory to her nephew Simon III. Otto VI, however, objected and started a feud which <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> and was finally resolved in favour of the Tecklenburg family.|$|R
50|$|After {{an absence}} <b>lasting</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> the French President Nicolas Sarkozy {{confirmed}} that France will rejoin the NATO integrated command. France {{has also been}} a lead nation, alongside the United States, Great Britain and Italy in implementing the UN sponsored no-fly zone in Libya (NATO Odyssey Dawn), deploying 20 fighter aircraft to Benghazi in defense of rebel held positions and the civilian population.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, Christian Science churches sprang up in {{communities}} around the world, though in the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> of that century, there was a marked decline in membership, except in Africa, where there has been growth. Headquartered in Boston, the church reports a worldwide membership of about 85,000.|$|E
25|$|University {{students}} have significantly increased their consumption of Fair Trade products over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> Women college {{students have}} a more favorable attitude than men toward buying Fair Trade products and they feel more morally obligated to do so. Women are also reported to have stronger intentions to buy fair trade products. When {{it comes to the}} intentions to buy Fair Trade products, gender had no direct effect.|$|E
25|$|Several {{blocks to}} the south, along Liberty Street, is another site of major {{historical}} interest — the Hasbrouck House, today preserved as Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site owing to its use for that purpose during {{the last years of}} the Revolutionary War. To the north the area becomes more residential but still includes some of the city's older and larger homes, although some have been allowed to deteriorate in the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ghallūghārā's not pogroms in {{the sense}} of the killing of masses of defenceless people. Since the martyrdom of the fifth Sikh Guru, Guru Arjan Dev in 1606, Sikhs wielded arms in self-defense. The first {{holocaust}} was a program during the Afghan provincial government's campaign to wipe out the Sikhs, an offensive that had begun during the Mughal Empire and <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|R
50|$|Firstly Sebastian {{had married}} to his cousin Princess Maria Amalia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies but the marriage, which <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> {{remained}} childless.When widowed {{at the age of}} 50, he remarried on 19 November 1860, this time to his cousin Infanta Maria Cristina of Spain, the niece of his first wife and two decades his junior. They produced three surviving sons, who were each granted their own dukedoms.|$|R
50|$|Landsat 5 {{significantly}} exceeded its designed life expectancy, <b>lasting</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> {{beyond its}} original three-year mission. Contributing to Landsat 5's longevity was {{the presence of}} extra fuel for possible future retrieval by the Space Shuttle. If the need arose, Landsat 5 could use the extra fuel {{to move into a}} lower orbit. Instead, the extra fuel was used to maintain its existing orbit as long as practicable.|$|R
25|$|The Kobuk River Basin is very {{sensitive}} to changes in climate. Arctic climates have warmed at approximately twice the global rate in the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> Records of air-temperature from 1961 to 1990 logged at the latitudes of the Kobuk River, show a warming trend of about 1.4°F (0.78°C) per decade. The warming has been the strongest {{in the winter and}} spring months. Climate change is presently considered the most severe environmental stress in the Kobuk River Basin and throughout Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the pure}} science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to {{distinguish}} it from applied optical sciences, which {{are referred to as}} optical engineering. Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms that mean slightly different things {{in different parts of the}} world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> due to advances in laser technology.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} Arctic sea ice, both in extent and thickness, over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> is further {{evidence}} for rapid climate change. Sea ice is frozen seawater that floats {{on the ocean}} surface. It covers millions of square miles in the polar regions, varying with the seasons. In the Arctic, some sea ice remains year after year, whereas almost all Southern Ocean or Antarctic sea ice melts away and reforms annually. Satellite observations show that Arctic sea ice is now declining {{at a rate of}} 13.3 percent per decade, relative to the 1981 to 2010 average.|$|E
25|$|Construction on {{the first}} walls of Brussels is {{estimated}} to {{have been at the}} beginning of the 13th century, under the reign of Henry I, the first duke of Brabant. The beginning and end dates are not clear, but construction would have <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b> On the other hand, from historical maps and other documents that have been preserved, the precise former course of the walls is known.|$|R
50|$|A {{fight for}} {{dominance}} broke out immediately {{between the three}} nationalist movements. The events prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens, creating up to 300,000 destitute Portuguese refugees—the retornados. The new Portuguese government attempted to mediate an understanding between the three competing movements, which they initially agreed to, but later failed and resulted in a devastating civil war which <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> claiming millions of lives and producing many refugees until ending in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{struggle}} of wills <b>lasted</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> involved two proposed dam sites and finally concluded with Red River's {{entry into the}} National Wild and Scenic River system on December 3, 1993. President Bill Clinton signed the declaration into law which provides federal protection for a 19.4 mi section of the river. This effectively eliminated any further possibility of a dam being constructed and preserved the Red River and its Gorge as they exist today.|$|R
25|$|There {{has been}} an exegetical trend during the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> to draw endless {{parallels}} to text from the ancient Near East and beyond {{in an attempt to}} validate the writings in the Book of Mormon and Pearl of Great Price. The pioneer and leader in this effort has been the great LDS scholar Hugh Nibley. In recent years the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS) has continued this legacy. The number of parallels that Nibley has been able to uncover from amazingly disparate and arcane sources is truly staggering. Unfortunately, {{there seems to be a}} neglect of any methodological reflection or articulation in this endeavor.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{society has}} changed rapidly over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> {{coinciding with the}} wider European trend of declining {{fertility}} and rapid aging. The fertility rate of 1.41 is below replacement levels {{and is one of}} the lowest in the world, subsequently leading to an increase in the median age to 44.2 years, the seventh-highest in the world. In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger. By 2016, the proportion of the population age 65 and older rose to 20.68 percent, while those age 14 and younger declined to slightly below 14 percent.|$|E
25|$|Somalis have old {{visual art}} traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, {{affluent}} urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers {{to work on}} their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the mihrabs and pillars of ancient Somali mosques. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially woodwork, was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as spoons, combs and bowls. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the aqal. In the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture have given way to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, Wedgwood {{residents}} formed Wedgwood Community Club, which <b>lasted</b> for <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> {{but eventually}} petered out. In the 1980s this vacuum was filled {{by the current}} Wedgwood Community Council.|$|R

50|$|The geoarchaeologist Eberhard Zangger has {{proposed}} {{the hypothesis that}} Atlantis {{was in fact the}} city state of Troy. He both agrees and disagrees with Rainer W. Kühne: He too believes that the Trojans-Atlanteans were the sea peoples, but only a minor part of them. He proposes that all Greek speaking city states of the Aegean civilization or Mycenae constituted the sea peoples and that they destroyed each other's economies in a series of semi-fratricidal wars <b>lasting</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|R
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> other {{academic}} buildings have been built south of the Eastman Quad, including Meliora Hall (1972), Hoyt Hall (1962), Harkness Hall (1946), Gavett Hall (dedicated with the Eastman Quad in 1930), and the Hopeman Engineering Building (1963). The southernmost part of the River Campus contains the new Science and Engineering Quadrangle: Wilmot Building (1961), Hylan Building (1971), Hutchison Hall (1972), the Computer Studies Building and Carlson Library (1987), the Robert B. Goergen Hall for Biomedical Engineering and Optics (2007), and Wegmans Hall housing the Goergen Institute for Data Science (2017). LeChase Hall (2013) and the Ronald Rettner Hall for Media Arts and Innovation (2013) were added {{to the north of the}} Eastman Quad on the Wilson Quadrangle behind Lattimore Hall and Morey Hall, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{first line}} of {{evidence}} {{is based on a}} physical understanding of how greenhouse gases trap heat, how the climate system responds to increases in greenhouse gases, and how other human and natural factors influence climate. The second line of evidence is from indirect estimates of climate changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years. These records are obtained from living things and their remains (like tree rings and corals) and from physical quantities (like the ratio between lighter and heavier isotopes of oxygen in ice cores), which change in measurable ways as climate changes. The lesson from these data is that global surface temperatures over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> are clearly unusual, in that they were higher than at any time during at least the past 400 years. For the Northern Hemisphere, the recent temperature rise is clearly unusual in at least the last 1,000 years (see graph opposite).|$|E
25|$|In European {{countries}} which were most profoundly {{influenced by the}} Reformation, Protestantism still remains the most practiced religion. These include the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. In other historical Protestant strongholds such as Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Latvia, Estonia and Hungary, it {{remains one of the}} most popular religions. Although Czech Republic was the site of one of the most significant pre-reformation movements, there are only few Protestant adherents; mainly due to historical reasons like persecution of Protestants by the Catholic Habsburgs, restrictions during the Communist rule, and also the ongoing secularization. Over the <b>last</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> religious practice has been declining as secularization has increased. According to a 2012 study about Religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer, Protestants made up 12% of the EU population. According to Pew Research Center, Protestants constituted nearly one fifth (or 17.8%) of the continent's Christian population in 2010. Clarke and Beyer estimate that Protestants constituted 15% of all Europeans in 2009, while Noll claims that less than 12% of them lived in Europe in 2010.|$|E
