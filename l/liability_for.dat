5|$|Part IV {{of the act}} {{covers the}} {{delegation}} of powers to agents, and the trustees <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> their acts. This {{is an area that}} has long been criticised by practitioners and academics, particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925. The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith, and gave them no <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the agent's acts. In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> an agent's acts if he acted in good faith, which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness.|$|E
5|$|UBS {{set aside}} {{approximately}} US$2 billion in expected <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> alleged charges in currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the fraud {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the fraud theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E

5|$|In September 1999 Swissair, Delta, and Boeing (who had {{acquired}} McDonnell Douglas through a merger in 1997) agreed to share <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> {{the accident and}} offered {{the families of the}} passengers financial compensation. The offer was rejected in favour of a $19.8billion suit against Swissair and DuPont, the supplier of the Mylar insulation sheathing. A US federal court dismissed the claim in February 2002.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> using the technique in the finished game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|In 1918 Davies {{sought the}} {{position}} of miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was William Mainwaring, later a long-serving Labour MP for Rhondda East—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the agent was to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal {{the extent to which}} he was concerned with cases where the mining companies denied <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> underground injuries.|$|E

5|$|In 2012 federal {{prosecutors}} reviewed evidence that Jackson faced potential criminal <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> misuse of her husband's campaign funds; allegedly {{she and the}} Congressman used campaign funds to decorate their Washington, DC home. Jackson resigned from Chicago City Council, effective January 15, 2013. On February 15, 2013 Jackson agreed to a plea deal. On February 20, 2013, Jackson plead guilty to one count of filing false tax returns after neglecting to declare nearly $580,000 in income.|$|E
5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive {{remuneration}} for work done as a trustee. It sets a new duty of care, both objective and standard, massively extends the trustees' power of investment and limits the trustees' <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the actions of agents, also providing for their remuneration for work done {{in the course of the}} trust.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 proved {{insufficient}} in its {{objective of}} encouraging privately built and run nuclear reactors. A series of accidents with research reactors, including partial core meltdowns, made private companies cautious, and reluctant {{to become involved}} with nuclear energy without protection from liability. This led to the Price–Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act of 1957, which capped private <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> nuclear accidents, while providing for adequate compensations for accident victims.|$|E

5|$|The Defective Premises Act 1972 (c. 35) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} landlords' and builders' <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> poorly {{constructed}} and poorly maintained buildings, {{along with any}} injuries that may result. During the 19th century, the common law principle that a landlord could not be liable for letting a poorly maintained house was established, while a long-running principle was that, in practice, builders could not be sued for constructing defective buildings. The courts began to turn against the first principle during the 20th century, imposing several restrictions on the landlord's immunity, but the landlord was still largely free from being sued.|$|E
5|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 (c. 31) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} occupiers' liability. The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> visitors. The Act introduced an element of <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Rockaway Line {{was opened}} on August 26, 1880 by the New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad and {{would later be}} {{operated}} by the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) as its Rockaway Beach Branch. Frequent fires on the line's wooden viaduct across Jamaica Bay between The Raunt and Broad Channel made the line a <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the LIRR. After a fire on May 8, 1950 cut service altogether the bankrupt LIRR sought to sell or abandon the line altogether. The city purchased the southern portion of the line in 1952. The rebuilt IND Rockaway Line opened for subway service on June 26, 1956.|$|E

5|$|The author {{discusses}} influential legal cases {{including a}} judgment involving Compuserve, where {{the court ruled}} that the Internet service provider should be deemed similar to a bookstore avoiding <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> publishing potentially offensive speech. He recounts Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service which followed a raid by the United States Secret Service in 1990 on Steve Jackson Games and his involvement influencing the media relating to the incident. He cites the LaMacchia case, which dealt with charges of copyright infringement of software subsequently dismissed. An incident at Santa Rosa Junior College which involved issues of free speech and gender discrimination is discussed and analyzed in the book.|$|E
5|$|The repairs mainly {{involved}} {{fixing holes}} in the roof and preventing the ingress of rain water, as well as repairing the weatherboards on the sides. The intervention by English Heritage led to a protracted dispute over the £30,000 cost of the repairs that was scheduled to come to trial at the High Court of Justice in April 2012. In January 2012, a settlement was reached in which Harmondsworth Barn Ltd sold the barn to English Heritage for £20,000. By that time the government had abandoned its plans to expand Heathrow Airport and the barn had become a <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{required}} causation may {{be quite}} oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic. The general law on <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not an important point in the case as other charges were brought. Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.|$|E

A 2009 report by the Government Accountability Office uncovered $129 billion in unfunded OPEB liabilities among just 39 large local governments.|$|R
5|$|UBS France {{executive}} Patrick de Fayet {{was among}} three local branch executives being investigated. UBS wealth management bankers allegedly {{broke the law}} by enabling French taxpayers to hide their assets in UBS-controlled offshore assets to avoid paying taxes. The bankers undertook to direct their French clients' assets to UBS's Switzerland operation, rather than keep the money in France. UBS set aside approximately US$2 billion in expected <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> its currency rigging and French tax evasion cases.|$|E
5|$|An initial trial {{concluded}} on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel {{issued a}} summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK {{claimed that the}} duty supervisor {{at the time was}} responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700million.|$|E
5|$|During June and July 1864, Confederate forces {{under the}} command of General Jubal A. Early patrolled the Shenandoah Valley. Early's successes were a {{political}} <b>liability</b> <b>for</b> President Abraham Lincoln, and caused Union leaders to divert resources away from Richmond and West Virginia. Union soldiers from the Army of West Virginia began arriving via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in Martinsburg, West Virginia, on July 19, and had an initial success in the Battle of Rutherford's Farm. A few days later, Early tricked Union General George Crook into believing that Early had sent a large part of his Confederate force to Richmond. The result of this deception was a July 24 Confederate victory near Winchester, Virginia, at the Second Battle of Kernstown. Union troops, in some cases panic stricken, retreated to {{the north side of the}} Potomac River.|$|E
