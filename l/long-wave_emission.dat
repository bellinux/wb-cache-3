40|$|CO 2 is {{the strongest}} {{anthropogenic}} forcing agent for climate change since pre-industrial times. Like other greenhouse gases, CO 2 absorbs terrestrial surface radiation and causes emission from the atmosphere to space. As the surface is generally warmer than the atmosphere, the total <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> to space is commonly less than the surface emission. However, this does not hold true for the high elevated areas of central Antarctica. Our investigations show, that for the high elevated areas of Antarctica the greenhouse effect (GHE) of CO 2 is commonly around zero or even negative. This {{is based on the}} quantification of GHE as the difference between long-wave surface emission and top of atmosphere emission. We demonstrate this behaviour with the help of three models: a simple two-layer model, line-by-line calculations, and an ECMWF experiment. Additionally, in this region an increase in CO 2 concentration leads to an instantaneous increased long-wave energy loss to space, which is a cooling effect on the earth-atmosphere system. However, short-wave warming by the weak absorption of solar radiation by CO 2 are not taken into account here. The reason for this counter-intuitive behaviour is {{the fact that in the}} interior of Antarctica the surface is often colder than the stratosphere above. Radiation from the surface in the atmospheric window emitted to space is then relatively lower compared to radiation in the main CO 2 band around 15 microns, which originates mostly from the stratosphere. Increasing CO 2 concentration leads to increasing emission from the atmosphere to space, while blocking additional portions of surface emission. If the surface is colder than the stratosphere, this leads to additional long-wave energy loss to space for increasing CO 2. Our findings for central Antarctica are in strong contrast to the generally known effect that increasing CO 2 has on the <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> to space, and hence on the Antarctic climate...|$|E

Beside the heat fluxes due to heat conduction through the building component and heat convection from the surrounding air, radiation effects are important as well. Usually only the short-wave radiation heating up the component's surface during the day is taken into account. The <b>long-wave,</b> thermal <b>emission</b> of the component's surface is often neglected. Realistic temperature conditions on the component's surface can not be computed very well this way.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{variability}} of the ocean's thermohaline circulation in a Oceanic General Circulation Model (OGCM) coupled to a two dimensional atmospheric Energy Balance Model (EBM). The EBM calculates air temperatures by balancing heat fluxes, including that from the ocean surface; air temperature and ocean circulation evolve together without imposed temperature restrictions except specification of the solar constant. The heat coupling is scale dependent such that small-scale ocean temperature anomalies are damped quickly while large-scale ones lose heat slowly by <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> to space. These boundary conditions are more realistic than restoring conditions even when weak coupling is used since they allow changes in air temperature and wholesale shifts in the planetary heat balance.

This increased stability arises from the ability of the coupled model to develop [...] ...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} new hygrothermal models, which include long-wave {{radiation}} effects, the temperature drop {{of the surface}} below ambient conditions by <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> at night and the resulting condensation can be calculated for external thermal insulation composite systems (ETICS). The most essential condition for microbial growth (esp. algae or mould) is a sufficient amount of moisture on the surface. Thus, the question to be answered is, whether a hydrophobic coating leading to lower water absorption of the render, is of advantage concerning the risk of microbial growth. With a capillary active render system the condensed water may be drained below the surface and is therefore not available for micro-organisms. Up to now, hygrothermal models can calculate the transient water content in the materials of a building, but not the moisture on the surface. Now a new model is developed and validated with laboratory experiments and field tests. For the future, this new tool will help {{to develop a new}} render with optimal hygric behavior...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{disturbance}} has {{a significant}} impact on hydrology due to its effect on the forest canopy, which is important for precipitation interception, transpiration, site micrometeorology, and snow accumulation and ablation. This study examines the impact of mountain pine beetle infestation and subsequent forest death on snow ablation. Dead stands experience needle loss and canopy reduction due mainly to the loss of small branches and stems, which has a subsequent impact on micrometeorological conditions. Ablation is driven largely by incoming short-wave radiation, which in dead stands is greater than in alive stands, but does not reach that available in clearcuts. <b>Long-wave</b> radiation <b>emission</b> in dead stands is lower than that in alive stands, reducing its contribution to snowpack warming and ablation. Turbulent flux contributions to snow ablation are limited in forest stands relative to clearcuts, although they are slightly greater in dead than alive stands due to the more open forest structure.

30|$|Modern office {{buildings}} often have large glazed areas. Depending on the climate zone, {{incident solar radiation}} on fenestration can lead to high cooling demands during hot periods, although solar radiation can help reduce heating demands during cool periods. Previous {{studies have shown that}} {{a large proportion of the}} net energy demand of an office building is related to window heat loss and cooling demands induced by solar irradiance. Some experts [1] found that, even in what traditionally has been considered to be a heating-dominated climate, cooling demands dominate the net energy demand of an office building. Solar shading systems are vital to reduce the cooling demand of an office building and might also be necessary to reduce glare issues. In the tropics, glazed façade is also the cause of large solar heat gains inside buildings, and researchers [2] are focusing on reducing solar heat (infrared) transmittance and daylight (visible light) transmittance. It was also observed [3] that, in the case of double glazing units (DGU), the use of a solar control film is highly recommended to increase the separation between the sheet glasses. The energy gain was reduced by 55  % compared to the traditional DGU without solar control film. Fixed shading devices (e.g. vertical fins, diagonal fins and egg crate) are used to protect inner spaces from direct solar gain through openings, windows and large glazed surfaces to control air temperature and improve the illuminance level. The results [4] showed that the temperature in offices with shading devices was reduced to an acceptable level compared to offices without shading devices. The visual environment was improved by controlling the illuminance level, improving uniformity and eliminating glare. Other researchers [5] recommend accurately estimating the optical properties of the different types of dynamic shading devices (such as roller blinds and Venetian blinds) and including their effects in the glazing system analysis. The Venetian blind is an interesting solution because it blocks direct solar radiation, whilst enabling the transmission of diffuse radiation indoors. Further progress is inextricable linked to the dynamic control of sunlight and optimal control of solar heat gains, taking into account the variability in the solar radiation spectra incident on the building’s envelope and the variability in outdoor and indoor air temperature differences. Tuning control [6] of glazing’s transmittance dependence on the solar radiation wavelength is required to optimise daylighting with reference to people’s needs (their health and comfort) and energy (thermal and electrical load minimization). However, the energy-saving potential of regulating solar spectrum response properties is greater than that of regulating the <b>long-wave</b> thermal <b>emission</b> property in summer; the trend is reversed in winter [7]. By properly regulating the NIR spectrum transmission and reflection properties and the <b>long-wave</b> thermal <b>emission</b> property, the performance of ordinary glazing can be improved to approach the perfect window for summer or winter. An advanced fenestration system must combine the functions of daylighting regulation, glare protection and seasonal thermal control.|$|R
40|$|Synthesis {{of several}} interrelated metallo-compounds is described. They are of {{intrinsic}} {{interest in their}} own right and were designed as intermediates and model studies for construction of various acetylene metal systems with interesting synthetic and optical potential. Synthesis of a triacetal and its eta 6 -tricarbonylchromium(0) complex 31 is described. Further transformations towards an eneyne derivative of 31 were complicated by the inherent instability of the complex towards oxidative decomplexation. Synthesis of a series of hexa-substituted eta 6 -tricarbonylchromium(0) complexes 39 [...] 47 (E = H, Me, SiMe 3, SnMe 3, Cl, Br, I, COH, CO 2 Me) and 54 [...] 57 (E = H, Cl, Br, I) by di- or tri-lithiation of the parent compounds followed by quenching with a series of electrophiles is reported. Attempts to obtain alkynylated derivatives of the complexes by Sonagashira coupling reactions failed to produce the desired products. A novel tridurylborane 83, incorporating three azulenyl substituents, was prepared and displayed unique photophysical properties with an absorption maximum nearly 80 nm longer than that of its precursor. A new class of heteroatom-containing triarylboranes 79 (R = OMe) and 96 (R = Me) were synthesized. Triarylborane 96 displayed broadened resonances in the 1 H NMR spectrum at room temperature and a low-temperature 1 H NMR study revealed that the borane existed as an approximate 10 : 1 ratio of two enantiomeric sets of conformational isomers. Triarylborane 96 was further extended by sequential Sonagashira coupling reactions to yield the highly fluorescent chromophore 110, which exhibited intense and <b>long-wave</b> absorption and <b>emission</b> maxima...|$|R

The weak symmetric photospheric absorptions indicate radial velocity variations from night to night (by as much as 3 km/s), resulting from small pulsations. Peculiarities and profile variations were found for strong lines of FeI, FeII, BaII, SiII, etc. The profiles of these lines were asymmetric: their short-wave wings were extended and their cores were either split or distorted by emission. During the 2010 observing season, the position and depth of the Halpha absorption component, the intensities of the short and <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> components, and the intensity ratio of the latter components varied from spectrum to spectrum. Weak emissions of neutral atoms (VI, MnI, CoI, NiI, FeI) appeared in the spectrum of June 1, 2010.

40|$|The {{conditions}} and the exterior surface of building components with high insulation are almost independent of the indoor climate. With today's increasing insulation thicknesses, the tiny heat flow from the interior is thus generally not sufficient to prevent a temperature drop below ambient conditions by <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> especially during night-time. Apart from energetic consequences this temperature drop may lead to surface condensation and subsequently to soiling or microbial growth. Another factor resulting in surface temperatures below ambient conditions is the evaporation of precipitation moisture. In order to obtain realistic surface conditions by numerical simulation the heat and moisture transfer processes at the surface have to be modelled accurately, taking into account convective and radiation, precipitation, wind speed and direction. These data serve as input for a hygrothermal simulation tool. The calculated results are compared with measured surface temperatures of walls at the IBP test site. From comparisons like these appropriate surface transfer coefficients for simulation tools may be deduced and the different surface humidity sources may be quantified. Further, the simulation tool is used to compare three different types of wall construction {{with respect to their}} night-time surface temperatures...|$|E

The use of remote sensing in this context aims to fill a gap in Brazil, where the available data of solar radiation is very limited and mostly refers to climatological averages. For this, we used the procedures of the method Algorithm for Land Surface Balance - SEBAL. Was obtained values of the components of Rn-based reflective radiance from the channels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) and the thermal channel (6) 5 -Landsat TM. For comparative purposes, the main types of land cover were analyzed in the study area: urban area, water bodies, vegetation and bare soil. The emissivity values did not differ significantly between the targets, the values of albedo and surface temperature were directly proportional to the targets while for values Rn and <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> was observed an inverse relationship in which the surfaces with higher emissivity values showed lower Rn. So clear was the contrast between the natural surfaces (vegetation and water bodies) that showed the highest values of Rn, while the urban area and areas of exposed soil showed lower values due to low capacity and high thermal conductivity heat material associated therewith.

40|$|Two model {{experiment}}s, namely {{a control}} (CTL) experiment without aerosol–radiation feedbacks and a experiment with online aerosol–radiation (RAD) interactions, {{were designed to}} study the radiative feedback on regional radiation budgets, planetary boundary layer (PBL) meteorology and haze formation due to aerosols during haze episodes over Jing–Jin–Ji, China, and its near surroundings (3 JNS region of China: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, East Shanxi, West Shandong and North Henan) with a two-way atmospheric chemical transport model. The impact of aerosols on solar radiation reaching Earth's surface, outgoing <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> {{at the top of}} the atmosphere, air temperature, PBL turbulence diffusion, PBL height, wind speeds, air pressure pattern and PM 2. 5 has been studied focusing on a haze episode during the period from 7 to 11 July 2008. The results show that the mean solar radiation flux that reaches the ground decreases by about 15 % in 3 JNS and 20 to 25 %in the region with the highest aerosol optical depth during the haze episode. The fact that aerosol cools the PBL atmosphere but warms the atmosphere above it leads to a more stable atmospheric stratification over the region, which causes a decrease in turbulence diffusion of about 52 % and a decrease in the PBL height of about 33 %. This consequently forms a positive feedback on the particle concentration within the PBL and the surface as well as the haze formation. Additionally, aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) increases PBL wind speed by about 9 % and weakens the subtropical high by about 14 hPa, which aids the collapse of haze pollution and results in a negative feedback to the haze episode. The synthetic impacts from the two opposite feedbacks result in about a 14 % increase in surface PM 2. 5. However, the persistence time of both high PM 2. 5 and haze pollution is not affected by the aerosol DRF. On the contrary over offshore China, aerosols heat the PBL atmosphere and cause unstable atmospheric stratification, but the impact and its feedback on the planetary boundary layer height, turbulence diffusion and wind is weak, with the exception of the evident impacts on the subtropical high...|$|E
40|$|The {{microclimate}} of the Horotane Valley is characterised {{to enable}} {{an assessment of}} land-use potential in the valley. Crops that are traditionally thought of as marginal or unsuitable for commercial growth on the Canterbury Plains, can be grown successfully in the valley. While {{the residents of the}} valley have a qualitative appreciation of the climate, no quantitative data had previously been collected to characterise the microclimate. Data collection took place over a five month period from 14 th February 1995 to 31 July, 1995. Field observations of maximum and minimum temperature and short-wave radiation are augmented by modelling. Temperature data are used to determine the Growing Degree Day, chill unit and frost distribution. Continuous monitoring of the wind in the upper valley allows analysis of the diurnal and seasonal variation in the wind regime. Radiation receipt varies with slope angle and aspect. Radiation modelling using the "Cosine Law of Illumination" produces comparatively high results as cloud cover, air pollution levels and sky view factors are not taken into account. Albedo varies with the surface colour, roughness and moisture level. Growing degree days initially increase with elevation, until the lower maximum temperatures in the thermal belt counteract the higher minimum temperatures. Chill units decrease with elevation in the thermal belt and then increase again. Frosts are most common on the valley floor and decrease in frequency and severity with elevation up the valley slopes. A temperature inversion is most likely to develop under anticyclone conditions when the nocturnal <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission</b> is at a maximum. Nocturnal temperatures follow the normal lapse rate when the atmosphere is well-mixed. Diurnal temperatures tend to follow the normal lapse rate. Thermotopographically generated winds are prominent in the valley wind regime. The northerly anabatic wind develops in the valley following sunrise. It reaches peak velocity in the afternoon when backed by the low level gradient north-easterly and the sea breeze. A light southerly katabatic flow dominates the nocturnal wind regime. Gradient winds are modified by the valley topography and shelter is needed from the gradient southerly winds as they reach maximum speeds of 15 m/s. The valley is topographically sheltered from winds from an easterly arid westerly direction. Published knowledge of the climatic requirements of selected crops was used to evaluate their suitability to the Horotane Valley microclimate. The research has shown that the valley climate could support other marginal crops such as grapes and kiwifruit, and that the area planted in stonefruit could be extended...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experimental}} study addresses turbulence and exchange {{processes in the}} urban roughness sublayer, namely the region from street canyon floor up to 2. 5 times the mean building height. Measurements with ultrasonic anemometerthermometers from three urban full-scale towers provided new insights into vertical profiles of mean flow, Reynolds stress, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), dissipation rate, as well as exchange processes of heat, and partially water vapor and CO 2. With the help of ensemble profiles, which are a surrogate for a real horizontal average, results {{are discussed in the}} frame of an ‘urban family portrait’. For the majority of realizations, the plane mixing layer analogy matches processes in the urban roughness sublayer much better than the classical boundary layer theory. The observed patterns suggest a conceptual division of the urban roughness sublayer into three parts, namely the canyon layer, the roof layer, and an above-roof layer. In the canyon layer, local mechanical and thermal turbulence production are of minor importance. Turbulence is dominated by large coherent structures, it is very intermittent and highly uncorrelated. The majority of TKE is imported by turbulent and pressure transport from the roof layer. The well known street canyon vortex is only found on average and only for selected configurations. Upwind roof shape was determined as an important factor affecting its dynamics. In the roof layer, profiles are characterized by strongest gradients and exchange is more efficient. Here, local shear production is a strong source of TKE. The skimming flow over the street canyons creates an inflected mean wind profile, from which instabilities evolve. Notable amounts of TKE and temperature variance are exported from the roof layer by sweeps into the upper street canyon and by ejections into the above-roof layer. As a consequence, dissipation rate is lower than locally produced turbulence and neutral limits of velocity variances are slightly lower than predicted with classical (local) approaches. In the above-roof layer, the mean wind profile approximates the well known logarithmic form valid in the inertial sublayer. And, integral statistics approach surface layer values. Turbulent transport processes of momentum and heat are dominated by ejections. While shear production is the main source of TKE in the roof layer below, here both, buoyancy and shear production are important. Finally, a network of spatially distributed energy balance measurements allowed a quantitative estimation of the urban energy balance modification. For this purpose, the surface energy balance was simultaneously measured over different land uses (urban, suburban, rural). The impact of a lower urban albedo is roughly counterbalanced by a stronger <b>long-wave</b> <b>emission,</b> resulting in a nearly equivalent net radiation over urban and rural surfaces. Urban surfaces are characterized by a strong storage term and a high Bowen ratio. At night, turbulent flux densities remain upward directed in dense urban environments. This is explained by a strong nocturnal release of stored heat. As a consequence, the urban inertial sublayer and the roughness sublayer are thermally unstable most of the time...|$|E
