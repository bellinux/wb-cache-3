5000|$|The {{turntable}} plinth has {{a precision}} 16 gauge steel stamped top plate. The base {{appears to be}} a heavy composite plastic material with steel bars or plates added for additional weight. The platter is die-cast aluminum having a thickness of 0.110". At the center of the underside of the platter a 3.520" [...] diameter, 0.210" [...] thick, ceramic magnetic ring bonded to the platter is used to magnetically secure the platter to a 3.800" [...] diameter steel plate on the spindle assembly. Two large finger holes in the platter are provided for lifting the platter off of the spindle. The platter and ceramic magnet assembly weighs 1.84 lbs. The integrated aluminum tonearm assembly includes the tonearm counterweight with stylus pressure ring, rest/clamp, <b>lift</b> <b>lever,</b> lift adjustment, plus calibrated anti-skate control, height, height lock, and tracking force adjustments. The tonearm rest/clamp and adjustment dials are plastic. The die-cast metal headshell is of the standard removable type. A generously sized LCD display on the Pro models indicates speed setting, play/pause, pitch, quartz lock, and direction of platter rotation. The ground wire and audio output leads are permanently attached. A removable, hinged plastic dust cover was included.|$|E

In order to produce new machines and devices we have to develop its design methods. As marketing analysis shows, there isn’t any manufacturer of load lifting mechanisms in our country. “Nurnberg scissors” type load lifting mechanisms are produced abroad. But such load lifting platforms are very dangerous and might overturn since equipments’ stiffness is low. Also these load lifting platforms are very heavy. The main reason is when mechanism is in the built-up condition its state is close to singularity, that is why it is very big on reactions of kinematical chains, the value of balancing force is very high. For instance in some equipments it can be observed that balancing force is 16 times higher than lifted load.

50|$|The NEGEV is striker-fired, {{where the}} bolt carrier {{assembly}} {{acts as the}} striker, and fires from an open bolt position. A lever-type fire control selector switch is provided (“A”— for fully automatic fire and “R”— for semi-automatic fire), installed {{on the left side}} of the pistol grip, which doubles as a manual safety against accidental firing. The safe “S” position disables the sear mechanism (which makes it impossible to cock the bolt carrier), by <b>lifting</b> the <b>lever</b> responsible for holding the bolt carrier in the forward position and disconnects the trigger mechanism from the sear. The weapon can be secured safe regardless of the position of the bolt carrier group. The cocking handle is equipped with a ratcheting mechanism that immobilizes the partially cocked bolt carrier.|$|R
50|$|Nutcrackers in {{the form}} of wood carvings of a soldier, knight, king, or other {{profession}} have existed since at least the 15th century. Figurative nutcrackers are a good luck symbol in Germany, and a folk tale recounts that a puppet-maker won a nutcracking challenge by creating a doll with a mouth for a lever to crack the nuts. These nutcrackers portray a person with a large mouth which the operator opens by <b>lifting</b> a <b>lever</b> {{in the back of the}} figurine. Originally one could insert a nut in the big-toothed mouth, press down and thereby crack the nut. Modern nutcrackers in this style serve mostly for decoration, mainly at Christmas time, a season of which they have long been a traditional symbol. The ballet The Nutcracker derives its name from this festive holiday decoration.|$|R
50|$|Self-dumping grabs {{also have}} a single {{supporting}} rope or chain. The lower girder contains a linkage mechanism with hooks which connect to the upper girder, holding the grab closed. When the grab is lowered onto the spoil, weights release the hooks and allow the grab to open when <b>lifted.</b> A <b>lever</b> may also be fitted {{to this type of}} mechanism to which a long trip rope can be attached which, when pulled by a banksman, releases the catches in the mechanism and allows the grab to open in mid air (e.g. above a lorry or a hopper). The grab usually is fitted with a hydraulic damper to restrict the speed of opening. The clamshell bucket on the left hand side of the photograph on this page at Cardiff is a self-dumping chain grab.|$|R
50|$|The Lily {{features}} a Flemish brake design which incorporates a rope drum which <b>lifts</b> a loaded <b>lever</b> {{which in turn}} pulls a set of wooden blocks tightly around the windshaft (the shaft the sails are mounted on). This brake design {{which is similar to}} a band brake is very effective when the sails are facing the wind, but much less so when the wind is coming from behind. For this reason a ‘kneppel’ is installed which prevents counter-rotation of the sails when the windmill has stopped.|$|R
50|$|The optic or {{non-drip}} {{measure is}} mounted beneath an inverted spirit bottle, {{so that a}} pre-defined volume of the bottle's contents drains into the measure. <b>Lifting</b> a <b>lever</b> {{on the side of}} the measure first closes off the measure from the bottle, then dispenses the measured liquid into the glass or mixing vessel held underneath. This mechanism ensures that a correct spirit measure can be dispensed each time, as the inverted bottle allows the measure to be replenished in the optic after each shot has been dispensed. These types of measures are commonly used for highly demanded drinks in professional bar settings, and are often incorporated into visually-appealing machines that serve both functional and marketing purposes for the liquor being poured. Bottles are available to the trade with their labels affixed upside down so that they will be the right way up when mounted on the optic.|$|R

They {{had spent most of}} the day dragging the canoe round the rapid which roared down the hollow in a wild tumult of froth, <b>lifting</b> her with <b>levers</b> from rock to rock, and now and then sliding with her down a declivity, but that was a mode of progression clearly unsuited to an injured man.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shift pattern}} for most underbone or {{miniature}} motorcycles {{with an automatic}} centrifugal clutch is also modified for two key reasons—to enable the less-experienced riders to shift the gears without problems of [...] "finding" [...] neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to [...] "lift" [...] the gearshift lever (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The gearshift lever of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe {{all the way to}} the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and <b>lift</b> the <b>lever</b> up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the Honda Wave have a [...] "rotary" [...] shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ratchet control}} {{button on the}} end of a fly-off {{handbrake}} is designed to work in the opposite way to what is normally accepted. If the <b>lever</b> is <b>lifted</b> or pulled back to the [...] "on" [...] position, on letting go it immediately releases unless the end button is pressed and held in place before letting go of the lever. Once set, the brake is released by <b>lifting</b> the handbrake <b>lever</b> (not pushing the button) in the setting direction (up or back). This mechanism was traditionally fitted to sports cars to facilitate a racing get-away, such as at traffic lights. It can also be used to help the back wheels to slide, without the worry of the ratchet leaving the brake on.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the key is}} struck, a chain {{reaction}} occurs to produce the sound. First, the key raises the [...] "wippen" [...] mechanism, which forces the jack against the hammer roller (or knuckle). The hammer roller then <b>lifts</b> the <b>lever</b> carrying the hammer. The key also raises the damper; and immediately after the hammer strikes the wire it falls back, allowing the wire to resonate and thus produce sound. When the key is released the damper falls back onto the strings, stopping the wire from vibrating, and thus stopping the sound. The vibrating piano strings themselves are not very loud, but their vibrations are transmitted to a large soundboard that moves air and thus converts the energy to sound. The irregular shape and off-center placement of the bridge ensure that the soundboard vibrates strongly at all frequencies. (See Piano action for a diagram and detailed description of piano parts.) The piano hammer is [...] "thrown" [...] against the strings. This means that once a pianist has pressed or struck a key, and the hammer is set in motion towards the strings, {{the pressure on the}} key no longer leads to player controlling the hammer. Of course, the damper keeps the note sounding until the key is released (or the sustain pedal).|$|R
2500|$|Third, {{after the}} hammer strikes the string, the action must avoid an {{unwanted}} second blow, which could easily {{result from the}} hammer {{bouncing up and down}} within the space confining it. In Cristofori's action, this was accomplished by two means. By <b>lifting</b> the intermediate <b>lever</b> with a jack that disengages in its highest position, the Cristofori action made it possible for the hammer to fall (after its initial blow) to a position considerably lower than the highest position to which the key had lifted it. By itself, this mechanism greatly reduces the chance of an unwanted second blow. In addition, the Cristofori action also included a check (also called [...] "back check"; M) that catches the hammer and holds it in a partially raised position until the player releases the key; the check also helped to prevent unwanted second blows.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : A Rube-Goldberg contraption that {{demonstrates}} many challenging multibody contact sounds. A noisy block feeder (Left) with flexible tubes ejects marbles into a double helix of plastic chutes (Middle), which causes a cup to fill up, <b>lifting</b> a <b>lever</b> that drops a bunny into a runaway shopping cart (Right) producing familiar clattering and clanging sounds due to deformable micro-collisions. Our approach can accurately resolve modal vibrations and contact sounds using an asynchronous, adaptive, frictional contact solver. Contact sound models based on linear modal analysis {{are commonly used}} with rigid body dynamics. Unfortunately, treating vibrating objects as “rigid ” during collision and contact processing fundamentally limits the range of sounds that can be computed, and contact solvers for rigid body animation can be ill-suited for modal contact sound synthesis, producing various sound artifacts. In this paper, we resolve modal vibrations in both collision and frictional contact processing stages, thereby enabling non-rigid sound phenomena such as micro-collisions, vibrational energy exchange, and chattering. We propose a frictional multibody contact formulation and modified Staggered Projections solver which is well-suited to sound rendering and avoids noise artifacts associated with spatial and temporal contact-force fluctuations which plague prior methods. To enable practical animation and sound synthesis of numerous bodies with many coupled modes, we propose a novel asynchronous integrator with model-level adaptivity built into the frictional contact solver. Vibrational contact damping is modeled to approximate contact-dependent sound dissipation. Results are provided that demonstrate high-quality contact resolution with sound...|$|R
60|$|From Trinity College, Dublin, Lever went to Gottingen, {{where he}} found fun and {{fighting}} enough among the German students. From that hour he became {{a citizen of the}} world, or, at least, of Europe, and perhaps, like the prophets, was most honoured when out of his own country. He returned to Dublin and took his degree in medicine, after playing a famous practical joke. A certain medical professor was wont to lecture in bed. One night he left town unexpectedly. Lever, by chance, came early to lecture, found the Professor absent, slipped into his bed, put on his nightcap, and took the class himself. On another day he was standing outside the Foundling Hospital with a friend, a small man. Now, a kind of stone cradle for foundlings was built outside the door, and, when a baby was placed therein, a bell rang. <b>Lever</b> <b>lifted</b> up his friend, popped him into the cradle, and had the joy of seeing the promising infant picked out by the porter.|$|R

50|$|In pump-action shotguns, {{a sliding}} forearm handle (the pump) works the action, extracting the spent shell and {{inserting}} {{a new one}} while cocking the hammer or striker as the pump is worked. A pump gun is typically fed from a tubular magazine underneath the barrel, which {{also serves as a}} guide for the pump. The rounds are fed in one by one through a port in the receiver, where they are <b>lifted</b> by a <b>lever</b> called the elevator and pushed forward into the chamber by the bolt. A pair of latches {{at the rear of the}} magazine hold the rounds in place and facilitate feeding of one shell at a time. If it is desired to load the gun fully, a round may be loaded through the ejection port directly into the chamber, or cycled from the magazine, which is then topped off with another round. Well-known examples include the Winchester Model 1897, Remington 870 and Mossberg 500/590.|$|R

50|$|The long {{horizontal}} slats {{are held}} one above {{the other by}} the rungs of ladder cords shaped like a ladder. The lower ends of {{the legs of the}} ladder cords are secured to the long rail under the slats. Their upper ends are attached to the drive rod in the housing, the elongated box above the slats. As the drive rod rotates, one leg of each ladder cord moves up while the other moves down, causing the angle of the slats to change. In one design, this rotation is achieved by pushing up or pulling down on a long handle called a tilt wand connected to the drive rod by a <b>lever.</b> <b>Lift</b> cords along the ladder cords are also attached to the rail. They pass through holes in the slats and into the housing above, where they go over pulleys, combine and exit through the cord lock. For safety it's important that the lock always works. A downward pull on the main lift cord raises the slats by the cords pulling up the rail below the slats. The cord lock holds the main lift cord to keep the slats up until the cord is pulled to release the lock. The safety lock made the cord lock easier to use.|$|R
50|$|The {{release lever}} (L) holds the rack (M) {{up when the}} clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a {{projection}}. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly <b>lifts</b> the release <b>lever,</b> allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, {{is determined by the}} position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, {{in such a way that}} gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.|$|R
5000|$|These were {{designed}} for use aboard a ship or within a fortification and consisted of two large wooden slabs called [...] "cheeks" [...] held apart by bracing pieces called [...] "transoms". The trunnions of the gun barrel sat {{on the top of}} the cheeks; the rearward part of each cheek was stepped so that the breech could be <b>lifted</b> by iron <b>levers</b> called [...] "handspikes". Because these guns were not required to travel about, they were only provided with four small wheels called [...] "trucks", whose main function was to roll backwards with the recoil of the gun and then allow it to be moved forward into a firing position after reloading. Traversing the gun was achieved by levering the rear of the carriage sideways with handspikes. An improvement on this arrangement started at the end of the 18th century with the introduction of the traversing carriage, initially in fortifications but later on ships as well. This consisted of a stout wooden (and later iron) beam on which the entire gun carriage was mounted. The beam was fitted to a [...] at the centre, and to one or more trucks or [...] "racers" [...] at the front; the racers ran along a semi-circular iron track set in the floor called a [...] "race". This allowed the gun to be swung in an arc over a parapet. Alternatively, the pivot could be fitted to the front of the beam and the racers at the rear, allowing the gun to fire through an embrasure. The traversing beam sloped upwards towards the rear, allowing the gun and its carriage to recoil up the slope.|$|R
40|$|VIRTUAL PROTOTYPING {{has been}} {{generally}} adopted in product development {{in order to}} minimise the traditional reliance on testing of physical prototypes. It thus constitutes a major step towards solving the conflict of actual increasing development cost and time due to increasing customer demands on one side, {{and the need to}} decrease development cost and time due to increasing competition on the other. Particularly challenging for the off-road equipment industry is that its products, working machines, are complex in architecture. Tightly coupled, non-linear sub-systems of different technical domains make prediction and optimisation of the complete system’s dynamic behaviour difficult. Furthermore, in working machines the human operator is essential for the performance of the total system. Properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability are all not only dependent on inherent machine properties and working place conditions, but also on how the operator uses the machine. This is an aspect that is traditionally neglected in dynamic simulations, because the modelling needs to be extended beyond the technical system. The research presented in this thesis focuses on wheel loaders, which are representative for working machines. The technical system and the influence of the human operator is analysed, and so-called short loading cycles are described in depth. Two approaches to rule-based simulation models of a wheel loader operator are presented and used in simulations. Both operator models control the machine model by means of engine throttle, <b>lift</b> and tilt <b>lever,</b> steering wheel, and brake only – just as a human operator does. Also, only signals that a human operator can sense are used in the models. It is demonstrated that both operator models are able to adapt to basic variations in workplace setup and machine capability. Thus, a “human element” can be introduced into dynamic simulation of working machines, giving more relevant answers with respect to operator-influenced complete-machine properties such as productivity, fuel efficiency, and operability already in the concept phase of the product development process.
