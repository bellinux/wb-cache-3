40|$|Pipe ageing {{leads to}} an {{increment}} both in breakage frequency and leakages, and to a decrement in the system efficiency. Strategies are then necessary to define when and where to operate {{in order to improve}} the water distribution system reliability and to reduce maintenance costs. A decision-making tool based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm technique for optimizing water distribution management strategies is proposed. Funds to be spent over a predefined time interval on pro-active actions (i. e. <b>leakage</b> <b>detections</b> and pipe replacements) are assumed available. The aim is to define how to spend this budget, i. e. where and when to make <b>leakage</b> <b>detections</b> and/or pipe replacements, in order to minimize a) passive costs (repair costs), b) leakages and c) to maximize the water distribution reliability by minimizing the volume of the unserved demands over a long predefined time horizon. The constraint of the funds allocated for pro-active actions to be spent in full within the planning time interval is selected to respect the standard way of operating of a water agency. In fact, once an amount for a given purpose is allocated, i. e. an item is defined, the water agency operates to spend this amount in full for that item within the time interval defined, since residual amounts are not necessarily reallocated to the same item, and return to the global budget of the entire set of activities to be planned for the subsequent period. Results regarding a real water distribution system show that the proposed procedure {{has the potential to be}} a useful decision-making tool for scheduling <b>leakage</b> <b>detections</b> and rehabilitation actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{status of}} {{printed circuit board}} {{inspection}} is reviewed with special focus placed on the existing techniques of assessing plated-through hole quality. The need for developing a non-destructive method for plated-through hole inspection has been identified and is the major objective of this research. The {{results of the investigation}} into various methods that could lead to this objective are presented. This investigation has been concerned with the application of image processing techniques and the <b>leakage</b> light <b>detection</b> method. The hardware and software requirements for automatic visual inspection of stuffed board components are established initially using available equipment from the Department of Production Technology. Image processing techniques are found to be capable of discriminating copper-plated and unplated surfaces using the difference in reflectance between the surfaces. This suggests the possibility of applying such techniques to assess the quality of through-hole plating. The <b>leakage</b> light <b>detection</b> method can be implemented to assess the plating coverage of plated-through holes. A low cost inspection system demonstrating the principle of <b>leakage</b> light <b>detection</b> has been constructed. This system is particularly relevant to the small batch manufacturers in the printed circuit board industry. The performance of the demonstration system has illustrated the simplicity and reliability of the design.

40|$|Each year, {{millions}} of people suffer from after-effects of pipeline leakages, spills, and eruptions. <b>Leakages</b> <b>Detection</b> Systems (LDS) are often used to understand and analyse these phenomena but unfortunately could not offer complete solution to reducing {{the scale of the}} problem. One recent approach was to collect datasets from these pipeline sensors and analyse offline, the approach yielded questionable results due to vast nature of the datasets. These datasets together with the necessity for powerful exploration tools made most pipelines operating companies "data rich but information poor". Researchers have therefore identified problem of dimensional reduction for pipeline sensor datasets as a major research issue. Hence, systematic gap filling data mining development approaches are required to transform data "tombs" into "golden nuggets" of knowledge.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an acoustic emission transferability method in applications of valve <b>leakage</b> rate <b>detection</b> and tool wear monitoring. The method aims {{to transfer the}} information between AE inspection systems using different types of sensor and position by relationship which was called a transfer function. The spectrum density function/AErms spectra of both wide band (WD) and resonance (R 15 and R 30) AE sensors were studied. The results demonstrate a very good similarity transfer function in various conditions. Three sets of cutting condition of tool wear monitoring in machining tests were conducted. A tool shank of type SDJCL 1616 H 11 and carbide tool inserts of type CG 4035 DCMT 11 T 3 04 -UF (Sandvik Coromant) were used. Two AE sensors were mounted on the tool-holder: a WD sensor (PAC) {{at the end of}} the tool-holder and an R 30 sensor (PAC) on the side. For valve <b>leakage</b> rate <b>detection,</b> artificial leaks from incomplete closure of ball valve are used to simulate the leakage. The tests were conduced by varying inlet pressure from 1 to 5 bars in three valve sizes of 1, 2 and 3 inches respectively. The AE signals detected at the two sensors (WD and R 15) were analyzed in real-time using a Hewlett Packard HP 89410 A. Transfer functions of two AE sensors are calculated and represented by the ratio of frequency responses of the two sensors. This is particularly useful since the information obtained from one sensor may be converted into another without having to repeat the experiments. With the proposed acoustic transferability, it will be possible to make comparison between results obtained from different set-ups...|$|R
