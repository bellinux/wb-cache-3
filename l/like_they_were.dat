5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated digits, which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other digits support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third digits go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth digits go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E
5|$|Life {{magazine}} {{decided to}} publish a photo story for their January 15, 1951 edition, which would document {{the results of the}} competition and feature a photograph of the protesters. Life initially wanted to photograph the painters {{on the steps of the}} Metropolitan, with their paintings. They refused on the grounds that it would look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying to enter the museum, but were being rebuffed. The magazine capitulated; art editor for Life, Dorothy Seiberling, sent photographer Nina Leen to photograph them at a studio on 44th Street. They assembled there on November 24. Only three of the original signatories were absent: Weldon Kees, Hans Hofmann, and Fritz Bultman. Pollock made a special trip with James Brooks for the session.|$|E
5|$|After the A defense {{forced a}} punt {{on the opening}} {{possession}} of the third quarter, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted the first Manziel pass {{of the second half}} and returned it 73yards for a touchdown and extended the Alabama lead to 35–14. The Aggies responded on the drive that followed with a 14-yard Manziel touchdown pass to Malcome Kennedy which was followed with a three-yard Kenyan Drake touchdown run that made the score 42–21 in favor of the Crimson Tide {{at the end of the}} third quarter. In the fourth, the Aggies scored first on a 12-yard Kennedy touchdown reception, and Alabama looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> about to respond with a touchdown as well, but Yeldon fumbled at the two-yard line that was recovered by A Three plays later, Manziel threw a 95-yard touchdown pass to Mike Evans that cut the Crimson Tide lead to 42–35. Alabama rebounded on their next drive that was capped with a five-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that extended their lead to 49–35. A four-yard touchdown pass from Manziel to Kennedy in the last 0:20 made the final score 49–42. Alabama recovered the ensuing onside kick to seal the win.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if they are called on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two tenths of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though {{was unable to find}} any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

25|$|Adaptation {{rather than}} replacement. Names {{that came to}} look <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> coined as Old English may {{actually}} come from Roman-period ones. For example, the city of York's connection to its original Romanised Celtic name Eburacum is not immediately obvious. But knowledge of the intermediate forms of the name, Old English *Eburwīc (later Eoforwīc) and Norse Jórvík, makes the connection clearer.|$|E
25|$|Zarroug {{highlights}} {{the mention of}} Al-Aswani that Alodia had plenty of horses. Like in any pre-Industrial society, horses were the quickest method to deliver messages and to project military power and therefore would have been of major importance in a large, steppe dominated kingdom like Alodia, just <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in the other Medieval Sudanese kingdoms. Aside of horses, boats would have played a considerable role in Alodian infrastructure as well.|$|E
25|$|When viewing {{pieces of}} art in an experiment, {{participants}} in a solo context rated art in an improving sequence significantly higher than when the targets are presented in a declining sequence. When viewing the art in a joint context, participants evaluated {{the first and last}} pieces similarly in both kinds of sequence. Simply priming viewers to feel <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in solo or joint contexts or to process analytically or holistically was enough to produce the same viewing effects.|$|E

25|$|Movements over 30 {{kilometers}} (daily horse travel limit) {{were particularly}} slow and complex. Longer hauls were relegated to trucks at first opportunity, while horses persisted at divisional level and in auxiliary units. Horse transports were particularly inadequate in deep offensive operations, just <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> in 1914. American trucks supplied to the Soviets allowed operations up to 350 kilometers {{away from the}} railhead, a distance impossible for horse-drawn sleighs. Likewise, replacement of field artillery horses with jeeps allowed towing 120-mm mortars in line with advancing troops, another tactic not possible with horses.|$|E

However, in the last end they did not have the hammer, meaning Jones would have last rock. Ontario had a rock on the button that was well guarded, and the only way at it was an in-off a rock sitting just outside the house. Jones made this very {{difficult}} shot, which gave her four points and the win.|$|E

25|$|When the King traveled, Marshals {{supervised}} the local Voivodes. The Marshals decided {{who would be}} admitted to royal audience. They were the organizers and masters of royal and court ceremonies (including weddings, funerals and the <b>like).</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> the masters of the court, kept track of lesser courtiers, and (where applicable) set their salaries. Each Marshal wielded a marshal's staff, which he had received from the Chancellor (Kanclerz). In exchange, all Chancellor nominations were heralded by the Marshals. If no Marshal was present, his functions were carried out by a Grand Treasurer or secular Grand Chancellor. On formal occasions and during travel, where appropriate, a Marshal with his staff of office preceded the King. Close after the Marshals in the hierarchy were the Chancellors.|$|E

25|$|To {{compose the}} music, Sakoda used real instruments, then notated {{the music on}} an MSX {{computer}} and converted it onto a PC-9800. Since he didn't like mechanical sounds, he programmed the virtual instruments to sound <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> played by humans. Sakoda worked closely with sound effects programmer Masanobu Tsukamoto. Since the game had limited sound channels, he exercised caution not to create too many simultaneous sounds so the sound effects would not cut out the music. Sakoda only had four channels to use in any given song, {{one of which was}} always fixexd on drums. After the soundtrack was nearly finished. Compile leadership told Sakoda to change the music to something which fit the Japanese aesthetic. After hearing a new soundtrack with plucky Japanese instruments, leadership told Sakoda to revert back to his original music.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} 82,106 at Croke Park was treated {{to one of}} the best All-Ireland finals of all-time, {{and at the end of}} it all, the Cats were {{acclaimed}} as one of the greatest teams of all-time, if not the greatest. Kilkenny created a piece of history with a fourth successive All-Ireland title following a defeat of Tipperary, thus becoming only the second county to put four titles back-to-back, joining the great Cork team of the 1940s in an elite club. For long periods Tipp looked <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to end the reign of Brian Cody's side. Tipperary had to play almost twenty minutes with fourteen men following the dismissal of Benny Dunne, and their resolve was finally broken in the final stages, when late goals from Henry Shefflin and substitute Martin Comerford finally killed off their heroic efforts to secure a 2-22 to 0-23 victory.|$|E
