25|$|Dry ice {{is easily}} manufactured.) Properties, Uses, Applications: CO2 Gas and Liquid Carbon Dioxide|url =http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html|accessdate = 2009-07-26}} First, gases {{with a high}} {{concentration}} of carbon dioxide are produced. Such gases can be a byproduct of another process, such as producing ammonia from nitrogen and natural gas, oil refinery activities or large-scale fermentation. Second, the carbon dioxide-rich gas is pressurized and refrigerated until it liquefies. Next, the pressure is reduced. When this occurs some <b>liquid</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> vaporizes, causing a rapid lowering of temperature of the remaining liquid. As a result, the extreme cold causes the liquid to solidify into a snow-like consistency. Finally, the snow-like solid carbon dioxide is compressed into small pellets or larger blocks of dry ice.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{to develop}} the first aerogels, Kistler used {{a process known as}} {{supercritical}} drying which avoids a direct phase change. By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a supercritical fluid state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with ethanol, the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a CO2-miscible liquid such as ethanol or acetone, then onto <b>liquid</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its critical point. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.|$|E

Because the <b>liquid</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> would throw material over 100 meters, the channels should be discontinuous, but they are not.

Weed control by freezing with <b>liquid</b> nitrogen or <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> snow is a method that works. The method can be used more or less {{in the same way as}} flaming.

Weed control by freezing is an expensive method because of the large quantities of freezing media required to obtain good results. The equipment used to spread the freezing media on the weeds is a very simple experimental model. It can probably be improved in order to be more energy effective.
