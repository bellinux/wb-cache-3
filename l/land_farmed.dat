This {{study was conducted}} over 17. 833 hectares of irrigated wheat fields and 15. 500 hectares of dry land wheat in Saveh city, Iran, in the harvest year of 2003 - 2004. The data was collected from three different sources: questionnaire, literature reviewand field measurement. Total energy consumption for wheat in irrigated farming systems and dry <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> systems was estimated 51, 587 and 12, 543 MJ/ha. The average operational energy consumption for cultivation of irrigated farming system and dry <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> system was 36107 and 6067 MJ/ha, respectively. The maximum energy consumed in operational wheat production was about 28, 301 MJ/ha for irrigated farming systems, including irrigation and It was 3, 582 MJ/ha for dry <b>land</b> <b>farming,</b> including tillage,. Energy consumption {{in the production of}} one-kilogram of wheat, in irrigated <b>farming</b> and dry <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> systems, on average, was 13. 5 MJ/kg and 10. 4 MJ/kg, respectively.

2500|$|The {{environment}} advisor Steve Bass says research {{tells us}} that [...] "the sustainability of land use depends less on percentages and more on other factors. For example, {{the environmental impact of}} 15 per cent coverage by intensively farmed cropland in large blocks will be significantly different from that of 15 per cent of <b>land</b> <b>farmed</b> in more sustainable ways, integrated into the landscape. The boundary of 15 per cent land-use change is, in practice, a premature policy guideline that dilutes the authors' overall scientific proposition. Instead, the authors might want to consider a limit on soil degradation or soil loss. This would be a more valid and useful indicator of the state of terrestrial health." ...|$|E
2500|$|The area of arable <b>land</b> <b>farmed</b> by {{a family}} was notionally {{suitable}} {{for two or three}} plough teams, allocated in runrigs. Runrigs, were a ridge and furrow pattern, similar to that used in parts of England, with alternating [...] "runs" [...] (furrows) and [...] "rigs" [...] (ridges). They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective on heavy soils and cheaper to feed than horses. They were usually pulled by a team of eight oxen, which would have taken four men to operate and only covered half an acre a day. In the late sixteenth century population growth in the west Highlands prompted an abandonment of ploughing in favour of more intensive cultivation methods using spades and foot ploughs (cas chrom) with lazy beds, which produced larger furrows with narrower channels between and allowed arable cultivation in locations where ploughing would have been impossible. Pasture was often accessed by shieling-grounds, with shelters made of stone or turf, used for the grazing of cattle in summer. These would often be distant from the main settlements in the Lowlands, but might be relatively close in the more remote Highlands. All farms combined livestock with arable farming, with cattle and sheep and goats in parts of the Highlands and all farms growing some grain. However, there was some specialisation, with arable most important in the East and there was a tradition of sheep farming in the eastern Borders dating back to the arrival of new monastic orders in the twelfth century, which continued after the secularisation of the monasteries.|$|E
60|$|Ideas {{that are}} unhampered by {{political}} intrigue or financial considerations have a sweeping way with them, and before a year {{was out the}} records of the council show clearly that it was rising to its enormous opportunity, and partly through its own direct control and partly through a series of specific committees, it was planning a new common social order for the entire population of the earth. 'There can be no real social stability or any general human happiness while large areas of the world and large classes of people are in a phase of civilisation different from the prevailing mass. It is impossible now to have great blocks of population misunderstanding the generally accepted social purpose or at an economic disadvantage to the rest.' So the council expressed its conception of the problem it had to solve. The peasant, the field-worker, and all barbaric cultivators were at an 'economic disadvantage' to the more mobile and educated classes, and the logic of the situation compelled the council to take up systematically the supersession of this stratum by a more efficient organisation of production. It developed a scheme for the progressive establishment throughout the world of the 'modern system' in agriculture, a system that should give the full advantages of a civilised life to every agricultural worker, and this replacement has been going on right up to the present day. The central idea of the modern system is the substitution of cultivating guilds for the individual cultivator, and for cottage and village life altogether. These guilds are associations {{of men and women who}} take over areas of arable or pasture land, and make themselves responsible for a certain average produce. They are bodies small enough as a rule to be run on a strictly democratic basis, and large enough to supply all the labour, except for a certain assistance from townspeople during the harvest, needed upon the <b>land</b> <b>farmed.</b> They have watchers' bungalows or chalets on the ground cultivated, but the ease and the costlessness of modern locomotion enables them to maintain a group of residences in the nearest town with a common dining-room and club house, and usually also a guild house in the national or provincial capital. Already this system has abolished a distinctively 'rustic' population throughout vast areas of the old world, where it has prevailed immemorially. That shy, unstimulated life of the lonely hovel, the narrow scandals and petty spites and persecutions of the small village, that hoarding, half inanimate existence away from books, thought, or social participation and in constant contact with cattle, pigs, poultry, and their excrement, is passing away out of human experience. In a little while it will be gone altogether. In the nineteenth century it had already ceased to be a necessary human state, and only the absence of any collective intelligence and an imagined need for tough and unintelligent soldiers and for a prolific class at a low level, prevented its systematic replacement at that time....|$|E
40|$|In this study, <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> and {{chemical}} oxidation of a diesel-contaminated site {{is compared to}} evaluate the environmental impact during soil remediation using the Spreadsheet for Environmental Footprint Analysis by U. S. EPA. Each remediation process is divided into four phases, consisting of soil excavation, backfill and transportation (Phase 0), construction of remediation facility (Phase 1), remediation operation (Phase 2), and restoration of site and waste disposal (Phase 3). Environmental footprints, such as material use, energy consumption, air emission, water use and waste generation, are analyzed to find the way to minimize the environmental impact. In material use and waste generation, <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> has more environmental effect than chemical oxidation due to the concrete and backfill material used to construct <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> facility in Phase 1. Also, in energy use, <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> use about six times more energy than chemical oxidation because of cement production and fuel use of heavy machinery, such as backhoe and truck. However, carbon dioxide, commonly considered as important factor of environmental impact due to global warming effect, is emitted more in chemical oxidation because of hydrogen peroxide production.

6000|$|I see our towns, not indeed diminished {{from their}} present size, but no larger; much cleaner, and {{surrounded}} by wide belts of garden allotments, wherein town workers spend many of their leisure hours. I see in Great Britain fifty millions instead of forty-one; but the town population only thirty-two millions as now, and the rural population eighteen millions instead of the present nine. I see the <b>land</b> <b>farmed</b> in three ways: very large farms growing corn and milk, meat and wool, or sugar beet; small farms co-operatively run growing everything; and large groups of co-operative small holdings, growing vegetables, fruit, pigs, poultry, and dairy produce to some extent. There are no game laws to speak of, and certainly no large areas of ground cut to waste for private whims. I see very decent cottages everywhere, with large plots of ground at economic rents, and decently waged people paying them; no tithes, but a band of extinguished tithe-holders, happy with their compensation. The main waterways of the country seem joined by wide canals, and along these canals factories are {{spread out on the}} garden city plan, with allotments for the factory workers. Along better roads run long chains of small holdings, so that the co-operated holders have no difficulty in marketing their produce. I see motor transport; tractor ploughs; improved farm machinery; forestry properly looked after, and foreshores reclaimed; each village owning its recreation hall, with stage and cinema attached; and public-houses run only on the principle of no commission on the drink sold; every school teaching the truth that happiness and health, not mere money and learning, are the prizes of life and the objects of education, and for ever impressing on the scholars that life in the open air and pleasure in their work are the two chief secrets of health and happiness. In every district a model farm radiates scientific knowledge of the art of husbandry, bringing instruction to each individual farmer, and leaving him no excuse for ignorance. The land produces what it ought; not, as now, feeding with each hundred acres only fifty persons, while a German hundred acres, not nearly so favoured by Nature, feeds seventy-five. Every little girl has been taught to cook. Farmers are no longer fearful of bankruptcy, as in the years from 1875 to 1897, but hold their own with all comers, proud of their industry, the spine and marrow of a country which respects itself once more. There seems no longer jealousy or division between town and country; and statesmen by tacit consent leave the land free from Party politics. I see taller and stronger men and women, rosier and happier children; a race no longer narrow, squashed, and disproportionate; no longer smoke-dried and nerve-racked, with the driven, don't-care look of a town-ridden land. And surely the words [...] "Old England" [...] are spoken by all voices with a new affection, as of a land no longer sucking its sustenance from other lands, but sound and sweet, the worthy heart once more of a great commonwealth of countries.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} the {{comparative}} analysis of composting and <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> as bioremediation methods in hydrocarbon degradation. To achieve this, soil samples from a polluted site were collected at different distances of 10 m- 50 m and were mixed together to have a composite sample. Then Physiochemical, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) and microbial analysis were carried out after five weeks and {{it was observed that}} there were reduction in the concentration of heavy metals and total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) both for the <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> and the composting method. For <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> method, the degradation of TPH from week 1 to week 5 were 2149. 15, 1916. 45, 1657. 38, 1075. 13, and 397. 03 respectively. While that of composting method the degradation of TPH from week 1 to week 5 were 2149. 15, 2045. 37, 1781. 28, 1232. 72, and 762. 07 respectively. These show high level of efficacy in the use of these methods as remediation techniques. While for the heavy metals there were also a decrease in their concentrations, the decrease were within DPR standard. The microbial analysis showed an increase in the microbial population for the two methods in the first four weeks, though microbial population in the <b>land</b> <b>farming</b> method was high compared to the composting method...|$|R
