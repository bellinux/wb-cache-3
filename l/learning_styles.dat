The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine variables associated with intent to use <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference information by undergraduate nursing students. Variables included demographic, academic, and <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference variables as well as students’ ability to explain <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference information, obtained from a commercial <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> inventory. A purposive convenience sample (N = 219) was obtained from six baccalaureate nursing programs in different geographical areas to achieve adequate learner diversity for the variables to be studied. 	A researcher-developed survey entitled Intent to Use <b>Learning</b> <b>Style</b> Preference Information was used to collect study data. Students responded to questions regarding demographic, academic, and <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference information. Pearson correlation, independent samples t test, analysis of variance, and multiple linear regression methods were used for statistical analyses. 	The significant variables of type of BSN program, years of education, person who shared results, perception of usefulness of <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> assessment, and ability to explain <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference information, when entered into the regression model, accounted for 32. 5 % of the variance in the intent to use <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> preference information, F(5, 198) = 19. 07, p <. 001.

Two-hundred-and-sixty-nine managers completed the NEO Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) and Kolb's <b>Learning</b> <b>Style</b> Inventory (KLSI 3. 1). Regression analyses revealed that extraverted managers: have a preference for grasping new experience by engaging in concrete experience rather than abstract conceptualization; prefer to transform experience via active experimentation rather than reflective observation; and tend to have an accommodative <b>learning</b> <b>style.</b> It was concluded that while Kolb's experiential <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> construct is associated with personality, it is also distinct from personality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} education faculty students’ learning strategies in terms of <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> and certain demographic variables. In accordance with this aim, this research was designed using the survey method. The sample of the study consists of 950 students during the 2013 - 2014 academic school year. Kolb’s <b>Learning</b> <b>Style</b> Inventory, <b>Learning</b> Strategies Scale, and Personal Information Form were used as the data collection instruments. Descriptive statistics, Chi-Square Test and MANOVA were used to analyze the data. The results indicate that students mostly have assimilating and converging <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> and that <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> and gender have an effect on learning strategy. Learning strategy usage level of the students that have converging <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> is higher than other students...|$|R

Particular emphasis will {{be placed on the}} Dunn and Dunn <b>Learning</b> <b>Style</b> Model. The basic tenets of this <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> model will be highlighted. The Dunn and Dunn model forms the basis of the Productivity Environmental Survey (PEPS) which is a valid and reliable <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> instrument. The PEPS is currently being used as a research tool within the introductory physics course for non-majors at American University. Two teaching approaches which have been developed based on a <b>learning</b> <b>style</b> approach will be shared. These approaches include the use of writing as well as interactive on-line discussions using Blackboard technologies. Ideas for effective adaptation of these approaches by educators in other branches of science, as well as mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) education will be discussed.
