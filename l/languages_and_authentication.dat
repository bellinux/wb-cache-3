We prove the soundness of these transformations with respect to an expressive security property specification <b>language</b> covering secrecy <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> properties. Our work clarifies and significantly extends the scope of earlier work in this area. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach on a family of key establishment protocols...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} voice-based personal authentication in a conceptual framework of conversational speech biometrics relying on two sources of authentication - the acoustic voice-print and the user knowledge. Several technologies are closely integrated: speaker recognition and speech recognition as well as natural <b>language</b> understanding <b>and</b> dialog management. The {{first part of this}} paper details on the algorithms for the acoustic voice-print modeling and recognition and presents experimental results on two databases with telephony speech. The second part describes the integration of acoustic voice-print recognition and speech recognition in a prototype that allows for natural <b>language</b> input <b>and</b> dynamic <b>authentication</b> scenaria in the telephony environment, together with an experimental evaluation carried out on a speech-biometrics database...|$|R

40|$|M. Com. (Informatics) A {{certain degree}} of {{vulnerability}} exists in traditional knowledge-based identification <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> access control, {{as a result of}} password interception and social engineering techniques. This vulnerability has warranted the exploration of additional identification <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> approaches such as physical token-based systems and biometrics. Speaker recognition is one such biometric approach that is currently not widely used due to its inherent technological challenges, as well as a scarcity of comprehensive literature and complete open-source projects. This makes it challenging for anyone who wishes to study, develop and improve upon speaker recognition for identification <b>and</b> <b>authentication.</b> In this dissertation, we condense some of the available speaker recognition literature in a manner that would provide a comprehensive overall picture of speaker identification <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> to a wider range of interested audiences. A speaker recognition solution {{in the form of an}} open, user-friendly software prototype environment is presented, called SRIA (Speaker Recognition Identification Authentication). In SRIA, real users may enrol and perform speaker identification <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> tasks. SRIA is intended as platform for speaker recognition understanding and further research and development...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is implementation and performance evaluation of an SSL VPN taking into consideration the effect of encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> technique {{on the performance of}} the VPN. SSL VPNs is considered as a great leap in the world of networking because it improves work efficiency tremendously by eliminating the need for client software, since clients can access the VPN through web browsers. VPNs use encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> techniques to provide a secure path for data through a public network. Encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> techniques differ in their quality, mainly, according to key size and block size; on the other hand this may result in degradation of the performance of the VPN. The {{objective of}} this project is implementation and performance evaluation of an SSL VPN. SSL VPN was successfully implemented using an open-source SSL VPN solution called OpenVPN. A performance evaluation study was done for the implemented SSL VPN taking into consideration the effect of encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> techniques on the performance of the VPN. Determining the effect of encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> on the performance of the VPN can give us an insight of the kind of suitable applications and thus choosing the right encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> technique for a certain scenario. Three of the most used cryptographic ciphers and hash algorithms were chosen for the study. Network performance measures were tested on the implemented SSL VPN when applying each of the combinations of these cryptographic ciphers and hash algorithms. Network performance measures calculated are round trip time (RTT), packet loss, transfer rate using ftp, network file system (NFS) access time, Throughput, Bandwidth and jitter. We found that RTT and packet loss isn’t affected by the combination applied, but NFS access time increases with the amount of encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> applied. Transfer rate decreases with the amount of encryption <b>and</b> <b>authentication</b> applied. Bandwidth <b>and</b> throughput isn’t affected by the combination applied and jitter seems to have a random nature...|$|R
