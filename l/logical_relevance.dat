50|$|The {{scheme of}} Chapter 3 of the Act deals with {{admissibility}} of evidence. Evidence which is relevant is generally admissible, and evidence which is irrelevant is inadmissible. Evidence is relevant {{if it is}} evidence which, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) {{the assessment of the}} probability of a fact in issue in the proceedings. As evidence which is relevant has the capability to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue, it is “probative”. This determination is known as <b>logical</b> <b>relevance.</b> <b>Logical</b> <b>relevance</b> merely requires evidence have a logical connection to the facts in issue.But neither s 55 nor s 56 of the Act requires that evidence be probative to a particular degree for it to be admissible. Evidence that is of only some, even slight, probative value will be admissible, just as it is at common law. Therefore, evidence is either relevant or it is not and if the evidence is not relevant then no further question arises about its admissibility. However, <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> isn't sufficient to establish the potential admissibility of the evidence and is still possible for the evidence to be inadmissible. This determination is known as ‘legal relevance’ as opposed to <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> and sets a demanding test for discretionary exclusion (but one that is not obligatory) where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial. Once the legal relevance of the evidence is established, the exclusionary principles and exceptions to those principles are also to be considered.|$|E
5000|$|The word's secular usage may owe {{much of its}} {{popularity}} to Irish novelist James Joyce. The Joycean epiphany {{has been defined as}} [...] "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind--the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> of whatever produces it." [...] The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection Dubliners (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment Stephen Hero, although this was published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see face-to-face).In traditional and pre-modern cultures, initiation rites and mystery religions have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The Greek dramatists and poets would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of catharsis or kenosis, respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of William Burroughs' Naked Lunch, a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, [...] "a frozen moment when everyone sees what {{is at the end of}} the fork." [...] Both the Dadaist Marcel Duchamp and the Pop Artist Andy Warhol would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of fine art (for example a urinal as a fountain), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of [...] "what art is" [...] or is not.|$|E

However, the interpretations of Moche conflict based upon these kinds information represent simple analogies and the <b>logical</b> conclusions and <b>relevance</b> assumptions are unwarranted, especially when considered in light of the available archaeological and bioarchaeological data. Within this paper, I present new biodistance analyses and explore additional ethnohistoric analogies to suggest that Moche warfare represented conflict between competing north coast polities, rather than strictly ritualized staged battles between Moche elite...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} Information Retrieval is {{providing}} an algorithm for retriev-ing all documents {{in a text}} collectionD relevant to a query q. However, retrieval should be updated whenever the user is able to provide as an input a preferred set of relevant documents; this process is known as relevance feedback. Recent work in IR has been paying great attention to models which employ a logical approach; the advantage being that one can have a simple computable charac-terization of retrieval {{on the basis of}} a pure logical analysis of retrieval. Most of the logical models make use of probabilities or similar belief functions in order to introduce the inductive component whereby uncertainty is treated. Their general paradigm is the following: nd the nature of conditional d! q and then dene a probability on the top of it. We just reverse this point of view; rst use the numerical information, frequencies or probabilities, then dene your own logical consequence. More generally, we claim that retrieval is a form of deduction. We introduce a simple but powerful <b>logical</b> framework of <b>relevance</b> feedback, derived from the well founded area of nonmonotonic logic. This de...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} novel method of {{determining}} the appropriateness of an {{answer to a question}} through a proof of <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> rather than a logical proof of truth. We define <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> as the idea that answers should not be considered as absolutely true or false in relation to a question, but should be considered true more flexibly in a sliding scale of aptness. This enables us to reason rigorously about the appropriateness of an answer even in cases where the sources we are getting answers from are incomplete or inconsistent or contain errors. We show how <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> can be implemented through the use of measured simplification, a form of constraint relaxation, in order to seek a logical proof than an answer is in fact an answer to a particular question. We then give an example of such an implementation providing a set of specific rules for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|A {{system that}} can {{retrieve}} logically relevant 3 D captured motions is useful in game and animation production. We presented a robust <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> metric based on the relative distances among the joints. Existing methods select a universal subset of features {{for all kinds of}} queries which may not well characterize the variations in different queries. To break through this limitation we proposed an Adaptive Feature Selection (AFS) method that abstracts the characteristics of the query by a Linear Regression Model, and different feature subsets can be selected according to the properties of the specific query. With a Graded Relevance Feedback (GRF) algorithm, we refined the feature subset that enhances the retrieval performance according to the graded relevance of the feedback samples. With an Ontology that predefines the <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> between motion classes in terms of graded relevance, the performance of the proposed AFS-GRF algorithm is evaluated and shown to outperform other class-specific feature selection and motion retrieval methods...|$|E

We illustrate our framework by addressing a set of physically relevant situations that clarify both the features and the potential of our proposal...|$|E
40|$|The article {{describes}} some peculiar {{functions of the}} pronoun all {{in the language of}} the regional press. The dependence of secondary pragmatic values of the quantifier pronouns on the genre setting, stylistic features, thematic dominants of the text, and the image of an author is shown, their coordination with the degree of subjectivity in presenting information is stated. It was proved that when referring to the pronoun all an author of the text describes the quantitative parameters of the situation or event, and also use them as resources for the generalized assessment and ideological setting formation, as well as the instruments of influence on the interpretative activity of readers. The pragmatic and ideological components in the content of such statements prevail over their informative ones. The intention to manipulate readers' opinions turns out to be more important than preserving such qualities as exactness, <b>relevance,</b> <b>logical</b> representation. The studies of the most regular and frequent structures and combinations with the pronoun all {{in the language of the}} analyzed newspapers revealed the following: on the basis of meanings 'inclusiveness' and 'generality' the secondary meanings of universality, normativity, verity, commitment, axiological values are being constructed, communication strategies and tactics of generalization, exaggeration, praise, persuasion, identification are implemented, significant intra-textual links are organized...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{relevance}} has gained considerable attention recently in areas {{as diverse as}} machine learning and knowledge representation. In this paper, we focus on one particular area, namely relevance {{in the context of}} logical theories. We are interested in answering questions like: when is a sentence (or theory) relevant to a set of propositions, or, when is one set of propositions relevant to another given some background theory? The answers are given semantically in terms of a logic of belief and syntactically in terms of prime implicates. Furthermore, rather than merely adding yet another set of definitions of relevance to the many that already exist, we also show close connections to two others that were recently proposed, thus pointing to some common ground {{at least as far as}} <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> is concerned. ...|$|E
40|$|Agents {{require a}} {{constant}} flow, {{and a high}} level of processing, of relevant semantic information, in order to interact successfully among themselves and with the environment in which they are embedded. Standard theories of information, however, are silent on the nature of epistemic relevance. In this paper, a subjectivist interpretation of epistemic relevance is developed and defended. It is based on a counterfactual and metatheoretical analysis of the degree of relevance of some semantic information i to an informee/agent a, {{as a function of the}} accuracy of i understood as an answer to a query q, given the probability that q might be asked by a. This interpretation of epistemic relevance vindicates a strongly semantic theory of information, according to which semantic information encapsulates truth. It accounts satisfactorily for several important applications and interpretations of the concept of relevant information in a variety of philosophical areas. And it interfaces successfully with current philosophical interpretations of causal and <b>logical</b> <b>relevance...</b>|$|E
40|$|Singapore {{amended the}} expert opinion {{evidence}} provisions in its Evidence Act (EA) in 2012. The criteria for admissibility have been broadened, but {{the courts are}} now also expressly given the discretion to exclude relevant expert opinion evidence if it is ‘in the interests of justice’. This article explains why the 2012 amendments have raised more questions than answered them. First, Parliament {{did not appear to}} have properly appreciated the distinction—as conceptualised by the EA—between legal and <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> and relevance and admissibility. Second, it did not appear to have appreciated the distinction between general and specific relevance. Third, the introduction of the judicial discretion is a concept that neither comports with the common law position nor coheres with the EA. Fourth, whether there should have been continued applicability of the ‘ultimate issue rule’ could have been clarified. At bottom, Parliament did not demonstrate a keen understanding of the conceptualisation, structure, and principles of the antiquated EA. A framework for determining relevance and admissibility of evidence that is in accordance with the EA is thus proposed. As a number of Commonwealth jurisdictions share similar legislation to the EA, this article may be of interest to such jurisdictions as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of ecological selection and geographical isolation in promoting and constraining genetic and phenotypic differentiation among populations is not always obvious. Interacting with divergent selection, restricted opportunity for gene flow may in some cases be as much a cause {{as a consequence of}} adaptation, with the latter being a hallmark of ecologi- cal speciation. Ecological speciation is well studied in parts of the native range of the three-spined stickleback. Here, we study this process in a recently invaded part of its range. Switzerland was colonized within the past 140 years from at least three different colonization events involving differ- ent stickleback lineages. They now occupy diverse habitats, ranging from small streams to the pelagic zone of large lakes. We use replicated systems of parapatric lake and stream populations, some of which trace their origins to different invasive lineages, to ask (i) whether phenotypic divergence occurred among populations inhabiting distinct habitats, (ii) whether trajec- tories of phenotypic divergence follow predictable parallel patterns and (iii) whether gene flow constrains divergent adaptation or vice versa. We find consistent phenotypic divergence between populations occupying distinct habitats. This involves parallel evolution in several traits with known eco- <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> in independent evolutionary lineages. Adaptive divergence supersedes homogenizing gene flow even at a small spatial scale. We find evidence that adaptive phenotypic divergence places constraints on gene flow over and above that imposed by geographical distance, signalling the early onset of ecological speciation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Psychology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The study {{identifies}} a basic psycho-logico assumption, {{coined the}} premise of locality, which is postulated by the author to permeate most of historical and contemporary psychological, philosophical and scientific thought. In light of the latter supposition the study explores the domain of quantum physics, whence an alternate psycho-logico assumption, {{the premise of}} non-locality, is conceptualised. The semantic implications of the non-locality premise are elucidated by investigating the meaning, character and symptoms of the locality premise. The indicative factors of the premise of locality are enumerated and consequently articulated upon the psychological thought of Jacques Lacan. The study demonstrates how the implicit locality assumptions in Lacan’s thinking are the provenance of the incompatibility of his mirror-stage formulation and the empirical findings of contemporary mirror self-recognition research. Assuming a premise of non-locality the author develops a psychological perception structure, coined dichotomous subject objectification. Dichotomous subject objectification represents the localized experience of the self as subject characterized by the capability for mirror self-recognition. Intuited by the premise of non-locality, the author introduces the notion of ‘non-local perceptum’. The physiological dynamics of non-local perceptum is conceptualised by explicating the meaning of ‘absolute power states’. The disposition of absolute power states in terms of dichotomous subject objectification is functionalised by correlating the latter with Michel Foucault’s conceptualisation of power-relations. Concerning the latter, particular attention is given to Foucault’s understanding of the modern day disparity between disciplinary power and sovereign power; the possible influence of this disparity on the psychological experience of the localized subject is subsequently investigated and a certain ‘cognitive dissonance’ is revealed. Localized psychological experience emanating through non-local perceptum is further illuminated by explicating the <b>logical</b> <b>relevance</b> of Socrates’ idiosyncratic flavour of ignorance. Implementing Socrates’ infamous dictum – I know that I don’t know – the study demonstrates how gazing {{through the prism of}} the locality premise creates scattered patterns of self-referential paradoxes and self-defeating scientific-logical suppositions. Subsequently the study illustrates that if, conversely, localized thought rather passes through the prism of the non-locality premise, the jumbled dissymmetries emanating from the locality prism are transfigured into symmetrical patterns of logical beauty. Concerning the notion of symmetry, the study explicates the importance there-of in terms of the non-locality premise by defining and differentiating the symmetrical [R] and the symmetrical [I]. The study evidences the pragmatic efficacy the notion of symmetry has already provided for the domain of physics in the past, and considers the vital importance of investigating the clinical applicability this notion might have for the domain of psychology in the future. This preliminary disquisition concerning the premise of non-locality is summarized in the conceptualisation of the ‘power to will’. The power to will evinces an alternative approach for addressing the paradigmatic reprise (postulated in terms of the ‘brilliant Greek mistake’) that confronts the post-modern mind...|$|E
40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{sometimes}} elusive line between expert and lay opinion testimony. Justice Holmes once remarked {{that the law is}} constantly drawing lines. That remark certainly holds true in Evidence law. On a daily basis trial judges must distinguish between character and noncharacter uses of evidence and differentiate hearsay from nonhearsay theories of <b>logical</b> <b>relevance.</b> The topic of this article is another evidentiary distinction: that between lay opinions and expert opinions. That distinction has assumed tremendous importance since 1993. In that year, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 was amended to prescribe mandatory pre-discovery disclosures. One of the most important parts of that scheme is a mandate that the proponent of a testifying expert provide the opposition with a detailed report previewing the expert’s opinion. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 imposes a similar requirement for an expert report. However, there is no requirement under either rule for such a report when the opinion is lay in nature. In the same year, the Supreme Court handed down its celebrated decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). Daubert announced a new empirical validation test for the admissibility of scientific testimony. In 1999 in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U. S. 137 (1999), the Court expanded Daubert and held that the proponent of any type of expert testimony must establish objective indicia of the reliability of the testimony. Like the Civil Rule 26 and Criminal Rule 16 amendments, Daubert and Kumho are inapplicable to lay opinion testimony. These two 1993 developments have created a strong incentive for litigants to characterize their witnesses’ opinions as lay rather than expert. If the judge accepts that characterization, {{there is no need for}} the litigant to file a Rule 26 report or lay a Daubert foundation. Unfortunately, as Part I of the enclosed article points out, the courts are experiencing difficulty drawing the line between lay and expert opinions. Part I considers several possible bases for distinguishing the two types of opinions that have been proposed in the past. Part I demonstrates that each of those potential bases is unsatisfactory. Part II argues that in order to properly differentiate between the two types of opinions, the court should focus on the underlying reasoning processes. In the case of both types of opinions, the witness arrives at the opinion by evaluating a case-specific fact in light of a generalization. However, the two types of opinions differ in both: (1) how the witness obtains the case-specific information; and (2) how they validate and derive the generalization. Part III of the article explains how the courts may use the insights discussed in Part II to both differentiate between the two types of opinion and determine the admissibility of such opinions. Although the courts have struggled to draw the line in these cases, Part III demonstrates that the courts can draw the line with confidence by employing the analysis proposed in Part II...|$|E
