40|$|This is {{a pioneer}} and {{comprehensive}} study of the political geography of the Red Sea region. Background studies on geopolitics, physical environment, and resources are offered. The thesis is especially concerned with three basic American interests in the Red Sea. Firstly, energy interest: United States deep concern about uninterrupted flow of oil supplies from the Gulf to the former {{as well as to}} its Western allies creates an increasing American interest in the Red Sea route, particularly since the Gulf tanker war in 1982. Such interest is clearly seen in United States political, technical, and financial involvement in the Suez Canal (1975) and in the current <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipelines</b> from the Gulf to the Red Sea. Disruption of those supplies to the US or its allies may result in American use of force. Secondly, shipping interest: such concern is clearly shown in United States involvement in matters relating to the Suez Canal, the Straits of Bab al Mandeb and Tiran. Freedom of navigation through the Red Sea, especially for Israeli ships, is a major American interest in this respect. United States refusal to sign the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea may involve the former into conflict with some Red Sea States, particularly when American nuclear-powered vessels sail from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean or vice versa. Thirdly, Soviet involvement in Afghanistan, the Gulf war and the resurgence of Islam are becoming increasingly worrying to the US, because such developments are feared as a destabilizing factor to the stability of the oil producing states of the Arabian peninsula, with particular reference to Saudi Arabia, the most important Red Sea state...|$|E
40|$|This {{study on}} {{protected}} {{areas in the}} North Sea {{has been carried out}} for the Directorate of Nature, Environment and Fauna Management of the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries. It is part of a project (project number 22) of the Nature Policy Plan of this Ministry. The objective of the study, as defined by the Directorate of Nature, Environment and Fauna Management, is to review the necessity and feasibility of the designation of protected areas in the Dutch sector of the North Sea as a contribution to the conservation and, where possible, rehabilitation of a natural diversity of ecologically valuable areas with their specific communities and characteristic species. The objectives for the designation of marine protected areas are given in chapter 2 of the report: To preserve, rehabilitate and develop natural values in the Dutch sector of the North Sea by limiting the effects of those human activities that cause detectable changes in the North Sea ecosystem. To protect groups of animals which {{are an integral part of}} the natural values of the Dutch sector of the North Sea and whose existence or 'normal' functioning is currently threatened within this part of the North Sea. The study only addresses those human activities which can be controlled within the boundaries of the Dutch sector of the North Sea itself: fisheries, off-shore mining, sand and gravel extraction, military activities, shipping, pipelines and telecommunication cables. Pollution from land-based sources, atmospheric deposition, dumping and calamities have therefore not been considered in this report. Chapter 3 contains a description of the North Sea ecosystem (plankton, benthos, fish, seabirds and marine mammals). An effort was made to develop an ecological zoning for each of these groups of animals (see map on back cover). In many cases it has been possible to present relevant (a) biotic parameters. These parameters have played an important role in the final choice of protected areas. The distribution of plankton is to a large extent related to the position of water-bodies in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The following areas can be identified: coastal water, southern North Sea, central North Sea and the Frisian Front area. The distribution of micro-, meio- and macrobenthos is largely determined by sediment types (sand, mud, gravel, stones). By and large, the following clusters can be identified with respect to infauna (macrobenthos living in the sediments) and epifauna (macrobenthos living on the seafloor) : the Southern Bight including the coastal zone, Oystergrounds, Dogger Bank, the area north of the Dogger Bank, the Frisian Front area and the Klaverbank. The distribution of fish is not only determined by such factors as temperature, food, sediment type and water depth, but also by the presence of spawning and nursery areas and the location of migratory routes. With respect to seabirds, four different areas can be identified: the coastal zone, the Southern Bight, the Frisian Front area and the northern part of the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The distribution of seabirds is determined by such factors as the presence of breeding areas, migratory and wintering movements, feeding methods and availability of food. The distribution of marine mammals depends on the species. Porpoises are found both in the northern part of the Dutch sector of the North Sea and in the coastal zone north of the Frisian Islands. Dolphins are rarely seen in coastal waters. The effects of human activities in the Dutch sector of the North Sea are discussed in chapter 4 and can be summarized as follows. Fishery is a frequent large-scale activity which throughout the Dutch sector of the North Sea has resulted in considerable changes within the ecosystem. There is hardly any place where benthic communities can develop undisturbed. At least 10 benthic species have disappeared or their numbers have decreased substantially. The spawning stocks and stability of many fish stocks have decreased substantially as well. Some bird species, however, have increased in numbers. In addition, intensive fisheries have possibly contributed to the decline of sea mammal populations. Offshore mining can, as a result of discharges of cuttings contaminated with oil-based muds (OBM), result in long-term local effects on the benthic system. Effects of water-based muds (WBM) cannot be ruled out, but will be found in smaller areas over a shorter period of time than the effects of OBM. Effects of discharges of production water have not been observed but could occur locally with effects on plankton, fish and birds. It seems unlikely that acoustic disturbance by offshore mining (including seismic surveys) should affect sea mammals which are more that 100 m away from the installation producing the disturbance. Some disturbance may occur as a result of ship and helicopter movements associated with offshore mining. Sand and gravel extraction and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipelines</b> and telecommunication cables will result in local effects on the benthic system. The destruction of shellfish beds in the coastal zone by sand or gravel extraction might have long-term effects on scoters. It is not possible to quantify the effects of substances introduced into the marine environment by shipping and military activities. Noise produced by such activities may affect communication between sea mammals and behaviour of seabirds. There may be a recovery of those populations which are affected by fisheries. discharges from mining installations, sand and gravel extraction and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipelines</b> and telecommunication cables after termination of these activities in certain parts of the Dutch sector of the North Sea. This would contribute to the recovery and conservation of these populations in the North Sea in general (see chapter 5). In general, recovery of communities may take 1 to 20 years (benthos and fish), 5 to 50 years (for seabirds) and 20 to more then 50 years (for sea mammals). Recovery will be impossible if gravel extraction has resulted in the removal of the entire layer of gravel on the seafloor. Chapters 6 and 7 give the objectives and related criteria which are used for the designation and the selection of areas which qualify for a protected status. The first criterion addresses the extent to which specific activities have developed into a threat to the existence or normal functioning of groups of animals or species in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. Fishery activities result in large-scale effects on a large number of ecological groups (benthos, fish, seabirds, marine mammals) in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. Discharges of cuttings contaminated with OBM result in long-term local benthic effects. Other discharges by offshore mining installations and sand and gravel extraction have local but possibly large-scale effects on benthos in specific relatively small areas such as the Frisian Front area or the Klaverbank. The second criterion addresses the question whether a prohibition or restriction of certain human activities in specific areas would reduce the threat to those groups of animals or species which were identified through the application of the first criterion. Alternatives for prohibitive or restrictive measures are also discussed. The designation of protected areas where certain activities are prohibited or restricted has the potential to contribute to the conservation or recovery of threatened species. In a number of cases there is no alternative other than the designation of protected areas. This is true of the threat to the benthos and fish which is caused by fisheries activities in the (Dutch sector of the) North Sea, and, in specific relatively small areas, it is also true of the threat to benthos caused by discharges from offshore mining installations and by sand and gravel extraction. The third criterion is used for identifying the areas most suitable for a protected Status on the basis of the ecology of groups of animals or species which need protection. Ecological criteria such as diversity, representativeness. integrity and vulnerability have been used. The application of ecological criteria results in the general conclusion that, within the Dutch sector of the North Sea, the following types of areas qualify for a protected status: a sandy area, a muddy area, an area with frontal characteristics and a gravel area. A protected area should contain coastal waters and an adequate depth gradient. An unbroken area which contains areas of all types would be the most effective option for protection. For the protection of benthos species with a limited migration, areas of circa one hundred square kilometers each should be sufficient; for fish species with an extensive migration pattern it would be necessary to protect a large part of the whole North Sea. It is concluded that for the protection of those species which are most characteristic of the Dutch sector of the North Sea it is necessary to protect an area with a total surface of some 31 ICES blocks (each some 60 x 60 square kilometers). The fourth criterion addresses the question whether there are adequate legal instruments to ensure effective protection of the selected areas. On the basis of existing legal instruments it is, in principle, possible to protect these areas. However; there are certain problems associated with measures which are required with respect to fisheries, gravel extraction and offshore mining. On the basis of the above criteria it is concluded that two areas within the Dutch sector of the North Sea qualify for a protected status: 1. An area directly northwest of the Frisian Islands (see Figs A and B). In this unbroken area of some 10, 000 square kilometers it will be possible to protect a combination of different types of benthic communities (coastal waters, sandy bottoms, the Frisian Front area, muddy areas and restricted areas with gravel and stones). The area will also have an adequate depth gradient. The proposed area contains important spawning and nursery areas for fish (including squid) and habitats of many (non-commercial) fish species. Seasonal migratory routes to and from the Wadden Sea are concentrated in this area. Relatively large numbers of porpoises as well as dolphins and seabirds occur in this area. Protection of this area also strengthens the functioning of the Wadden Sea as a nursery area and supports the recolonisation of benthos in the Wadden Sea after, for instance, severe winters. There are two alternative options for the exact location of the area to be protected. The first alternative (Fig. A) has been chosen especially with an emphasis on conservation and recovery of the diversity of communities in the Dutch sector of the North Sea. The second alternative (Fig. B) more closely relates to existing measures regarding fisheries. The proportion of muddy areas is very low in this alternative. An expansion of the proposed area in an easterly direction could be considered only if it connected the area with similar protected areas in the German sector of the North Sea. An expansion of the proposed area in a southerly direction would more closely relate to the ecological interests of the Wadden Sea. The following protective measures are proposed for this area: The area will be closed for all types of fisheries throughout the year; Discharges from offshore mining installations which contain oil will be prevented (OBM) or minimized (production water); Additional area-specific protective measures with respect to offshore mining, shipping, military activities, sand extraction, dumping and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>pipelines</b> can be considered whenever the situation in this area calls for such measures. Such measures should also be considered for areas to be used as reference areas for scientific research; The application of policies resulting from the implementation of international conventions with respect to conservation (the EC Bird Directive, the Conventions of Bonn, Berne and Ramsar, the proposed EC Habitat Directive). 2. Klaverbank (see Figs A and B). The Klaverbank, the only gravel area of importance in the Dutch sector of the North Sea, has a still relatively undisturbed benthic fauna which is specific to this type of area. The Klaverbank (approximately 800 square kilometers) should be given a protected status under which gravel extraction is prohibited. and discharges from offshore mining installations which contain oil will be prevented (OBM) or minimized (production water). Fisheries too should be prohibited but the limited size of this area rules out effective implementation and enforcement of such a measure. It is therefore advisable to develop proposals in cooperation with the United Kingdom for the designation of a protected area in the UK sector of the North Sea which should contain a large gravel area and possibly also the Klaverbank. If a decision is taken to protect these areas, it will be necessary to develop a management plan. Chapter 8 gives a possible outline for such a management plan, including certain relevant issues. Firstly, it will be necessary to define objectives for these specific areas in addition to the objectives already defined for the designation of protected areas in general. Secondly, it will be necessary to attune measures for the management of these areas to the objectives of their protection. A management plan will also have to address the organizational structure required for effective management of these areas. Arrangements for adequate enforcement and effective control of measures taken are also necessary. Programmes for scientific research will have to be developed...|$|E

In experiments in a stiff pressure lifting pipelines, collapse is always localized as shown in Figures 3 and 4. However,because pipe’s localization takes place after the pressure maximum, the collapse pressure yielded by the 2 -D analysis suffices for most cases. Exceptions are pipes with local imperfections, in the form of dents.

A time series forecasting scheme is employed. Based on a sequence of preceding observations forecasts are made over lead times of 3 hr to 72 hr. Large differences in the accuracy of the forecasts were not seen when alternative forecasting tools were employed and hence the user is free to use any one of them as per her convenience and confidence. A graphical user interface has been developed that operates on the received wave height data from the field and produces the forecasts and further makes them accessible to any user located anywhere in the world...|$|R

This thesis {{addresses}} some of {{the issues}} involved in using numerical methods to simulate the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> an offshore <b>pipeline,</b> the objective being to contribute to the expertise of the South African offshore technology. Of particular interest is the prediction of the stresses in the pipe during such an event. The thesis concentrates on the use and suitability of the finite element method to simulate the important aspects of the pipelaying problem. ABAQUS, a nonlinear general purpose finite element code, was chosen as numerical tool, and nonlinear effects such as geometry and drag, as well as contact and lift-off at the boundaries, are included in the models. The analysis is performed in two parts: in the static analysis the displaced equilibrium position <b>of</b> the <b>pipeline</b> under self weight, buoyancy and barge tension is sought, whilst the response due to wave action and barge motion is of interest in the dynamic analysis. Numerical experiments show the suitability of ABAQUS to model the behaviour of slender structures under both static loads and dynamic excitations...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyReeling is {{offshore}} pipeline installation method which delivers fast and cost effective <b>pipeline</b> <b>laying.</b> Each <b>of</b> the <b>pipeline</b> segment are welded onshore, the long section <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> then spooled onto a large diameter of reel. However, reeling installation method causes large plastic strain to the pipeline girth welds. Due {{to the existing}} cracks commonly found in the girth welds, the plastic strain will cause possible crack growth. To derive the acceptance criteria for pipeline girth weld defects and sustain the integrity <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> during reeling installation, an Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) is required. The objective of this thesis is to perform Engineering Critical Assessment (ECA) <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> girth welds during reeling installation particularly in spooling on and reeling off stages using LINKpipe and CRACKWISE software and also to perform the ECA for clad/lined pipes using LINKpipe. CRACKWISE {{is one of the}} software {{that can be used for}} the flaw assessment <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> girth welds during reeling installation. In order to reduce the conservatism of existing failure assessment methods, SINTEF recently have developed a new failure assessment approach which depends on finite element calculations <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> model. LINKpipe is based on four-node ANDES shell elements and a non-linear line-spring element. The software established an efficient and adequately accurate model even for large level of strain, thus it has potential as an alternative ECA tool for pipelines subjected to plastic strains. Moreover, the new bi-metallic shell elements that were developed in LINKpipe making it capable analyzing defect assessments on clad and lined pipes. Based on the analyses performed for the thesis work the influence of misalignment for the critical crack size curve is less significant compared to the effect of residual stress. On the contrary, pipe misalignment in LINKpipe ECA simulations can show the effect of increasing the Crack Driving Force very significantly, which makes the critical crack size, became smaller. Whereas the residual stress showed little influence in the prediction of the critical crack size using LINKpipe. When the maximum possible misalignment (which is 1. 95 mm) along with the residual stress is applied, the critical crack size curves resulted from CRACKWISE and LINKpipe, are relatively close to each other. However, CRACKWISE tends to be conservative for long crack lengths (> 90 mm) compared to LINKpipe, whereas for short crack lengths (< 90 mm) CRACKWISE yields less conservative critical crack sizes...|$|R

Sonya runs against Tim for Mayor and wins. On becoming mayor she is confronted by protesters, Paige among them, against removal of trees for the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> a <b>pipeline.</b> Sonya hires Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson) as her assistant, but after he allows Tom Quill (Kane Felsinger) to view council documents, Sonya is forced to fire him. Tom begins threatening the Rebecchis, taking a photograph of Nell and breaking into the house. The Lassiter's boiler room explodes, and Sonya realises Toadie is trapped under the rubble. He is soon rescued. Sonya's uncle Walter (Greg Stone) arrives in town to reconcile with her. Sonya decides to read the accident report about her parents' deaths and learns Walter was there that night. He then reveals that he is her father, {{and that he was}} arguing with his brother about telling her the truth when the car crashed. Sonya also learns that she has a half-sister called Zoe Mitchell (Nicola Billie Gullotti), who has leukaemia and requires a bone marrow transplant. Sonya takes a blood test, but is found not to be a match, so Walter suggests that Nell be tested and Sonya goes through with it behind Toadie's back. Nell is a match, but Toadie and Sonya refuse to let her go through with the transplant. Callum is also found to be a match and Zoe and Walter leave to continue her treatment.|$|R

The co-authors have proven expedient application of chrysolite-cement pipes both in the event <b>of</b> trenchless pipe <b>laying,</b> and in cases <b>of</b> other pipe <b>laying</b> methods, especially in rural areas. Permanent loads, including weight and soil pressure (q), own weight of pipes, ownrp. weight of the heat carrier, influence of temperature and humidity of the heat carrier, andinternal pressure were considered in the research into the properties and installation conditions of chrysolite-cement pipes. The research findings have proven that chrysolitecement pipelines demonstrate a 35 – 50 % safety factor {{in the event of}} subterranean trenchless pipe laying at the depth of. 8 + meters, depending on the pipe diameter, types and consistency of the soil, and traffic intensity of the motor road above the <b>pipeline.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> temperature fields <b>of</b> a chrysolite-cement <b>pipeline</b> demonstrates that chrysolite-cement pipes can be laid using a simplified thermal insulation pattern due to their low heat conductivity, if the pipe wall is sufficiently thick. Boiler ash widely available in rural areas can be used for insulation purposes, or, alternatively, no thermal insulation can be used. Any works associated with the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> pressurized chrysolite-cement <b>pipelines</b> are to comply with all design-related requirements. The works pre-construction assignments, excavation works, delivery, visual examination and installation <b>of</b> <b>pipeline</b> elements, thermal insulation <b>of</b> pipes, <b>pipeline</b> strength and tightness testing, thermal insulation of ring joints. Any pipes and joints are to be thoroughly examined and tested. Arrangement of hot water supply networks made of chrysolite-cement pipes is efficient in terms of their steel consumption rate, labour resources consumption rate, capex and reduced costs. The bigger the pipe diameter, the higher the efficiency of hot water supply networks made of chrysolite-cement pipes.
