This paper examines the cointergation and causal link among household disposable income, household savings, debt service ratio, <b>lending</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> consumer price index and household debt in South Africa. An Autoregressive Distributed Lag and Granger causality techniques was used to analyse data collected from the South African Reserve Bank and Quantec from 1984 to 2014. The results of Autoregressive Distributed Lag test revealed cointegrating relationships between household debt and debt service ratio as well as household debt and <b>lending</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> However, there is no long run cointegrating relationship between household disposable income, household savings and consumer price index with household debt.

For the purpose, we employ two indicators of human capital development that are health expenditures and illiteracy rate and our empirical estimates confirm the efficiency seeking behavior of the MNEs. This study differs from the existing empirical literature-earlier FDI was mainly driven by market seeking motive and latter on by efficiency seeking motive- by finding the importance of both motives at the same time. Excessive government consumption and military expenditures are comparatively more significant, reflecting non-market friendly approaches.

Adopting an approach distinct from the literature, this paper employs a continuous measure of the accumulated arrears of interest payments and principal repayments on private and official external debt {{as a proxy for}} sovereign default. Apart from the importance of the current account balance, short-term debt, credit to the private sector, output, <b>lending</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> and the exchange rate, empirical results show that the presence of the HIPC relief program is found to mask a portion of the true effects of the economic and political factors on debt arrears. In addition, in contrast to middle-income countries, political risk exhibits a negative impact on accumulated arrears in low-income countries. Arrears are found to be responsive to <b>lending</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> only in the middle-income and nonHIPC countries. Moreover, in the HIPC and low-income countries arrears are found to be more sensitive to volatility in the exchange rates.
