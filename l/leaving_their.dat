40|$|Thesis (MSW) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. The {{researcher}} {{has worked}} in the field of foster care in social work for a few years in Ireland and England and during this time has seen that foster carers experience some kind of grief and loss when children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. The researcher wanted to explore the emotional experience of foster carers when foster children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the emotional experience of short–term foster carers when foster children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. This research aim resulted in the following research question: “What is the emotional experience of short–term foster carers when foster children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care?” The researcher used a conceptual framework that focused on the Gestalt approach and foster care as background to the empirical study. A qualitative approach was used to address the research question. A case study strategy was used to explore and describe the experience of short–term foster carers when foster children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. A non–probability purposive sampling technique was used and the population consisted of short–term foster carers in Oxfordshire, England, working with children in foster care. A total of nine participants took part in the study. Semi–structured one–to–one interviews were used to obtain accurate and reliable evidence of the emotional experience of foster carers when foster children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. An interview schedule was used for the semi–structured interviews, which was derived from the literature review. The interview data was then transcribed and analysed. The six themes that were identified are (1) the general emotions of foster carers when children <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care, (2) the difficulty foster carers experience to cope when a child <b>leaves</b> <b>their</b> care, (3) the experience of contact with a foster child when the child has moved on, (4) concerns that foster carers have when a foster child <b>leaves</b> <b>their</b> care, (5) the support experienced when a foster child moves on, and (6) the foster carers’ own children’s emotional experience when children v in care <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> care. From the data analysis sub–themes were identified under the main themes and were discussed according to the literature review. Conclusions were drawn for each of the six themes and sub–themes that were identified. The researcher concluded and recommended that more support, guidance, advice and input are needed for foster carers after a child <b>leaves</b> <b>their</b> care. The foster carer needs to have more of a voice and must be seen as an invaluable part of the multi–disciplinary fostering team. Improvements in the fostering system are needed to improve the emotional experience of the foster carers, but also to ultimately improve the retention of foster carers within the foster care system.

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by <b>leaving</b> <b>their</b> character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reducing {{turnover}} {{is essential}} to address health worker shortages {{in the public sector}} and improve the quality of services. This study examines factors associated with Ethiopian nurses' intention to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs. METHODS: Survey respondents (a sample of 425 nurses at 122 facilities) rated the importance of 20 items in decisions to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs and reported whether they intended to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs in the next year. Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to identify predictors of nurses' intentions to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs. RESULTS: Half (50. 2 %) the nurses said they intended to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs in the next year. A multivariate analysis identified three significant predictors of nurses' intention to <b>leave</b> <b>their</b> jobs: holding a university degree rather than a diploma (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2. 246, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 212, 4. 163; p< 0. 01), having worked fewer years in the public health system (adjusted OR= 0. 948, 95 % CI= 0. 914, 0. 982; p< 0. 01) and rating the importance of limited opportunities for professional development more highly (adjusted OR= 1. 398, 95 % CI= 1. 056, 1. 850; p< 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Interventions to increase the retention of nurses at public health facilities in Ethiopia should target young nurses who are completing their compulsory service obligation and nurses with a university degree. They should include both non-financial and financial incentives...|$|R
