5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa in 1950, Harvey {{was offered a}} job in captain Lindsay Hassett's sports store. Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket. Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment. He was paid £300 a year, but nevertheless <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married, due to poverty. He used the same cricket uniforms {{for more than five}} years.|$|E

She entered the University of Delaware as a part-time student in the fall semester of that year. Meissner trained for most of her career in Newark, Delaware at the University of Delaware Figure Skating Club, the club she represents in competition. Until February 2008, Meissner lived in Maryland with her family, and <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> while attending college. Following her coaching change after the 2008 U.S. Championships, Meissner moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.|$|E

Mao's paternal grandmother, Liu, {{had died in}} 1884, nine years before his birth. When Zedong was two years old, his mother {{gave birth to her}} fourth child, Mao Zemin, with a further son, Mao Zetan, being born when Zedong was eleven. She also gave birth to two daughters, both of whom died in infancy, although soon after Zetan's birth the couple adopted a baby girl, Zejian, who was the daughter of one of Mao's paternal uncles.|$|E

During this time Medtner fell in love with Anna Mikhaylovna Bratenskaya (1877–1965), a {{respected}} violinist and the young wife of his older brother Emil. Later, when World War I broke out, Emil was interned in Germany where he had been studying. He generously gave Anna the freedom to marry his brother. Medtner and Anna were married in 1918.|$|E
25|$|Because the UDR did {{not live}} in barracks like other {{soldiers}} but <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> (in many cases with families), they were vulnerable to attack when off-duty. A number of soldiers were issued with personal weapons. Some of these were stolen from soldiers homes. Part-time soldiers were most at risk as they had day jobs which often took them to unsafe areas. Most UDR soldiers killed in the Troubles were attacked off duty.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Cayce {{formed a}} {{business}} partnership {{with his father}} to sell Woodmen of the World Insurance; however, in March {{he was struck by}} severe laryngitis that resulted in a complete loss of speech.

He began an apprenticeship at the photography studio of W. R. Bowles in Hopkinsville, and eventually became quite talented in his trade.|$|E

25|$|Upon their father's {{death in}} 1933, Helen, who still <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> {{received}} $14 million from his estate. She received another $10 million bequest in 1935 upon {{the death of}} her mother, plus newspaper stock and possession of the family's Humboldt Street mansion. May received only a $25,000 annual allowance from a trust, and sued her sister over her mother's estate. After a pitched, three-year legal battle, May was awarded $5 million cash from her mother's estate, some cash from her father's estate, 15% of the Denver Post stock, and additional real estate. The court case divided the sisters even further and they cut off all communication with each other.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, {{the system}} was changed with regard to both cavalry (1536) and {{infantry}} (1544), to provide an army that could be quickly mobilized. This was still done through impressment for the infantry, and tax exemptions for those who financed horsemen. The new system gave the conscripted soldiers a means of subsistence between campaigns, by making {{a whole group of}} farmers responsible for the keep of each soldier. While the soldiers would be hired and salaried full-time if at war, they <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and off duty in peacetime. This meant that it would always be possible to raise a trained army in case of war.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Empire, the 293 firemen of Paris were underpaid, untrained and poorly equipped. They usually <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and had second jobs, usually as shoemakers. They reported to both the Prefect of the Seine and the Prefect of Police, which caused bureaucratic disputes. They possessed only two ladders, one kept at the National Library, and other at the market of Les Halles. Their shortcomings became evident on 1 July 1810, when a fire broke out at the Austrian Embassy on the Chausée d'Antin during a ball given to celebrate the wedding of Napoleon and Marie-Louise of Austria. Napoleon and Marie-Louise escaped unharmed, but the wife of the Austrian Ambassador and the Princess de la Leyen were killed, and a dozen other guests died later from their burns. Napoleon himself wrote a report of the event, noting that only six firemen had appeared, and several of them were drunk. Napoleon issued a decree on September 18, 1811 which militarized the firemen into a battalion of sapeur-pompiers, with four companies of one hundred forty-two men each, under the Prefect of Police and the Ministry of the Interior. The firemen were required to live in four barracks built for them around the city, and to have watchmen on duty around the city.|$|E

500|$|Bacher {{entered the}} University of Michigan, where {{he joined the}} Kappa Sigma [...] {{fraternity}} and lived in the frat house. He became the house manager in his sophomore year, but moved back home in his junior year to concentrate on physics. At Randall's suggestion he applied to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which he entered in 1926 to study for his doctorate. His fees were paid by his family, but his father {{had a heart attack}} and could no longer afford them, so in 1927 Bacher moved back to Ann Arbor, where he <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> and attended the University of Michigan. He received a Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowship from General Electric.|$|E
500|$|Chadwick {{chose to}} attend Victoria University of Manchester, which he entered in 1908. He meant to study maths, but {{enrolled}} in physics by mistake. Like most students, he <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> walking the [...] {{to the university}} and back each day. At {{the end of his}} first year, he was awarded a Heginbottom Scholarship to study physics. The physics department was headed by Ernest Rutherford, who assigned research projects to final-year students, and he instructed Chadwick to devise a means of comparing the amount of radioactive energy of two different sources. The idea was that they could be measured in terms of the activity of [...] of radium, a unit of measurement which would become known as the curie. Rutherford's suggested approach was unworkable—something Chadwick knew but was afraid to tell Rutherford—so Chadwick pressed on, and eventually devised the required method. The results became Chadwick's first paper, which, co-authored with Rutherford, was published in 1912. He graduated with first class honours in 1911.|$|E
500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I am sick at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, but to me it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{a member}} of Harvard's class of 1829, Holmes <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{for the first few}} years of his college career rather than in the dormitories. Since he {{measured}} only [...] "five feet three inches when standing in a pair of substantial boots", the young student had no interest in joining a sports team or the Harvard Washington Corps. Instead, he allied himself with the [...] "Aristocrats" [...] or [...] "Puffmaniacs", a group of students who gathered in order to smoke and talk. As a town student and the son of a minister, however, he was able to move between social groups. He also became a friend of Charles Chauncy Emerson (brother of Ralph Waldo Emerson), who was a year older. During second year, Holmes was one of 20 students awarded the scholastic honor Deturs, which came with a copy of The Poems of James Graham, John Logan, and William Falconer. Despite his scholastic achievements, the young scholar admitted to a schoolmate from Andover that he did not [...] "study as hard as I ought to'. He did, however, excel in languages and took classes in French, Italian and Spanish.|$|E
500|$|In 1937, Ernest was {{presented}} with a £92 university scholarship, and worked in a research position under Mark Oliphant, {{the chairman of the}} physics department. The scholarship was insufficient to cover his living expenses, so he <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and commuted by bus and train. The project he shared with another student was to determine if the weak alpha particle activity of samarium was due to the electron or gamma ray components of cosmic rays. The work had to be carried out in a coal mine, [...] below the surface. Upon completion of these experiments, Titterton was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1938. As a requirement of his scholarship, Ernest was required to become a teacher for a year. This met with a lukewarm reception, but he graduated with his Diploma in Education, and was even awarded the Elizabeth Cadbury Prize for achieving top marks in the class. As part of his training, he taught at King Edward's School, Birmingham. To support himself, he also taught three nights a week at Birmingham Central Technical College. With his diploma in hand, he became a teacher at Bridgnorth Endowed School, a coeducational secondary school and sixth form located in the market town of Bridgnorth in the rural county of Shropshire.|$|E

Many of the leading literary and cultural figures of the time visited the flat, and {{it was here that}} she was able to spend time with Frank Dalby Davison whom she admitted many years later had been her love. She wrote of this relationship to her writer friend, Jean Devanny, [...] "I was deeply in love with him ... We were lovers for eight years ... In 1942 I knew things were coming to an end ... I was, as he said, very naïve". She admitted to Devanny that the break-up of this relationship was the cause of a serious illness.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his first}} two years of medical school Draper <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> but for his final two years he and a roommate rented a place near the school and hospital. [...] Shortly before his {{graduation}} he was married in Detroit, Michigan on April 6, 1910, to Margaret Gansevoort Maxon (October 29, 1883 – April 28, 1967), the daughter of William D. and Anna (Lush) Maxon of Detroit, but originally from Waterford, New York. [...] Margaret had attended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in classics. [...] A month after his marriage, Draper earned his MD degree, then went to Washington D.C. to take the United States Public Health Service entrance exam. [...] In June, he and Margaret went to a summer cottage in Morrisville, Vermont awaiting the exam results and news of his first assignment.|$|E

Their precocious and bookish son George attended The Roxbury Latin School, which then had about 100 pupils. George consistently led his class in marks and won a scholarship to Harvard, which he entered in 1878. As a Freshman, he <b>lived</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Boston and walked to Harvard every day to save money. In his Freshman year, Kittredge came in second in his class of 181 to mathematician Frank Nelson Cole, but in Sophomore, Junior, and Senior years he was first, garnering highest honors in his chosen field of classics.|$|E
