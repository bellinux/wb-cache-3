25|$|Between 1933 and 1938 korenizatsiya was not {{actually}} repealed. Its provisions merely stopped being enforced. There also began purges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaderships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national republics and territories. The charge against non-Russians {{was that they}} had instigated national strife and oppressed the Russians or other minorities in the republics. In 1937 it was proclaimed that local elites had become hired agents and their goal had become dismemberment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and <b>the</b> restoration <b>of</b> capitalism. Now it was time to see that the Russians got fair treatment. National <b>leaderships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> republics and autonomies were liquidated en masse.|$|R

40|$|The {{leadership}} book examined is <b>The</b> <b>Leadership</b> Style <b>of</b> Jesus by Michael Youssef. This book is an enlightening {{book that}} challenges {{the reader to}} consider their own characteristics. The author examines five parts <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> including <b>the</b> beginnings <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>the</b> qualities <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>the</b> temptations <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>the</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> and <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>leadership.</b> Each section includes sub-segments that pose challenges, scenarios and stories related to the topic at hand. After reading the book, I have evaluated three sections I found the most interesting including forgiveness as a quality <b>of</b> <b>leadership,</b> anger as a temptation <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> and where leaders come from as <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> is debated...|$|R

5|$|After Byzantium, the Spartans were {{allegedly}} {{eager to}} end their involvement in the war. The Spartans were supposedly of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war's purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. In the aftermath of Mycale, the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion. Xanthippus, the Athenian commander at Mycale, had furiously rejected this; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies, and the Athenians, if no-one else, would protect the Ionians. This marks {{the point at which}} the <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians. With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium, the <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenians became explicit.|$|E
5|$|After Norman's death, Antares {{took over}} as leader and channeled {{messages}} from her. Others later began channeling her, and recordings of her messages were replayed.

In the 2000s, Unarius' leaders emphasized individual transformation, focusing on a gradual spiritual change in humanity.|$|E
50|$|It is {{speculated that}} the obvious {{political}} errors leading to World War I and World War II with their consequent horrors and, thereafter, <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> thermonuclear weapons by the opposing powers exerted a restraining influence on <b>the</b> <b>leaderships</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major powers.

5|$|After this, Khrushchev {{made many}} desperate {{attempts}} to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it useless and denied any proposal.

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons. Allen's appointment was controversial {{due to his}} strong ties to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and because of concerns {{that he would be}} unable to attend functions on Saturdays due to his faith's strict observation of the sabbath. Allen resigned from his <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E

5|$|Among {{those who}} {{defected}} to El Buen Pastor Church was Lino Figueroa, the pastor who had re-baptized González in 1938.

The whole congregation was re-baptized as well, as now Joaquín was the source of baptismal legitimacy and authenticity. With all those who had challenged him gone, Joaquín was able to consolidate <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church.|$|E
5|$|As a {{proxy for}} his father, Romulus made no {{decisions}} and left no monuments, though coins bearing his name were minted in Rome, Milan, Ravenna, and Gaul.

When Orestes refused, the tribes revolted under the <b>leadership</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scirian chieftain Odoacer. Orestes was captured near Piacenza on 28 August 476 and swiftly executed.|$|E
