30|$|In thermal EOR, steam is {{injected}} into the reservoir to reduce the viscosity of the heavy oil and/or vaporize the oil so as it may flow and can be extracted easily. Thermal-based EOR also involves the in-situ combustion entailing heat generation within the reservoir containing <b>low</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>oil.</b> Increased heat within the reservoir reduces the surface tension and increases the permeability of oil. Thermal EOR is usually applied in case of Shallow reservoirs (which are less than 3, 000  feet deep) of heavy crude oil. In addition, this technique is also mainly applied to large fields which can provide high return on investment. CO 2 -based EOR is being used widely and also depends upon economic availability of CO 2 from natural and/or industrial resources. This method has worldwide demonstrated its efficiency, where for instance in 2006, about 37  % of oil production in the US was contributed by CO 2 -based EOR.|$|E

Moreover, some of the traps are shallow, and <b>low</b> API <b>gravity</b> <b>oils</b> are found. Massive meteoricwater infiltration and local biodegradation have been proposed to explain these observations, but requiresome in-depth investigation to be confirmed. In order to provide some new insights into the Llanos Basinpetroleum system, we performed a natural gas geochemical survey over different areas of the basin,including stable isotopes of hydrocarbon, non-hydrocarbon and noble gases. Results show that the influenceof meteoric water infiltration is dominant in the shallow area eastward, but decreases towardsthe deepest part of the basin westward. A general gas/oil phase separation differentiates gas-depletedbiodegraded, shallow reservoirs from deep gas-rich less-altered reservoirs. Data suggest that there is ashallow biodegradation associated with meteoric water circulation in the Carbonera Fm, while some ofthe deeper heavy oils (Mirador, Une fms) were more likely produced by an early mature source rock. However, biodegraded oil later mixed with less altered oil and associated gas are plausible. This studyalso indicates a contribution of mantle fluids in the deepest parts of the basin near the contact with theGuaycaramo Fault System.
