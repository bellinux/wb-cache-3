25|$|The post lunch {{session was}} one of the most {{dramatic}} sessions in Test history. VVS Laxman played one of his best knocks along with Ishant Sharma for most of the post lunch session. He was happy to give Ishant most of the strike with Ishant stone-walling the rest of the over. Occasional boundaries (mainly from Sharma) and early singles off every over had India slowly, but surely inching towards their target. In what seemed <b>like</b> <b>forever,</b> India crawled from 124/8 to 170, 180 and 190/8. Finally Ishant got out to a Ben Hilfenhaus lbw decision that replays showed was going down the leg side, with the score at 205. Pragyan Ojha, the last man for India joined Laxman at the crease. During Mitchell Johnson's over more drama followed with Ojha being clearly struck in line, but On-field Umpire Billy Bowden turned down the appeal. Pragyan Ojha tried to sneak a single when substitute fielder Steven Smith shied at the stumps. But unfortunately for Australia, no fielders where backing his throw. It went for four overthrows meaning India just needed 2 runs to win.|$|E

Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly.
