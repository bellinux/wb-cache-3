5|$|In the 1970s, the United States and Western European {{countries}} {{introduced legislation}} to reduce lead air pollution. The impact was significant: while {{a study conducted}} by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in 1976–1980 showed that 77.8% of population had elevated blood lead levels, in 1991–1994, a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to 2.2%. The main product made of lead {{by the end of the}} 20th century was the lead–acid battery, which posed no direct threat to humans. From 1960 to 1990, lead output in the Western Bloc grew by a third. The share of the world's <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> by the Eastern Bloc increased from 10% to 30%, from 1950 to 1990, with the Soviet Union being the world's largest producer during the mid-1970s and the 1980s, and China starting major <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> in the late 20th century. Unlike the European communist countries, China was largely unindustrialized by the mid-20th century; in 2004, China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead. As was the case during European industrialization, lead has had a negative effect on health in China.|$|E
5|$|In the New World, {{lead was}} {{produced}} {{soon after the}} arrival of European settlers. The earliest recorded <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> dates to 1621 in the English Colony of Virginia, fourteen years after its foundation. In Australia, the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841. In Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo Basin, where lead was used for trade with Europeans, and as a currency by the 17th century, well before the scramble for Africa.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and this trend {{is likely to increase}} in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted without the need for smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E

5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels unmatched until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world <b>lead</b> <b>production.</b> The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{is easily}} {{extracted}} from its ores; prehistoric people in Western Asia knew of it. Galena, a principal ore of lead, often bears silver, interest in which helped initiate widespread extraction {{and use of}} lead in ancient Rome. <b>Lead</b> <b>production</b> declined {{after the fall of}} Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution. In 2014, annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes, over half of which was from recycling. Lead's high density, low melting point, ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful. These properties, combined with its relative abundance and low cost, resulted in its extensive use in construction, plumbing, batteries, bullets and shot, weights, solders, pewters, fusible alloys, white paints, leaded gasoline, and radiation shielding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Lead</b> <b>production</b> {{designer}} Richard Hudolin flew to Los Angeles, 1996 {{to gather}} material from Stargate for reference {{and found the}} original film prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely disintegrated, he could take a detailed mould for Stargate SG-1 production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, lock the chevrons, and be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Britain, and later {{continental}} Europe and the United States, experienced the Industrial Revolution. This was the first time during which production rates exceeded those of Rome. Britain was the leading producer, losing this status by the mid-19th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany, Spain, and the United States. By 1900, the United States was the leader in global <b>lead</b> <b>production,</b> and other non-European nations—Canada, Mexico, and Australia—had begun significant production; production outside Europe exceeded that within. A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting—lead paints were in regular use. At this time, more (working class) people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated. This led to research into the effects of lead intake. Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal. Lead poisoning and gout were linked; British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters. The effects of chronic ingestion of lead, including mental disorders, were also studied in the 19th century. The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the 1870s and 1880s in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Metallic lead beads {{dating back}} to 7000–6500 BCE {{have been found in}} Asia Minor and may {{represent}} the first example of metal smelting. At that time lead had few (if any) applications due to its softness and dull appearance. The major reason for the spread of <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> was its association with silver, which may be obtained by burning galena (a common lead mineral). The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics, an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond; the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets, glazes, glasses, enamels, and for ornaments. Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material, as currency, and for construction. Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant, as currency, and as a contraceptive; the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets; and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing.|$|E

Stargate SG-1 employed about 200 Canadian union workers, although that number could exceed 300 when new sets were built. <b>Lead</b> <b>production</b> designer Richard Hudolin joined the project in October 1996.

25|$|The {{problems}} in the concentrator also affected the performance of MIM's Mount Isa lead smelter. The lead–zinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous pyrite (FeS2). This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated {{without the aid of}} a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck.|$|E
25|$|The Russians {{established}} {{agriculture in}} the Lena River basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to Sakha {{in the second half}} of the 19th century began to grow wheat, oats, and potatoes. The fur trade established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the Soviet period.

In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures. Brotherhood has not been numbered unlike Assassin's Creed II because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while {{this is only the}} continuation of Ezio's story.|$|E

25|$|Undaunted by career setbacks, Miller tried {{her hand}} with smaller studios such as Monogram and Republic Pictures, though she would still {{work for the}} {{occasional}} big studio. Miller also made further incursions in the then-new medium of television, which she began before her contract with Paramount was dropped. Despite the demands of raising a family, the 1950s would be Miller's most prolific years, seeing her as a television regular. Throughout the '50s, {{she was able to}} display a broader acting range than when under Paramount and Hal Wallis. Although she missed out on playing Lizabeth Scott's character's younger sister in Paid in Full, she played a younger sister in the noirish Shadow on the Wall (1950), which also involved two sisters competing over the same man. The elder sister, played by Ann Sothern, discovers that her younger, married sister is having an affair with Sothern's fiancé, which leads to murderous results and short screen-time for Miller. Production ran April 11–mid-May 1949. Though never leaving the noir genre, Miller would begin her reputation for Westerns with Young Daniel Boone (1950), but as the female <b>lead.</b> <b>Production</b> ran mid-October–late October 1949.|$|E
500|$|Tellurium was {{discovered}} in the Habsburg Empire, at Zlatna (now in Romania) in 1782 by Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein in a mineral containing tellurium and gold.

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} company's establishment, it began {{developing}} its first project. The team took inspirations {{from the popular}} Doom, and hoped to capitalize upon the industry's excitement for a first-person shooter. The team still lacked experience and considered developing a [...] "Doom clone". The game was developed for the Panasonic 3DO because its developer kit can be purchased inexpensively, and the team had high hopes for the console. Using a time frame of one month, the team developed a functional gameplay demo for the game. It was pitched to various publishers and was later shown to Mark Cerny, an executive producer from Universal Interactive Studios, who {{was impressed by the}} team's efforts. Universal later published the game and helped with funding and marketing. Universal also helped the game's development and cutscenes, and hired actors to film real-time sequences. Catherine Hardwicke was hired to <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> design, and inspirations were taken from Warhawk.|$|E
500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When I go into the studio, I'm a magician.

500|$|In Europe, <b>lead</b> <b>production</b> only {{began to}} revive in the 11th and 12th centuries, {{when it was}} again used for roofing and piping. Starting in the 13th century, lead was used to create stained glass. In the European and Arabian traditions of alchemy, lead (symbol [...] in the European tradition) was {{considered}} an impure base metal which, by the separation, purification and balancing of its constituent essences, could be transformed to pure and incorruptible gold. During the period, lead was used increasingly for adulterating wine. The use of such wine was forbidden for use in Christian rites by a papal bull in 1498, but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in mass poisonings up to the late 18th century. Lead was a key material {{in parts of the}} printing press, which was invented around 1440; lead dust was commonly inhaled by print workers, causing lead poisoning. Firearms were invented at around the same time, and lead, despite being more expensive than iron, became the chief material for making bullets. It was less damaging to iron gun barrels, had a higher density (which allowed for better retention of velocity), and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as they could be made using a wood fire. Lead, in the form of Venetian ceruse, was extensively used in cosmetics by Western European aristocracy as whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty. This practice later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners, and only faded out with the French Revolution in the late 18th century. A similar fashion appeared in Japan in the 18th century with the emergence of the geishas, a practice that continued long into the 20th century. The white faces of women [...] "came to represent their feminine virtue as Japanese women", with lead commonly used in the whitener.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} the {{influence}} of different dispatching rules on the average <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time is investigated. Two theorems based on covariance between processing time and <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time are formulated and proved theoretically. Theorem 1 links the average <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time to the “processing time weighted <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time” for the multi-stage production systems analytically. The influence of different dispatching rules on average lead time, which is well known from simulation and empirical studies, can be proved theoretically in Theorem 2 for a single stage production system. A simulation study is conducted to gain more insight into {{the influence of}} dispatching rules on average <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time in a multi-stage production system. We find that the “processing time weighted average <b>production</b> <b>lead</b> time” for a multi-stage production system is not invariant of the applied dispatching rule {{and can be used}} as a dispatching rule independent indicator for single-stage production systems...|$|R
