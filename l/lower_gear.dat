25|$|Downshifting {{is similar}} to up-shifting but in reverse order, and is slower, at 600milliseconds, due to the engine's Electronic Control Unit, or ECU, needing to 'blip' the {{throttle}} so that the engine crankshaft speed can match the appropriate gear shaft speed. The car's computer senses the car slowing down, or more power required (during acceleration), and thus engages a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> on the shaft not in use, and then completes the downshift.|$|E
25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset if the goal is to switch to the next higher or <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> ratio.|$|E
25|$|For {{a bicycle}} to travel {{at the same}} speed, using a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> (larger {{mechanical}} advantage) requires the rider to pedal at a faster cadence, but with less force. Conversely, a higher gear (smaller mechanical advantage) provides a higher speed for a given cadence, but requires the rider to exert greater force. Different cyclists may have different preferences for cadence and pedaling force. Prolonged exertion of too much force in too high a gear at too low a cadence can increase the chance of knee damage; cadence above 100 rpm becomes less effective after short bursts, as during a sprint.|$|E

25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears are {{appropriate}} for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow gear selection to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|This {{term has}} no {{generally}} accepted meaning. Originally it {{referred to a}} gearing arrangement which had one especially low gear (for climbing Alpine passes); this low gear often had a larger than average jump to the next lowest gear. In the 1960s the term was used by salespeople to refer to then current 10-speed bicycles (2 chainrings, 5-sprocket cogset), without any regard to its original meaning. The nearest current equivalent to the original meaning {{can be found in}} the Shimano Megarange cogsets, where most of the sprockets have roughly a 15% relative difference, except for the largest sprocket which has roughly a 30% difference; this provides a much <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> than normal at the cost of a large gearing jump.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) bolt circle diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>lowered</b> <b>gearing</b> {{in either}} {{or all of}} the transmission, {{transfer}} case (including often employing a second transfer case to reduce gearing even more), or axle differentials ...|$|R
25|$|In practice, this {{relationship}} {{can be observed}} in bicycles: Bicycles are typically composed of two road wheels, front and rear gears (referred to as sprockets) meshing with a circular chain, and a derailleur mechanism if the bicycle's transmission system allows multiple gear ratios to be used (i.e. multi-speed bicycle), all of which attached to the frame. A cyclist, the person who rides the bicycle, provides the input power by turning pedals, thereby cranking the front sprocket (commonly referred to as chainring). The input power provided by the cyclist is equal to the product of cadence (i.e. the number of pedal revolutions per minute) and the torque on spindle of the bicycle's crankset. The bicycle's drivetrain transmits the input power to the road wheel, which in turn conveys the received power to the road as the output power of the bicycle. Depending on the gear ratio of the bicycle, a (torque, rpm)input pair is converted to a (torque, rpm)output pair. By using a larger rear gear, or by switching to a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> in multi-speed bicycles, angular speed of the road wheels is decreased while the torque is increased, product of which (i.e. power) does not change.|$|E

2500|$|As {{far as a}} cyclist's {{legs are}} concerned, when {{changing}} gears, the relative difference between two gears {{is more important than}} the absolute difference between gears. [...] This relative change, from a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> to a higher gear, is normally expressed as a percentage, and is independent of what system is used to measure the gears. Cycling tends to feel more comfortable if nearly all gear changes have more or less the same percentage difference. [...] For example, a change from a 13-tooth sprocket to a 15-tooth sprocket (15.4%) feels very similar to a change from a 20-tooth sprocket to a 23-tooth sprocket (15%), even though the latter has a larger absolute difference.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun gear, a split ring gear that has a fixed <b>lower</b> ring <b>gear</b> coaxial with the sun gear and a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring gears together. Within the split ring gear is an even number of planet gears between the split ring gear and the sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet <b>gear,</b> and <b>lower</b> planet <b>gear</b> with the upper and <b>lower</b> planet <b>gears</b> splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and <b>lower</b> planet <b>gears.</b> The <b>lower</b> planet <b>gear</b> meshes with the input sun gear and the fixed ring gear while the upper planet gear {{is driven by the}} <b>lower</b> planet <b>gear</b> and meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|R

50|$|Several tuning {{factors can}} affect engine responsiveness. Throttle {{response}} in manual cars {{can be enhanced}} by dropping to a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> before accelerating. This action is often used in smaller cars to aid in overtaking.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{versions}} had a MTU engine (the 16 V 396 TC14); two variants {{were built}} either {{with or without}} a two-speed voith transmission - versions with the two-speed transmissions had a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> limiting the maximum speed to ~60 km/h but giving greater torque.|$|E
50|$|As {{soon as the}} {{accelerator}} is released enough to slow the engine, engine braking comes into effect {{as long as the}} wheels remain connected via the transmission to the engine. A slipping or disengaged clutch, or a torque converter, would disengaged the wheels or absorb braking energy. The braking force varies depending on the engine, and the gear the transmission is in. The <b>lower</b> the <b>gear,</b> the higher the braking effect due to higher rpm and the torque transferred through the transmission (higher torque is delivered from the engine in <b>lower</b> <b>gears).</b>|$|R

50|$|In 2000 a new Class 66/6 sub-class was built, with a <b>lower</b> <b>gear</b> ratio, {{enabling}} heavier {{trains to}} be hauled, albeit at slower speed.

50|$|The most {{fundamental}} meaning {{is that of}} an overall gear ratio between engine and wheels, such that the car is over-geared, and cannot reach its potential top speed, i.e. the car could travel faster if it were in a <b>lower</b> <b>gear,</b> with the engine turning at higher RPM.|$|E
