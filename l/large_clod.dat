40|$|International audienceSoil {{roughness}} {{is a key}} parameter to {{our understanding}} of soil properties and soil-water interaction, most of which occur at millimeter scales. Soil irregularities, such as aggregates, clods and interrill depressions, influence water infiltration and overland flow. The objective {{of this study is to}} observe and quantify clod evolution under cumulated precipitation. We prepared two soil trays with loose silt soil and pre-sieved clods put on top, at low and high concentrations. These trays were then subjected to a set of five successive artificial rainfalls. The digital elevation models (DEM) were recorded for each tray, at millimetric resolution, at the initial stage and after each subsequent rainfall. The clods were automatically segmented on the DEM and the diameter, surface area and volume of these clods were measured by computer. The isolated clods showed comparable behavior on both trays. The small clods were almost always decreasing in volume until they disappeared. The other clods swelled during the first rain or the first two rains, and then decreased in area and volume. The decrease was faster for volume than for area. This probably reflected a soil detachment phenomenon, which mostly affected the heights of the clods. On the high concentration tray, the close inter-proximity of the clods induced merging and the formation of blocks. The rate of decrease of clod volume as a function of cumulative precipitation could be modeled using exponential and linear equations. Small and intermediate-sized clods showed an exponential decrease that was smoother as the clod size increased. <b>Large</b> <b>clod</b> volume decrease was almost linear. We were further able to model the trend of the slope parameter of the exponential decrease, as a function of clod size. Our study has shown how the DEM recording and image analysis can be used to quantify the evolution of clods under rainfall, improve our understanding of clod dynamics under rainfall and roughness parameterization. The size dependency of clod volume decrease is important for soil conservation decisions. This will obviously affect crust formation, surface armoring, soil erosion and surface permeability to water and gas...|$|E

Recently, farmers in this area have had difficulty in harvesting potatoes in predominantly wet years. After a dry period, soil particles in {{the top layer of}} the potato ridges form a platy structure and are difficult to sieve. Locally, this resulted in many clods, and sometimes harvesting proved impossible. In the field, significantly more earthworms (mainly Aporrectodea caliginosa and A. rosea) were observed in the problem parts than in the non-problem parts.

5000|$|The Optimum Water Content of soil is {{the water}} content {{at which a}} maximum dry unit weight can be {{achieved}} after a given compaction effort. A max dry unit weight would have no voids in the soil. If {{you were trying to}} compact a hard dry soil to make it more dense, you might want to get it wet. The OPT is the water content of the soil in which you could compact it the most. If there is too much water you would have too much pore water pressure during compression to compact any further. If there is too little water the soil would naturally resist compaction via shear strength/friction/effective stress. The determination of the OPT is important because if tillage is carried out on fields that are wetter or drier than the OPT many problems can be caused, including soil structural damage, through the production of <b>large</b> <b>clods,</b> and an increase in the content of readily dispersible clay which is indicative of the soil stability.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nevi {{are common}} benign {{neoplasms}} {{and the main}} diagnostic entity in the differential diagnosis of melanoma. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM), a novel technique for skin imaging at cellular-level magnification, {{has been shown to}} be useful for differentiating nevi from melanoma. However, systematic studies of the specific RCM features of nevi are still lacking. OBJECTIVE: To describe the characteristic RCM features of common melanocytic nevi and to correlate them with histopathology. METHODS: A total of 180 biopsy-proven nevi were imaged with RCM prior to excision. RCM images were evaluated for the overall nevus pattern and presence of specific RCM criteria. Upon histopathology, nevi were analysed for thickness using adapted Breslow depth and Clark's level grading. RESULTS: Observed RCM patterns varied according to anatomic depth of nevi. Junctional nevi were mainly characterized on RCM by a Ringed pattern, indicating a predominantly single cell proliferation of melanocytes; in contrast, the junctional component of compound nevi appeared on RCM as a Meshwork pattern, indicating a predominantly nested-proliferation. In compound nevi, the size of dermal nests was related to the thickness of nevi. Moreover, nevi extending deeper into the dermis were more likely to display a junctional component that extended laterally beyond the dermal component and appeared on RCM as either Ringed or Meshwork pattern. Intradermal nevi showed on RCM, in almost all cases, <b>large</b> <b>clods.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The possibility for in vivo histopathological classification of nevi may help in attaining a better understanding of the origin of nevi and of nevus-related melanoma risk...|$|R

The objectives of this work reported were to create a method to process native agricultural sediment, mix a uniform sediment slurry at a target concentration, and create a control system that will deliver the slurry in varying flow rates corresponding to a target sedigraph. Eroded silty clay (14 % sand) was scraped, dried, and processed with a hammer mill. A sand (93 % sand) and loam (44 % sand) were dried and screened for organic debris and <b>large</b> <b>clods.</b> Each soil type was mixed by an axial flow impeller in an 1890 ‐L cone‐bottom tank.

The sediment mixing system was capable of producing concentrations within 3. 3 % of the target concentration with a maximum test concentration of 0. 294 kg L‐ 1 with the silty clay soil. Simulated hydrographs had a Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0. 998, a Root Mean Square Error of 0. 06 L s‐ 1, and a peak flow rate within 1 % of the target flow. Simulated sedigraphs with silty clay had similar performance. Neither the sandy soil, nor the loam, were successfully delivered through the system to match target sedigraphs.

40|$|Ten {{temporary}} haul {{roads and}} landings in west-central Alberta were tilled with a winged subsoiler {{specifically designed for}} tilling compacted forest soils. Surface soil {{had been removed from}} all sites during construction, and spread over three of the four landings prior to tillage. Soil bulk density at the 0 – 10, 10 – 20, and 20 – 30 cm depths, and clod size distribution at the 0 – 30 cm depth were measured immediately after tillage. Bulk density of undisturbed and compacted (untilled) soil was also measured. Mean bulk density of compacted soil in haul roads was significantly greater than the bulk density of undisturbed soil, but not for landings. Tillage significantly reduced mean bulk density on three haul roads and two landings; subsurface soil was relatively dry at these sites. Most soils were difficult to fracture into small clods because these weakly aggregated soils were severely remoulded and compacted by equipment, particularly logging trucks operating on the haul roads. The degraded soil was massive and the strenght of the surface soil layers was generally much higher than was the strength of lower soil layers; this resulted in the subsoil deforming around the wings of the subsoiler rather than fracturing the surface soil. Fracturing of compacted soil into small clods was apparently enhanced by at least 2 years of frost action. The winged subsoiler was only moderately effective at fracturing recently compacted soil because of an often high soil water content, but it was observed that sites where soil was broken into <b>large</b> <b>clods</b> was loosened by frost action the following winter. Alternative methods of tilling compacted soil that insure soil fracturing over a wider range of soil water contents are needed for loosening compacted soil in northern boreal forests...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{three levels of}} soil {{moisture}} content (10 - 12, 13 - 15 and 16 - 18 % d. b.) and three levels of plowing depth (15, 20 and 25 cm) on draft, specific draft, and drawbar power requirements of a 3 - bottom disk plow and on soil pulverization and inversion in a clay loam soil were investigated. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with a 3 × 3 factorial. Except in soil inversion, the effect of soil moisture {{on all of the}} performance parameters mentioned, was highly significant. Mean values of draft, specific draft and drawbar power requirements and clod mean weight diameter were minimized at 13 - 15 % and 16 - 18 % soil moisture contents, respectively. The effect of plowing depth was highly significant only on draft and drawbar power requirement of disk plow, {{in such a way that}} the mean values of these two parameters were significantly increased with plowing depth, while specific draft showed only a mild decreasing trend. In order to provide a quantitative index to express the degree of soil pulverization by tillage implements, a tractor-pulled rotary sieve was designed and fabricated. With this apparatus, in-field determination of soil clod mean weight diameter (MWD) following plowing was possible. The results showed that the effect of soil moisture content on MWD was highly significant, such that, plowing at 10 - 12 % moisture content produced the <b>largest</b> <b>clods,</b> whereas the effect of plowing depth on MWD was not significant. The decreasing trend of MWD with soil moisture content persisted to the highest moisture level studied (16 - 18 %), in which the average clod MWD (33. 8 mm) was about 72 % smaller than those formed at 10 - 12 % moisture content. The effects of plowing depth and soil m. c. on soil inversion by disk plow were not significant and the overall soil inversion was about 54 % which was in agreement with those reported by other researchers...|$|R
50|$|The use {{of plastic}} mulch {{requires}} a unique application process to ensure proper {{placement of the}} plastic film. This application process begins with preparing the field the same way one would for a flat seed bed. The bed must be free of <b>large</b> soil <b>clods</b> and organic residue. A machine called a plastic layer or a bed shaper is pulled over the field creating a row of plastic mulch covering a planting bed. These beds can be a flat bed which simply means {{the surface of the}} plastic mulch is level with the inter-row soil surface. Machines that form raised beds create a plastic surface higher than the inter-row soil surface. The basic concept of the plastic bed shaper is a shaping box which creates the bed that is then covered by plastic via a roller and two coulters that cover the edges of the plastic film to hold the plastic the soil’s surface. These plastic layers also place the drip irrigation line under the plastic while the machine lays the plastic. It is somewhat important that the plastic is rather tight. This becomes important in the planting process.|$|R

Avanzi” of the University of Pisa (Italy). Both the mechanical and operative performances (working time and capacity, fuel consumption, power requirement, etc.) {{and the quality of}} work (clod size distribution and soil roughness) were evaluated. 	The results emphasized that there were no relevant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of machines tested. Thus specific power (usable power per meter of working width and centimeter of working depth) both of rotary harrows and rotary hoes was always of the same order. In contrast seed-bed quality was notably different. Use of rotary hoes led to a high degree of soil crumbling, which was also homogeneous throughout the tilled layer, while rotary harrows resulted in a lower degree of soil crumbling, with a distribution of <b>larger</b> diameter <b>clods</b> in the shallowest layer. As a consequence, soil roughness was decidedly higher after harrowing. 	Therefore, given the absence of significant differences between the operative performances of the two typologies of pto powered operative machines, choice of implement can be based on desired seed-bed quality, in order to obtain either pronounced soil crumbling and leveling (rotary hoe) or greater “protection” of tilled soil from crusting and erosion (rotary harrow) ...|$|R

The information in this publication represents costs and returns of a case study Adams County, Washington farmer using both the low-disturbance V-sweep undercutter conservation tillage * and traditional tillage systems for summer fallow. To avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions from this case study, you should closely examine the assumptions and data used.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{state of the}} seedbed is of importance to the plant environment as it influences some important processes in the soil such as seedling emergence, water and solute transport, and ease of root penetration. This is affected {{to a large extent}} by tillage process, the tillage implement type and the geometry of the implement used. A field experiment was carried out on a clay soil to determine the effect of the geometry of bladed tillage implements on some soil physical properties after tillage. The soil properties evaluated were bulk density, mean clod size distribution and total pore space after tillage and the extent of loosening achieved. Implement parameters considered were blade width, rake angle and depth of operation of the implement. Two blade widths of 75 and 150 mm were evaluated in combination with three rake angles of 30, 60 and 90 degrees. Each tillage implement was drawn through the soil at four operating depths of 100, 150, 200 and 250 mm. Larger rake angles were observed to result in larger mean aggregate sizes and greater bulk density reductions when compared to smaller rake angles. Greater reduction in bulk density was observed with the wider of the two blade widths evaluated. Mean clod size after tillage was also observed to be large for the wider of the two widths evaluated. Irrespective of width and rake angle, greater operating depths resulted in <b>larger</b> mean <b>clod</b> sizes and greater reductions in bulk density as compared to shallower operating depths.

40|$|A {{dissertation}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the award of the degree Doctor of Engineering (EngD), at Loughborough University. Lime stabilisation is a ground improvement technique used to improve the engineering properties of cohesive fill materials. During earthworks operations, specialist plant is used to rotovate the clay fill material and intermix lime binder around clay clods. After completion of the lime treatment, the layer is compacted in the usual way. Immediately after mixing, the lime instigate a series of physico-chemical reactions within the clay soil. Where the chemical reactions are favourable and with time after compaction (curing) the material becomes progressively stronger and durable to environmental influences, e. g. inundation by surface or ground water. However, where sulphate is present within the soil, the reactions may change and the ingress of water into the layer can result in the expansive growth of deleterious minerals e. g. ettringite. 	While sulphate swell issues are relatively rare, when they do occur the degree of expansion can be very high. A high profile sulphate swell failure developed during {{the construction of the}} M 40, Oxford, UK in 1989. Over the winter period after the lime stabilisation works, a 250 mm deep lime treated layer heaved by up to 150 mm - destroying the overlying road construction. Since the M 40 failure, a substantial amount of effort has been undertaken to better understand the sulphate swell reactions and in this regard the state of scientific knowledge is relatively strong. 	A fundamental issue for field applications of lime stabilisation is {{that the vast majority of}} research has been undertaken on laboratory specimens prepared using methods which do not reflect site practice. Laboratory studies often use oven dried and finely crushed clay, whereas site operations will treat much <b>larger</b> clay <b>clods</b> to result in a more heterogeneous distribution of lime through the compacted soil body. With <b>large</b> clay <b>clods,</b> the chemical reactants must migrate through clods and this may cause the sequence of chemical reactions to change. A further challenge is that laboratory studies are typically undertaken with cure temperatures of 20 °C, whereas a typical near surface temperature in the UK is < 10 °C. This is of particular relevance to sulphate swell failures which are reported to coincide with a reduction in ambient temperature over winter periods. Thus, the direct relevance of laboratory studies to site application was unclear. 	A series of laboratory experiments using a preparation method which reflects field applications of lime stabilisation was used to investigate the influence of <b>large</b> clay <b>clods</b> on the durability of lime stabilised clay soil. This method was applied to both low and high sulphate clay soils. 	A fundamental discovery from work on low sulphate clay is that the addition of lime binder to the surface of the clay clods causes a physico-chemical boundary to form. This boundary develops due to the rapid increase to the plastic limit of the clay preventing adjacent clods from joining together during compaction. This causes the engineering properties of each individual clod to develop independent to its neighbours and for each clay clod to be separated by an inter-clod pore space. The strength of each individual clay clod will increase with curing as the added lime dissociates into Ca 2 + and OH- and migrates to form C-S-H deep within the clods. Where the material is compacted wet of the optimum water content, this condition improves ion migration and enables development of diffuse cementation deep within clods. The inter-clod porosity remains as a weakness throughout curing especially during specimen soaking, where the pore channels comprise a pathway, accelerating the ingress of soaking water. With low sulphate soil, the soaking water softens the treated material, however, with high TPS soil substantial sulphate swelling may develop. Thus, efforts to minimise this porosity during preparation is important and the use of quicklime with longer mellowing periods can cause the clay clods to develop high strength before compaction. The high strength clods resist compaction and the degree of inter-clod porosity in the compacted mass increases, worsening specimen durability to water ingress. 	The investigations into high sulphate clays included the development of a Novel Swell Test (NST) to assess volume change. A unique aspect of the NST was that the sulphate swell response of the lime treated material was investigated at site realistic temperatures of 8 °C. It was identified that, when compared with standard laboratory test temperatures of 20 °C the rate of sulphate swell is substantially higher at the low temperature. The mineralogical testing has permitted the hypothesis that, at 8 °C the growth of crystalline ettringite becomes slower and the ettringite precursor, which has a high affinity to imbibe water, remains in this state for much longer. Thus, laboratory swell tests at 20 °C may substantially underestimate the degree of swell that may develop in the field. As a pressing need, it is recommended that the industry adapt sulphate swell test methods to appraise the degree of swell at field realistic temperatures i. e. < 10 °C. The work also identifies that the primary defence against sulphate swell is to condition the fill so that the risk of post compaction water ingress, via inter-clod porosity, is minimised. The use of GGBS and water addition during extended mellowing periods also reduces the degree of sulphate swell in natural clay soils. 	This work concludes that working methods for lime stabilisation of medium high plasticity soils of a potentially high sulphate content, should be adapted to encourage diffuse cementation and minimise the degree of (post compaction) inter-clod porosity. Practically this involves the use of hydrated lime and the addition of mixing water throughout extended mellowing periods. Fundamentally, the study recommends that where construction programmes allow, the long term durability of a fill material should be the priority over immediate strength...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated to obtain some understanding on the behaviour of soil at higher moisture content {{and to explore}} the potential of preparing paddy fields with reduced amounts of water. This investigation comprised of three separate studies. Based on existing information that water could be reduced when soil clods were initially formed prior to flooding, the effects of clod size, clod initial moisture content and confining states on the rate of water uptake were explored. The moisture gradients within clods wetted and dried for different period of times were also studied. The results of the clod wetting experiments show that· the rate of water uptake by capillarity was greatest when clods were initially very dry and smaller clods tended to absorb water faster than bigger clods when under confined conditions. Confining {{had no effect on}} infiltration when the initial condition was very wet. On drying, the smallest clod dried the fastest, reduced greater volume and increased its dry bulk density significantly. <b>Larger</b> <b>clods</b> required,longer drying period to arrive at a uniform moisture profile within as compared to smaller clods. Results from the wetting experiments were tested against the infiltration model of. Jarvis and Leeds-Harrison (1987) and a model developed based on linear flow of heat into a solid (Carslaw and Jaeger, 1959). A second project involved the study of soil deformation at high moisture contents in an attempt to produce clods with minimum draught force using simple relieved tines at various rake angles and depths in a soil tank. The principal. objective of the - ii - study was to utilise soil implement mechanics knowledge to improve the efficiency of soil preparation for wetland crops. Aspects like the nature of soil disturbance, extent of disturbance and draught requirement were investigated. The soil was in a plastic consistency prepared to three specified density states of 940, 1000 and 1250 kg/m 3 • The soil disturbance pattern was monitored using implanted coloured beads and glass sided tank studies. In addition, the extent and height of heave and surface disturbance were noted. Predictive models based upon Mohr-Coulomb soil mechanics theory were developed to predict the interaction between the soil and simple implements at three rake angles. These were based on the lateral failure theory of Godwin and Spoor (1977) and the two dimensional soil failure model of Hettiaratchi and Reece (1974). Results from the single tine study were tested against the models. A sliding resistance component and crescent effect were incorporated to improve the predictions for the 45 ° and 90 ° rake angle tines. The magnitude of each mode of failure is dependent upon the critical aspect ratio which varies with tine rake angles and soil conditions. The mode of failure is considered to be lateral when the tine aspect ratio is larger than the critical aspect ratio and an upward failure when the tine aspect ratio is lower than the critical aspect ratio. The predicted results are in close agreement with the results of the experimental studies. For the backward raked tine, a model was developed based on the formation of an elliptical wedge and bearing capacity type of failure ahead and below the wedge. This failure theory was based on the bearing capacity failure for deep footings. The model - iii - helped identify an additional parameter that influenced the draught force for a backward raked tine. This parameter is the sliding resistance component on both sides and beneath the elliptical soil wedge •. Results from multitine studies showed that draught force increased with tine spacinq but the increase was not significant. In the wet condition the tines merely cut slots and little or no interaction was noted. In an effort to find the optimum water level for soil puddlinq, a laboratory study was conducted to determine the influence of water-soil ratio on the ease of puddling air dry aqqreqates.

The sites covered {{a variety of}} soil conditions ranging from a clay loam to a rock 7 2 C 2 iplemeflts tested included disk harrows (four aies), brusa blades (three sites), standard subsoiler tines (two sites), wing. - ed subsoiler tines (two sites), and rock ripper tines (five sites). Soil density and strength measurements made prior to the tillage operatIons indicated that the depth of compacted soil within primary skid trails exceeded 12 inches and was often detectable {{to a depth of}} 18 inches. Logging debris typically was incorporated into the skid trail surfaces. The disk harrow proved ineffective for loosening compacted forest soils at depth when: 1) the soil had a high rock content, 2) disk weighting was insufficient, or 3) the trail cross-section was concave and the harrow wide. The brush blade failed to loosen the deeper layers of compaction and resulted in transfer of some of the loosened soil to the trail edges. The short closely-spaced tines did not allow loosened soil and logging debris to pass between the tines. The performance of subsoiler and rock ripper tines was favorable in the rocky coarse-grained soils and some of the cohesive soils. However, plastic flow rather than shatterin. g occurred when tines operated below their crit- [...] ical depth. The critical depth was controlled by soil conditions and tue geometry. The winged subsoiler tines resulted in 30 to 64 percent greater shattering than did standard subsoiler tines at a ripping depth of 1. 5 feet. Close tine spacing caused logging debris to accumulate in front of the tines. The tines produced <b>large</b> angular <b>clods</b> when working in a cohesive soil. These clods did not break down after heavy rains. Clods from coarse-grain soils broke down readily when moistened. A trapezoid-shaped representatjoii of the soil sbattering pattern produced by tines was shown to compare adequately with actual shattering patterns. A computer program was developed to analyze ripping depth and tine spacing combinations resulting in maximum shattering across the skid trail width. The cost of the tillage operations ranged from 89 to 228 per mile of skid trail (1980 - 1981 dollars) ...|$|R

The optimum aggregate size distribution was found in the left side of the channel, which had the largest number of aggregates (50. 50 %) in the 0. 5 – 8. 0 mm sieve size range. Maximum aggregate stability (AS) was found in Gulistan-e-Sarmast (46 %), Kohsar (42 %) and Latifabad # 10 (34 %), while all other soils had minimum aggregate stability (< 14 %). The minimum aggregate stabilities demonstrate that the tilled fallow areas of Hyderabad district are highly susceptible to erosion. Therefore, the present study suggests investigating potential ways to enhance the aggregate stabilities of soils...|$|R
60|$|Thrust {{away in the}} benighted {{hinterland}} of a scattered market district, {{it might}} have been supposed that these two detached items of the Great Human Family would have leaned towards one another in a fellowship begotten of kindred circumstances and a common isolation from the outer world. And perhaps it had been so once, but the way of things had brought it otherwise. Indeed, otherwise. Fate, which had linked the two families in such unavoidable association of habitat, had ordained that the Crick household should nourish and maintain among its earthly possessions sundry head of domestic fowls, while to the Saunderses was given a disposition towards the cultivation of garden crops. Herein lay the material, ready to hand, for the coming of feud and ill-blood. For the grudge between the man of herbs and the man of live stock is no new thing; you will find traces of it in the fourth chapter of Genesis. And one sunny afternoon in late spring-time the feud came—came, as such things mostly do come, with seeming aimlessness and triviality. One of the Crick hens, in obedience to the nomadic instincts of her kind, wearied of her legitimate scratching-ground, and flew over the low wall that divided the holdings of the neighbours. And there, on the yonder side, with a hurried consciousness that her time and opportunities might be limited, the misguided bird scratched and scraped and beaked and delved in the soft yielding bed that had been prepared for the solace and well-being of a colony of seedling onions. Little showers of earth-mould and root-fibres went spraying before the hen and behind her, and every minute the area of her operations widened. The onions suffered considerably. Mrs. Saunders, sauntering at this luckless moment down the garden path, in order to fill her soul with reproaches at the iniquity of the weeds, which grew faster than she or her good man cared to remove them, stopped in mute discomfiture before the presence of a more magnificent grievance. And then, in the hour of her calamity, she turned instinctively to the Great Mother, and gathered in her capacious hands <b>large</b> <b>clods</b> of the hard brown soil that lay at her feet. With a terrible sincerity of purpose, though with a contemptible inadequacy of aim, she rained her earth bolts at the marauder, and the bursting pellets called forth a flood of cackling protest and panic from the hastily departing fowl. Calmness under misfortune is not an attribute of either hen-folk or womenkind, and while Mrs. Saunders declaimed over her onion bed such portions of the slang dictionary as are permitted by the Nonconformist conscience to be said or sung, the Vasco da Gama fowl was waking the echoes of Toad-Water with crescendo bursts of throat music which compelled attention to her griefs. Mrs. Crick had a long family, and was therefore licensed, in the eyes of her world, to have a short temper, and when some of her ubiquitous offspring had informed her, with the authority of eye-witnesses, that her neighbour had so far forgotten herself as to heave stones at her hen—her best hen, the best layer in the countryside—her thoughts clothed themselves in language “unbecoming to a Christian woman”—so at least said Mrs. Saunders, to whom most of the language was applied. Nor was she, on her part, surprised at Mrs. Crick’s conduct in letting her hens stray into other body’s gardens, and then abusing of them, seeing as how she remembered things against Mrs. Crick—and the latter simultaneously had recollections of lurking episodes in the past of Susan Saunders that were nothing to her credit. “Fond memory, when all things fade we fly to thee,” and in the paling light of an April afternoon the two women confronted each other from their respective sides of the party wall, recalling with shuddering breath the blots and blemishes of their neighbour’s family record. There was that aunt of Mrs. Crick’s who had died a pauper in Exeter workhouse—every one knew that Mrs. Saunders’ uncle on her mother’s side drank himself to death—then there was that Bristol cousin of Mrs. Crick’s! From the shrill triumph with which his name was dragged in, his crime must have been pilfering from a cathedral at least, but as both remembrancers were speaking at once it was difficult to distinguish his infamy from the scandal which beclouded the memory of Mrs. Saunders’ brother’s wife’s mother—who may have been a regicide, and was certainly not a nice person as Mrs. Crick painted her. And then, with an air of accumulating and irresistible conviction, each belligerent informed the other that she was no lady—after which they withdrew in a great silence, feeling that nothing further remained to be said. The chaffinches clinked in the apple trees and the bees droned round the berberis bushes, and the waning sunlight slanted pleasantly across the garden plots, but between the neighbour households had sprung up a barrier of hate, permeating and permanent.|$|R
40|$|In the Mekong delta of Vietnam, wetland rice is {{the main}} crop. The {{traditional}} rice cropping system with one crop per year changed to a system {{with two or three}} crops per year, and mechanised tillage replaced traditional tillage by water buffaloes. Currently, three tillage systems can be distinguished: dry tillage (ploughing and/or rotovating of the unsaturated field), wet tillage (puddling) or a mix of the two systems. The heavy monsoon rainfall causes many problems and strongly reduces the trafficable and workable periods. Tillage requires a high energy input and time pressure is high due to the short periods between crops. Whenever possible, farmers prefer dry tillage in view of soil structural quality, resistance of the crop to lodging (anchoring) and the experience that the typical soil profile is kept in better condition, resulting in higher yields. Experiments were carried on typical heavy clay soils (near Cantho, Cantho province) comparing the three tillage systems in terms of: quality of the seedbed (aggregate size, smoothness), the structure of the arable layer, bearing capacity of the hardpan, and energy expenditure and timeliness of the tillage operations. It was found that (dry) ploughing with a disk plough had a low energy consumption (about 40 % of that of the rotavator) but produced a very poor seedbed. Additional disk harrowing or rotary tillage was necessary. One pass with the rotary tiller produced a good seedbed. Where secondary tillage operations on dry soil are required, drying of the soil for at least 6 days is needed to achieve an acceptable quality of the seedbed. A good alternative for the assessment of the surface condition of a rice-seedbed is collecting and quantifying the amount or number of <b>clods</b> <b>larger</b> than 80 mm at the surface...|$|R
40|$|In its gregarious phase the locust Dociostaurus maroccanus (Thunberg) (Orthoptera Acrididae) has {{periodically}} caused significant yield {{losses in}} many Mediterranean and Asian countries, and alarm {{in the general}} public. Population outbreaks {{in recent years have}} frequently required the application of control measures, based on those that have low environmental impact, which are only possible with a sound knowledge of locust bio-ethology and ecology. Our research was aimed at studying the spatial distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods in two Apulian egg bed areas in southern Italy, thus contributing to the rationalization of control methods. The distribution of D. maroccanus egg pods was investigated using a geostatistical approach. Three sampling designs (called A, B and C), characterized by different mesh and clod sizes, were compared to evaluate their effectiveness and affordability. In both egg bed areas, the variogram models were asymptotic with a small nugget effect, and indicated an aggregated distribution of egg pods. Contour maps showed that design A, based on a <b>larger</b> mesh and <b>clod</b> size, was characterized by few hot spots and an extended zone of “low density” egg pods, while design B, involving a smaller mesh and clod size, showed a more structured distribution, with various hot spots alternating with zero level zones. Finally, design C, based on a larger mesh size and smaller clods, showed a single extended hot spot surrounded by a large area without egg pods. Moreover, because of the larger amount of soil to be examined, design A was about 2. 6 - and 10. 9 -fold more time consuming than designs B and C, respectively. Our data showed that sampling designs providing smaller and denser samples should be preferred over designs with fewer and larger samples when information on both the distribution and density of egg pods is needed...|$|R
40|$|In Madagascar, where 85 % of {{the working}} {{population}} earn their living through agriculture and livestock farming, farmers produce mainly rice and zebu cattle. But the country is neither able to produce enough food for its 12 million inhabitants nor able to earn enough foreign exchange to import rice and the cattle are not used widely as draught animals. In order to increase agricultural production, the zebu should be harnessed to the plough. Food self-sufficiency is a national priority, to be attained either by intensifying crop production or by increasing the area of land under cultivation. The first option, to increase yield per hectare, has attracted considerable attention and extension services have been established to promote the use of fertilizer, manure, pesticides, better quality seeds and improved techniques. But this {{has proved to be}} an expensive exercise that has failed to achieve convincing results. In fact in areas where intensified farming practices have been tried over the last few years, per capita rice production has actually decreased. However, extending the area under cultivation could lead to food self-sufficiency. At the present time, only 5 % of the island of Madagascar is cultivated. The limiting factor to increased agricultural production is neither a shortage of land nor an unsuitable climate. Madagascar's climate is such that practically any type of crop can be cultivated. Farmers are willing, intelligent and ingenious, as {{can be seen from the}} terraced paddy fields that they have developed. The major constraint to increasing the area of land under cultivation is the lack of muscle power: hands to cultivate and to weed. Unfortunately, increasing the number of working hands also increases the number of hungry mouths and only by increasing the productivity of the existing workforce will the vicious circle be broken. This means increasing production per unit of time worked, not increasing the size of workforce. Malagasy farmers work hard but their principal farming tool, the angady, limits what they can produce. The angady is a metal blade set into a wooden handle and it is used to turn over the soil and break down <b>large</b> <b>clods</b> of earth. Every farmer owns at least one and swears by it since survival depends upon it. But while the angady is an excellent gardening implement, it is not suitable for agriculture. In fact to be using this prehistoric hand ploughing tool in today's age of mechanization is agriculturally disastrous. It takes at least 60 days to cultivate one hectare using an angady, by which time not only does the most favourable time for sowing seed pass, but weeds destroyed when work began start to regrow. No matter how much farmers may wish to produce more, this laborious way of working means that they can cultivate no more than one hectare, sufficient only to feed a family and survive. Mechanization could improve this low productivity, but unfortunately people tend to think that mechanization invariably means tractors. However, tractors are only successful where there is a commitment to maintenance and where money, spare parts and skilled mechanics are available to ensure regular servicing and repair. Few people think of animal draught power as an alternative and, remarkably, of the hundreds of projects in Madagascar, none has been devoted solely to its development. Nevertheless, using animal traction for ploughing produces good results since it takes only six days to plough one hectare instead of 60 using the angady. A farmer can therefore cultivate four or five hectares during the best sowing season and prepare land on the hillsides as well as paddies along the valley floor. Implements and harness equipment can, for the most part, be maintained and repaired by the owner himself, by the local blacksmith or at the local market. Although zebus are plentiful in Madagascar (there are almost as many zebus as there are people), developing animal traction is not easy. It is the dream of every farmer to own a zebu and, when his dream comes true, he becomes the animal's slave as he strives to feed and care for it. The zebu also becomes a form of savings bank because it is easy to sell if the need arises. In effect, farmers are happy just to feed their cattle and keep them to a great age. Yet one solution to the challenge of achieving food self-sufficiency in Madagascar could be to improve the productivity of farmers by making some of their zebu cattle work for their living. 'Operation Plough' schemes have been tried before in Madagascar, but they failed. Sometimes this was because ploughs were acquired by farmers who had no zebu to draw them, and sometimes because zebus were acquired by farmers who neither knew how to feed nor look after them. It was a case of 'putting the plough before the ox'. It would have been better to have begun by training the animals and targeting only those farmers who already owned zebus and knew how to look after them. In the thirties, near Lake Alaotra, in a region known as the 'rice bowl' of Madagascar, a training centre was established to which farmers could bring their zebus. The incentive was the opportunity to buy a plough at a very favourable price. And now no-one in the region works his paddy field with an angady. Draught cultivation is widespread and it is the only region of Madagascar where a commercial surplus of rice is produced. This proves the viability of animal draught power in Madagascar. In the future, animal traction should not remain merely a secondary project component. It should be the principal component in all rural development projects where the major constraint is the human muscle power involved. In Madagascar, where 85 % {{of the working}} population earn their living through agriculture and livestock farming, farmers produce mainly rice and zebu cattle.
