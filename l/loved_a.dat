500|$|Patton's niece Jean Gordon {{appeared}} again; {{they spent}} some time together in London in 1944, and again in Bavaria in 1945. Gordon actually <b>loved</b> <b>a</b> young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945. Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with this young woman but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson says the relationship was casual. Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility. D'Este agrees, saying, [...] "His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [...] and 1944–45, {{the presence of the}} young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} mermaid stories {{appeared}} in Assyria c. 1000 BC. [...] The goddess Atargatis, mother of Assyrian queen Semiramis, <b>loved</b> <b>a</b> mortal (a shepherd) and unintentionally killed him. Ashamed, she jumped into a lake {{and took the}} form of a fish, but the waters would not conceal her divine beauty. Thereafter, she {{took the form of}} a mermaid— human above the waist, fish below— although the earliest representations of Atargatis showed her as a fish with a human head and arm, similar to the Babylonian god Ea. The Greeks recognized Atargatis under the name Derketo. Sometime before 546 BC, Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species. He thought that humans, who begin life with prolonged infancy, could not have survived otherwise.|$|E

500|$|Although some reviewers, {{including}} Yahr and TVLine Michael Slezak, were unenthusiastic about Blaine's {{visit to}} Burt {{to get him}} to have [...] "the talk" [...] with Kurt, there was widespread praise for the talk itself, which Jen Harper of BuddyTV described as the [...] "best scene" [...] of the episode. Fallon called it [...] "one of the most uncomfortable father–son sex talks ever committed to television (and thus, really, one of the most realistic)", and his colleague Brown said it became [...] "something lovely, open-hearted, and true". Gonzalez deemed it awkward to watch, yet wrote that the scene served to convince her she had [...] "never <b>loved</b> <b>a</b> father-son pair" [...] more. Poniewozik found it realistic and moving, and gave particular praise to O'Malley for portraying Burt's [...] "determination and awkwardness in helping his son", as did Slezak: [...] "his completely grounded performance helps anchor the show in reality".|$|E
500|$|Until {{asked to}} perform and {{interpret}} Joaquín Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez in 1991, de Lucía was not proficient at reading musical notation. Biographer Pohren, however, {{at the time}} of writing his biography in 1992, said that he was still not proficient and had found a bizarre way of learning the piece, locking himself away. His performance with the orchestra under Edmon Colomer was highly acclaimed, a sensitive, atmospheric rendition that composer Rodrigo himself praised, describing it as [...] "pretty, exotic, inspired" ... I might add that Paco plays it {{with a great deal of}} feeling, far more than is normally heard. And that goes for the orchestra that backs him up." [...] In 1992, he performed live at the bullring at Seville Expo '92, and a year later on the Plaza Mayor in Madrid, playing [...] "La Barrosa". In 1995, he and Bryan Adams recorded the hit song and video Have You Ever Really <b>Loved</b> <b>A</b> Woman on the soundtrack for the American film Don Juan DeMarco.|$|E

500|$|Part IV {{consists}} {{of only one}} chapter, which, like the book's opening chapter, is mostly composed {{of a series of}} seemingly unrelated vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder of the chapter {{consists of}} the vignettes [...] "Saint Kevin", [...] "Berkely and Patrick" [...] and [...] "The Revered Letter". ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake her sleeping husband, declaring [...] "Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!", and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a <b>loved</b> <b>a</b> long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.|$|E
500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Matt Bjorke of About.com deemed the song {{as one of}} the album's highlights, while Elizabeth Kessler of Yahoo! commented that [...] "hardly any song can compare to this love anthem! ... Everyone feels their insides tug as they listen to this heart wrenching song." [...] Country Universe writer Kevin John Coyne did separate reviews for [...] "From This Moment On". While reviewing the duet, Coyne graded it a B and commented that it was mostly a showcase of White's vocals, [...] "who turns in some signature licks and makes Twain seem a bit bland in comparison. [...] However, it also gives the song a bit of a mid-eighties Peter Cetera vibe, which hasn’t held up well over time." [...] Coyne concluded, however, that the single release turned the track [...] "into a potent solo number," [...] and noted that [...] "the addition of a Spanish-flavored guitar that borrowed heavily from 'Have You Ever Really <b>Loved</b> <b>a</b> Woman' [...] gave the ballad added oomph." [...] He graded the single release at an A-. At the 1999 Canadian Country Music Awards, [...] "From This Moment On" [...] won the award for Vocal/Instrumental Collaboration of the Year.|$|E
500|$|The view {{of history}} propounded in this text is very {{strongly}} influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola {{are important to the}} interplay of the [...] "characters." [...] Vico propounded a cyclical {{view of history}}, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory of history {{is to be found in}} the opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words [...] "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." [...] ("vicus" [...] is a pun on Vico) and ends [...] "A way a lone a last a <b>loved</b> <b>a</b> long the." [...] In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from [...] "ideal insomnia" [...] and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.|$|E
