5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
5|$|The non-sliding <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale,</b> Gunter's rule, {{was invented}} shortly after Napier's invention. William Oughtred {{enhanced}} it {{to create the}} slide rule—a pair of logarithmic scales movable with respect to each other. Numbers are placed on sliding scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. Sliding the upper scale appropriately amounts to mechanically adding logarithms. For example, adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale yields a product of 6, which is read off at the lower part. The slide rule was an essential calculating tool for engineers and scientists until the 1970s, because it allows, {{at the expense of}} precision, much faster computation than techniques based on tables.|$|E

500|$|<b>Logarithmic</b> <b>scales</b> {{are useful}} for {{quantifying}} the relative change of a value as opposed to its absolute difference. Moreover, because the logarithmic function [...] grows very slowly for large x, <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scales</b> are used to compress large-scale scientific data.

5|$|Scientific {{quantities}} {{are often}} expressed as logarithms of other quantities, using a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale.</b> For example, the decibel is {{a unit of}} measurement associated with logarithmic-scale quantities. It {{is based on the}} common logarithm of ratios—10 times the common logarithm of a power ratio or 20 times the common logarithm of a voltage ratio. It is used to quantify the loss of voltage levels in transmitting electrical signals, to describe power levels of sounds in acoustics, and the absorbance of light in the fields of spectrometry and optics. The signal-to-noise ratio describing the amount of unwanted noise in relation to a (meaningful) signal is also measured in decibels. In a similar vein, the peak signal-to-noise ratio is commonly used to assess the quality of sound and image compression methods using the logarithm.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scale,</b> sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

40|$|Many {{physical}} systems {{share the}} property of scale invariance. Most of them show ordinary power-law scaling, where quantities can be expressed as a leading power law times a scaling function which depends on scaling-invariant ratios of the parameters. However, some systems do not obey power-law scaling, instead there is numerical evidence for a <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scaling</b> form, in which the scaling function depends on ratios of the logarithms of the parameters. Based on previous ideas by C. Tang we propose {{that this type of}} <b>logarithmic</b> <b>scaling</b> can be explained by a concept of local scaling invariance with continuously varying exponents. The functional dependence of the exponents is constrained by a homomorphism, which can be expressed as a set of partial differential equations.
