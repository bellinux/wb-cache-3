In contact with surface oxides it forms hydroxides, water, or hydrogenated complexes, which are volatile at soldering temperatures. The most practical dissociation method is probably an electrical discharge. Argon-hydrogen gas compositions with hydrogen concentration below the <b>low</b> <b>flammable</b> limit can be used, eliminating the safety issues. The operation has to be performed at low pressure, as the stability of atomic hydrogen at atmospheric pressure is insufficient. Such hydrogen plasma {{can be used for}} fluxless reflow soldering.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{enhanced}} recovery techniques {{have been used}} in the Fruitvale Field. In 1972, operators began waterflooding, thereby attempting to push the heavy crude to production wells, increasing the rate of extraction; in 1976, they began using cyclic steam flooding, a generally more effective technique for heavy oil, as the heat considerably reduces the oil's viscosity, helping it to flow. [...] Fireflooding, an {{enhanced recovery}} technology in which <b>flammable</b> <b>units</b> deep underground are ignited—in this case, a 15 ft thick section of oil sand—began in 1980 in the portion of the field operated by Gulf. Engineers at the time believed that up to 400 million further barrels of oil could be recovered from the field, oil which could be made to flow due to the intense heat generated by this process.|$|R
40|$|Flame liftoff height {{data were}} {{obtained}} on lifted methane jet flames diluted with nitrogen at transition regime Reynolds numbers. The data were analyzed to better understand and model natural gas combustion phenomena, in particular the effects of dilution in the near transition regime of methane jet flames. Images of the stable lifted flames were obtained at low Reynolds numbers from 2000 to 3800. This regime of Reynolds numbers was chosen due to the instability of laminar, lifted methane flames at these lower Reynolds numbers. Amongst other applications, lifted flames are often utilized in boilers and industrial burners to reduce thermal stresses, and are thus of importance in natural gas and low calorific fuel gas combustion.

Its degradation point starts from 500 °C and it has no melting point. It is sensitive to salts, acids, and ultraviolet radiation. When {{it comes to the}} static build-up in the body it is prone to it as well 1. Protection is also based on the pressure of the impact. Some of these fabrics are only designed with hand-guns in mind basically making anything with a bigger calibre a threat potential. One cannot wear a GoldFlex and expect a large caliber round (E.G [...]50 BMG round) to be stopped from penetrating it. Also GoldFlex is not the only material that is responsible for minimizing penetration and absorbing the attack. Along with GoldFlex there are other layers on top of this fabric to ensure that the object does not penetrate through the material.|$|R

It {{is a member of}} several types of saltbush-greasewood plant communities, the two shrub types often occurring together. In some habitats it is a climax species but it also takes hold during secondary succession after a habitat has been disturbed. This species is considered fire-resistant because it is <b>low</b> in <b>flammable</b> oils and high in ash and similar compounds. When it does burn down, the plant grows back quickly by resprouting from its roots. It is sometimes planted in fuelbreaks in California.|$|R
40|$|To develop {{functional}} sustainable epoxy resins, {{we report}} a novel epoxy resin (DEU-EP) with high net biobased content (70. 2 wt%) derived from renewable eugenol. We comparatively study DEU-EP with a commercial bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) {{in the presence}} of a diamine curing agent, 4, 4 ′-diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM). Differential scanning calorimetry reveals that DEU-EP can be sufficiently cured by DDM at a slower rate than DGEBA. By applying an autocatalytic reaction kinetic model we adequately simulate the curing rate of DEU-EP/DDM, and reveal its detailed kinetic mechanisms from model-free isoconversional analysis. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows that DEU-EP/DDM takes the higher storage modulus up to ∼ 97 °C than does DGEBA/DDM with the glass temperature of 114 °C. Nanoindentation and thermogravimetric analyses demonstrate that compared with DGEBA/DDM, DEU-EP/DDM exhibits a 20 %, 6. 7 % and 111 % increase in Young’s modulus, hardness and char yield, respectively. Microscale combustion calorimetry data show that DEU-EP/DDM expresses 55 % and 38 % lower heat release rate and total heat release than does DGEBA/DDM, respectively. The horizontal burning test approves DEU-EP/DDM can self-extinguish in a short time. Our results demonstrate that the eugenol building blocks and their arrangement greatly affect the cure behaviors of DEU-EP/DDM, and contribute significantly to its enhanced mechanical properties, high-temperature charring ability and chain motions at the glassy state, as well as the reduced flammability. To summarize, DEU-EP exhibits a high promise as a new sustainable epoxy monomer for fabricating high biobased content, high rigid and <b>low</b> <b>flammable</b> epoxy materials...|$|R

40|$|Type of {{refrigerant}} {{the most}} recognized {{and the most}} used today in the vapor compression cycle is R- 12 refrigerant (halocarbon group), which is technically quite good. The refrigerant also has low toxicity and <b>low</b> <b>flammable.</b> But, in the mid 1970 ’s known that chlorine has contained in the refrigerant were released into the environment could damage of ozone in the stratosphere and caused greenhouse effect. Because of that, it using has stopped. An alternative refrigerant is hydrocarbon refrigerant (HCR) and one of it is hydrocarbon- 12 (HCR- 12). HCR- 12 have several advantages, besides friendly environmental because have low global warming effect and low destruction of ozone, this type of refrigerator {{can be used as}} direct changer on the refrigerant machine so no needed compressor replacement and more efficient electric energy than R- 12. In this research, did a study experimental to compared R- 12 with HCR- 12 with used vapor compression cooler machine. The result of measurement have been get performance of vapor compression cooler machine COPR (Coefficient of Performance Refrigeration) and COP (Coefficient of Performance Heat Pump) for R- 12 and HCR- 12 relatively are 2. 4 – 9. 8 (COPRHP) and 3. 4 – 10. 8 (COP) and 6. 4 – 14. 1 (COP R) and 7. 4 – 15. 1 (COPHP). Performance of vapor compression cooler machine COP and COP have tendency increase with increase rate of flow of refrigerant until 0. 035 for R- 12 and 0. 014 for HCR- 12. Performance vapor compression cooler machine of COPHP increase if absorbed of heat (Qe) by evaporator increase and COPHPR increase if released of heat (Q) by condenser increase.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the production of biogas from abattoir cow liquor waste (CLW) on biogas production of some agroindustrial wastes. The wastes; brewery spent grain (BS), cassava waste water (CW) and carbonated soft drink sludge (CS) were combined with definite proportions of cow liquor waste to produce biogas under anaerobic digestion for a 25 day retention period. The wastes were combined in the ratios: CLW:BS (1 : 1), CLW:CS (3 : 1) and CLW:CW (1 : 3). The results obtained indicated increased biogas production when BS and CW were inoculated with CLW, while it had {{a negative effect on}} CS. The mean biogas production of BS and CS were 8. 72 and 8. 12 L, respectively, while CW had no biogas production. When inoculated with CLW, the mean biogas production of BS increased to 24. 28 L. CW experienced gas production with mean biogas yield of 8. 36 L while the gas production of CS reduced to 2. 84 L. The CLW:BS blend had the shortest time lag from gas production to onset of gas flammability of 7 days while CLW:CW and CLW:CS had time lag of 10 and 11 days respectively. The retention times for the CLW:CW and CLW:CS was 17 and 21 days, respectively. Overall results indicated that while the <b>low</b> biogas and/or <b>flammable</b> biogas production of brewery spent grain could be enhanced significantly in the presence of cow liquor waste.
