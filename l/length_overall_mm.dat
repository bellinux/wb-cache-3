5000|$|There {{have been}} three {{attempts}} at a carbine version of the L85. The first was in 1989 (<b>length</b> <b>overall</b> 556 <b>mm,</b> barrel <b>length</b> 289 mm). The second attempt, which was in 1994, used the standard L86 LSW handguard and a 17.4-inch barrel (<b>length</b> <b>overall</b> 709 <b>mm,</b> barrel <b>length</b> 442 mm). The third attempt (2003-2004) is also {{the only one to}} officially be adopted - the L22. This resembles the 1989 model but has all the necessary A2 upgrades, and has a 318 mm (12.5 in) barrel and an <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> of 585 <b>mm.</b> Around 1,500 were [...] "manufactured" [...] from surplus L86 LSWs; more were built with the increased demand. Due to the shortened barrel (12.5 in), it is less accurate and less powerful, especially at long ranges. Because there is no handguard, these guns are outfitted with a vertical front grip. It exists only in A2 variants as they were made to A2 standard. Initially issued to tank and armoured vehicle crews for emergency action out of vehicle, the L22 has been seen {{in the hands of the}} Royal Marines Fleet Protection Group and pilots of all three services due to its compact size.|$|R
5000|$|Intended {{for use by}} cavalry, engineers, quartermasters {{and other}} non-frontline troops, the Type 38 carbine was {{introduced}} into service {{at the same time}} as the standard Type 38. Its barrel was 487 <b>mm,</b> <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> 966 <b>mm,</b> and weight 3.3 kg. The rifle lacked a bayonet. It was produced in a number of locations: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{visualization}} {{study was}} to obtain {{a better understanding of}} the mechanism by which trapped air is removed from the apical region of simulated root canals by activation of an irrigant using an erbium, chromium:yttrium-scandium-gallium-garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser during endodontic procedures. A high-speed imaging system with high temporal and spatial resolution was used to visualize laser-induced shock waves in a resin block model with a curved root canal (inner diameter at the apex 0. 08 mm, taper 4 %, crown height 10 <b>mm,</b> <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> 40 <b>mm)</b> and a glass cylinder model with a straight root canal (inner diameter 1 mm, crown height 10 <b>mm,</b> <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> 40 <b>mm).</b> The study utilized MZ 3 and RFT 3 tips in each model, without water or air spray, and with an average power of 1 W at 35 Hz. Laser-activated irrigation overcame the airlock effect by releasing air trapped in the air column. The mechanism underlying the removal of trapped air from the apical region using an Er,Cr:YSGG laser in a dry root canal is via the disruption of the surface tension at the solution-air interface. This disruption, caused by bubble implosion (cavitation), displaces air in the form of bubbles from the apical region toward the solution, which allows the solution to travel apically...|$|R

5000|$|The [...]338 Norma Magnum {{prior to}} C.I.P. {{certification}} had a shorter cartridge <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> (91.44 <b>mm</b> (3.60 in)) {{compared to the}} cartridge <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> of the [...]338 Lapua Magnum (93.50 mm (3.681 in)). The [...]338 Norma Magnum loaded with 19.44 g (300 gr) [...]338 caliber Sierra HPBT projectiles will have these projectile less deeply seated compared to the [...]338 Lapua Magnum when both cartridges are loaded to 91.44 <b>mm</b> (3.681 in) <b>overall</b> <b>length.</b> To achieve this the [...]338 Norma Magnum cartridge utilizes a shorter case (about 63.30 mm (2.492 in)) with less taper and a slightly sharper shoulder angle with a slightly longer neck, resulting in about 6.5% less case capacity. However the cartridge <b>overall</b> <b>lengths</b> of the [...]338 Norma Magnum and [...]338 Lapua Magnum are currently (2013) determined at 93.50 mm (3.681 in) by the C.I.P. rulings for these cartridges.|$|R
50|$|The Brougham {{featured}} a greater level of luxury than the Premier, {{which had been}} {{the top of the}} range Holden since the introduction of the nameplate in 1962. The Brougham also {{featured a}}n <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> 200 <b>mm</b> greater than the other HK sedans, although this extra length was added to the body only, while the wheelbase remained unchanged at 111 inches. It was equipped with the 307 cubic inch V8 engine as standard. The Monaro models were 2-door coupes, the first such vehicles to be offered by Holden and the Monaro GTS 327 featured a 327 cuin L Chevrolet V8 engine which was not available in any other Holden model but was available in the larger GMH assembled Chevrolet Impala and Pontiac Parisienne.|$|R
5000|$|The GAZ-24 was {{developed}} to replace the outdated Volga GAZ-21 developed in the 1950s. The new Volga had a longer wheelbase (2800 mm) than the GAZ-21 (2700 mm (106 in), but slightly shorter <b>overall</b> <b>length</b> (4735 <b>mm</b> compared to 4810 mm) [...] ) and was substantially lower at 1490 mm) compared to 1620 mm. Width remained untouched. Long wheelbase, boxier styling, bucket seats with lower bases and flat roof made the new Volga generously sized inside, with comfortable five- or six-passenger seating. The car was designed to last for years in severe road conditions, and its reinforced unibody construction gave the Volga extra weight if compared to foreign analogues. Yet power steering was not even an option, and it gained the nickname [...] "barzha" [...] (barge).|$|R
