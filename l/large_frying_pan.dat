50|$|As a stew, it {{is unique}} in that all the main {{ingredients}} are cut into slices, so as to lie flat. Because of this, it is normally cooked in a <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan,</b> {{on top of the}} stove, and served on a plate (as opposed to a bowl). The vegetables used are typically potatoes, onions, carrots (sliced lengthwise) and peas. Although usually made with smoked bacon, minced beef is occasionally substituted.|$|E
50|$|Two eggs, {{one-half}} cup of milk, one-half cup of flour, a {{pinch of}} salt, a little nutmeg and one teaspoonful of sugar. Mix well. Have a <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> ready with hot butter. Be sure and have the butter run all over {{the inside of the}} pan so the pancake will not stick to the sides when it rises. Pour in the batter and place in oven. When nearly done, powder with sugar and put back in oven to brown. Serve with lemon and powdered sugar.|$|E

They chose to build a <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> because the cowboy breakfast is cooked over open flames using mostly cast iron frying pans.|$|E

50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated in a <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan.</b> Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|E

He is jealous of Harlequin, to whom Cassander wants to give his daughter. Without Harlequin's seeing him do it, he annoys him with his fishing line. Thinking Cassander is to blame, Harlequin punches the old man, knocking him to the ground. Columbine, indignant, slaps Harlequin's face. Pierrot, after having helped Cassander up, tries to goad Harlequin into a fight. The latter refuses. [...] "I don't fight with a valet", he says. And to calm Cassander, he gives him an enormous watch. Cassander softens, and shushes Pierrot, who wants to swoop down on his rival. In {{the midst of this}} brawl, Cassander receives the blows of the two combatants. Columbine, to calm Pierrot, whom she loves, gives him her flower without being seen by Harlequin.|$|E

Internees were sent meat from an army slaughterhouse; it was brought through the compound by train. This meat was unrefrigerated and many times kept uncovered. The only equipment left over or given to the internees was two <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pans,</b> two copper pots, some tin pails, a dozen knives {{and a couple of}} bowls.

50|$|The Delmarva Chicken Festival is {{an annual}} event {{sponsored}} by Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc started in 1948 {{with the purpose of}} publicizing the Delmarva Peninsula with an emphasis on its arguably most important agricultural enterprise, raising chickens. The two-day event hosted in various locales on Delmarva features trade shows, arts and crafts, carnival, entertainment, and food concessions. Chicken is, of course, the featured food, but french fries, corn-on-the-cob, funnel cake, ice cream, kettle corn, and fresh-squeezed lemonade are other local favorites. Nearly three tons of chicken are cooked each year in the world's <b>largest</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan.</b> The pan made its debut at the second annual festival in 1950. The first and original pan was used and made by the Mumford Sheet Metal Company in Selbyville, Delaware. It was ten feet in diameter and had an eight-foot handle, weighed 650 pounds and could hold 800 chicken quarters. The 60th Annual Delmarva Chicken Festival took place June 19 and 20, 2009 in Centreville, Maryland, United States.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the degree of degradation of the soybean oil used in frying processes. The quality of the oil during the frying process was evaluated by means of physical-chemical analyses, such: conjugated dienes (%) and TBA index (mmoles g(- 1)), and determination of total polar compounds (%). It was observed that the values of conjugated dienes increasing significantly with time until 1. 87 % after 15 hours for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> I and 1. 76 % after 22. 5 hours for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> II. The TBA indexes reached at the end the frying process values of 0. 0265 and 0. 0210 mmoles g(- 1) for <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> I and II, respectively. The percentages of total polar compounds have shown an increase of six and eight times in relation to the original sample starting from 5. 9 % and 3. 7 % and reaching values of 36. 8 % and 29. 2 %, for <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> I and II, after 15 and 22. 5 hours of heating, respectively. It has been concluded that the alterations of the soybean oil increased as the time of frying increased, for both <b>fry</b> <b>pans.</b> The oil used in <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> I showed greater alteration than the that observed in the oil used in <b>fry</b> <b>pan</b> II, in spite of the time of heating being shorter. Taking into consideration that the levels of polar compounds should be less than 25 % according to the legislation of several countries, the oils used in both <b>fry</b> <b>pans</b> were already inadequate conditions at the moment of disposal...|$|R
