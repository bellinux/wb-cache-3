50|$|Selectrix {{locomotive}} decoders {{have traditionally}} been quite small in comparison to decoders used in competing systems. For this reason Selectrix {{has been a very}} popular choice in smaller N- and Z-scale model railways. A locomotive decoder has 5 bits reserved for controlling the locomotive speed. This gives 32 speed steps in both directions. Internally most Selectrix decoders use 128 speed steps though. In addition to speed control a Selectrix decoder provides control for <b>locomotive</b> <b>head</b> and rear <b>lights</b> and one additional function. If more functionality is required, there are Selectrix decoders equipped with SUSI-bus for an additional sound decoder or similar.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the issues strictly {{connected with the}} scientific discipline of Transport, concerning the exploitation of lighting devices, reflectors and projectors being the fundamental devices for tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting.</b> The factor influencing {{the safety of a}} moving track vehicle is the quality and state of tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting.</b> Appropriate light distribution within the area of tram’s foreground plays a decisive role in the perception of luminous sensations by the tram driver. A properly shaped light beam conditions appropriate visibility from the tram driver’s seat and facilitates correct assessment of traffic situations connected with the behaviour of other road traffic participants. The history of development of <b>lighting</b> devices for <b>head</b> <b>lights</b> used for trams has been discussed. The article proposes and discusses application of AFS system in trams particularly accounting for proposals of new lighting requirements for tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lighting</b> devices. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} photometric requirements for projectors and reflectors of tram’s <b>head</b> <b>lights,</b> presenting proposals for these requirements. After conducting a lighting analysis of currently exploited light beams it has been established that justification exists for using symmetrical light beams in the case of head, main and low beam lights.
