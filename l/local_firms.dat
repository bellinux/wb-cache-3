5|$|Many {{towns and}} cities began to erect war {{memorials}} after the armistice, but Manchester did not get underway until 1922. As a result of pressure from the local branch of the Royal British Legion, the city council formed a war memorial committee, chaired by the mayor, to explore options for commemoration. The committee raised £10,000 in subscriptions and donors were told that <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> would benefit from the construction and resulting employment.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, <b>local</b> <b>firms,</b> with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E

50|$|Confusingly, in the United Kingdom the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> of Deloitte, Haskins & Sells merged instead with Coopers & Lybrand. For {{some years}} after the merger, the merged firm was called Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte and the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> of Touche Ross kept its {{original}} name. In the mid 1990s however, both UK firms changed their names to match those of their respective international organizations. On the other hand, in Australia the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> of Touche Ross merged instead with KPMG. It is for these reasons that the Deloitte & Touche international organization was known as DRT International (later DTT International), to avoid use of names {{which would have been}} ambiguous (as well as contested) in certain markets.|$|R

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{ownership}} in foreign market entry {{is an important}} topic in the entry mode literature. Yet the determinants of the share of ownership sought in cross-border acquisitions (CBAs) have not received much research attention. Drawing on multiple theoretical explanations, we develop and test hypotheses on factors influencing the share of equity sought by foreign firms in CBAs. Findings based on a sample of CBAs by US firms show that the share of equity sought is influenced by many factors, including the cost of valuing <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> assets, difficulty in integrating <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> managers in culturally distant countries, the cost of separating desired assets {{from the rest of}} the <b>local</b> <b>firm,</b> and the cost of resource commitment under exogenous uncertainty. ...|$|R

25|$|Still, {{pollution}} {{reaches the}} Paulins Kill from nearby residential developments and farm run-off containing agricultural pesticides and fertilizers. Several farms {{along the banks}} of the Paulins Kill produce alfalfa, wheat, corn, hay (and historically, barley, buckwheat and rye). Fruit trees in orchards produce cherries, apples, plums, peaches and pears, while native wild grape vines, and blackberry bushes are also found in the valley. New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection occasionally brings civil actions against <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> that pollute in the Paulins Kill watershed, such as a $121,500 fine for a Sussex County shopping mall sewage treatment facility which discharged pollutants into a tributary of the Paulins Kill between 1996 and 1998.|$|E
25|$|Project finance, i.e. {{financing}} secured {{primarily by}} the projected revenue stream of the project, has been commonly used to finance wastewater treatment plants in Saudi Arabia. In May 2002 the first wastewater contract in Saudi Arabia financed in this way, in this case as a BOT contract, was awarded to a consortium of <b>local</b> <b>firms.</b> The consortium was to rehabilitate, operate, maintain and upgrade the wastewater system of the Jeddah Industrial City {{over a period of}} 20 years and invest US$32 million. The government has awarded many more BOT wastewater treatment contracts since then, based on the revenue stream of long-term sales agreements for treated wastewater sold to major customers.|$|E
25|$|RBI also {{exercises}} {{a system}} of capital controls in addition to intervention (through active trading) in currency markets. On the current account, there are no currency-conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange (although trade barriers exist). On the capital account, foreign institutional investors have convertibility to bring money {{into and out of}} the country and buy securities (subject to quantitative restrictions). <b>Local</b> <b>firms</b> are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. However, local households are restricted in their ability to diversify globally. Because of the expansion of the current and capital accounts, India is increasingly moving towards full de facto convertibility.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors model rent seeking in {{litigation}} in weak legal systems as a Tulloch contest in which litigators may seek {{to influence the}} court directly through bribery {{as well as through}} the merit of the legal case that they bring. If the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> has a competitive advantage in influencing the court then there is a strategic asymmetry between the players: the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> regards expenditure by the foreign firm as a strategic complement, but the foreign <b>firm</b> regards <b>local</b> expenditure as a strategic substitute. This leads to different attitudes to commitment: the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> would like to commit to a high level of effort to influence the court, the foreign firm to a low one. There is also an asymmetry in the commitment technology. It is not easy to commit to a low level of bribery, but it is feasible to commit to a high one: once a payment is made it cannot be easily recovered. The authors model the interaction as a two stage game: the players simultaneously commit to a minimum level of effort, then play a simultaneous Tulloch influence game. They find a continuum of equilibria. An equilibrium selection argument selects a unique equilibrium that is outcome equivalent to the Stackelberg equilibrium of a simple Tulloch contest in which the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> moves first. Thus they find an argument for endogenous timing: the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> moves first and secures a first mover advantage...|$|R

25|$|However, many {{regulatory}} {{barriers to}} entry remain to protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights {{in the face of}} rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.|$|E
25|$|The Honan Chapel is internationally {{regarded}} as representing the best artwork of the Irish Arts & Crafts Movement (1894–1925). However, socially, {{the commission was}} also significant because the project generated much needed work in Cork during the First World War (1914–18). The project fostered the revival of silver and textile craft working, once central to the Cork economy, and supported <b>local</b> <b>firms,</b> through patronage, such as the builders John Sisk & Son. Today Sisk is a construction firm of national importance. Egan’s of Patrick Street continued making liturgical altar plate and textiles until it ceased trading in 1986. As a central figure behind the Honan commission, Rev. Sir John Robert O’Connell was a catalyst in Irish cultural life {{at the turn of}} the twentieth century. His collaboration with Sir Bertram Windle between 1914-17 greatly assisted the physical expansion of University College Cork and the revival of craft industry in Cork.|$|E

Edward Albert Stone was the architect, Griggs & Son Ltd of Westminster were the main building contractors, Major C.H. Bell acted as consultant engineer and local firm H. Lasenby Bros. were contracted to demolish and clear the site. The main concrete structure of the building was supplied by British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd of Stafford. The cast stone façade was produced by the Patent Impervious Stone and Construction Co Ltd of Leyton. Another London firm, Dawnay & Sons Ltd, provided the steelwork, but the brickwork was produced locally by the Sussex Brick Co. Ltd of Horsham. Tiling company Ramsdens of Westminster {{were responsible for the}} terrazzo floors and wall decoration, and the plasterwork was by H.E. Gaze Ltd of London. Two other London firms, the Carrier Engineering Co. Ltd and Berkeley Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively supplied ventilation and heating equipment and installed the electric systems and lighting. Furnishings were by W.W. Turner & Co. Ltd of Birmingham, and Henri & Laverdet Ltd (the firm of Marc-Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet) were the interior designers. The John Compton Organ Co. of Acton installed the organ.

500|$|Foreign {{domestic}} {{workers are}} recruited primarily {{by a large}} number of specialised agencies, with <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> connected to correspondents in the workers' home countries.

Local agencies dealing with workers from the Philippines are accredited by the Philippine consulate. To hire an Indonesian worker, an employer must use an agent; there is no similar requirement for Filipino workers. Although agency fees are regulated by law to 10 percent of one month's salary, some agencies in the workers' countries charge commissions and [...] "training" [...] fees which take several months to pay off.

500|$|Important {{transport}} links {{contributed to the}} growth of the town and the textile industry; the Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal constructed in 1791, connected the town to Bury and Manchester providing transport for coal and other basic materials. The Bolton and Leigh Railway, the oldest in Lancashire, opened to goods traffic in 1828 and Great Moor Street station opened to passengers in 1831. The railway initially connected Bolton to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Leigh, an important link with the port of Liverpool for the import of raw cotton from America, but was extended in 1829 to link up with the Manchester to Liverpool Line. <b>Local</b> <b>firms</b> built locomotives for the railway, in 1830 [...] "Union" [...] was built by Rothwell, Hick and Company and two locomotives, [...] "Salamander" [...] and [...] "Veteran" [...] were built by Crook and Dean.|$|E
500|$|Cotton {{serves as}} the base for the nation's {{industrial}} sector. Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each {{in the form of}} phutti (seed cotton) during 2014–15; this [...] was an 11% increase compared to the previous season (2013–14). Its phenomenal growth was from 1.38 million bales in 1961 to 11.138 million bales in 2014, with the estimated 2014–15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales. Between 1980–81 and 1990–91, the growth in production was rapid, with production rising from 0.70 million to 2.2 million tonnes, which was called the [...] "magic year" [...] of Pakistan's cotton industry. This was attributed to better pest control measures, use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers. The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1,000 ginneries, 425 textile mills, and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners. Cotton hybrids, created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties, have been developed by <b>local</b> <b>firms</b> dealing with seeds. In Sindh province cotton is grown in more than one million acres in the districts of Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Mirpur Khas, Naushero Feroz, Sanghar, Badin, Sukkar, Ghotki, Tharparkar, Thatta and Umar Kot.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} which personal characteristics underlie {{four types of}} allegiances that expatriates may have to the parent <b>firm</b> and the <b>local</b> <b>firm.</b> The four types are free agents: low allegiance to either firm; going native expatriates: high allegiance to the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> and a low allegiance to the parent firm; hearts-at-the-parent-company expatriates: low allegiance to the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> and a high allegiance to the parent firm; dual citizens: they have a high allegiance to both the parent and the <b>local</b> <b>firm.</b> Expatriates of a big international company (N = 127) rated the importance of items referring to cultural empathy, open-mindedness, extraversion, emotional stability, adventurousness, orientation to action, flexibility, perseverance and organization commitment to multicultural success. Factor analysis showed that flexibility and adventurousness {{are associated with the}} free-agent allegiance, extraversion and cultural empathy with the going-native allegiance, open-mindedness and orientation to action with the dual citizen allegiance, and commitment to the company and perseverance to the heart-at-the-parent-company allegiance. The perceived importance of the allegiances differed dependent upon the expatriates' age and their type of job. Interestingly, expatriates who were stationed in Africa considered the going-native and the free-agent allegiances to be of less importance than did expatriates who were stationed elsewhere.

40|$|The {{internationalization}} {{of production}} requires each multinational firm {{to determine the}} local content rate for his product that is made and sold in a foreign country. In this thesis, we investigate the local content rate and pricing decisions for a multinational firm who competes with a <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> in a market without and with a local content requirement (LCR). We develop and solve a two-stage decision problem in which the multinational firm determines his optimal local content rate and the two firms then make their pricing decisions. Our analytical {{results show that the}} multinational firm sets a lower local content rate, when the competition between the product of the multinational firm and that of the <b>local</b> <b>firm</b> intensifies, consumers 2 ̆ 7 valuation is more strongly affected by the quality of the product of the multinational firm, and the reduction in consumers 2 ̆ 7 marginal utility is smaller. We also show that an LCR may induce the multinational <b>firm</b> to increase <b>local</b> content rate and transfer benefits from the multinational <b>firm</b> to the <b>local</b> <b>firm.</b> However, a very high LCR threshold will cause the multinational firm to adopt a low local content rate, resulting in a low demand and profit for both the multinational <b>firm</b> and the <b>local</b> <b>firm...</b>|$|R
