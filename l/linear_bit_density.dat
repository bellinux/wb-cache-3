50|$|HDD data {{transfer}} rate depends upon the rotational speed of the disks and the data recording density. Because heat and vibration limit rotational speed, increasing density has become the main method to improve sequential transfer rates. Areal density (the number of bits that {{can be stored in}} a certain area of the disk) has been increased over time by increasing both the number of tracks across the disk, and the number of sectors per track. The latter will increase the {{data transfer}} rate for a given RPM speed. Improvement of {{data transfer rate}} performance is correlated to the areal density only by increasing a track's <b>linear</b> surface <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> (sectors per track). Simply increasing the number of tracks on a disk can affect seek times but not gross transfer rates.

Seek times have not kept up with throughput increases, which themselves have not kept up with growth in <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> and storage capacity.|$|R
40|$|In {{magnetic}} {{high density}} recording media, the Wonnation is stared in the domain structure at the surface of thin films. Chemical, structural and magnetic properties at the surface plar {{an important role in}} the reading and writing process. In this thesis the results of an investigation on sputtered Co-Cr films, a most promissing {{high density recording}} medium, are presented. Special attention is pared to the upper 50 nm of the films, which is indicated as surface. It appeared from XPS and Auger experiments that the oxidized scale on room temperature annealed RF- and MRF-sputtered Co 81 Crl 9 films was abaut 6 nm thick and consisted of three different larers. The topology as investigated br SEM, AFM and STM appeared to be stronglr related to the film's column morphology. The roughness amplitude varied trom 6 nm for the thinner films to 50 nm for the thick Co-Cr films. In order to investigate the magnetism at the surface of these films a combined optical and magneto-optical measurement srstem has been built, based on a polarizer film rotating analrser ellipsometer. The dielectric tensor elements were determined and appeared ta be stronglr dependent on the morphology of the film under investigation. It can be concluded from these results and those of others, that the Kerr rotation can be considered ta be linearlr dependent on the magnetization. Hrsteresis curves could be measured very accuratelr with the intensity technique. Major, minor and in-plane loops as weIl as the angle dependencr of the magnetizatian were studied br Kerr tracer and V SM. The differences between the measurement results obtained br bath methods can be explained br demagnetizing effects and film in- homogenities. A model was developed in order to calculate the influence of roughness, oxidatian- segregation surface larers and closure domains on the maximum readable infarmatian density. It can be concluded from the results of this calculation, that the recording performances of next generation media will be limited br the surface properties. A large surface loss is expected for <b>linear</b> <b>bit</b> <b>densities</b> in the order of 30 Mbit/m.

40|$|To {{serve the}} needs of high <b>linear</b> <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> {{recording}} and high data transfer rate, a new perpendicular recording hard disk media constitution is proposed. In the new hard disk media, a Co-Cr layer is directly deposited on a soft-magnetic Mn-Zn single-crystal ferrite substrate.

This improvement in high frequencies is brought about by suppressing the eddy current losses because of high electric resistivity of the ferrite substrate...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{recording}} is nowadays {{the most}} widely used method for storing large amounts of data. A lot of effort is being spent on research on magnetic recording to increase the storage density. One principle cause, which limits the <b>linear</b> <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> in longitudinal recording systems, is the length of the magnetic transitions in the recording medium, due to demagnetizing forces. An answer to this problem is offered by perpendicular recording. Since the mid seventies there has been a growing interest in this recording mode. Because the magnetization of a perpendicular recording medium is oriented perpendicular to the substrate, the demagnetizing forces are strongly reduced in high-density recording. In part I of this thesis, the introduction, the principles of perpendicular recording are given and it is schematically shown that the transitions in a perpendicular recording medium can have negligible width, due to the favorable orientation of the magnetization. Also some complications are discussed, which may deteriorate the recording performance of the medium. The common core of these complications is formed by the longitudinal demagnetizing forces, which tend to close the magnetic flux within the medium. Certain cobalt-based alloys, having the hcp structure with perpendicular c-axis orientation, are suitable materials for a perpendicular recording medium. In practice the anisotropy axis coincides with the c-axis. The physical properties of these binary alloys, viz. the magnetization and the phase diagram, are discussed in chapter 4. The hysteresis loops of thin magnetic layers with perpendicular anisotropy is extensively treated in chapter 5. Two different models of magnetic microstructures are discussed, the stripe domain structure and colurnnar particle structure. The principal difference between these two structures is the way the short- range exchange forces extend through the medium. In the former these forces are able to extend throughout the medium, in which case the nucleation of a stripe domain pattern is a commonly observed microstructure in this kind of magnetic layers. In the latter the exchange forces are confined within the volume of the parti~les, which thus define the maximum size of magnetic domains. These physically opposite models are both investigated to find out how far they agree with the experimentally observed hysteretic properties of Co-Cr layers, which were used as recording medium in this work, and form a continuous theme throughout this thesis. The investigations on the Co-Cr medium are described in part II. First our investigations on the RF-sputter deposition of Co-Cr layers are reported in chapter 6. The morphology of the Co-Cr medium, as revealed by means of electron microscopy, is described in chapter 7. The medium appears to consist of columnarlike crystallites, which have grown perpendicular to the substrate (see fig. 7. 7). It is just this morphology, which strongly suggests a particulate structure because of the distinct profile of the crystallites. Chapter 8 contains the analysis of the magnetic anisotropy of the Co-Cr medium by means of torque and VSM measurements. Especially the magnitude of the anisotropy constants and the different causes of anisotropy were investigated. The intriguing question, whether the Co-Cr medium is. continuous. or. particulate., is discussed in chapter 9 {{on the basis of the}} perpendicular easy-axis loops. The experimental loops are compared with the theoretical results of chapter 5 and it appears that the continuous model agrees best with the experimental results. The coercivity of the Co-Cr medium is analysed in chapter 10, also on the basis of the continuous and the particulate models. It again appears that the continuous modeloffers the best explanation, in this case for the experimentallyobserved coercivity. An interim discussion is presented after chapter 10 in which a tentative description of the Co-Cr medium is given and the consequences for the recording behaviour are discussed. The contents of part III refer to investigations on the characteristics of perpendicular recording. The structure of magnetic transitions, which are induced by means of a single- pole type head into the Co-Cr medium, is investigated experimentally as well as theoretically and is described in chapter 12. In this analysis an accurate description of the head field is required, which is therefore first given in chapter 11...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{aspects of}} the use of magnetic force microscopy for the study of magnetic recording media. The maximum achievable storage density in magnetic recording is limited by the magnetic reversal behaviour of the medium and by the stability of the written information. The shape and size of the small magnetic units (bits as wen as domaiDs) in the media is strongly correlated to the microstructure of the layers. Surface roughness, colurnnar structure of the layer, segregation of the elements inside the crystallites as wen as surface and volume defects influence {{the size and shape of}} the magnetic structures in the layer. The physicallimit for the bit size is estimated to be about 50 x 50 Dm. Such an increase in bit writing density requires a magnetic microscopy technique which can image magnetic details of about 10 Dm size. The advantage of magnetic force microscopy for this purpose lies in the easy sample preparation, combined with a high achievable resolution. In Chapter 2 we have discussed the optimisation of the tip shape, the tip magnetic properties as weIl as the detection mode in order to reach the required resolution. It is shown there that an elongated magnetic needIe can combine a sufficient volume with a small tip front end and is therefore superior to a soft tip which should have a spherical shape. Por the bar type tip we have calculated a one-dimensional transfer function which relates the spatial frequency components of the force (or force deri vati ve) to the spatial frequency components of the sample magnetisation distribution. This transfer function depends on the sample thickness, the tip magnetic layer thickness, the tip length and the tip sample separation and shows a behaviour very similar to the readback frequency characteristics of a magnetic recording channel. With a given detector sensitivity a minimum detectable wavelength Ac can be determined from the transfer function which serves as a measure for the comparison of different detection modes. Prom this comparison, for maximum resolution an MFM should be operated in a constant distance dynamic mode with a low oscillation amplitude. The tip has to have a high Ms and Hc. The tip coercivity has to be a result of the shape anisotropy due to the high aspect ratio of the needIe like magnetic tip layer. In Chapter 3 the instrumentation of an S FM scan head is described. This scan head win be applied for MFM measurements in extemal magnetic fields of arbitrary direction with respect to the sample. Por this purpose it has to be operated between the poles of a resisti ve electromagnet in a vacuum in order to increase the Q factor of the resonating cantilever. in dynamic detection mode. The properties of the scan head are: -Extemal magnetic field: continuously between - 1. 8 T and 1. 8 T, with a 1 p pm long term stability -Scan range: about 40 ~m -Detection limit: 0. 1 Dm in a 1 kHz bandwidth -Scan head size: 26 x 30 x 42 mm -Complete software control of the whole instrument The instrument is controlled by two digital signal processor (DSP) boards. One of them generates the scan signals, the second board is responsible for the detection and feedback. Chapter 4 describes the fabrication and magnetic properties of magnetic tips made from electron beam assisted deposited carbon needIes. The carbon needIes are grown in a SEM where the hydrocarbon gas contamination originating from the diffusion pump is locaIly cracked by the electron beam. These carbon needIes are very weIl suited for evaporating magnetic materia! as Co or CogoNi 2 o onto their side. This way a tip shape very similar to the bar type tip as described in Chapter 2 can be created. Lorentz electron microscopy images prove a single domain behaviour of the tip in extemal fields up to about 0. 2 T. For higher fields the tip is split up into two antiparallel magnetic domains. This contiguration remained stabIe even in remanent states. At no time did the tip front end contain more than one domain. On a Co-Ni/Pt multilayer sample we could observe magnetic structures smaller than 30 nm dimension with EBill magnetic tips in a constant force derivative detection mode. Chapter 5 describes the application of magnetic force microscopy for the characterisation of magnetic recording media. First of a!l the techniques used for the quantification of data from MFM images are presented. We used a thresholding a!gorithm to estimate the underlying magnetisation pattem from the constant signa! MFM images. We have used Fourier descriptors to characterise the jaggedness of the boundary of magneto- optica! bits as weIl as of conventional bits. This a!lows a comparison of bits in different materials, written under the same settings as weIl as different writing conditions on the same media. The principle of this technique is shown in an example of magneto- optical bits. Furthermore, Chapter 5 gives examples of results on magnetic recording media which were gained by MFM. The influence of the sputtering bias voltage on the magnetic structures of Co-Ni/Pt multilayers bas been shown. On ME tape the edge overwrite behaviour has been studied as weIl as the difference in bit structure when the bits were written in the direction of the colurnnar inclination or antiparallel to it. Furthermore the the writing behaviour of a CoCrTa perpendicular materia! bas been investigated. 400 nm wide bit tracks of 200 kfrpi (127 nm bit length) have been studied in this materia!. AFM observations of the sample surface topography show that the smallest observed bits still contain about 30 crysta 1 lites.

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of storage media with highest <b>bit</b> <b>densities</b> {{is vital for}} modern computer technol-ogy. In conventional magnetic storage media, information is stored in a granular medium, where several grains form a bit. The information is given by {{the orientation of the}} magnetization in the grains. This imposes certain limits onto the possible storage capability, which is given by the <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> of the medium.

A possible improvement in bit size might be reached with a patterned medium where the bits consist of single homogeneously magnetized object instead of a certain amount of grains.

This method has three advantages: Firstly, the onset of the superparamagnetic effect is shifted to signiÞcantly smaller sizes. Secondly, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the non-irradiated areas separates the storage elements from each other very effectively due to the suppression of stray Þelds.

While our calculations are based on a particular (“CMOL”) memory topology, with naturally segmented nanowires and an area-distributed nano/CMOS interface, for realistic parameters our results are also applicable to “global ” cross-bar memories with peripheral interfaces. The results indicate that the crossbar memories with a nano/CMOS pitch ratio close to 1 / 3 (which is typical for the current, initial stage of the nanoelectron-ics development) may overcome purely semiconductor memories in useful <b>bit</b> <b>density</b> if the fraction of nanodevice defects (stuck-on-faults) is below ∼ 15 %, even under rather tough, 30 ns upper bound on the total access time. Moreover, as the technology matures, and the pitch ratio approaches an order of magnitude, the crossbar memories may be far superior to the densest semiconductor memories by providing, e. g., a 1 Tbit/cm 2 density even for a plausible defect fraction of 2 %. These highly encouraging results are much better than those reported in literature earlier, including ou...|$|R
