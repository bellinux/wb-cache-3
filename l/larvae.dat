5|$|Beetle <b>larvae</b> can be {{differentiated}} {{from other}} insect <b>larvae</b> by their hardened, often darkened heads, {{the presence of}} chewing mouthparts, and spiracles {{along the sides of}} their bodies. Like adult beetles, the <b>larvae</b> are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile <b>larvae</b> include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their <b>larvae</b> are described as campodeiform. Some beetle <b>larvae</b> resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform <b>larvae,</b> and are found in the click beetle (Elateridae) and darkling beetle (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform <b>larvae</b> of click beetles are known as wireworms. Beetles in the Scarabaeoidea have short, thick <b>larvae</b> described as scarabaeiform, more commonly known as grubs.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly {{cases are}} open at both ends, the <b>larvae</b> drawing oxygenated water through the {{posterior}} end, over their gills, and pumping {{it out of}} the wider, anterior end. The <b>larvae</b> move around inside the tubes and this helps maintain the water current; the lower the oxygen content of the water, the more active the <b>larvae</b> need to be. This mechanism enable caddisfly <b>larvae</b> to live in waters too low in oxygen content to support stonefly and mayfly <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{determined}} that P. rebeli <b>larvae</b> use chemical mimicry to persuade the M. schencki ants that the P. rebeli {{are part of the}} ant brood. Furthermore, M. schencki ants cannot distinguish the physical differences between the P. rebeli <b>larvae</b> and other non-kin brood because the P. rebeli <b>larvae</b> are far more similar to the M. schencki <b>larvae</b> than to any other ant species <b>larvae.</b>|$|E

5|$|To develop, the <b>larvae</b> must be fed both nectar for {{carbohydrates}} and pollen for protein. Bumblebees feed nectar to the <b>larvae</b> by chewing {{a small hole}} in the brood cell into which they regurgitate nectar. <b>Larvae</b> are fed pollen {{in one of two}} ways, depending on the bumblebee species. Pocket-making bumblebees create pockets of pollen {{at the base of the}} brood-cell clump from which the <b>larvae</b> feed themselves. Pollen-storing bumblebees keep pollen in separate wax pots and feed it to the <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|A few species release fertilized {{eggs into}} the water, but most retain the eggs until they hatch. There are {{four types of}} <b>larvae,</b> but all are balls of cells with an outer layer of cells whose flagellae or cilia enable the <b>larvae</b> to move. After {{swimming}} {{for a few days}} the <b>larvae</b> sink and crawl until they find a place to settle. Most of the cells transform into archeocytes and then into the types appropriate for their locations in a miniature adult sponge.|$|E
5|$|Antlion <b>larvae</b> require loose soil, not {{necessarily}} but often sand. The <b>larvae</b> prefer dry places {{protected from the}} rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.|$|E

5|$|As {{ubiquitous}} insects, dipterans play {{an important}} role at various trophic levels both as consumers and as prey. In some groups the <b>larvae</b> complete their development without feeding, and in others the adults do not feed. The <b>larvae</b> can be herbivores, scavengers, decomposers, predators or parasites, with the consumption of decaying organic matter being one of the most prevalent feeding behaviours. The fruit or detritus is consumed along with the associated micro-organisms, a sieve-like filter in the pharynx being used to concentrate the particles, while flesh-eating <b>larvae</b> have mouth-hooks to help shred their food. The <b>larvae</b> of some groups feed on or in the living tissues of plants and fungi, and some of these are serious pests of agricultural crops. Some aquatic <b>larvae</b> consume the films of algae that form underwater on rocks and plants. Many of the parasitoid <b>larvae</b> grow inside and eventually kill other arthropods, while parasitic <b>larvae</b> may attack vertebrate hosts.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where <b>larvae</b> of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth <b>larvae</b> are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Butterfly <b>larvae,</b> or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for and eating food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, eating ant <b>larvae.</b>|$|E

5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their <b>larvae.</b> About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, adopt this stratagem. These <b>larvae</b> eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the <b>larvae</b> as they make their way between these resources.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the <b>larvae</b> to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of <b>larvae</b> is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it blocks the boreholes with resin, thus killing the <b>larvae.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flea <b>larvae</b> {{emerge from}} the eggs to feed on any {{available}} organic material such as dead insects, faeces, conspecific eggs, and vegetable matter. In laboratory studies, some dietary diversity seems necessary for proper larval development. Blood-only diets allow only 12% of <b>larvae</b> to mature, whereas blood and yeast or dog chow diets allow almost all <b>larvae</b> to mature. Another study also showed that 90% of <b>larvae</b> matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs. They are blind and avoid sunlight, keeping to dark, humid places such as sand or soil, cracks and crevices, under carpets and in bedding.|$|E

5|$|Fleas lay tiny, white, oval eggs. The <b>larvae</b> {{are small}} and pale, have {{bristles}} covering their worm-like bodies, lack eyes, and have mouth parts adapted to chewing. The <b>larvae</b> feed on organic matter, especially the feces of mature fleas, which contain dried blood. Adults feed only on fresh blood.|$|E
5|$|Fly <b>larvae</b> {{can be used}} as a {{biomedical}} {{tool for}} wound care and treatment. Maggot debridement therapy (MDT) is the use of blow fly <b>larvae</b> to remove the dead tissue from wounds, most commonly being amputations. Historically, this has been used for centuries, both intentional and unintentional, on battlefields and in early hospital settings. Removing the dead tissue promotes cell growth and healthy wound healing. The <b>larvae</b> also have biochemical properties such as antibacterial activity found in their secretions as they feed. These medicinal maggots are a safe and effective treatment for chronic wounds.|$|E
5|$|Following hatching, <b>larvae</b> {{feed on the}} {{reproductive}} structures of the plant and usually develop through four to six instars. Initially, the young larva feed together, and this stage is their most destructive stage. Through maturation, older <b>larvae</b> become aggressive and cannibalistic, leaving one or two <b>larvae</b> per feeding site (See Interfamilial Predation). They usually have orange heads, black thorax plates, and a body color that is primarily black. Their bodies can also be brown, pink, green, and yellow with many thorny microspines. Mature <b>larvae</b> migrate to the soil, where they pupate for 12 to 16 days.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea earns its {{nickname}} {{the corn}} earworm for its widely known destruction of cornfields. The corn earworm feeds on {{every part of}} corn, including the kernels. Severe feeding {{at the tip of}} kernels allows entry for diseases and mold growth. <b>Larvae</b> begin feeding on the kernels once they have reached third instar. <b>Larvae</b> penetrate 9 to 15cm into the ear, with deeper penetration occurring as the kernels harden. <b>Larvae</b> do not eat the hard kernels, but take bites out of many kernels, lowering the quality of the corn for processing.|$|E
5|$|In {{an unusual}} case, planidium <b>larvae</b> of some beetles {{of the genus}} Meloe form a group and produce a {{pheromone}} that mimics the sex attractant of its host bee species. When a male bee arrives and attempts to mate with the mass of <b>larvae,</b> they climb onto his abdomen.

5|$|<b>Larvae</b> of Sirex {{woodwasp}} develop through arrhenotoky: male <b>larvae</b> develop {{only from}} unfertilized eggs, the females only from fertilized ones. Usually, 10 males are produced per female, but the ratio varies between 20:1 and 1:1. The <b>larvae</b> hatch after eight {{days at the}} earliest, but in some exterior conditions, they may remain in the egg for several months. At the optimal temperature of around 25°C (77°F), they hatch out after 10 to 12 days. Although the <b>larvae</b> hatch at 30°C (86°F) {{two to three days}} earlier, they are 20% more likely to die. Such extreme temperatures result in slower development, and below 6.2°C (43°F), the <b>larvae</b> die. A sufficient interspersion of the wood with the mycelium of the woodwasp is crucial for its hatching, as the fungus prevents the wood from drying out. Without these prerequisites, hatching is not possible. The tree can only ward off the infestation if it floods the boreholes with resin or halts the fungus by producing a wall of polyphenols.|$|E
