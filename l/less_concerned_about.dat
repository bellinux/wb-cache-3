Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do.

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the greater {{predictability}} in economic and financial performance associated with the Great Moderation caused firms to hold less capital and to be <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> liquidity positions.

25|$|In health, {{the optimistic}} bias tends to prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of the optimistic bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> risk of heart disease. Because the optimistic bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E

Frist visited the detention center in eastern Cuba, which holds some 460 detainees, including 14 top alleged al-Qaida figures recently transferred from CIA custody. He stated that his visit with fellow Republicans Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, was especially poignant coming one day short of {{the fifth anniversary of}} the attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Frist said that visiting the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, and recognizing that the 14 individuals who likely contributed to the September 11, 2001 attacks were there, led him to realize how critical it is that the U.S. define the appropriate criteria {{to make sure that the}} government have the information to prevent such a tragedy from occurring again. The senators didn't see the 14 new detainees, but visited Guantanamo to learn of the interrogation techniques. In his mind, the detainees are being treated in a safe and humane way.|$|E

He was <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the book's length than about its author's name, since the title sounded like a boys' book to him, and he believed boys preferred books by male authors. Rowling therefore adopted the nom de plume J.K. Rowling just before publication. In June 1997, Bloomsbury published Philosopher's Stone with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, three hundred of which were distributed to libraries. Her original name, [...] "Joanne Rowling", can be found in small print on the copyright page of this first British edition.

Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors. As a child, she would climb trees and refuse to come down. Once, during a snowball fight at the family's Polish estate, Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana, knocking her to the ground. A distant cousin, Princess Nina Georgievna, recalled that [...] "Anastasia was nasty {{to the point of}} being evil", and would cheat, kick and scratch her playmates during games; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was. She was <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> her appearance than her sisters.

500|$|The Birmingham Barracudas, {{owned by}} {{insurance}} tycoon Art Williams, entered the league playing at Legion Field, which could accommodate a Canadian football field with 15-yard end zones. Led by future Hall of Fame member Matt Dunigan, the Barracudas {{fell short of}} the South Division title, but remained competitive throughout the year. Despite selling 2,000 season tickets and facing community apathy after numerous attempts at pro football squads had failed in the city, attendance {{for the first three}} games exceeded expectations. Williams knew that the 'Cudas potentially faced serious attendance problems once the traditional American football season began, and persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sunday afternoons - something the league had been deliberately eschewing in order to avoid putting its television broadcasts in direct competition with the NFL's. The Barracudas' owner, who was more concerned about his gate receipts, was <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the NFL's impact on his gate since Alabamians' NFL loyalties tend to be divided between different teams. Williams calculated that competing with the NFL on television was a more reasonable risk to take compared to competition with high school and Alabama/Auburn football. However, attendance still dropped to unsustainable levels; none of the final four home games attracted more than 10,000 people. [...] Williams claimed to have lost at least US$10 million on the season—at least as much as his startup costs—and blamed community apathy for the attendance woes.|$|E

We recast our GPGP coordination approach using this formalism, and present a set of general rules relating task environment characteristics and this implemented set of GPGP coordination mechanisms. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Dutch {{artists were}} strikingly <b>less</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> artistic theory {{than those of}} many nations, and less given to {{discussing}} their art; it appears that there was also much less interest in artistic theory in general intellectual circles and among the wider public than was by then common in Italy. [...] As nearly all commissions and sales were private, and between bourgeois individuals whose accounts have not been preserved, these are also less well documented than elsewhere. But Dutch art {{was a source of}} national pride, and the major biographers are crucial sources of information. These are Karel van Mander (Het Schilderboeck, 1604), who essentially covers the previous century, and Arnold Houbraken (De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen – [...] "The Great Theatre of Dutch Painters", 1718–21).
