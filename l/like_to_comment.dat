5000|$|In 2015, two Nepalese {{women were}} {{rescued from the}} fifth floor of Gurgaon {{residence}} of a Saudi Arabian diplomat in India. They were allegedly confined there and abused physically and sexually by the diplomat and his family and friends. The women were rescued in a police raid planned after the police {{received a letter from}} the Nepal embassy regarding their plight. Several persons, the Saudi diplomat among them, were booked for wrongful confinement and gang rape. Saudi Ambassador Saud Mohammed Alsati commented, [...] "This is completely false. We would not <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> any further since the case is under investigation by the Indian police." [...] Ten days after the diplomat was accused, it was confirmed that he had left India.|$|E

As we can see the geometry of image projection and the mathematics of transformation is a very key element in studying this field, but there are many other issues the student has to be prepared for. If {{we are going to talk}} about segmenting images and getting good geometric clues, we have to understand the relationship between the intensity of image data and its underlying geometry. And this would lead the student into such areas as optics, illumination theory, theory of shadows and the like. And also the mathematics underlying this kind of computations would of course require signal processing theory, fourier transform theory and the like. And in dealing with algebraic surfaces such as this curved surfaces as we talked about here, courses in algebraic geometry and higher pure forms of algebra will prove to be necessary in order to make any kind of progress in research to handle curved surfaces. So, I guess the bottom line of what I'm saying is: math courses, particularly those associated with geometric aspects will be key in all of this." ...|$|E
