50|$|Safety {{glass is}} glass with {{additional}} safety features {{that make it}} less likely to break, or less likely to pose a threat when broken. Common designs include toughened glass (also known as tempered <b>glass),</b> <b>laminated</b> <b>glass,</b> <b>wire</b> mesh <b>glass</b> (also known as <b>wired</b> <b>glass)</b> and engraved <b>glass.</b> <b>Wire</b> mesh <b>glass</b> was invented by Frank Shuman. Laminated glass was invented in 1903 by the French chemist Édouard Bénédictus (1878-1930).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{two kinds of}} safety glasses are considered: for {{protection}} against the impact by thrown objects and against the impact due to burglary violation. The methods were explained for testing the glass against the impact, the glass being divided into protection classes (A, B, C) in a connection with the tests results. Cited are main features of safety glassing of protection class A and B. Three kinds of glasses {{can be used as}} protective ones, according to the British Standard, and these are: <b>laminated,</b> quenched and <b>wired</b> <b>glass.</b> Key words: safety glass, laminated glass, annealed glass 1...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wire</b> mesh <b>glass</b> (also {{known as}} Georgian <b>Wired</b> <b>Glass)</b> has a grid or mesh of thin metal wire {{embedded}} within the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass,</b> {{as it is}} typically described, does not perform the function most individuals associate with it. The presence of the wire mesh {{appears to be a}} strengthening component, as it is metallic, and conjures up the idea of rebar in reinforced concrete or other such examples. Despite this belief, <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> is actually weaker than unwired glass due to the incursions of the wire into the structure of the <b>glass.</b> <b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> often may cause heightened injury in comparison to unwired <b>glass,</b> as the <b>wire</b> amplifies the irregularity of any fractures.This has led to a decline in its use institutionally, particularly in schools.|$|R

50|$|In recent years, new {{materials}} have become available that offer both fire-ratings and safety ratings so the {{continued use of}} <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> is being debated worldwide. The US International Building Code effectively banned <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> in 2006.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide greater meaning and {{significance}} to <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> {{so that it}} may be preserved by exploring the historical origins and complexity of manufacture of the medium. The Industrial Revolution was a period of amazing evolution in the history of glass manufacture. Plate glass technology allowed for new design and building construction concepts, including the Crystal Palace, but this was an imperfect technology. As the brilliant minds of the Revolution struggled to grapple with the obstacles posed by plate <b>glass,</b> <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> was eventually born. This new glass type spread across the United States in subsequent years, fueled by uniform manufacture standards on the city and state levels and the American mass media’s coverage of conflagrations, which led to the public’s association of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> with safety given its fire retardant and shatterproof qualities. <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> was technically incredibly difficult to produce, especially in mass production, and although inventors experimented with various treatments and patterns, <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> remained and was comparatively expensive (though people generally believed the safety benefits outweighed the costs). <b>Wire</b> <b>glass</b> fell into disfavor during the World Wars as it was replaced by newer types of glass that were more economical, but recent trends have sparked renewed interest in the use and hence preservation of <b>wire</b> <b>glass.</b> Original methods of <b>wire</b> <b>glass</b> manufacture using early wire netting patterns no longer exist, and so current methods of preservation and conservation involving replication through glass lamination methods using imported wire nettings and salvage are discussed. Possible conservation treatments for repair are debated and further research is concluded...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wired</b> <b>glass</b> {{is still}} {{utilized}} in the U.S. for its fire-resistant abilities, and is well-rated to withstand both heat and hose streams. This is why <b>wired</b> <b>glass</b> exclusively {{is used on}} service elevators to prevent fire ingress to the shaft, and also why it is commonly found in institutional settings which are often well-protected and partitioned against fire. [...] The <b>wire</b> prevents the <b>glass</b> from {{falling out of the}} frame even if it cracks under thermal stress, and is far more heat-resistant than a laminating material.|$|R

PURPOSE. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the fracture toughness of a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) resin and a bis-acryl composite (BAC) resin reinforced with stainless steel <b>wire,</b> <b>glass,</b> and polyethylene fiber. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Four groups (n= 13) of each of the 2 materials were prepared for the single-edge 3 -point-bending test. Three groups had the different reinforcements, and the group without reinforcement served as control. Using a universal testing machine, peak load to fracture was recorded and fracture toughness (KIC) was calculated in MNm- 1. 5. Median KIC values were compared by means of nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test, α=. 05). RESULTs. For the controls, the fracture toughness for PMMA resin (KIC= 27. 9) was significantly lower (P. 10, for BAC resin and KIC= 25. 8, P>. 10, for PMMA resin).
