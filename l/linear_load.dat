In modern buildings there is a huge number of non-linear loads in lighting, monitor, computer and small power supplies and only a very limited number (or no) conventional <b>linear</b> <b>loads.</b> This is causing unacceptable interference with costly consequences.

2500|$|Three-phase {{electrical}} {{generation is}} very common. The simplest {{way is to}} use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher [...] "pole orders" [...] are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds {{can be used to}} generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (<b>linear)</b> <b>load,</b> the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics.

40|$|Abstract- Nowadays {{the number}} of non <b>linear</b> <b>loads</b> in power systems is {{increasing}} dramatically. These non <b>linear</b> <b>loads</b> inject harmonic currents and voltage which makes the supply currents non-sinusoidal. These harmonics are eliminated via an active power filter. In this paper, a current control scheme is proposed which {{does not require a}} harmonic detector but requires two current sensors on the supply side. In order to make the supply current sinusoidal, an effective harmonic compensation method is carried out with the aid of conventional PI controller and vector PI controller. The accuracy of the APF is improved and the performance is not affected by the harmonic tracking process due to the absence of harmonic detector. The value of %THD is reduced in the proposed control scheme. The total implementation cost is reduced as {{the number of}} current sensors is reduced...|$|R
