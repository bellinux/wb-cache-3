5|$|The first {{full-length}} {{version was}} Murders in the Rue Morgue by Universal Pictures in 1932, directed by Robert Florey and starring Bela Lugosi, Leon Ames and Sidney Fox, with Arlene Francis. The film bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original story.|$|E
5|$|SMS Oldenburg {{was laid}} {{down at the}} AG Vulcan {{shipyard}} in Stettin in 1883, launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886. Oldenburg was intended {{to have been a}} fifth member of the Sachsen class, but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the ships of the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> earlier vessels. Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24cm guns amidships, six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside. She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German-made steel.|$|E
5|$|The high {{population}} of the asteroid belt makes for a very active environment, where collisions between asteroids occur frequently (on astronomical time scales). Collisions between main-belt bodies with a mean radius of 10km are expected to occur about once every 10 million years. A collision may fragment an asteroid into numerous smaller pieces (leading {{to the formation of}} a new asteroid family). Conversely, collisions that occur at low relative speeds may also join two asteroids. After more than 4 billion years of such processes, the members of the asteroid belt now bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original population.|$|E
50|$|The Siege of Trencher's Farm (1969) is a Psychological Horror-Thriller {{novel by}} Scottish author Gordon Williams. It was first {{published}} by Secker & Warburg, and is better known for the 1971 film adaptation Straw Dogs (starring Dustin Hoffman) by Sam Peckinpah. A re-make of that film under the same name was made to less favorable reviews, both films bearing <b>little</b> <b>resemblances</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> novel. The Siege of Trencher's Farm was republished by Titan Books as in 2011 as Straw Dogs, <b>to</b> coincide with <b>the</b> release of the re-make.|$|R
25|$|The rebuilt ship, {{the largest}} and grandest in Hurtigruten service at the time, bore <b>little</b> {{exterior}} <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original royal yacht. Prins Olav was considered the flagship of the Hurtigruten service.|$|R
50|$|The party's {{line had}} <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of <b>the</b> Young Turks and {{contained}} some socialist demands. Most of the party's supporters {{were active in}} the countrysides.|$|R
5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline {{began in the early}} 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
25|$|As is {{the rule}} in most creoles, the lexicon of these {{languages}} {{can be traced to}} the parent languages, usually with predominance of Portuguese; while the grammar is mostly original and unique to each creole with <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> syntax of Portuguese or the substrate language.|$|E
5|$|Believers in Planet X/Nibiru {{have given}} it many names since it was first proposed. All are, in fact, names for other real, {{hypothetical}} or imaginary Solar System objects that bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> either <b>to</b> <b>the</b> planet described by Lieder or to Nibiru as described by Sitchin.|$|R
50|$|Aquamarine is a {{novel by}} Alice Hoffman, {{published}} in April 2001. A film adaptation was released in 2006, although the plot of <b>the</b> film bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> that of <b>the</b> book.|$|R
5000|$|A {{conventional}} four door three box design, it bore very <b>little</b> external <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original Ritmo, {{although it}} hinted strongly at {{the look of}} the 1982 facelift for that car. In the Swedish market, the car was called [...] "Regatta", as Regata was uncomfortably close to a derogatory term for an overbearing woman. The same name was used in Latin American markets.|$|R
25|$|The {{show was}} given a one-off revival (of sorts) for Comic Relief 2007 {{in the form of}} Top Gear of the Pops, {{presented}} by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. It was filmed at the Top Gear aerodrome studio in Surrey on Sunday, 11 March 2007, although it bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> usual Top of the Pops format.|$|E
25|$|The new vehicle, which {{according}} to Land Rover design director Gerry McGovern will bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> DC100, is reportedly due to enter production in 2019 and will replace the then 25-year-old model which is the longest running production of any Land Rover vehicle. Land Rover is planning 60,000 to 80,000 units annually which would beat the 1970 record of between 55,000 and 60,000.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 horror film {{directed}} by David DeCoteau bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original story but, like the 1961 version, utilizes the large swinging pendulum in the penultimate scene. The film follows {{a group of}} university students who visit a hypnotherapy institute lorded over by a sinister hypnotist who wants to use the students to experiment {{with the possibility of}} breaking the pain threshold.|$|E
50|$|It {{should also}} be noted that the person known as Cato in this novel and his life bears <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{historical}} Cato the Younger who was Caesar's political opponent from about 60 BC.|$|R
50|$|Hamburgers {{are sold}} at stands called chimis, which also offer {{sandwiches}} called chimichurris, though these bear <b>little</b> <b>to</b> no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> South American sauce of the same name. Chimis occasionally also offer hot dogs and other sandwich varieties.|$|R
50|$|The {{resulting}} prototype bore very <b>little</b> family <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> AA-1. The AA-2 {{was different}} from the AA-1 in that it had doors instead of the Yankee's trademark sliding canopy and an oleo strut in place of the Yankee's spring steel tube nose gear. The aircraft had provisions for retractable gear to be installed on a later version, although the prototype had fixed landing gear. The AA-2 was powered by a 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming engine.|$|R
25|$|The 1876 {{match in}} Hull {{was the last}} time the UNEE played the USEE {{although}} there was a curious footnote to the series when the USEE played against the official North of England cricket team on 6 & 7 September 1880. The North's team in this match at Rotherham bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> UNEE but, nevertheless, the official North hammered another nail into the coffin of the unofficial USEE with a 53 run victory.|$|E
25|$|Sake is a brewed rice {{beverage}} {{that typically}} contains 15%–17% alcohol and {{is made by}} multiple fermentation of rice. At traditional formal meals, it is considered an equivalent to rice and is not simultaneously taken with other rice-based dishes, although this notion is typically no longer applied to modern, refined, premium ("ginjo") sake, which bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sakes of even 100 years ago. Side dishes for sake are particularly called sakana or otsumami.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Tooker, an anthropologist, {{has said}} that it was {{unlikely}} the US founding fathers were inspired by the confederacy, as it bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system of governance adopted in the United States. For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.|$|E
2500|$|Although often bearing <b>little</b> actual <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colour of {{the wine}} itself, the superlative-sounding name [...] "champagne" [...] is {{frequently}} used as a descriptor for the pale, yellowy-beige metallic hue popular with buyers of prestige automobiles, also of the colour of some high-value equestrian livestock, and some gemstones, especially diamonds. In the case of diamonds, any colouration used {{to be considered a}} defect which lowered prices considerably, until the idea came up to associate certain hues with Champagne.|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional {{shock wave}} {{turbulent}} boundary layer interactions in a corner have been studied at M about 3. The first phase, detailed mean wall static pressure distributions, has shown the interaction of a two-dimensional flow on one wall with the three-dimensional flow generated by a fin. Major three-dimensional effects on both flows were observed, extending from {{the interaction of the}} initial region of the three-dimensional flow and the corner. A large part of the resulting corner flow has <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> either <b>the</b> two-dimensional or three-dimensional interacting flows...|$|R
50|$|A fictional {{universe}} can {{be almost}} {{indistinguishable from the}} real world, except {{for the presence of}} the invented characters and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme it can bear <b>little</b> or no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> real-world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.|$|R
25|$|In Indian {{classical}} music and Indian light music, the mandolin, which bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European mandolin, is usually tuned E–B–E–B. As {{there is no}} concept of absolute pitch in Indian {{classical music}}, any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used. Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C–G–C–G, which corresponds to sa–pa–sa–pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style. This tuning corresponds to the way violins are tuned for carnatic classical music. This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra, dance music popular in Punjabi culture.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{developed}} {{some of the}} first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He later credited himself as being the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. (It should be noted that his electromechanical devices, some with motors moving photocells past lights, bore <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> all-electronic sequencers of the late sixties.) He began working on a machine he said composed using artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its vast array of knobs, buttons and patch panels is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|Crustaceans may {{pass through}} a number of larval and {{immature}} stages between hatching from their eggs and reaching their adult form. Each of the stages is separated by a moult, in which the hard exoskeleton is shed to allow the animal to grow. The larvae of crustaceans often bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adult, and there are still cases where it is not known what larvae will grow into what adults. This is especially true of crustaceans which live as benthic adults (on the sea bed), more so than where the larvae are planktonic and therefore more easily caught.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{reference}} {{in the name}} of the album, these recordings actually bear <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> those of <b>the</b> better known Outsiders; although some of their r&b roots are still apparent, the latter band has a different style that is generally categorized as garage rock, and Outsiders vocalist Sonny Geraci sounds much different from Tom King.|$|R
2500|$|These loanwords bear <b>little</b> or no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> native {{words for}} [...] "foot" [...] and [...] "ball". By contrast, some {{languages}} have calques of [...] "football": their speakers use equivalent terms that combine their words for [...] "foot" [...] and [...] "ball". An {{example is the}} Greek ποδόσφαιρο (podósfero).|$|R
2500|$|The {{facility}} today bears <b>little</b> or no <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wartime Luftwaffe airfield {{from which}} it originated. [...] Modern, state-of-the-art facilities are present, the only remaining evidence of its former use as a combat airfield is the disturbed areas {{at each end of}} its 2,000ft. runway, overlaid over the former 4,500ft. concrete runway.|$|R
25|$|The {{modern day}} {{interest}} in absinthe {{has spawned a}} rash of absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka or alcohol to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a harsh substance that bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. In at least one documented case, a person suffered acute kidney injury after drinking 10ml of pure wormwood oil—a dose much higher than that found in absinthe.|$|E
25|$|Some scholars, such as Carsten Peter Thiede, dispute this presentation. Early Christian leaders did {{not have}} to visit Qumran to have heard of Essene beliefs and read their texts. The various Jewish groups, {{including}} Christians and Essenes, were interconnected and simultaneously adopted some practices and beliefs while rejecting others. While some similarities exist, there are many differences and similar parallels can be also drawn between the early Christians and Pharisees, and other Jewish sects. Many features of Christian faith have no parallels in the texts from Qumran, and some that do are fundamentally distinct from Essene practices and beliefs. Notably, John's act of penitent baptism bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> daily baptismal ritual of the Essenes.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many areas}} in today’s modern cities, the Inner Belt District bears <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> what <b>the</b> area looked like {{when it was}} first being settled. The area was {{primarily}} marshland and the Miller's River, which has since been filled in, flowed along the southern edge. As industry began <b>to</b> enter into <b>the</b> area in <b>the</b> early- <b>to</b> mid-1800s, <b>the</b> landscape was changed <b>to</b> suit <b>the</b> needs of new businesses. Cobble Hill was brought down and used <b>to</b> fill in <b>the</b> marshes.

50|$|The statue was {{designed}} and constructed in Pyongyang, North Korea by the Mansudae Overseas Projects, {{an arm of the}} Mansudae Art Studio. It stands 9 m and weighs 4.8 tons. The statue sits on a marble slab 2.7 m high at the head of Samora Machel Avenue, and is illuminated at night. The statue has been criticized for bearing <b>little</b> <b>resemblance</b> <b>to</b> Samora. <b>The</b> Samora Machel Statue sits in front of Maputo City Hall on the spot formerly occupied by a statue of Joaquim Augusto Mouzinho de Albuquerque, Governor-General of Portuguese Mozambique from 1896 to 1897.|$|R
