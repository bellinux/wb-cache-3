5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{four sets}} {{in three hours}} and forty-three minutes, to win his first US Open title, and thus complete the Career Golden Slam (equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi). He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows, became the first man since Rod <b>Laver</b> in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after <b>Laver</b> to hold two Major titles on each surface (hard, clay and grass). The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E

5|$|It was lauded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} matches ever by former players, legends, and analysts of the sport. John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time, while legends Pete Sampras, Mats Wilander, and Björn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime. After the 2012 Australian Open, Rod <b>Laver</b> came out with his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists, Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list. <b>Laver</b> said the 2012 Australian Open final was a main reason for including both players. Nadal called it the toughest loss of his career but the best match he ever played. Djokovic said it was the finest win in his career and also commented on the high level of tennis played.

5|$|The 2012 French Open Men's singles final was the {{championship}} tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 French Open. It pitted the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, {{against each other}} in a Grand Slam tournament final for the fifth time overall and fourth consecutive time. This match had historical proportions as Djokovic would have become the first man since Rod <b>Laver</b> in 1969 to win all four Majors simultaneously, whereas Nadal was looking to break Björn Borg's record of six French Open titles and equal Chris Evert's record of seven French Open titles held by a man or woman.|$|E
5|$|Federer's next {{participation}} was in September in the inaugural <b>Laver</b> Cup, representing team Europe. Federer played his first singles match on day two, where he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, {{which took place}} at one set all. This {{was the first time}} Federer and Nadal competed {{on the same side of}} a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Hill's Test career {{ended in}} {{controversy}} amid another {{dispute with the}} Board of Control. He was once again appointed captain of the Australian team against an English side captained by Johnny Douglas in 1911–12. The English team included bowlers of the calibre of Barnes and Frank Foster and, after losing the first Test in Sydney, won all four remaining Tests to secure the Ashes. Hill had a lean season with the bat, managing 274runs {{at an average of}} 27.40. The England bowlers were clearly superior to the Australian batsmen; Trumper was the only Australian to score a century during the Tests. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted right of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, a group of senior players, including Hill, threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank <b>Laver,</b> was appointed.|$|E

He was a prominent member of the Queensland legal profession and in 1977 celebrated 60 years as a solicitor. <b>Lavers,</b> {{a founding member of}} the Toowoomba Rotary Club, was actively involved with the community and served on the Toowoomba Ambulance Brigade, Toowoomba Choral Society, Toowoomba Grammar School Trustees as well as being busy with the legal profession. After his death on 9 December 1968, tribute was paid to his long legal service to the Toowoomba City Council and the community. A former chairman of the Downs and South-Western Law Association <b>Lavers</b> was held in high esteem by the legal profession. A friend of George Essex Evans and Hoey [...] "Steele Rudd", he supported the Ladies Literary Society and was well known for his love of poetry.|$|R

5|$|It was {{the first}} time in nearly two decades that number 1 played number 2 and neither had won the French Open previously. Andy Murray had a career {{resurgence}} on clay, making deep runs in the Masters tournaments prior to the French Open, finishing runner up to Djokovic in Madrid before besting him in Rome. Rain had affected the tournament schedule and in Djokovic's case, he had to play 4 matches in 5 days. Murray was playing to become the first Brit since 1937 to win, while Djokovic had multiple historical records on the line, most notably joining the elite group of men who won a career grand slam and joining Rod <b>Laver</b> and Don Budge as the only men to hold all 4 Grand Slam titles at the same time. After Murray took the first set, Djokovic rallied to win the match prevailing in four sets.|$|E
5|$|The Big Four, {{along with}} Rod <b>Laver,</b> Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl, {{are the only}} men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single {{calendar}} year. Federer has achieved this a record five times in his career so far and Djokovic four times. However, this feat was accomplished many more times in the pre-Open Era. Similarly, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have made the semi-finals twice or more {{at each of the}} four Grand Slam events. Additionally, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have reached the final at each of the four Grand Slam events. Finally, prior to 2003, no man had ever made 20 grand slam singles finals, with Ivan Lendl leading the way with 19 grand slam singles finals. However, since then, Federer (29), Nadal (23) and Djokovic (21) have each surpassed this mark.|$|E
5|$|Between 2011–12, {{they met}} in four {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournament finals, just {{the second time in}} tennis history this has happened. In doing so, they also became the second pair in history, after Venus and Serena Williams, to meet in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events. Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three (from Wimbledon to the Australian Open), making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals. However, Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final, denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod <b>Laver</b> to hold all four Majors at once. The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played (5 hours and 53 minutes), at the 2012 Australian Open final. This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested, are considered two of the greatest matches of all time. At ATP Masters 1000 level, they have met 26 times, 12 of which were in the final (a record), including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where Djokovic ended Nadal's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event.|$|E

5|$|In {{his second}} match of the tour, Hirst scored 92 {{and used his}} pull shot more {{effectively}} than on other occasions. He followed this with 66 in the third match but did not take many wickets before the first Test. Warner considered he had nevertheless bowled well but was finding it difficult to maintain his energy in the hot conditions; his bowling lost pace and sting later in his bowling spells. Hirst played in all five Test matches, the first two of which were won by England. In the first game, Hirst took two wickets. In his first innings, he scored a duck and was dropped by Frank <b>Laver</b> before he had scored in the second. He survived to score 60 not out and his partnership with Tom Hayward guided England to victory after wickets had fallen early chasing a target of 194. Hirst scored 11 runs in the second match and took three wickets on a difficult batting pitch, badly affected by rain. Although this performance was not statistically impressive, Warner thought he bowled very well. During the third Test, Hirst took three wickets and, with innings of 58 and 44, {{was one of the}} few successful England batsmen in a poor performance which enabled Australia to win the match. England won the crucial fourth match to ensure the series victory. Hirst took two wickets and contributed scores of 25 and 18. Australia achieved a win in the final match in which Hirst scored 0 and 1, but after taking no wickets in the first innings he achieved his best Test figures of the tour in the second, with five for 48.|$|E
5|$|With a {{combined}} total of 210 matches played, the Big Four have played many notable matches. The 2008 Wimbledon final and the 2012 Australian Open finals are {{considered by some}} to be the greatest matches of all time. Novak Djokovic saved match points against Roger Federer at the 2010 and 2011 US Open semifinals, whereas Federer ended Djokovic's 43-match winning streak in the 2011 French Open semifinals. The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match {{the other members of the}} Big Four. Moreover, every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012, all played between the Big Four, holds some historical significance. The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played, the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open, whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod <b>Laver</b> in 1969. The 2012 Wimbledon final saw Federer equal the record for most Wimbledon titles when he came out victorious against Murray, who became the first British man since 1938 to appear in the final. The 2012 US Open final was the equal longest final in US Open history, and Murray became the first British man since 1938 to win a Major title, and the only British man to do so in the Open Era. He also became the only man to win Olympic Singles Gold and the US Open back-to-back.|$|E
25|$|<b>Laver</b> {{had also}} many battles with Lew Hoad {{in his first}} years on the pro circuit 1963–1966. Although he lost the first 8 matches in January 1963, <b>Laver</b> {{later in the year}} began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38–21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe, <b>Laver</b> had a {{head-to-head}} lead of 21–3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe's first win came in 1974, when <b>Laver</b> was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom <b>Laver</b> led 16–5 in their head-to-head score.|$|E

60|$|I answer, Verily, I {{think that}} the ten <b>lavers</b> were a figure of the ten commandments; in the purity and {{perfection}} of Christ's obedience to which he became capable of being made a burnt-offering, acceptable to God {{for the sins of}} the people. Christ was made under the law, and all his acts of obedience to God for us were legal, and his living thus a perfect legal life was his washing his offering in these ten <b>lavers,</b> in order to his presenting it upon the altar for our sins. The <b>lavers</b> went upon wheels, to signify walking feet; and Christ walked in the law, and so became a clean offering to God for us. The wheels were of the very same as were the <b>lavers,</b> to show that Christ's obedience to the law was of the same, as to length and breadth, with its commands and demands to their utmost tittle and extent. The inwards and legs of the burnt-offering were to be washed in these <b>lavers</b> (Lev 1:9,13; 2 Chron 4:6); to show that Christ should be pure and clean in heart and life.|$|R
