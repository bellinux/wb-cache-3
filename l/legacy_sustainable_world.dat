Key themes evident in the typology are discussed namely the primary <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> goal of flourishing life, the anthropocentrism-ecocentrism divide, approaches to human interests satisfaction, and optimisation vs resilience living. The paper notes the mere descriptive nature of the typology and concludes with some thoughts on ways in which the typology might be critiqued to identify which approach, Reformist or Transformational, is more likely to see the primary goal of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> achieved. </span...|$|R
40|$|This paper presents, as a 'sustainable world typology', the {{findings}} of a current research project that is concerned with what it means for there to be a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> and how humanity might go about achieving this. The typology is framed around key <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> dimensions and displays, for each of these dimensions, how Reformist and Transformational approaches are conceived in terms of giving meaning to the concept of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world.</b> Key themes evident in the typology are discussed namely: (a) the primary <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> goal of flourishing life, (b) the anthropocentrism-ecocentrism divide, (c) approaches to human interests satisfaction, and (d) optimisation vs resilience living. The paper notes the mere descriptive nature of the typology and concludes with some thoughts on ways in which the typology might be critiqued to identify which approach, Reformist or Transformational, is more likely to see the primary <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> goal achieved...|$|R

40|$|This paper critiques {{the current}} {{dominant}} {{approach to the}} achievement of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> as {{is evident in the}} broad national and international political sphere and as is advocated by the business community, namely 'reformist' based sustainable development. Although focusing on the business sector, the findings of this critique are equally as relevant to other social actors in their pursuit of <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> outcomes including governments, religious organisations, educational institutions, NGOs, communities, families, and individuals. The paper argues that the reformist <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> approach is challenging to believe as credible. Rather than helping society achieve needed change, this approach instead creates a false sense of progress that acts as a barrier to the more decisive action that is necessary to address underlying drivers of humanity's unsustainable behaviours. Further, some of the core technology strategies advocated by this dominant sustainability approach have flow-on effects that can work against the very objectives these strategies seek to achieve. The paper concludes by offering a way forward for the business sector by it embracing a more transformational <b>sustainable</b> <b>world</b> approach in both its internal activities and in its advocacy in the broader public and political space. ...|$|R

30|$|The present world, {{with all}} its advancement, is not a <b>sustainable</b> <b>world,</b> simply because {{it is based on}} non-renewable raw {{materials}} (non-RRMs). <b>Sustainable</b> <b>world</b> is best expressed in terms of sustainable development and non-RRMs must be replaced by sustainable materials. The sustainable materials needed by modern society are very wide and the main pillars are biofuels and bioproducts. Both pillars are best related through integrated biorefineries (IBRs) formed of related concepts which are very important for the economic development and sustainability of all countries on our planet. Integrated biorefineries include the production of biofuels and bioproducts and utilizing novel technologies. An IBR contains at least two routes: a biochemical route based on a sugar platform and a thermochemical-catalytic route based on a syngas platform. It is a multiple inputs–multi outputs (MIMO) system with design flexibility to accept a wide range of biofeedstock, especially wastes. If the biorefinery consists of only one route/platform, or is limited with regard to MIMO or biofuels/bioproducts produced, then it should be considered an elementary biorefinery (EBR). Sustainable development engineering which is a subsystem of sustainable development (and <b>sustainable</b> <b>world)</b> is more general than Environmental Engineering; and Clean and Green Technology, because it also includes the utilization of RRMs to achieve not only sustainability but also clean environment. An integrated system approach based on system theory is used to analyse <b>sustainable</b> development, <b>sustainable</b> <b>world,</b> <b>sustainable</b> materials, IBRs, EBRs and their interactions.|$|R
