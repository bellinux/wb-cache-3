5|$|Stamata Revithi {{was born}} in Syros in 1866. Records of her life from 1896 show that {{she was living in}} poverty in Piraeus in 1896. At that point she had given birth to two children, a son who died in 1895, aged seven, and another child who was {{seventeen}} months old {{by the time of the}} 1896 Olympics. According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas, Revithi, who was blonde and thin with large eyes, <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> older than her age.|$|E
5|$|Still {{photographs}} of Oheka Castle in Huntington, New York, {{were used in}} the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate. Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from Greek to German Gothic. The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of muslin fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots. Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Like the old revolutionary States-General, the new National Assembly {{contained}} radically opposed parties: the unitary democrats, led by Pieter Vreede, Johan Valckenaer and Pieter Paulus, and the federalists, such as Jacob Abraham de Mist and Gerard Willem van Marle. But {{there was}} a broad continuum of opinion between these poles. In this force-field the federalists held the upper hand after the sudden demise of Paulus (who might otherwise have acted as a unifier). The conservative federalists were more adept at parliamentary manoeuvering (Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck proved himself especially adept at this). The frustration this engendered among the democrats led them to appeal to popular opinion and to extra-parliamentary action. Meanwhile, the Assembly installed a constitutional commission that in November 1796 presented a report that amounted to {{a continuation of the}} old federal arrangements. As this was totally unacceptable to the unitarists, this draft was subsequently amended into its opposite, by a compromise that finally formed a basis for a new Constitution. The Assembly now started upon a discussion of other important matters, like the separation between church and state, and the emancipation of minorities. The organs of the state were to be a bicameral Legislative Corps, to be elected in indirect elections, and a Directoire-like Executive of five members. The end result <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like the French Constitution of 1795. This was approved by the Assembly on 10 May 1797.|$|E

25|$|Cho <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> {{better in}} 1978. He won the 7-dan {{section of the}} 3rd Kisei before being {{promoted}} to 8 dan in the summer. He took 3rd place in the Meijin League. Even through some success of the year, he still couldn't {{make it through the}} preliminaries of the 33rd Honinbo. He participated in the 16th Judan, the 3rd Tengen, and the 26th Oza preliminaries.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the winless Rams headed into New Orleans {{to face the}} {{streaking}} Saints, who'd won four straight games headed into the game. It <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> the same on the Saints opening drive that culminated in a 7-yard burst by Reggie Bush to give the Saints an early 7–0 lead. However, Steven Jackson answered with a 1-yard run of his own {{to tie the game}} {{toward the end of the}} 1st quarter.|$|E

Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|E
25|$|Harper's surname {{was changed}} to 'Harpur' in 1764, nearly two centuries after his death. This was {{supposedly}} {{in the belief that}} the new spelling <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> better when used in a Latin inscription, still visible today, below the statue of Harper on the facade of the old school buildings in St Paul's Square. Whatever the truth of this story, in that same year, 1764, the Harpur Trust was formally created by Act of Parliament to administer Bedford School's endowment.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts had {{its origin}} in Li'l Folks, a weekly panel comic that {{appeared}} in Schulz's hometown paper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, from 1947 to 1950. He first used the name Charlie Brown for a character there, although he applied the name in four gags to three different boys and one buried in sand. The series also had a dog that <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like the early 1950s version of Snoopy. In 1948, Schulz sold a cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post which published 17 single-panel cartoons by Schulz. The first of these was of a boy sitting with his feet on an ottoman.|$|E

25|$|Before his death, Ralph Quarles {{arranged}} for his Quaker friend William Gooch {{to be made}} guardian of his children. As requested by Quarles, after the parents both died in 1833 when John Langston was four, Gooch moved with the boys and their half-brother William Langston to Chillicothe, Ohio, in a free state. Quarles had reserved funds for the boys' education. In 1835 the older brothers Gideon and Charles started at the preparatory school of Oberlin College, where {{they were the first}} African-American students to be admitted. Gideon <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like his father; at the age of 21 Gideon took Quarles as his surname and thereafter was known as Gideon Quarles.|$|E
25|$|The C-Lab programmers {{left that}} company to form Emagic, and in 1993 {{released}} a new program, Notator Logic, which attempted to fuse both track- and pattern-based operation (but <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> more like track-based sequencers than Notator). While rich in features, early versions of Logic on the Atari lacked the intuitiveness and immediacy of either Cubase or Notator, and never achieved the same success. However, {{by this time}} the Atari was becoming obsolete, and {{part of the reason why}} Notator Logic had been written from scratch with an object oriented GUI (though it shared the same nomenclature as its predecessor) was to make it easier to port to other platforms. The Notator preface was dropped from the product name and the software became known as simply Logic.|$|E
25|$|Using {{this many}} landing gear on a swept wing would produce {{considerable}} problems when the aircraft {{tried to turn}} on the ground. It was possible to use steerable landing gear legs for this, but only at the cost of added complexity. An easier solution was to simply use a straight wing so the landing gear were in a line. However, this would limit the design to slower speeds below about Mach 0.7 (see wave drag). This was perfectly acceptable for short-haul role, where the cruise times were so short that added speed would have little actual effect on round-trip times. By limiting themselves to speeds not much greater than propeller transports, the engineers were free to select a wing designed solely for low-speed high-lift performance. The result <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> more like the wing from a 1930s airliner than a modern jet aircraft.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} Imperial models in this generation. The C-14 was the {{standard}} eight and <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like the Chrysler Royal C-18 with a longer hood and cowl. The C-15 was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear quarter panels. This model was available by special order. The third model, C-17, was the designation for the Airflow model. They had a concealed crank for raising {{the windshield and}} the hood was hinged at the cowl and opened from the front; side hood panels were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom convertible sedan {{was used as an}} official car at the Indy 500. The car pictured is James G Martin's (retired airline mechanic) 1939 C-24 7 passenger limousine, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limo still on the road.|$|E
25|$|Peter May took a well-deserved holiday {{with his}} fiancée, though the press {{did not think}} so, and Colin Cowdrey led the team against the weak Victorian team. He lost the toss {{and was forced to}} field in the 109°F/43°C heat and limited the fast bowlers Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman and Peter Loader to two over spells. Victoria did quite well and reached 270/5 in the day. A 21-year-old Bill Lawry opened the batting and made a slow 24 until he was bowled by Ted Dexter, the footballer Neil Crompton hit 73, Lindsay Hassett's nephew John Shaw 94 and Jack Potter 47. Trueman took 5/42 to dismiss Crompton and Shaw and {{returned}} in the morning to wrap up the innings for 286. The MCC responded poorly with 31/4, but Colin Cowdrey stroked 84 and Willie Watson 141 in a stand of 169. Watson <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like his old self and batted with the tail, especially John Mortimore (32) and they finished on 313, the paceman Colin Guest taking 3/39. Victoria struggled in their second innings as Tyson (3/40) and Loader (3/29) found their form. Only Crompton (64) passed 22 and they were all out for 180. The MCC players were helped when the temperature dropped to 89°F/32°C half-way through the day. While knocking off the 156/1 to win Arthur Milton received a nasty ball on his glove which re-fractured his broken finger and he retired hurt for 35. Peter Richardson made 65 and 120 was added before the first wicket fell. Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter both made 21 not out and the MCC won by 9 wickets.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, {{scientists}} realized that improved seismological knowledge {{was necessary for}} the detection of Soviet underground nuclear explosions. The [...] "Rainier" [...] test (part of Operation Plumbbob, performed in Nevada) produced strong seismic signals, but <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like an ordinary earthquake. In 1959, Dr. James R. Killian, the Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, formed the Panel on Seismic Improvement (which subsequently recommended the program that {{came to be known as}} Vela Uniform), with the twin goals of improving seismic instruments and deploying them globally, and researching in more depth the seismic effects of nuclear explosions. The project was subsequently initiated by the Eisenhower administration.|$|E

500|$|Sometime between 25,000 and 31,000years ago, Lassen Peak, a Pelean lava dome volcano, {{was pushed}} {{up through the}} pre-Lassen dacites. Lassen grew past the normal maximum size of plug dome volcanoes, , and reached a height of [...] above the {{surrounding}} plateau {{in as little as}} a few years. The surface of the growing pile of about a [...] of lava crumbled continually, forming enormous banks of talus. When Lassen Peak formed it <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like the nearby Chaos Crags domes do today, with steep sides covered by angular rock talus. Lassen Peak's shape was significantly altered by glacial erosion from 25,000 to 18,000years ago during the Wisconsin glaciation. At least one of Lassen's glaciers extended as far as [...] from the volcano itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{models of}} Palaeotherium {{represent}} an extinct Eocene mammal thought by Cuvier to be tapir-like. They have suffered the most {{wear and tear}} {{of all of the}} models, and the standing model no longer <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like the original made by Hawkins. During the 1960s these models were lying discarded in the bushes about fifty yards from the original site and, prior to the 2002 restoration, they were in such bad shape that they were removed and put into store. Some sources state that these models were added at a later date, but an Illustrated London News illustration of Hawkins's workshop shows them in the background. Models of the [...] "fearfully great bird" [...] Dinornis of New Zealand (extinct by 1500 AD), and of the extinct elephant-like Mastodon (Deinotherium) of the Miocene and Pliocene of America, were planned for the 'Tertiary Islands' but not completed.|$|E
500|$|The pre-dreadnought {{developed}} from the ironclad battleship. The first ironclads — the French Gloire and [...] — <b>looked</b> <b>much</b> like sailing frigates, with three tall masts and broadside batteries, when they were commissioned {{at the start of}} the 1860s. Only eight years later HMVS Cerberus, the first breastwork monitor, was launched. Only three years later followed , a turreted ironclad which more resembled a pre-dreadnought than previous and contemporary turretless ironclads. Each ship lacked masts and carried four heavy guns in two turrets fore and aft. Devastation was the first ocean-worthy breastwork monitor, built to attack enemy coasts and harbours; because of her very low freeboard, she could not fight on the high seas as her decks would be swept by water and spray, interfering with the working of her guns. Navies worldwide continued to build masted, turretless battleships which had sufficient freeboard and were seaworthy enough to fight on the high seas.|$|E
