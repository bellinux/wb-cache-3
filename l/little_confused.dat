500|$|In early February 2012, Rolo Tomassi {{announced}} {{the release of}} a new single: 'Old Mystics'. 'Old Mystics' and its B-side 'Mesmerizer' was written by synthesiser play James Spence in the earliest stages of the Astraea's writing, in late 2011. The single was uploaded to the band's Facebook profile to stream for free. They released the single on 26 March. The band announced a few days after releasing [...] "Old Mystics" [...] for streaming that it will most likely not appear on the new album and will just be a stand-alone single as they felt the two songs did not fit onto Astraea. Rolo Tomassi completed their first tour of the year as the main support for Architects on a 14-date UK tour in April. They used this tour to promote their new single 'Old Mystics' as well as debut other unrecorded new material from the album, such as songs 'Howl' and 'Remancer'. Rolo Tomassi's presence on the tour was met with positive reception; however, reviewers believed the band's music was too aggressive and chaotic for fans of Architects. Tim Sewell when writing for The Courier Online said that: [...] "it was apparent that much of the crowd (mostly Architects fans) were left a <b>little</b> <b>confused</b> by singer/shewolf Eva Spence, who flung herself about in front of them screaming." ...|$|E

50|$|The ZX Spectrum version {{achieved}} good critical success. Your Sinclair awarded 84%, {{highlighting the}} comprehensive shop sequence and large, well-animated enemies.

2500|$|The {{signature}} has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions ∧ and ∨ ("and" [...] and [...] "or"), and one unary function ¬ ("not"). This is a <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> as {{the functions}} {{use the same}} symbols as the propositional functions of first-order logic.|$|R

60|$|While the {{overture}} {{was going}} on, Ada {{told me to}} look down upon the sea of heads below. It was wonderful, but yet a <b>little</b> <b>confusing,</b> {{there were so many}} men looking up with opera-glasses, and a great many of them seemed gazing right into our box.|$|R
50|$|While Capra {{concentrates}} {{his discussion}} on living things, {{the idea behind}} the concept of structure-organization-process {{is one in which}} a process self organizes own structure (autopoieses as defined by Maturana and Varela, 1987). As we can see, the definitions for these three elements are a <b>little</b> <b>confusing.</b> This is why the idea of structure-organization-process (SOP) has been applied more generally by Linda Glassop (2007).|$|R

6000|$|The almost {{universal}} habit of batsmen of shouting [...] "Heads!" [...] at whatever height {{from the ground}} the ball may be, is not a <b>little</b> <b>confusing.</b> The average person, on hearing the shout, puts {{his hands over his}} skull, crouches down and trusts to luck. This is an excellent plan if the ball is falling, but is not much protection against a skimming drive along the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The series bears {{repeated}} listening, {{with many}} subtle lines, {{but at times}} can be a <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> as it goes backwards and forwards in time, segued by records that they play on their show.

One typical line from Bain-Jones is [...] "... {{and i said no}} it won't as its water based...", before realising they are on air again.|$|R

(The television episode had made clear that Jordin was investigating Lancer as well; the movie did not include those scenes, though, making Jordin’s sudden appearance and his motives for helping Solo as an enemy agent a <b>little</b> <b>confusing.)</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|In Paul's {{second letter}} to the Corinthians, he again refers to himself as an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God and reassures the people of Corinth {{that they will not}} have another painful visit, but {{what he has to say}} is not to cause pain but to reassure them of the love he has for them. It is shorter in length in {{comparison}} to the first and a <b>little</b> <b>confusing</b> if the reader is unaware of the social, religious, and economic situation of the community. Paul felt the situation in Corinth was still complicated and felt attacked.|$|R
