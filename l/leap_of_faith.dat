5|$|The third contest had Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff in a {{standard}} match. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations; as a result, Bischoff could not be disqualified for Coachman's interference. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunners on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.|$|E
40|$|Measuring and {{comparing}} the overall performance of countries’ public sectors requires agreement on definitions {{and objectives of}} government. I argue that such an agreement is about finding a consensus rather about finding better definitions. Measuring government requires a number <b>of</b> <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> where certain definitions, assumptions and statistics are accepted as good enough for measurement and comparison. The political science and economic research community have a different tradition of dealing with such agreements and <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> and this is reflected in their approaches to measuring {{and comparing}} the performance of public sectors. The implications of these traditions are particularly visible in the usefulness of measurement and indicators for policy makers...|$|R

25|$|Rather than {{argue for}} the {{necessity}} of a god, some theists base their belief upon grounds independent of, or prior to, reason, making Occam's razor irrelevant. This was the stance of Søren Kierkegaard, who viewed belief in God as a <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> that sometimes directly opposed reason. This is also the doctrine of Gordon Clark's presuppositional apologetics, with the exception that Clark never thought the <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> was contrary to reason (see also Fideism).|$|E

40|$|Prophetic {{modes of}} thought and action are dotted across the {{landscape}} of Afro-American history. I understand these modes to consist of protracted and principled struggles against forms of personal despair, intellectual dogmatism and socioeconomic oppression that foster communities of hope. Therefore the distinctive features of prophetic activity are Pascalian <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> in the capacity of human beings to transform their circumstances, engage in relentless criticism and self-criticism and project visions, analyses and practices of social freedom.

25|$|In Kierkegaard's meaning, purely {{theological}} assertions are subjective truths {{and they}} cannot be either verified or invalidated by science, i.e. through objective knowledge. For him, choosing {{if one is}} for or against a certain subjective truth is a purely arbitrary choice. He calls the jump from objective knowledge to religious faith a <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> since it means subjectively accepting statements which cannot be rationally justified. For him the Christian faith {{is the result of}} the trajectory initiated by such choices, which don't have and cannot have a rational ground (meaning that reason is neither for or against making such choices). Objectively regarded, purely theological assertions are neither true nor false.|$|E

50|$|Most {{agree that}} {{dealing with these}} {{obstacles}} at Olympic will require extraordinary leadership and <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> by all parties involved. There has been a noticeable increase in involvement by parents and the community. For instance, attendance for athletic events in 2006-07 was the highest since 1982, and a multi-million capital campaign was started by parents and community residents for facility improvements. The most recent incarnation of this fundraising is the Olympic High School Foundation, which raised $276,500 in 2015. It is the hoped that enthusiasm like this can be sustained and even grow as Olympic's success is measured in the coming years.|$|R
25|$|The Mayan Temple is {{the grand}} icon of Aquaventure, with {{a height of}} over six stories. The {{structure}} features a series of water rides, including the <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith,</b> a 60-foot near-perpendicular plunge that sends riders through a clear acrylic tunnel submerged in a shark-filled lagoon. Also located atop the Mayan Temple are the Challenger Slides, two high-speed dueling slides where riders race against the clock for the best times. From just below, the Serpent Slide spins out from 48 feet up the Temple and into the Temple's dark core before emerging through the shark-filled lagoon at a more leisurely “shark-viewing” pace. For a milder change of pace, the Jungle Slide meanders through exotic jungles and caves built {{in the heart of}} the Mayan Temple.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commentators}} associate Jaspers {{with the}} philosophy of existentialism, {{in part because he}} draws largely upon the existentialist roots of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and in part because the theme of individual freedom permeates his work. In Philosophy (3 vols, 1932), Jaspers gave his view of the history of philosophy and introduced his major themes. Beginning with modern science and empiricism, Jaspers points out that as we question reality, we confront borders that an empirical (or scientific) method simply cannot transcend. At this point, the individual faces a choice: sink into despair and resignation, or take a <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> toward what Jaspers calls Transcendence. In making this leap, individuals confront their own limitless freedom, which Jaspers calls Existenz, and can finally experience authentic existence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match, AJ Styles faced Shane McMahon. During the match, Styles {{attempted}} a springboard 450° splash on Shane, who countered into a triangle choke on Styles, who then countered into a one-armed Styles Clash on Shane for a near-fall. After the referee was knocked down, Styles attempted a Coast-to-Coast on Shane, who countered by attacking Styles with {{a trash can}}. Shane then performed a Coast-to-Coast into a trash can on Styles for a near-fall. Shane attempted a <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> through an announce table on Styles, only for Styles {{to move out of}} the way and Shane fell through the announce table. As Styles attempted a Phenomenal Forearm on Shane, Shane countered into a float-over DDT on Styles.

5000|$|Critics, meanwhile, were {{reserved}} {{in their}} praise. While many agreed the leads' performances are well played, {{a few have}} argued that the film's plot, and particularly some dramatic <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> were difficult to swallow. Ray Bennett of The Hollywood Reporter, for example, wrote that the film's [...] "plot doesn't really hold up" [...] and that [...] "while the cast does well, ... the demands of sudden changes of emotion are a bit overwhelming." [...] Derek Elley of Variety, however, appears to accept the dramatic licenses taken, and instead focuses on the film's excellent technical credits, and the performances of the four main leads.|$|R
40|$|Until recently, {{most economists}} work on Africa has taken 1960 as the {{starting}} point because data on national income and similar derivates are only available back to this point. To date, the quantitative literature on Africa has made heroic <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith,</b> asserting causal relationships across time periods, without being able to account for different trajectories of economic development. This paper suggests some ways in which historical national accounts for African economies can be created and discusses whether such estimates will add to our stock of knowledge regarding African economic change, or whether they are likely to mislead.

25|$|Next was a Last Man Standing {{match between}} Kane and Shane McMahon. Before the match began, McMahon {{attacked}} Kane, {{who was doing}} his entrance, with a steel chair. As the referee officially called to ring the bell to start the match, Kane pushed McMahon away to block another chair shot. After multiple shots with the chair, McMahon targeted Kane's knee using the ring post. Later, Kane attempted to perform a big boot on McMahon, but he accidentally hit the referee. After back and forth action, Kane attempted a Tombstone Piledriver onto the steel steps on McMahon but McMahon countered into a bulldog and performed a Coast-to-Coast into the steel steps, which were positioned against Kane. In the end, McMahon attempted a <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith,</b> {{from the top of}} the arena TitanTron, which was roughly 25 feet tall. but Kane moved and McMahon fell through the floor. Kane won the match when McMahon did not stand up in time to answer the referee's 10 count.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith.</b> One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them around to make cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
50|$|Kierkegaard {{gave some}} remit to irrationality in his Concluding Scientific Postscript to the Philosophical Fragments, where {{he claimed that}} 'Subjectivity is Truth'. Rather than {{allowing}} reason to do our choosing for us, Kierkegaard argued that irrational <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> could be more useful, as they were more authentic (although, he never used the word 'authentic'), and thus gave more meaning to life. Objectivity, like reason, was opposed to subjectivity, and thus could {{not be said to}} give any meaning to anyone's life.Although he never dismissed rationality in its entirety, Kierkegaard argued that we could not allow rationality to make our decisions for us. In this, and to some degree, he offers a vindication of irrationality.|$|R
50|$|While {{writing his}} journal {{and looking up}} words and names, Tubby {{encounters}} the writings of Søren Kierkegaard. A list of Kierkegaard book titles catches his attention and motivates him to delve into Kierkegaard's journals and publications. Tubby feels that he and Kierkegaard have experienced similar difficulties. For example, Tubby likens his being mocked in a magazine article to Kierkegaard's Corsair Affair; and the way Tubby dumps Maureen, he feels, is akin to Kierkegaard's breakup with Regine. Tubby struggles {{to find a way}} out of his depression. Even though Tubby denies Christianity it may be interpreted that he undergoes the three (Kierkegaardian) existential stages of 'the Aesthetic', 'the Ethical' and 'the Religious' and takes <b>leaps</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith</b> to move from one stage to another.|$|R

25|$|The {{other main}} match {{on the card}} was a Last Man Standing match between Shane McMahon and Kane. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Kane was forced to unmask himself after he had lost a Mask vs. Title match to Triple H. Shortly after Kane unmasked himself, Kane turned on and chokeslammed his tag team partner Rob Van Dam. Three weeks later on the July 14 episode of Raw, during an {{interview}} between Kane and Jim Ross, Kane set Jim Ross on fire after {{he thought he was}} mocking him. The following week on Raw, after a match between Kane and Van Dam ended in a no-contest, Linda McMahon came out to try and stop Kane from attacking Van Dam. Kane, however, gave Linda McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ramp. On the July 28 episode of Raw, Shane McMahon made a surprise appearance by attacking Kane for his actions the week before. The next week on Raw, Eric Bischoff defeated Shane McMahon after Kane interfered and gave McMahon a Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ring steps. On August 24 at SummerSlam, Kane defeated Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Shane McMahon defeated Eric Bischoff in a No Disqualification Falls Count Anywhere match. The following night on Raw, during a match between Shane McMahon and Chris Jericho, Kane interfered and performed a chokeslam on McMahon. Shortly afterwards, McMahon superkicked Kane into a dumpster that was on fire and full of gasoline. On the September 8 episode of Raw, Bischoff announced that McMahon and Kane would face each other in a Last Man Standing match at Unforgiven. The next week on Raw, after both men signed a contract for their match at Unforgiven, McMahon gave Kane multiple low blows, followed by a <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> through an announce table.|$|E
25|$|The Sun {{came into}} the 2010 WNBA Draft with two picks {{in the first round}} – the first and seventh overall picks, the latter of which was {{acquired}} one day prior to the draft from Tulsa. With its first overall selection in franchise history, the Sun took UConn standout and Player of the Year recipient, Tina Charles, the consensus top prospect available. By playing alongside premier talent at the collegiate level, Charles had shown that she was ready to pilot an offense and lead this franchise into the post-Sales era. After the selection of Charles, Thibault had the remainder of the draft to fortify the weapons around his newly acquired center. To diminish the losses of Amber Holt and Chante Black, both of whom were part of the package deal with the Shock, the Sun selected Kansas product Danielle McCray. Prior to the draft, it was understood that McCray wouldn't be available to participate in the upcoming season due to an ACL injury she sustained in college. There was risk involved concerning her durability, but McCray's potential as a superstar was reason enough to take the <b>leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>faith.</b> The Sun cemented its guard corps with the selection of Allison Hightower in the second round. Thibault wasn't finished making a mark on draft day as he maneuvered around the draft board to address the Sun's suspect defense. He nabbed former Cornhusker Kelsey Griffin, who was taken third overall, in a trade once again involving the Lynx. This trade would have the Sun relinquishing their first and second round picks in next year's draft. The acquisition of coveted players through the draft and free agency capped an offseason of change that had transformed a franchise for the future. Although the reconstruction of the Sun remained a work in progress, this talented class of prospects would serve as the foundation for a team that jumped back into contention quicker than anyone anticipated.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles {{that he would get}} a one-on-one rematch for the title if he did not win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating he should get his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He said because of them, {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing a <b>Leap</b> <b>of</b> <b>Faith</b> on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E
