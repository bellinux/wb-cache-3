5|$|Black Creek is an ephemeral stream. It used {{to drain}} an area between Turtle Creek and the Susquehanna River, but now <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> flow to {{underground}} mines via broken bedrock. Its channel is also disrupted by strip mines and rock piles. The waters of Black Creek are acidic.|$|E
5|$|Near Tilbury, Highway401 <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> tall wall {{median barrier}} and narrows to four lanes, {{following}} lot lines laid between concession roads in a plan designed to limit {{damage to the}} sensitive agricultural lands through which the highway runs.|$|E
5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom is the smallest among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E
50|$|The upper pnictogens, that is, nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic tend to form −3 charges. Antimony and bismuth {{can either}} {{take on a}} +3 or +5, by <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> p-shell {{electrons}} or <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> p-shell and s-shell electrons, respectively.|$|R

5000|$|Schweizer {{notes that}} some early {{versions}} have this verse read [...] "earth <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> salt" [...] rather than [...] "salt <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour" [...] {{and is thus}} an illustration of how important the disciples are to the world. Hill notes {{that there is an}} entirely different understanding, which is that Jesus was well aware that salt cannot <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour and the message is that if the disciples remain true to their Christianity they will never lose their influence and importance.|$|R
5|$|During extratropical transition, the cyclone {{begins to}} tilt {{back into the}} colder airmass with height, and the cyclone's primary energy source {{converts}} from the release of latent heat from condensation (from thunderstorms near the center) to baroclinic processes. The low pressure system eventually <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> warm core and becomes a cold-core system.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring that are as closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the only exception to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
5000|$|The most {{important}} objection is that Büyükeceli {{and the surrounding}} coastline may <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> touristic potential after {{the realization of the}} project. Büyükeceli residents are also worried that the already low population of the town may further decrease and the town may <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> township status.|$|R
50|$|An {{adjective}} can <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> capitalization when {{it takes}} on new meanings, such as chauvinistic. In addition, over time, an adjective can <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> capitalization by convention, generally when the word has overshadowed its original reference, such as gargantuan, quixotic, titanic, or roman in the term roman numerals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue of}} salt <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> flavour is {{somewhat}} problematic. Salt itself, sodium chloride, is extremely stable and cannot <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour. France notes that Jesus {{was giving a}} lesson in moral philosophy and [...] "not teaching chemistry"; to him, {{whether or not the}} proverbial image is factually accurate is of little relevance to the actual message of this verse. Nolland considers the impossibility of what is described as deliberate, it is counter to nature that salt <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> flavour, just as it is counter to God's will that the disciples lose faith.|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{a manifestation}} of the anti-social and inauspicious {{elements}} in women and is an antithesis to the goddess Lakshmi. Like Alakshmi, Dhumavati rules over the four months of the rainy season, when even solar light is obscured by the evil water spirit. This coincides with Chaturmas, a period during the year when the god Vishnu sleeps. At that time, darkness rules and the soul <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> usual luster. This period is considered inauspicious, and as such as no auspicious ceremonies like marriage can take place.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E

5|$|However some {{properties}} have so {{far gone}} unexplained, like the Thebe Extension, which {{may be due to}} unseen bodies outside Thebe's orbit, and structures visible in the back-scattered light. One possible explanation of the Thebe Extension is influence of the electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. When the dust enters the shadow behind Jupiter, it <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> electrical charge fairly quickly. Since the small dust particles partially corotate with the planet, they will move outward during the shadow pass creating an outward extension of the Thebe gossamer ring. The same forces can explain a dip in the particle distribution and ring's brightness, which occurs between the orbits of Amalthea and Thebe.|$|E
5|$|I have then {{considered}} {{myself as}} a particle broken off from the grand mass of mankind; — I was alone, till some involuntary sympathetic emotion, like the attraction of adhesion, made me feel that I was still {{a part of a}} mighty whole, from which I could not sever myself—not, perhaps, for the reflection has been carried very far, by snapping the thread of an existence which <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> charms in proportion as the cruel experience of life stops or poisons the current of the heart.|$|E
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has {{a thick layer}} of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing much of it through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E

50|$|In an echo {{of events}} from over 60 years earlier, the navy would <b>lose</b> <b>its</b> Marinflyget in 1998, with its {{helicopter}} units being absorbed by the air force's new 'joint' Helikopterflottiljen (Helicopter Wing) (the Army also <b>losing</b> <b>its</b> helicopters to this new wing). The air force then promptly retired the former navy ASW helicopters without any immediate replacement.|$|R
5|$|Several {{paragraphs}} outline potential {{conditions for}} an armistice, rejecting any {{notion that the}} German Empire has any place in dictating the terms of peace. The authors also insist that the German populace must accept some blame for having not resisted the march to war {{on the part of}} the German government. The authors maintain that immediate calls for negotiation would not be favorable, as the German state would potentially dictate the process from a position of diplomatic and military power. Instead, the manifesto proclaims that the war must be continued so that the German state <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> military strength, and by extension, its ability to negotiate.|$|E
5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E
5|$|At one point, Eddy Creek {{flows through}} a {{restored}} channel at a reclaimed mining site. Further downstream, the creek flows through its natural channel and cuts across {{a number of}} rock ledges. However, {{by the time it}} crosses US Route 6, it has lost its flow. Nevertheless, its channel is still discernible and its gradient is shallower. The creek <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> channel completely at the intersection of an electric transmission corridor and the Eddy Creek Mine Tunnel. It eventually reappears, but disappears again in strip pits and sinks. From Birds Eye Mine to Underwood Road, the stream channel has been completely destroyed. The creek has an engineered channel in one reach where it passes through a residential area.|$|E

5|$|M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, {{which allows}} female workers to be fertile, {{and these are}} then able to {{reproduce}} in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> queen can still thrive {{in the absence of}} the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> food source and dies as well.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} a {{flashback}} of a five year old Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) lost in a park. In the present, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), leaves Grey {{and their two children}} to go to Washington to resign from the President's brain mapping project. While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone <b>loses</b> <b>its</b> signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E
