5000|$|In 1823, Holme-on-Spalding-Moor {{was in the}} Wapentake of Harthill. Baines' History, Directory and Gazetteer of the County of York {{records the}} {{alternative}} village name of [...] "Hemp Holme", taken from the parish' former cultivation of hemp. A bed of gypsum was recorded in which ammonites were found. The church stands in an elevated position, on which is also sited a beacon, which gave its name of Holme Beacon to this contemporary part of Harthill Wapentake. The parish church and rectory was in the patronage of St John's College, Cambridge. There were two chapels, one Roman Catholic, the other, Methodist. Local landowners allotted land (cow-gates), for the personal use of their <b>labourers.</b> <b>Population</b> {{at the time was}} 1318. Occupations included twenty-three farmers and yeomen, three blacksmiths, two wheelwrights, three shoemakers, four shopkeepers, two coal dealers, two corn millers, a tailor, a butcher, a joiner, a bricklayer, and an ornamental plasterer. There were the landlords of The New Inn, The Hare and Hounds, The Sun, and The Blacksmiths' public houses. A carrier operated between the village and Market Weighton on Wednesdays, and Howden on Saturdays. Within the parish lived a banker, a steward to Lady Stourton Langdale, Charles Langdale at the Hall, a gentleman and a gentlewoman, a surgeon, and the parish rector. Baines records a traditional belief that a cell for two monks was founded at Welham Bridge on the edge of Spalding Moor by vavasours or constables. One monk was charged with guiding people over wasteland, the other praying for the safety of travellers.|$|E
50|$|The Treasury exhibit {{includes}} such pieces as the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, {{as well as}} the Broighter Gold and the Derrynaflan Hoard and the Cross of Cong, all famous examples of early medieval metalwork in Ireland, as well as prehistoric ornaments from the Bronze Age in Ireland. Many of these pieces were found in the 19th century by peasants or agricultural <b>labourers,</b> when <b>population</b> expansion led to cultivation of land which had not been touched since the Middle Ages. Indeed, only the intervention of George Petrie of the Royal Irish Academy, and like-minded individuals from the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, prevented the metalwork from being melted down for the intrinsic value of its materials. Contemporary Irish are more tuned to their heritage, {{as can be seen in}} the example of the Irish Bog Psalter, which was discovered and reported by an alert machine operator in July 2006.|$|R

50|$|This section {{includes}} famous {{examples of}} early medieval Celtic metalwork in Ireland {{such as the}} Ardagh Chalice, the Tara Brooch, and the Derrynaflan Hoard. Prehistoric pieces include the Iron Age Broighter Gold and over 50 gold lunulas (not all on display), and other Bronze Age jewellery. Many of these pieces {{were found in the}} 19th century by poor people or agricultural <b>labourers,</b> when <b>population</b> expansion led to cultivation of land which had not been touched since the Middle Ages. Indeed, without the intervention of George Petrie of the Royal Irish Academy and like-minded individuals from the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, most of the metalwork would have been melted down for the intrinsic value of its materials, as did frequently happen despite their efforts.

50|$|The {{site of the}} Polygon is now {{occupied}} by a block of council flats called Oakshott Court, which features a commemorative plaque for Wollstonecraft. The Polygon deteriorated socially as the surrounding land was subsequently sold off in smaller lots for cheaper housing, especially {{after the start of}} construction in the 1830s of the railway lines into Euston, St Pancras and King's Cross. In this period the area housed a large transient <b>population</b> of <b>labourers</b> and the <b>population</b> density of the area soared. By the late 19th century most of the houses were in multiple occupation, and overcrowding was severe with whole families sometimes living in one room, as confirmed by the social surveys of Charles Booth and Irene Barclay. Dickens lived in the Polygon briefly as a child.|$|R

Due to the main employment sector being agricultural the predominant social class of the males in Neenton was labourers and servants, the second most common social class was employers, professionals and middling sorts. After 1901 the population declined; as a result the population density was exceptionally lower than the average for England and Wales, due to the low population growth and sometimes the population declined ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study area}} {{is one of}} the {{watersheds}} of North Pennar basin, covering an area of 570 km(2) and lies between latitude 13 degrees 55 '- 14 degrees 17 'N and longitude 77 degrees 05 '- 77 degrees 25 'E in Pavagada area, Tumkur District, Karnataka and a small portion in Ananthpur District, Andhra Pradesh, India, forming a part of the hardrock terrain. The drainage network shows dendritic to sub-dendritic pattern and is non-perennial in nature. Poor soil cover, sparse vegetation, erratic rainfall and lack of soil moisture characterize the area for most part of the year. Recurring drought coupled with increase in groundwater exploitation results in decline the groundwater level. The entire study area has been further divided into nine sub-watersheds, namely Byadanur, Devadabetta, Talamaradahalli, Gowdatimmanahalli, Naliganahalli, Nagalamadike, Maddalenahalli, Paluvalli tank and Dalavayihalli, ranging in geographical area from 49 to 75 km(2). It has been taken up for prioritization based on available natural resources derived from satellite images and socio-economic conditions, including drainage density, slope, water yield capacity, ground-water prospects, soil, wasteland, irrigated area, forest cover and data on agricultural <b>labourers,</b> SC/ST <b>population</b> and rainfall. On the basis of priority and weightage assigned to each thematic map, the sub-watersheds have been grouped into three categories: high, medium and low priority. The prioritization results reveal that Nagalamadike, Maddalenahalli and Dalavayihalli sub-watersheds rank highest on the basis of weightage and are considered as high priority. These sub-watersheds may be taken up with development and management plans to conserve natural resources on sustainable basis with immediate effect, which will ultimately lead to soil and water conservation...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: India, being a fast {{developing}} nation, {{is looking}} forward a rapid growth in the economical status & infrastructure. Accordingly, there was a boom in the Real estate sector which led to exuberant constructions of multi-storeyed buildings. In the past two decades, India has witnessed rapid urbanization, motorization, industrialization and migration of people resulting from socioeconomic growth and development. With mechanization and revolution in technology, traditional ways of living and working are being altered. Injuries are a major public health problem in India. Lack of reliable and good quality national or regional data has thwarted their recognition. Methods: The present study is a retrospective study conducted at St. Johns Medical College. All the Autopsied cases of Occupational deaths which occurred from 2001 - 2010 {{over a period of}} 10 years were studied and analysed. Result: When a year wise percentage of fatalities was analysed, in year 2007 had a significantly high fatalities. It was found that significant increase in death was found to be in Manual construction <b>labourers</b> of migratory <b>population</b> at evening time due to Shock and Haemorrhage. Conclusion: A steep increase in deaths during the period of Real Estate boom was observed. </p...|$|R
