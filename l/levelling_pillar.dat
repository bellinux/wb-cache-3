This is a fine example of the simple Romanesque {{building}} style of the region and is clearest from outside the building. The apse, locally called the chevet, consists of two <b>levels</b> of <b>pillars</b> supporting a conical roof. The older, lower, part is constructed from simply dressed limestone and pink marble and has eight pillars with capitals of interlacing plant design. There are no arches in the lower <b>level,</b> the <b>pillars</b> merely supporting simple stone lintels. There are three simple slit windows in this lower section.|$|R

Pore formation is much more active in the highly doped Si, and the transition from polishing to pore formation is much clearer in the lightly doped Si. Higher etching rates are observed in the Si with higher doping <b>level.</b> <b>Pillar</b> thinning and oxidation are only observed for etching in the solutions with small values of λ. Strong bonding and bending of the pillars occur when {{the surface of the}} pillars is oxidized. These results help in understanding the MaCE mechanisms. Furthermore, this synthesis has a potential for applications in optoelectronics, sensors, and Li-ion batteries.|$|R

At micro <b>level,</b> <b>pillars</b> were generated from AL-Sn-Mg powders and binder mixture. Both conventional and current activated sintering processes were investigated {{in order to}} do sintering. Two types of binders and solvent system were investigated. Paraffin wax (PW) and n-heptane was used with AL-Sn-Mg powders and polyethylene glycol (PEG) and water was used with Al-SN powders. Setup was designed and fabricated to generate pillars and for DC current activated sintering. Rolling technique and very low pressure was applied in this application. At macro level, press and sinter technique was investigated to compare the mechanical properties such as density, hardness and shrinkage of mechanically alloyed Al-Sn-Mg powders and unmilled powders. The result shows that the MA powders have higher mechanical properties compared to unmilled powders. However, unmilled powder compact sintered very nicely and used for further processing. Green pillars were successfully generated using both binder systems. For sintering, conventional sintering appeared more successful than current activated sintering...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -D {{finite element}} {{analysis}} was performed to evaluate {{the stability of the}} SPR upper and lower oil storage levels at Weeks Island. The mechanical analysis predicted stresses and strains from which pillar stability was inferred using a fracture criterion developed from previous testing of Weeks Island salt. This analysis simulated the sequential mining of the two levels and subsequent oil fill of the mine. The predicted subsidence rates compare well to those measured over the past few years. Predicted failure mechanisms agree with observations made at the time the mine was being modified for oil storage. The modeling technique employed here treats an infinite array of pillars and is a reasonable representation of the behavior {{at the center of the}} mine. This analysis predicts that the lower <b>level</b> <b>pillars,</b> at the center of the mine, have fractured and their stability at this time is questionable. Localized pillar fracturing is predicted and implies that the mine is entering a phase of continual time dependent deterioration. Continued and expanded monitoring of the facility and development of methods to assess and predict its behavior are more important now than ever...|$|R

40|$|The {{collapse}} of abandoned room-and-pillar mines is often violent and unpredictable. Safety concerns often resulted in mine closures with no post-mining stability evaluations. As a result, {{large amounts of}} land resources over room-and-pillar mines are wasted. This paper attempts to establish {{an understanding of the}} long-term stability issues of goafs (abandoned mines). Considering progressive pillar failures and the effect of single pillar failure on surrounding pillars, this paper proposes a pillar peeling model to evaluate the long-term stability of coal mines and the associated criteria for evaluating the long-term stability of room-and-pillar mines. The validity of the peeling model was verified by numerical simulation, and field data from 500 pillar cases from China, South Africa, and India. It is found that the damage <b>level</b> of <b>pillar</b> peeling is affected by the peel angle and pillar height and is controlled by the pillar width–height ratio...|$|R

50|$|The {{station is}} by far the most unusual in the system. Its design is a shallow <b>level</b> curved side-platform <b>pillar</b> bi-span. In the {{original}} designs the station was not planned, and the long stretch Kharkivska-Boryspilska was already under construction, when in late 2003, the City urban planning committee decided to invest and develop the empty area roughly halfway between the two stations with new housing massifs. As a result, a need for a Metro station arose. In fact the only other station in the former USSR to exhibit the same layout is Alexandrovsky Sad on the Moscow Metro whose design was too attributed to the same reasoning.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{contribute}} to our understanding of regional economic development by constructing a regional entrepreneurship index that captures the essence of the contextual features of entrepreneurship and fills a gap in the measurement of economic and social development in the cases where high heterogeneity is found in the entrepreneurial climate between countries and regions. This paper builds on Acs and Szerb (2011) and aims to provide a regional application of the Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index (GEDI). Originally the GEDI has been developed to measure national level of entrepreneurship. The GEDI refers to the contextual feature of entrepreneurship by focusing on the twelve pillars of entrepreneurial attitudes, entrepreneurial action and entrepreneurial aspirations. The country level index construction integrates 31 variables, 16 from the GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor data) adult population survey, and 15 from other data sources, into 14 pillars, three sub indexes and a 2 ̆ 018 super index'. One of the most important finding of Acs and Szerb (2011) is that the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic development appears to be mildly S-shaped. The model has important implications for development policy. The regional application of the GEDI is relatively straightforward, since the GEM related individual variables are available in regional levels for a few countries, including Spain. The key element of the regional entrepreneurship index construction is to find regional level institutional data that are available also in the country level. Out of the 15 institutional variables we apply for the entrepreneurship index construction 10 are available in the NUTS- 2 regional levels that is the same or very similar to the country level variables. Because of the lack of the remaining four pillars we used the Spanish country level variables. While the overall regional level entrepreneurship and development index for the Spanish regions are calculated as benchmarking the country <b>level</b> <b>pillars</b> the analysis focuses on comparing 17 Spanish autonomous regions. This paper provides tailor-made entrepreneurship policy suggestions for the different autonomous Spanish regions by showing the relatively weak and strong points of their entrepreneurial climate. For an optimum configuration of a public policy to improve entrepreneurship we suggest different levels of public policy as national, multi- and single levels depending on the deviation of a particular pillar from the best benchmarking value and on how many regions are affected by the weakness of a particular pillar...|$|R
40|$|A {{recursive}} dynamic regional Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) {{model is}} developed {{to assess the}} economic impacts of two Common Agricultural Policy scenarios in six NUTS- 3 regions of the European Union. The main goal of the analysis is to assess the scenario effects (economic, change in production, prices, employment) in the rural and urban parts of these regions {{as well as on}} the different sectors. The two scenarios analyzed are related to a 30 % reduction in Pillar 1 (market measures and direct support to farmers) support and the introduction of an EU-wide flat rate <b>level</b> of <b>Pillar</b> 1 support with a 45 % decrease in Pillar 2 (Rural Development Policy) funds. Results show that the overall GDP effects are not significant, due to the relatively low importance of both the agricultural sector and Common Agricultural Policy spending in the regional economies. However, impacts on the agricultural sector are quite important and differ according to the nature of the policy shock. Also, the structural characteristics of each case study drive the results regarding the rural-urban and sectoral spill-overs, including impacts on region-specific agricultural activity. JRC.
