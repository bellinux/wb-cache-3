Located in the glass atrium of the winter garden, Humanity in Motion shows ten life-size human figures walking across ten {{horizontal}} poles positioned {{at different levels of}} the atrium. At ground level, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stainless steel figures, are two more figures shaped to look like a father and son.|$|E
5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth. This idea, which {{appeared}} in various forms since 1995, initially predicted Doomsday in May 2003, but proponents abandoned that date after it passed without incident. The idea originated from claims of channeling alien beings and is widely ridiculed. Astronomers calculated that such an object so close to Earth would be visible to anyone <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> night sky.|$|E
500|$|Laura Claridge said, [...] "The American {{ideal that}} the {{painting}} is meant to encapsulate shines forth brilliantly {{for those who have}} canonized this work as among Rockwell's great pictures. For those who find the piece less successful, however, Rockwell's desire to give concrete form to an ideal produces a strained result. To such critics the people <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> speaker have stars in their eyes, their posture conveying celebrity worship, not a room full of respectful dissent." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{their return}} to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens. He is taken to the ICU and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time {{together}} for anything, since he [...] "gave me a forever within the numbered days." [...] Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral {{to make up for}} the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: [...] "Okay." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{religious}} or spiritual views, Seeger replied: [...] "I feel most spiritual when I’m out in the woods. I feel part of nature. Or <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars. [...] I was an atheist. Now I say, it's all according to your definition of God. According to my definition of God, I'm not an atheist. Because I think God is everything. Whenever I open my eyes I'm looking at God. Whenever I'm listening to something I'm listening to God.".

2500|$|Typical of Brewster's portraits is [...] "Francis O. Watts with Bird" [...] (1805), showing [...] "an {{innocent}} looking {{boy with}} manly features" [...] wearing a nightslip {{and holding a}} bird on his finger and with a string. The surrounding landscape is [...] "strangely low and wildly out of scale—the young boy towers over trees and dwarfs distant mountains. He looks like a giant," [...] Genocchio has written. Or he {{looks as if the}} viewer must be lying down, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> child from the ground. Brewster always struggled with the relationship of his figures to the background.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{penultimate}} episode, Drake asks Hunt if {{he killed}} Sam Tyler, with Hunt explaining that Tyler had been acting [...] "weird" [...] {{and asked for}} Hunt's help in faking his own death. However, the vision that Drake has of the police officer with injuries {{to the side of}} his face is connected to Tyler's presumed death, and a roll of undeveloped film apparently reveals where the policeman is supposedly buried. Along with this, Shaz, Ray and Chris all have visions of stars, as if <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, and hear strange voices as described by Chris as Nelson (Tony Marshall), the publican from Life on Mars, asking him what he would like to drink.|$|E

2500|$|Adams {{claimed that}} the title came from a 1971 {{incident}} while he was hitchhiking around Europe {{as a young man}} with a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe book: while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book and <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stars, he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of [...] "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" [...] to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2015, Scantlin also lip-synced at the TNL Onstage {{concert in}} Colombo, Sri Lanka. Scantlin {{appeared}} intoxicated {{as he struggled}} to mime along the words to their popular tracks including [...] "Blurry", [...] "Psycho" [...] and [...] "She Hates Me". Some audience members proceeded to abandon the concert after it became obvious the band wasn't playing live - Scantlin sang while standing away from the mic, <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky without any change in vocals. According to organizers, the band conducted a full sound check pre-event, before using an audio connection to play vocal tracks off an iPod during the show. The organizers released a statement apologizing to unhappy fans, as well as offering refunds on their tickets.|$|E
2500|$|Probably {{the most}} {{frequently}} noted aspect of Ozu's camera technique is his consistent use of an extremely low camera position to shoot his subjects, a practice that Bordwell traces {{as far back as}} his films of the 1931–1932 period. An example of the low camera in Late Spring would be the scene in which Noriko visits her friend Aya in her home. Noriko is in a sitting position, while Aya is seated at a slightly higher elevation, so Aya is looking down towards her friend. However, [...] "the camera angle on both is low. Noriko sits <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> standing Aya, but the camera [...] looks up on Noriko's face, rejecting Aya's point of view. We are thus prevented from identifying with Aya and are forced into an inhuman point of view on Noriko." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 2005, Tate was a {{guest at}} the 77th Royal Variety Performance, and {{appeared}} {{in the guise of}} teenager Lauren Cooper, accompanied by Lauren's friends, Ryan and Liese. After Lauren embarrassed herself in front of the audience, Ryan pointed out that the Queen was laughing at her. <b>Looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Royal Box, she asked, [...] "Are you disrespecting me?" [...] and mimicked the Queen's accent, asking, [...] "Is one bovvered? Is one's face bovvered?", before adding, [...] "Who is looking after the corgis?" [...] The Queen was seen laughing at this joke, and Prince Phillip also appeared to take this in good humour. There were, however, reports that the Prince was extremely unimpressed by the performance and complained to the show's executive producer. She also appeared as Lauren in a special sketch for the BBC's annual Children in Need telethon. The segment was a crossover with EastEnders (see charity sketches for details).|$|E
2500|$|It is {{said that}} getting flown over by a mikoshi-nyūdō results in death or getting strangled by the throat, and if one falls back due to <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> nyūdō, one's {{windpipe}} would get gnawed at and killed. On Iki Island off Kyushu, a mikoshi-nyūdō would make a [...] "wara wara" [...] sound like the swaying of bamboo, so by immediately changing, [...] "," [...] the nyūdō would disappear, but it {{is said that}} if one simply goes past them without saying anything, bamboo would fall resulting in death. In the Oda District, Okayama Prefecture, {{it is said that}} when one meets a mikoshi-nyūdō, it is vital to lower one's vision to the bottom of one's feet, and if one instead looks up to the head from the feet, one would be eaten and killed. Other than this, other than changing [...] "mikoshita (seen past)" [...] or [...] "minuita (seen through)," [...] there are also examples where they would disappear by mustering one's courage and smoking tobacco (Kanagawa Prefecture), or by calculating the height of the mikoshi-nyūdō by a margin (Shizuoka Prefecture), among other methods.|$|E
2500|$|At the conclave, [...] "it was, if not Ratzinger, who? And as {{they came}} to know him, the {{question}} became, why not Ratzinger?" [...] On 19 April 2005, he was elected {{on the second day}} after four ballots. Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor described the final vote, [...] "It's very solemn when you go up one by one to put your vote in the urn and you're <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Last Judgement of Michelangelo. And I still remember vividly the then Cardinal Ratzinger {{sitting on the edge of}} his chair." [...] Ratzinger had hoped to retire peacefully and said that [...] "At a certain point, I prayed to God 'please don't do this to me'...Evidently, this time He didn't listen to me." [...] Before his first appearance on the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica, he was announced by Jorge Medina Estévez, Cardinal Protodeacon of the Catholic Church. Cardinal Medina Estévez first addressed the massive crowd as [...] "dear(est) brothers and sisters" [...] in Italian, Spanish, French, German and English, with each language receiving cheers from the international crowd, before continuing with the traditional Habemus Papam announcement in Latin.|$|E
