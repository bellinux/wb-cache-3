5|$|Kramer {{is almost}} {{immediately}} out, {{due to the}} presence of a beautiful exhibitionist woman in the apartment across the street who walks around in her apartment naked with the curtains open. The others are distracted by various temptations: George is distracted in the hospital his mother is staying at by an attractive nurse giving an even more attractive woman a daily sponge bath; Elaine visits a fitness club which is also patronized by John F. Kennedy, Jr.; Jerry is tempted by the naked woman across the street and frustrated because the woman he's dating won't have sex with him since she wants to remain a virgin. One method he uses to distract himself is by watching wholesome shows <b>like</b> <b>Tiny</b> Toons on Nickelodeon.|$|E
5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are roughly equivalent to those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{moments of}} atoms in a ferromagnetic material {{cause them to}} behave something <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> permanent magnets. They stick together and align themselves into small regions of more or less uniform alignment called magnetic domains or Weiss domains. Magnetic domains can be observed with a magnetic force microscope to reveal magnetic domain boundaries that resemble white lines in the sketch. There are many scientific experiments that can physically show magnetic fields.|$|E

25|$|On January 28, 2010, the {{facility}} published a paper reporting {{the delivery of}} a 669 kJ pulse to a gold hohlraum, setting new records for power delivery by a laser, and leading to analysis suggesting that suspected interference by generated plasma {{would not be a}} problem in igniting a fusion reaction. Due {{to the size of the}} test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{are made}} of a chain of 20 {{different}} types of amino acid molecules. This chain folds up into a compact shape, rather like an untidy ball of string. The shape of the protein {{is determined by the}} sequence of amino acids along its chain and it is this shape that, in turn, determines what the protein does. For example, some proteins have parts of their surface that perfectly match the shape of another molecule, allowing the protein to bind to this molecule very tightly. Other proteins are enzymes, which are <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> machines that alter other molecules.|$|E
25|$|Lumpsuckers {{are found}} in {{temperate}} northern waters. They live on the seafloor, and are temporary residents of rocky pools in late winter and early spring when they spawn. The body of the lumpsucker is scaleless and covered with small lumps. They have a large sucking disc on their underside which they use to cling to surfaces. They are normally a blue to slate-grey colour, and are effectively camouflaged to look like stones. They are portly, nearly spherical, poor swimmers, reaching lengths up to 50cm. After the female lumpsucker lays eggs, the male takes over, clamping itself to a rock where it guards the eggs. When they hatch, lumpsuckers look <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> tadpoles. They remain in shallow water and rock pools, hiding amongst seaweed and rocks, until they grow up.|$|E
50|$|A small, non-transforming Optimus Primal toy {{that came}} with the Orcanoch Micro playset. This toy looked <b>like</b> a <b>tiny</b> version of Ultra Optimus Primal in robot mode.|$|R

50|$|The cocoon {{is formed}} on a leaf. It is {{spun out of}} silk in a small sphere, then covered in a liquid that sets <b>like</b> a <b>tiny</b> ball.|$|R
25|$|In {{most species}} of caridean shrimp, the females lay 50,000 to 1 million eggs, which hatch after some 24 hours into tiny nauplii. These nauplii feed on yolk {{reserves}} within {{their bodies and}} then undergo a metamorphosis into zoeae. This second larval stage feeds in the wild on algae {{and after a few}} days metamorphoses again into the third stage to become myses. At this stage, the myses already begin to appear <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> versions of fully developed adults and feed on algae and zooplankton. After another three to four days, they metamorphose a final time into postlarvae: young shrimp having all the characteristics of adults. The whole process takes about 12 days from hatching. In the wild, the marine postlarvae then migrate into estuaries, which are rich in nutrients and low in salinity. There they grow and eventually migrate back into open waters when they mature. Most adult carideans are benthic animals living primarily on the sea floor.|$|E
2500|$|Paramagnetism {{is due to}} the {{presence}} of unpaired electrons in the material, so all atoms with incompletely filled atomic orbitals are paramagnetic. [...] Due to their spin, unpaired electrons have a magnetic dipole moment and act <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> magnets. [...] An external magnetic field causes the electrons' spins to align parallel to the field, causing a net attraction. [...] Paramagnetic materials include aluminium, oxygen, titanium, and iron oxide (FeO).|$|E
2500|$|There are two living {{groups of}} hemichordates. The solitary enteropneusts, {{commonly}} known as [...] "acorn worms", have long proboscises and worm-like bodies with up to 200 branchial slits, are up to [...] long, and burrow though seafloor sediments. Pterobranchs are colonial animals, often less than [...] long individually, whose dwellings are interconnected. Each filter feeds {{by means of a}} pair of branched tentacles, and has a short, shield-shaped proboscis. The extinct graptolites, colonial animals whose fossils look <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> hacksaw blades, lived in tubes similar to those of pterobranchs.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, the 68010 had a [...] "loop mode" [...] which accelerates loops {{consisting}} {{of only two}} instructions, such as a MOVE and a DBRA. It acts <b>like</b> a <b>tiny</b> special-case instruction cache.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said. 'All's safe; and I am in. What if I {{had been}} out?' It was <b>like</b> {{dropping}} <b>tiny</b> pebbles {{into a deep}} well--so long after came the answering feeble splash.|$|R

2500|$|Unplasticised {{polystyrene}} is a rigid, brittle, inexpensive plastic {{that has}} been used to make plastic model kits and similar knick-knacks. It also is the basis for {{some of the most popular}} [...] "foamed" [...] plastics, under the name styrene foam or Styrofoam. Like most other foam plastics, foamed polystyrene can be manufactured in an [...] "open cell" [...] form, in which the foam bubbles are interconnected, as in an absorbent sponge, and [...] "closed cell", in which all the bubbles are distinct, <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> balloons, as in gas-filled foam insulation and flotation devices. In the late 1950s, high impact styrene was introduced, which was not brittle. It finds much current use as the substance of toy figurines and novelties.|$|E
2500|$|Adult males {{typically}} weigh , {{but have}} been documented up to , and females typically weigh [...] They are a small species of deer, with relatively little sexual dimorphism. [...] Males have small, lightweight antlers that are 3-pronged, which go through a yearly cycle of shedding in August or September, with a new grown set by December. [...] The lower front main prong of the antlers is not divided, but the upper prong is. [...] Females have hair whorls that look <b>like</b> <b>tiny</b> antlers stubs. [...] Females and males have different stances during urination. [...] Males have a strong smell secreted from glands in their back hooves that can be detected up to 1.5km away. Compared to other small ruminants, the males have small testicles relative to their body size.|$|E
2500|$|She graced every {{printed cover}} of Good Housekeeping from December 1917 through April 1933, {{becoming}} the artist with the longest run of illustrated magazine covers. She created {{a total of}} 184 illustrations of family scenes for the magazine. The magazine said of her, [...] "Certainly no other artist is so fitted to understand us, and to make for us pictures so truly an index to what {{we are as a}} magazine are striving for. The holding up to our readers of the highest ideals of the American home, the home with that certain sweet wholesomeness one associates with a sunny living-roomâ€”and children." [...] She was one of the highest paid illustrators of the time, earning over $1,500 per cover. Smith also created illustrations for Kodak and Procter & Gamble's Ivory soap over the course of her career. She made illustrations for Collier's magazines and of Charles Dickens' works, <b>like</b> <b>Tiny</b> Tim, Dickens' Children - Ten Children, and David Copperfield.|$|E
