40|$|A {{number of}} {{proposed}} theories of tort liability are "monolithic" {{in that they}} seek to explain tort liability by focusing on a single element or concern of the tort situation. Four different monolithic theories of tort liability {{will be discussed in}} this work: personal moral culpability liability; strict or absolute liability; <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> utility and, more specifically, economic liability; and <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reciprocity of risk between the parties. The narrow scope of each of these theories renders them susceptible to both internal and external criticism [...] they are, variously, internally inconsistent and incoherent and they lead to unacceptable results in tort decisions. <b>Liability</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a standard of reasonableness which permits and requires a consideration of a variety of individual and community interests in making a tort decision is to be preferred to any of these monolithic theories. A theory of <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reasonableness is in accord with and serves to correctly explicate the majority of decisions in reported tort cases. Furthermore, a theory of <b>liability</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> reasonableness dispels the supposed antithesis between liability with fault and strict liability...|$|R

An applicant (the injured party) usually sues the respondent (the owner or occupier) under common law <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>negligence</b> and/or damages.
