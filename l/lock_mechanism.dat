25|$|The {{pin tumbler}} lock is a <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> that uses pins of varying lengths {{to prevent the}} lock from opening without the correct key. Pin {{tumblers}} are most commonly employed in cylinder locks, but may {{also be found in}} tubular or radial locks. The earliest pin-tumble locks were made over 4,000 years ago by the Egyptians. But due to their large, cumbersome size and since they were made of wood, the locks were not practical to use. In 1848, Linus Yale, Sr. invented the modern pin-tumbler lock. In 1861, Linus Yale, Jr. was inspired by the original 1840s cylindrical lock designed by his father, thus inventing and patenting a smaller flat key with serrated edges as well as pins of varying lengths within the lock itself, the same design of the pin-tumbler lock which still remains in use today.|$|E

2500|$|The Sebenza is {{a folding}} pocket knife {{manufactured}} by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho. [...] It is constructed with {{a stainless steel}} blade and titanium handle. [...] Its handle functions as the <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> similar in concept to the Walker linerlock differing in that the handle itself forms the lock bar which holds the blade open. [...] This mechanism was invented by Chris Reeve, and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L). [...] It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Framelock, {{and is one of the}} most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement. [...] The name Sebenza is derived from the Zulu word meaning [...] "Work," [...] a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.|$|E
50|$|Bolt thrust is an {{important}} factor in weapons design. The greater the bolt thrust, the stronger the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> has to be to withstand it.

5000|$|A {{folding knife}} connects the blade to the handle through a pivot, {{allowing}} the blade to fold into the handle. To prevent {{injury to the}} knife user through the blade accidentally closing on the user's hand, folding knives typically have a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Different <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are favored by various individuals for reasons such as perceived strength (lock safety), legality, and ease of use.Popular <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> include: ...|$|R
50|$|Some {{connector}} housings {{are designed with}} <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to prevent inadvertent disconnection or poor environmental sealing. <b>Locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> designs include <b>locking</b> levers of various sorts, screw locking, and toggle or bayonet locking. Depending on application requirements, housings with <b>locking</b> <b>mechanisms</b> may be tested under various environmental simulations that include physical shock and vibration, water spray, dust, etc. to ensure {{the integrity of the}} electrical connection and housing seals.|$|R
2500|$|Motorists {{occasionally}} pump gasoline into {{a diesel}} car by accident. [...] The converse {{is almost impossible}} because diesel pumps have a large nozzle with a diameter of [...] which does not fit the [...] filler, and the nozzles are protected by a <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> or a liftable flap. Diesel fuel in a gasoline engine — while creating large amounts of smoke — does not normally cause permanent damage if it is drained once the mistake is realized. However even a liter of petrol added to the tank of a modern diesel car can cause irreversible damage to the injection pump and other components through a lack of lubrication. In some cases, the car has to be scrapped because the cost of repairs exceeds its residual value. The issue is not clear-cut as older diesels using completely mechanical injection can tolerate some gasoline — which has historically been used to [...] "thin" [...] diesel fuel in winter.|$|E
2500|$|The matchlock firing {{mechanism}} {{became a}} common {{term for the}} arquebus after it {{was added to the}} firearm. Prior to the appearance of the matchlock, handguns were fired from the chest, tucked under one arm, while the other arm maneuvered a hot pricker to the touch hole to ignite the gunpowder. The matchlock changed this by adding a firing mechanism consisting of two parts, the match, and the lock. The <b>lock</b> <b>mechanism</b> held within a clamp a two to three feet long length of smoldering rope soaked in saltpeter, which was the match. Connected to the lock lever was a trigger, which lowered the match into a priming pan when pulled, igniting the priming powder, causing a flash to travel through the touch hole, also igniting the gunpowder within the barrel, and propelling the bullet out the muzzle. While matchlocks provided a crucial advantage by allowing the user to aim the firearm using both hands, it was also awkward to utilize. To avoid accidentally igniting the gunpowder the match had to be detached while loading the gun. In some instances the match would also go out, so both ends of the match were kept lit. This proved cumbersome to maneuver as both hands were required to hold the match during removal, one end in each hand. The procedure was so complex that a 1607 drill manual published by Jacob de Gheyn in the Netherlands listed 28 steps just to fire and load the gun. In 1584 the Ming general Qi Jiguang composed an 11 step song to practice the procedure in rhythm: [...] "One, clean the gun. Two pour the powder. Three tamp the powder down. Four drop the pellet. Five drive the pellet down. Six put in paper (stopper). Seven drive the paper down. Eight open the flashpan cover. Nine pour in the flash powder. Ten close the flashpan, and clamp the fuse. Eleven, listen for the signal, then open the flashpan cover. Aiming at the enemy, raise your gun and fire." [...] Reloading a gun during the 16th century took anywhere from between 20 seconds to a minute under the most ideal conditions.|$|E

A series of test protocols {{was designed to}} evaluate {{the integrity of the}} new <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and a dedicated test rig was manufactured. Preliminary test results were disappointing and the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> failed at lower applied loads than predicted. Microscopy studies were conducted to establish the cause of this poor performance and with the aid of statistical analysis, these studies assisted in the development process.

40|$|Abstract. Concurrency control {{mechanisms}} such as turn-taking, locking, serialization, transactional <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{and operational}} transformation {{try to provide}} data consistency when concurrent activities are permitted in a reactive system. Locks are typically used in transactional models for assurance of data consistency and integrity in a concurrent environment. In addition, recovery management is used to preserve atomicity and durability in transaction models. Unfortunately, conventional <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms</b> severely (and intentionally) limit concurrency in a transactional environment. Such <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms</b> also limit recovery capabilities. Finally, existing recovery mechanisms themselves afford a considerable overhead to concurrency. This paper describes a new transaction model that supports release of early results {{inside and outside of}} a transaction, decreasing the severe limitations of conventional <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> yet still warranties consistency and recoverability of released resources (results). This is achieved through use of a more flexible <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and by using two types of consistency graph. This provides an integrated solution for transaction management, recovery management and concurrency control. We argue that these are necessary features for management of long-term transactions within “digital ecosystems ” of small to medium enterprise...|$|R
