5000|$|On 31 August 2006, up to 600 people {{attended}} a protest called Reclaim Power converging on Drax {{and attempting to}} shut it down. There was a 'kids march' to Drax Power Station, with a giant ostrich puppet, made by The Mischief Makers. Two protesters climbed a <b>lighting</b> <b>pylon</b> {{at the edge of}} the Drax site and four others broke through the fence. Thirty-eight protesters were arrested. The police reported that work at the power plant was not disrupted.|$|E

50|$|In several {{parts of}} China & india, there are <b>lighting</b> <b>pylons</b> with {{combinations}} of solar panels and wind-turbines at their top. This allows space already used for lighting {{to be used}} more efficiently with two complementary energy productions units. Most common models use horizontal axis wind-turbines, but now models are appearing with vertical axis wind-turbines, using a helicoidal shaped, twisted-Savonius system.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{station was}} abandoned because {{the construction of}} the Pinnacle Bank Arena required the re-routing of railway lines away from it. The new station cost $1.3 million. Designed by Sinclair Hille Architects, the building is composed of brick pavilions linked by a central waiting room. A large, curved skylight in the waiting room is meant to evoke the great vaulted spaces of many historic stations. One pavilion houses the restrooms while the other holds the ticket office, baggage room, and a space for train crews. Across from the ticket office is a large photo mural depicting steam and streamlined locomotives against an antique map of Nebraska. A tall, <b>lighted</b> <b>pylon</b> with “Lincoln” spelled vertically down its front serves as a beacon for approaching travelers.|$|R

50|$|The 128-metre-high, <b>light</b> blue <b>pylon</b> {{is divided}} into two parts: an {{approximately}} 40-metre-high base of concrete and an upper part of steel. The superstructure is separated from the base by bridge bearings. The base of the main pillar consists of 40 bored pilings with a 1.5 metre diameter. 32 harp-shaped, diagonally tensioned steel cables suspend the two main openings from the drop-shaped pylon.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{the results of}} a study of the architecture and history of drive-in restaurants from their genesis in the late 1920 s to their decline in popularity during the 1960 s. The study provides a context within which the historic, cultural and architectural significance of this building type can be evaluated. A Muncie, Indiana case study follows the study of the national context. Conclusions are reached concerning how the designs of drive-in restaurants in the Muncie study area compare to national design trends. It provides a framework for further research of the building type. Of the major drive-in restaurant styles, types or forms that were typical on the national scene, the Muncie study area demonstrated only the roadside stand-type, Modern style, and rectangular form. Independent of style or type, Muncie drive-ins demonstrated various interpretations of elements that were common nationally: the sheltering canopy, the <b>pylon,</b> <b>lighting,</b> electronic speaker systems for ordering, and plate glass. It is possible, though, that the Muncie study area contained other restaurants that exhibited national design trends but were demolished and left no record. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. S. H.
