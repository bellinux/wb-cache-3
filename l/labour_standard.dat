25|$|The Lost Decades {{forced a}} radical change in {{legislation}} as the government was now dealing with major declines {{in the economy and}} the competitiveness of Japan in the world markets. Neoliberal trade liberalization policies resulted in increasing competitive pressures on Japanese companies, forcing many to reduce labour costs. The 1998 and 2003 revision of the <b>Labour</b> <b>Standard</b> Law and the 1999 Worker Dispatching Law allowed for easier dismissal of workers and relaxed regulations regarding hiring practices, along with the aforementioned Equal Opportunity Law. As part-time workers, commonly known as freeters, are far less expensive than the traditional full-time lifelong worker whose wages traditionally increased with age, Japanese companies drastically increased the proportion of part-time workers to full-time workers. Among young adult workers, the percentage of full-time employees dropped from 90% in 1988 to 54% for a single, high-school educated female. Females are more significantly affected by development, as males are still able to maintain a higher ratio of full-time employment. The full-time employment rate of high-school educated males was at 78% in 2008 as compared to 75% for university educated females. As part-time workers receive lower wages, less employment protection and little benefits, female workers experience marginalization.|$|E

The impacts on business practices, in terms of obstacles and opportunities, are examined in a comparative case analysis, which demonstrates that suppliers need higher prices or long-term contracts to economically motivate implementation.

The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare and contrast, through a {{literature}} review, the compliance of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Republic of South Africa to the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILO). The minimum standards are established as the core <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> embodied in the eight fundamental conventions. The ROK and South Africa’s labour laws and labour practices are benchmarked against the ILO’s International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILS) in order to compare these practices and to establish if these <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum standards set by the ILO. The propositions stated are: that the ROK and South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> differ, that South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the ILO; and that ROK <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> do not comply with the minimum standards of the ILO. The propositions were verified. The ILO standards are described in order to identify the minimum rules set by the core <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> as embodied in the eight fundamental conventions. The two countries’ labour relations histories, labour laws, labour relations institutions and rule making strategies are described as part of the labour practices in these countries. The labour practices in each country are analysed and benchmarked against the ILO ILS in order to identify an inconsistency between law and practice. In South Africa, the Constitution includes all international laws when interpreting South African law. The only exceptions are when the Constitution or when an act of Parliament specifically excludes the contents of such a law. The conclusion is that South Africa complies with ILO ILS. In the ROK, the labour practices such as the right to the freedom of association and collective bargaining of non-permanent workers, as well as the exclusion of certain categories of workers are areas of concern...|$|R
