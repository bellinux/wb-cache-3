50|$|The {{engine was}} a <b>longitudinal</b> <b>rear</b> mounted V8 engine and not supercharged. The bore and the stroke travel were 77 mm and 71 mm respectively, {{bringing}} the total displacement to 2644.96 cc. The compression ratio was 9.8:1. The monobloc and head were manufactured in lightweight alloy. The maximum power delivered by the engine was 265 HP at 7,000 RPM.|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} the EC {{carriage}} {{is based on the}} {{design of the}} CC carriage documented in D- 0 Engineering Note 3740. 215 -EN- 14. The non-symmetric weight distribution of the EC cryostat results in uneven loading of the arms of the EC carriage. The design load on each <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> is 220, 000 lb, while each front arm supports 40, 000 lb. (The CC carriage design load was 200, 000 lb on all four arms.) ANSYS finite element models were made representing various combinations of plate thicknesses in an attempt to balance the deflections of the arms. In the final design a 3 / 4 -inch curved top plate is used with an additional 1. 75 -inch thick 'doubler plate' incorporated into the <b>rear</b> <b>arms.</b> The bottom flanges are 2 -inch and 3 / 4 -inch for the <b>rear</b> and front <b>arms,</b> respectively. Web plates are 3 / 4 -inch for all arms. The carriage bottom plate is 2 -inch thick, and other details are similar to the CC design...|$|R
5000|$|An unusual {{element in}} this design is a three-armed [...] "barrel-holding lever". It is pivoted above the trigger {{as shown in the}} drawing from page 188, Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947. Its bottom arm engages with the trigger. The forward arm holds the barrel forward for loading. The <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> serves as a hammer catch.|$|R

Numerous windows pierce the walls of the western wing.|$|R
50|$|Hudson {{automobiles}} {{were more}} fully equipped than competitive makes, and all Hudson models received door arm rests, twin air-horns, ashtrays, windshield wipers, stop lights, locking glove box, sealed beam headlights, and deep pile carpeting. Commodore and Commodore Customs added foam rubber seat cushions (Hudson {{was the first}} automaker to introduce foam seat cushions), door-step courtesy lights, <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rest (sedans) and gold etched lettering on the dash board panel.|$|R

50|$|Dampers were {{mounted to}} the chassis and axle through Silentbloc bushes at each end. Silentbloc bushes were another {{development}} of the early 1930s, a vulcanised rubber bush bonded into a steel tube. These provided the stiff location that accurate suspension required, but reduced vibration and road noise, compared to earlier cars. Many cars used a different design for front and rear, where the <b>rear</b> <b>arms</b> were rigidly bolted to the chassis, rather than with a swivelling bush.|$|R
50|$|The pankratiast faces his {{opponent}} with a nearly frontal stanceâ€”only slightly turned sideways. This is an intermediate directional positioning, between the wrestler's more frontal positioning and the boxer's more sideways stance and {{is consistent with}} the need to preserve both the option of using striking and protecting the center line of the body and the option of applying grappling techniques. Thus, {{the left side of the}} body is slightly forward of the right side of the body and the left hand is more forward than the right one. Both hands are held high so that the tips of the fingers are at the level of the hairline or just below the top of the head. The hands are partially open, the fingers are relaxed, and the palms are facing naturally forward, down, and slightly towards each other. The front arm is nearly fully extended but not entirely so; the <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> is more cambered than the front arm, but more extended than a modern-day boxer's <b>rear</b> <b>arm.</b> The back of the athlete is somewhat rounded, but not as much as a wrestler's would be. The body is only slightly leaning forward.|$|R

This trim was sold in Canada in the 2006/2007 model year, until it was replaced with the LX-SR and EX-L models.|$|R
50|$|The platter lift {{consists}} of an aerial steel rope loop running over a series of wheels, powered by an engine at one end. Hanging from the rope overhead are equally spaced vertical poles or cables attached to a plastic button or platter that is placed between the skiers legs and pulls the skier uphill. Snowboarders place the platter behind {{the top of their}} front leg or in front of their chest under their <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> and hold it in position with their hands.|$|R

50|$|The W114/W115 {{models were}} the first post-war Mercedes-Benz {{production}} car to use a newly engineered chassis, not derived from preceding models. The new chassis format of semi-trailing <b>rear</b> <b>arms</b> and ball-joint front end first displayed in the W114/W115 chassis would be used in all new Mercedes passenger car models until {{the development of the}} multi-link rear suspensions of the 1980s. The W108/109 S-Class chassis of the 280S/8, 280SE/8 and 300SEL/8 (and W113 280SL Pagoda) would be the last of the low-pivot swing axle and king pin/double wishbone front ends. The next S-Class -the W116 chassis- having the same engineering of the W114/115.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were three}} {{significant}} models {{on the same}} chassis, a 4-door six-light saloon, a 4-door tourer and a 2-door 4-seat tourer known as the Southern Cross. The front doors on the saloon were hinged at the front, while those at the back were hinged to the rear. A sliding sun roof was standard, operated by a rotating handle above the driver. Folding <b>rear</b> <b>arm</b> rests were fitted but do not appear on the prototype. The most noticeable differences between 1931 cars and the later models was a change to the radiator surround and different profiling of the front wings.|$|R
