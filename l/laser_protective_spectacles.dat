50|$|Prevention of ocular {{trauma is}} most {{effective}} when soldiers wear polycarbonate eye armor correctly in the battlefield. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Military have made Ballistic <b>Laser</b> <b>Protective</b> <b>Spectacles</b> (BLPS), Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), and Sun/Wind/Dust Goggles (SWDG) available to combatants and associated personnel. These forms of eye protection are available in non-prescription and prescription lenses, and their use has been made mandatory at all times when soldiers are in areas of potential conflict. Despite their proven record of protection against secondary blast trauma, soldier compliance remains low: 85% of soldiers afflicted ocular trauma {{in the first year}} of OEF were not wearing their protective lenses at the time of detonation. While 41% of soldiers could not recall whether or not they were wearing eye protection at the time of detonation, 17% of casualties were wearing eye protection while 26% of casualties were not. Among this group, the poorest visual prognoses were documented in individuals who did not wear eye protection. The lack of compliance has been attributed to complaints about comfort, stylishness, and “misting” of the lenses when in the field. BLPS and SPECS offer the same line of protection against secondary trauma as the SWD goggles, and these lenses may overcome the complaints many soldiers have with their military-issue goggles.|$|E

The UV and IR wavelengths cannot be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately. Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder {{to be able to}} look at the intensely glowing metal being welded. An approved face shield or welding helmet can also have filters for optical radiation protection, and offer additional protection against debris and sparks. UV blocking <b>protective</b> <b>spectacles</b> with side shields or welding goggles are considered primary protection, with the face shield or welding helmet considered secondary protection. This way, the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up.|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} of protective eyewear for military operations, conflicting constraints impact design considerations. Since protection is a key parameter, {{it is important to}} be able to quantify the impact of different levels of coverage of the visual field. The objective of this project was to merge two different techniques [...] (a) methodology to verify visual field coverage and (b) ray trace model for pupil accessibility [...] to produce a coverage metric to represent retinal accessibility to damage from lasers. Data were collected from nine subjects and a computer model was used to determine the proportion of incident rays that could access the pupil. Overall, the combined result provides an efficient methodology to assist when design trade-offs are required in the evaluation of <b>protective</b> <b>spectacles.</b> This technique can be used to quantify the amount of coverage and assign a conservative level of risk to the areas of the visual field that remain uncovered.

50|$|Scorpion uses a novel {{optical system}} {{featuring}} a light-guide optical element (LOE) {{which provides a}} compact color collimated image to the pilot. This allows the display to be positioned between the pilot's eyes and NVGs. The display can be positioned as the pilot wishes. Sophisticated software correction accommodates the display position, providing an accurate image to the pilot and allowing the Scorpion HMCS to be installed onto a pilot's existing helmet with no special fitting. A visor can be deployed {{in front of the}} display providing protection during ejection. The visor can be clear, glare, high contrast, gradient, or <b>laser</b> <b>protective.</b> An NVG mount can be installed in place of the visor during flight. Once installed, NVGs can be placed in front of the display, thus allowing the pilot to view both the display symbols as well as the NVG image simultaneously.|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to research on a new type <b>laser</b> <b>protective</b> material. Polycarbosilanes (PCS) /divinylbenzene mixtures containing ZrO 2 powders were brushed {{to the surface of the}} aluminum alloy plates and then cured at 150 °C for 6 h. The PCS-coated plates were ablated by laser for 3 s. The phase identification of as-ablated powders was examined by X-ray diffraction. The results indicated that the as-ablated powders of cured PCS were composed of major phase β-SiC and smaller amounts of free carbon. The PCS composite coating played a certain role of laser ablation resistance. The effect of added ZrO 2 powders on the pyrolysis of PCS-coating under laser ablation is conspicuous.

40|$|Research into lanthanide-doped organic–inorganic hybrid {{materials}} {{emerged in}} the 1990 s {{with the development of}} interesting materials for optics: high efficiency and stable solid-state lasers, new fiber amplifiers and sensors, devices with upconversion, fast photochromic and non-linear responses, etc. Their interest relies on the possibility of combining properties of sol–gel host materials (shaping, tunable refractive index and mechanical properties, corrosion protection, specific adhesion, etc.) and the well-known luminescence of lanthanide ions (Ln). The fast development of photonic hybrids allowed the commercial exploitation of products with new or enhanced characteristics (megajoule pulsed Nd-YAG <b>laser,</b> <b>protective</b> coatings of glasses, screens or glasswares). However, recently, Ln-hybrid nanocomposites have found new applications in bio-sensors, bio-analytics and even clinical imaging diagnostics. These applications make use of the fluorescence properties of lanthanides that make luminescent hybrids ideal candidates for time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays, DNA hybridation assays, fluorescence imaging microscopy, or in vivo imaging. As a consequence, the goal of this review is twofold: (i) as a reminder of some general considerations that {{must be taken into account}} to design new optically active Ln-doped nanocomposites whatever the application field, and (ii) to show the most important advances achieved in the past years in different areas, paying special attention to bio-medical application...|$|R

40|$|Here, {{we report}} {{the case of}} a patient who {{sustained}} Nd: YAG laser macular injury with subsequent 6 year follow-up evaluation. A 23 -year-old female was accidentally exposed to a Q-switched Nd: YAG <b>laser</b> without <b>protective</b> goggles. Upon initial evaluation, the best-corrected visual acuity of her affected eye was 20 / 100 OD. Fundoscopic examination revealed a macular laser burn and vitreous hemorrhage. Corticosteroids, in the form of 60 mg prednisolone, were administered orally with a 10 mg per week taper. Nineteen days following exposure, fundoscopic examination revealed a distinct epiretinal membrane which resolved within six months. The best-corrected visual acuity of the affected eye remained 20 / 100 OD. This clinical course is similar to those of previously reported cases including vitreous hemorrhage and subsequent epiretinal membrane formation. However, visual acuity did not recover despite spontaneous regression of the epiretinal membrane and at 6 year follow-up, there was neither choroidal neovascularization nor macular hole formation...|$|R

40|$|Brittle cornea {{syndrome}} (BCS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterised by extreme corneal thinning and fragility. Corneal rupture can therefore occur either spontaneously or following minimal trauma in affected patients. Two genes, ZNF 469 and PRDM 5, {{have now been}} identified, in which causative pathogenic mutations collectively account for the condition in nearly all patients with BCS ascertained to date. Therefore, effective molecular diagnosis is now available for affected patients, and those {{at risk of being}} heterozygous carriers for BCS. We have previously identified mutations in ZNF 469 in 14 families (in addition to 6 reported by others in the literature), and in PRDM 5 in 8 families (with 1 further family now published by others). Clinical features include extreme corneal thinning with rupture, high myopia, blue sclerae, deafness of mixed aetiology with hypercompliant tympanic membranes, and variable skeletal manifestations. Corneal rupture may be the presenting feature of BCS, and it is possible that this may be incorrectly attributed to non-accidental injury. Mainstays of management include the prevention of ocular rupture by provision of <b>protective</b> polycarbonate <b>spectacles,</b> careful monitoring of visual and auditory function, and assessment for skeletal complications such as developmental dysplasia of the hip. Effective management depends upon appropriate identification of affected individuals, which may be challenging given the phenotypic overlap of BCS with other connective tissue disorders...|$|R
40|$|Dipcoating, wherein {{an object}} is {{withdrawn}} from a liquid bath, retaining {{a thin layer}} of liquid which then dries, is perhaps the simplest of coating techniques. SOLA Optical asked the MISG to investigate this process as a means of applying a <b>protective</b> coating to <b>spectacle</b> lenses. The theory, as proposed by the group, involves the 'lubrication' form of the equations of slow viscous flow. This yields an estimate of the wet coating thickness variation, which in turn depends on the liquid properties, the pull rate, and the lens curvature. When this thickness is reduced by the volatile fraction of the coating, predicted thicknesses are in rough agreement with reported values. Once applied, the liquid film drains downward and this effect is modelled numerically. An outline of a more complete model, allowing evaporation and drying, is also presented...|$|R
