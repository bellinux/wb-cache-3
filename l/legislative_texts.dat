5|$|Between 355 and 351BC, Demosthenes {{continued}} practising law privately {{while he}} was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines, two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In Against Timocrates and Against Aristocrates, he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as {{the importance of the}} navy, of alliances and of national honour, are prosecutions (graphē paranómōn) against individuals accused of illegally proposing <b>legislative</b> <b>texts.</b>|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{period of}} {{canonical}} history {{is that of}} the present day, initiated by the promulgation of the 1917 Code of Canon Law on 27 May 1917. It is sometimes referred to as the Jus Codicis ("law of the code") or, in comparison with all law before it, the Jus Novum ("new law"). From time to time, the Pontifical Council for <b>Legislative</b> <b>Texts</b> issues authentic interpretations regarding the code. The pope occasionally amends the text of the codes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} address the problem of the 'resource {{consumption}} bottleneck' of creating (legal) semantic technologies manually. It builds on research in legal theory, ontologies and natural language processing in order to semi-automatically normalise <b>legislative</b> <b>text,</b> extract definitions and structured norms, and link normative provisions to recitals. The output is intended to help make laws more accessible, understandable, and searchable in a legal document management system. Key contributions are: - an analysis of legislation and structured norms in legal ontologies and compliance systems in order to determine the kind of information that individuals and organisations require from legislation to understand their rights and duties; - an analysis of the semantic and structural challenges of <b>legislative</b> <b>text</b> for machine understanding; - a rule-based normalisation module to transform <b>legislative</b> <b>text</b> into regular sentences to facilitate natural language processing; - a Semantic Role Labeling based information extraction module to extract definitions and norms from legislation and represent them as structured norms in legal ontologies; - an analysis of the impact of recitals on the interpretation of legislative norms; - a Cosine Similarity based text similarity module to link recitals to relevant normative provisions; - a description of important challenges that have emerged from this research which may prove useful for future work in the extraction and linking of information from <b>legislative</b> <b>text...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Pontifical Council for <b>Legislative</b> <b>Texts</b> {{issued on}} 24 June 2000 a {{declaration}} {{on the application}} of canon 915 of the Code of Canon Law to divorced Catholics who have civilly remarried. Even if such people, while being unable for serious reasons, such as the upbringing of children, to separate, live in full continence, their publicly known objective situation as divorced and remarried Catholics excludes them from receiving Eucharistic Communion. Public denial of Communion must be avoided and so the reasons for exclusion must be explained to them, but if such precautionary measures fail to obtain the desired effect or are impossible, Communion {{is not to be}} given to them.|$|E

2500|$|Besides the Pope, who has plenary {{legislative}} power, {{there are}} several other legislative authorities in the Roman Catholic Church with varying degrees of particular legislative power. [...] Primary examples are diocesan bishops and their equivalents, episcopal conferences, and particular councils. [...] Any of these legislators can issue authentic interpretations of their laws and their predecessor's laws. Legislators also can entrust the power to authentically interpret their own laws to someone else. [...] For the 1983 Code of Canon Law, the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, and other papal laws, the pope has delegated the authority to issue authentic interpretations to the Pontifical Council for <b>Legislative</b> <b>Texts.</b> [...] The following table contains the authentic interpretations issued by that dicastery (with Pontifical approval).|$|E
2500|$|The Pontifical Council for <b>Legislative</b> <b>Texts</b> is a dicastery of the Roman Curia. Its work [...] "consists {{mainly in}} {{interpreting}} {{the laws of the}} Church". (Pastor Bonus, 154). It is distinct from the highest tribunal, or court, in the Church (aside from the Pope), which is the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, and does not have law-making authority, to the degree the Pope and the Holy See's tribunals do, beyond the charge to interpret already-existing canon laws, though it works closely with the Signatura and the other Tribunals and the Pope. Like the Signatura and the other two final appellate Tribunals, the Roman Rota and the Apostolic Penitentiary, it is led by a prefect who is at least a Bishop.|$|E
