5|$|Agârbiceanu {{recalled}} {{an idyllic}} childhood, with summers spent tending to his father's sheep and {{sleeping in a}} stick hut. An avid reader of stories by Petre Ispirescu, he attended school in his native village and in Blaj, graduating from the Superior Gymnasium in 1900. <b>Literary</b> historians describe this as the period of his <b>literary</b> debut, which was a collaboration with Unirea newspaper. There, Agârbiceanu published a feuilleton (signed as Alfius), poetry, and, in 1900, the short story În postul Paștelui ("At Lent"). Agârbiceanu also served {{as secretary of the}} Blaj <b>Literary</b> Society, at the time the city's only Romanian-speaking <b>literary</b> body still tolerated by the Hungarian authorities. He soon became a correspondent of Răvașul, a Cluj-based newspaper, signing his first pieces there with the pen name Alfius, then as Agarbi or Potcoavă ("Horseshoe").|$|E
5|$|Along with Tarnovo, {{during the}} rule of Ivan Sratsimir Vidin emerged as a major <b>literary</b> center, under the strong {{influence}} of the Tarnovo <b>Literary</b> School. Some of the works that have survived from that period include the Tetraevangelia of the Metropolitan Danail and the Vidin collection from 1360, ordered by Empress Anna, which contains the hagiographies of thirteen Orthodox saints and {{a description of the}} holy sites in Jerusalem. Joasaph of Bdin, who was elected Archbishop of Vidin in 1392 wrote Praising epistle for the movement of St Philotea relics from Tarnovo to Vidin which contained all features of the Tarnovo <b>Literary</b> School. Joasaph also demonstrated great respect to Patriarch Evtimiy of Tarnovo, the most prominent figure in the Bulgarian cultural and <b>literary</b> life {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E

5|$|During Simeon's reign, Bulgaria {{reached its}} {{cultural}} apogee, becoming the <b>literary</b> and spiritual centre of Slavic Europe. In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It {{was in the}} Preslav <b>Literary</b> School and Ohrid <b>Literary</b> School, founded under Boris, that the main <b>literary</b> work in Bulgaria was concentrated {{during the reign of}} Simeon in the new Cyrillic alphabet which was developed there.|$|E
5|$|During the war, the {{contents}} of the society's library were plundered by Union Army forces, and many of its 3,000 volumes were either scattered or destroyed. After a reorganization in 1869, the society commenced construction of the present <b>Literary</b> Hall in downtown Romney. It transferred ownership of its Romney Classical Institute campus to the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in 1870 and in that year completed <b>Literary</b> Hall, where the society reconstituted its library collection and revived its <b>literary</b> activities.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of <b>Literary</b> Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor of}} the building as a meeting space, while the Romney <b>Literary</b> Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized <b>Literary</b> Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney <b>Literary</b> Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased <b>Literary</b> Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase of <b>Literary</b> Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. <b>Literary</b> Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1819, the Romney <b>Literary</b> Society was {{the first}} <b>literary</b> {{organization}} {{of its kind in}} the present-day state of West Virginia, and one of the first in the United States. In 1846, the society constructed a building which housed the Romney Classical Institute and its library. The Romney <b>Literary</b> Society and the Romney Classical Institute both flourished and continued to grow in importance and influence until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861.|$|E
5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for two reasons. Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in <b>literary</b> sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure occurs in a contemporary <b>literary</b> text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant <b>literary</b> source. In some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing <b>literary</b> evidence.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo (4 March 1901 or 1903– 22 June 1937), born Joseph-Casimir Rabearivelo, {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be Africa's first modern poet and the greatest <b>literary</b> artist of Madagascar. Part {{of the first generation}} raised under French colonization, Rabearivelo grew up impoverished and failed to complete secondary education. His passion for French literature and traditional Malagasy poetry prompted him to read extensively and educate himself on a variety of subjects, including the French language and its poetic and prose traditions. He published his first poems as an adolescent in local <b>literary</b> reviews, soon obtaining employment at a publishing house where he worked as a proofreader and editor of its <b>literary</b> journals. He published numerous poetry anthologies in French and Malagasy, as well as <b>literary</b> critiques, an opera, and two novels.|$|E

5|$|The Romney <b>Literary</b> Society reorganized on May 15, 1869. Following the reorganization, {{the society}} built <b>Literary</b> Hall between 1869 and 1870 while also {{undertaking}} an initiative {{to bring the}} West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind to its old Romney Classical Institute campus. The construction of <b>Literary</b> Hall {{was part of the}} society's effort to revive the organization and reassemble its original library. The society set about recovering original volumes and purchasing new ones, and the library reopened with 700 volumes. For a period of ten years between 1870 and 1880, much of Romney's intellectual life centered on <b>Literary</b> Hall. As older members died, interest in the society began to dwindle. The society's meetings were held less frequently, and its last recorded meeting was held on February 15, 1886.|$|E

5|$|The first section, {{entitled}} Definitions and Distinctions, {{consists of}} five chapters and details how Wellek and Warren define literature. This section also contrasts Wellek and Warren's definition {{with those of}} others, such views of literature as everything in print and as only belles-lettres (accepted <b>literary</b> canon). They define <b>literary</b> scholarship as beyond the personal ("super-personal") and contrasted with the <b>literary</b> arts by its more scientific approach. Wellek and Warren suggest that neither a purely objective nor a purely subjective approach {{would be able to}} properly describe literature. They note that <b>literary</b> scholarship should not only examine what makes a work or author unique, but also its general characteristics that allow it to be compared to other works.|$|E
