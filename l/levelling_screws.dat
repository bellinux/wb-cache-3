This review aims to evaluate the effect of transpedicular fixation in traumatic fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. A systematic search on controlled, randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing different methods of surgical treatment of this fractures was performed, followed by a process of article selection, data extraction and bias assessment by 3 independent authors. Eight articles were included {{in a total of}} 5 comparisons, between different transpedicular fixation techniques. No significant differences on function or quality of life, neurologic status or limitation of motion were found. Only instrumentation with fracture <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> incorporation showed significant decrease of pain when compared with instrumentation alone. Several techniques resulted in significant improvements of different radiological parameters. Significantly, surgeries with smaller duration were associated with lesser blood loss. Bone graft use caused a significant raise in post-operative complications, namely donor site pain. So, this paper showed that significative improvements in radiological parameters do not associate with correspondent clinical benefits, and only instrumentation with <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> incorporation is associated with a clear benefit on pain. Moreover, the need for bone graft is questioned, since it leads to no clinic-radiological improvement with a raise of complications.

By this technique {{it is possible to}} manufacture patient specific drill guide templates that enable optimal pedicle screw placement. In the last decade, many studies have featured relatively successful implantations of pedicle screws through the use of drill guide templates, though mostly on cadavers. We performed a similar clinical study involving the manufacture of templates for the lumbar and sacral regions that enable simultaneous multiple- <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> implanting. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed in 15 patients. In the lumbar and sacral spine 30 screws were implanted using drill guide template and 36 screws using free hand technique under fluoroscopy supervision.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: With {{the use of}} each {{pedicle screw}} for {{surgical}} correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), there {{is an increase in}} instrumentation-related costs, operative time, risk of neural injury, and overall health-care expenses. As such, alternate <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> strategy (ALSS) has been reported as a potential alternative to contiguous multilevel screw strategy (CMSS). Moreover, studies have shown the importance in accounting for the flexibility of the curve based on the fulcrum bending radiograph when assessing postoperative curve correction. Therefore, this study addressed a radiographic and cost analysis comparing CMSS with ALSS for the treatment of thoracic AIS with titanium screws and rod application. METHODS: 77 patients with AIS underwent surgery (range 6 - 15 levels). 35 patients received CMSS, which was characterised as bilateral screw fixation at every level. 42 patients underwent ALSS, which entailed bilateral screw fixation at alternate levels. Titanium rods were used in all cases. Preoperative and postoperative posteroanterior and fulcrum bending radiographic Cobb angles were obtained for all patients. The fulcrum flexibility and the fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) were assessed. Cost analysis was also done. RESULTS: We recorded a statistically significant difference between screw strategy-type to that of preoperative and postoperative Cobb angles, and postoperative curve correction (p 0 ∙ 05). The mean FBCIs of the CMSS and ALSS were 126 ∙ 1 % and 122 ∙ 1 %, respectively, and did not differ significantly (p= 0 ∙ 734).

It’s unknown if preoperative flexibility affects maintenance of correction in alternative <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> strategy (ALSS) until biologic stability. METHODS: A prospective study of 49 thoracic AIS-ALSS patients (mean age: 14. 5 -years; 86 % females) was preformed. Radiographic parameters were noted on Fulcum Bending Radiograph (FBR) and standing coronal/sagittal films preoperatively, immediate postoperative and at two-year follow-up. Flexibility, curve correction rate, and fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) were calculated. RESULTS: The mean preoperative coronal Cobb’s angles were 58. 3 ° on standing x-ray and 21. 9 ° on FBR (mean FBR flexibility 63. 2 %). The mean curve correction was 15. 2 ° at immediate postoperative (correction rate: 74. 1 %; FBCI: 123. 4 %), and maintained at 18. 3 ° at 2 -year follow-up (correction rate: 68. 4 %; FBCI: 112. 5 %). 61 % of the patients had insignificant change (< 5 °) in coronal alignment (mean change: 1. 1 °), while the remaining had a mean change of 6. 8 °. The trunk list did not change significantly (p= 0. 368), whereas trunk shift improved on last follow-up (p< 0. 0001). No clinically significant changes were noted in the sagittal profile. While curve flexibility did not predict loss of correction, skeletally mature patients had a 6 -fold higher risk of losing curve correction (95 % CI: 1. 3 - 27. 3). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated satisfactory maintenance of curve correction by low implant density constructs, such as the ALSS. However, skeletal maturity seemed to affect the correction attained.

40|$|Scientific Program: Paper no. 55 Summary: The study {{addressed}} the radiographic, clinical and cost-analysis of three pedicle screw strategy techniques {{for the treatment}} of AIS. The study noted that pedicle screw strategy techniques utilizing non-contiguous multilevel screw fixation (CMSS) maintain an FBCI greater than 100 %, are cost-effective, and provide similar clinical outcomes as CMSS. Introduction: Studies have demonstrated that taking into account curve flexibility based on the fulcrum bending radiograph in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is imperative to best assess curve correction following surgery. We present the prospective radiographic, clinical, and cost comparisons of three pedicle screw fixation strategies in the treatment of thoracic AIS while accounting for curve flexibility. Methods: Ninety-four AIS patients were prospectively assessed. Seventeen patients had key-vertebral screw strategy (KVSS), 42 had alternate <b>level</b> <b>screw</b> strategy (ALSS), and 35 received contiguous multilevel screw strategy (CMSS). Titanium rods were utilized in the KVSS and ALSS cases, whereas stainless-steel rods were applied in patients with CMSS. Pre- and postoperative postero-anterior and fulcrum bending radiographic Cobb angles were obtained. The fulcrum flexibility and the fulcrum bending correction index (FBCI) were assessed. Final follow-up SRS- 22 Questionnaire were assessed. Instrumentation cost analyses was conducted of all three strategies. Results: The FBCIs of the KVSS, ALSS, and the CMSS were 119 %, 122 %, and 152 %, respectively (p 0. 05). In comparison to the CMSS, the KVSS and ALSS were associated with pedicle screw cost reductions of 41. 7 - 73. 1 % and 33. 3 - 46. 2 %, respectively. Conclusion: Although the CMSS may provide an increased amount of FBCI, the KVSS and ALSS utilizing less pedicle screws for the surgical treatment of AIS are safe, cost-effective, and achieve an FBCI greater than 100 % in the majority of cases while achieving similar clinical outcomes. In AIS patients with flexible thoracic curves, the KVSS and ALSS are viable alternatives to CMSS. In addition, one should remain cognizant that variation in instrumentation (e. g. stainless steel rods vs. titanium rods) may affect the degree of FBCI. Significance: In comparison to the CMSS, ALSS and KVSS utilize less pedicle screws while maintaining an FBCI greater than 100 %, are cost-effective, and provide similar clinical outcomes. In particular, in AIS patients with flexible thoracic curves, the KVSS and ALSS are viable alternatives to CMSS.

The displacement error of the accuracy assessment points {{was found to be}} +/− 0.015 mm.|$|R
30|$|Although {{not a true}} post-surgical complication, it is {{important}} to identify hardware misplacement and any deviations from the normal postoperative course. Implant malposition can result in spinal instability and postsurgical malalignment. Knowledge of the surgical approach (anterior, posterior, lateral, or caudal) is critical to interpretation of postoperative spines [13]. Transitional lumbosacral vertebral bodies can result in inaccurate identification of the pathologic level, necessitating correlation between radiological and surgical level labelling. Use of software spinal level labelling saved to picture archiving and communication system (PACS) images allows for correlation between the reported pathologic level and patients’ anatomy. The most common hardware placement complication is not placing hardware at the wrong <b>level,</b> but misangulated <b>screw</b> positioning and depth at the correct level.|$|R
