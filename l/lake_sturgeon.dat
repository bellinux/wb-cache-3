The Wisconsin Fisheries Commission noted a reduction of roughly 25% in general fish harvests by 1875. The states have removed dams from rivers where necessary.|$|E

25|$|The {{burrowing}} owl (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) is an endangered species. They inhabit holes created by other {{animals such as}} Richardson's ground squirrel (gopher), prairie dog, fox, coyote, and badger. Their decline is due to habitat loss due to agricultural, residential and highway lands, and pesticide spraying. Another endangered species, the swift fox (Vulpes velox), has been bred in captivity and re-introduced into protected habitat areas. <b>Lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is a Species at Risk in the prairie provinces.|$|E
25|$|Most {{species are}} at least {{partially}} anadromous, spawning in fresh water and feeding in nutrient-rich, brackish waters of estuaries or undergoing significant migrations along coastlines. However, some species have evolved purely freshwater existences, such as the <b>lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser fulvescens) and the Baikal sturgeon (A. baerii baicalensis), or have been forced into them by anthropogenic or natural impoundment of their native rivers, {{as in the case}} of some subpopulations of white sturgeon (A. transmontanus) in the Columbia River and Siberian sturgeon (A. baerii) in the Ob basin.|$|E

[...] Since 2000, the TNACI has participated in the Tennessee River <b>Lake</b> <b>Sturgeon</b> Working Group, a program to restore the <b>lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> to the Tennessee River Basin. [...] In order to reestablish a self-sustaining population of sturgeon, which were declared extinct in the Tennessee River in 1961, the TNACI collects eggs from populations in the Great Lakes, hatches them in Georgia, and raises them at the Tennessee Aquarium until they are large enough to be released into the river. [...] More than 180,000 sturgeon have been released as of October 2015, and sightings have been reported {{along the length of the}} Tennessee River between Knoxville, Tennessee, and Kentucky Lake. [...] Some fish have been implanted with tracking devices, providing an additional means of monitoring the population; the trackers include acoustical devices detectable by receivers, including a mobile receiver aboard the River Gorge Explorer.

2500|$|Like {{the other}} Great Lakes, Lake Ontario {{used to have}} an {{important}} commercial fishery. It has been largely destroyed, mostly by over-fishing. [...] Consider the <b>Lake</b> <b>Sturgeon</b> as but one example. <b>Lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> are huge fish—they can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190kg in weight. [...] The females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity. It was once an abundant species in Lake Ontario. [...] "In 1860, this species, taken on incidental catches of other fishes, was killed and dumped back in the lake, piled up on shore to dry and be burned, fed to pigs, or dug into the earth as fertilizer." [...] It was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats. [...] Once its value was realized, [...] "They were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets, poundnets and gillnets." [...] Over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining Lake Erie in a single year. The fishery collapsed, largely by 1900. They have never recovered. Like most sturgeons, the <b>lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> is rare now, and is protected in many areas. Populations in the Oswego River are being actively managed for recovery.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{completion}} of fish ladders {{on the lowest}} five mainstem dams in 1992 allowed salmonine passage as far as Twin Branch Dam in Mishawaka, Indiana, 94% of the fish that pass are salmon and trout, as the ladders were not designed to permit passage of migrating native fish. Historically, the migrating native species included <b>lake</b> <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser fulvescens), bass (smallmouth and largemouth), redhorse (silver, golden, shorthead, river, and greater) (Moxostoma ssp.), walleye (Sander vitreus), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), northern pike (Esox lucius) and American pickerel (E. americanus vermiculatus).
