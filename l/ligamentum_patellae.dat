5000|$|It is a plexus of fine nerves {{situated}} {{in front of}} the patella, the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae</b> and {{the upper end of the}} tibia. It is formed by contribution from the following: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{superficial}} plexus {{is situated}} between the fascia and skin around about the patella, and forms three well-defined arches: one, above the upper {{border of the}} patella, in the loose connective tissue over the Quadriceps femoris; the other two, {{below the level of}} the patella, are situated in the fat behind the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellæ.</b>|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} tubercle of the tibia, a leg bone {{which is more}} {{commonly known as the}} shinbone or shankbone, is the tibial tuberosity. The tibial tuberosity is located on the tibia's anterior surface, distal to the medial condyle. It creates a bony prominence just below the patella, and can be easily located with the fingers. It creates an attachment point for the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae,</b> or patellar ligament. Other tubercles of the tibia include the medial intercondylar tubercle, the lateral intercondylar tubercle, and Gerdy's tubercle.|$|E
30|$|According to Biau et al. [17], about 4 out of 10 {{patients}} recovered completely after ACL reconstruction; {{the percentages}} of a normal International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score in the patients who underwent an operation with a semitendinosus or a <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae</b> graft were 33 and 41 %, respectively. This fact could be possibly explained {{by the loss of}} the important role that native ACL plays in proprioception, due to the sensory nerve fibers which it contains [18, 19].|$|E
40|$|Limb salvage in tumor surgery has {{encouraged}} {{the development of}} megaprostheses. However, reattaching the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae</b> poses a particular problem: avulsion and/or extensor lag may lead to poor function. We describe a new technique of patellar ligament reconstruction. The technique involves reattachment of the patellar ligament to the tibial tuberosity of the proximal tibial megaprosthesis, which has a porous surface created, and the repair is protected with a cerclage wire through the patella and the prosthesis. In 10 consecutive patients, the range of motion averaged 95 ° (median, 90 °; range, 70 °– 120 °), and the mean extension lag averaged 4 ° (median, 0 °; range, 0 °– 20 °). We had one case of patellar ligament avulsion. This technique resulted in good quadriceps function and a low incidence of complications...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{analyzed}} outcome during the early rehabilitation period phase following two different methods of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction: <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae</b> (LP) and semitendonosus/gracilis tendon (SG) based reconstruction. This study included 40 patients treated by each method, examined 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Patients in the SG group showed significantly better Lysholm scores at 6 and 12 months, Tegner Activity Scale scores at 3 months, and pain profile assessments at 6 weeks and 3 months {{than those in the}} LP group. Significant differences were observed in LP group in range-of-motion at 6 weeks and 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Stability tests revealed no significant differences between patients in the two groups. SG-based reconstruction of the ACL thus demonstrated advantages over LP-based reconstruction regarding pain and function, while LP-based reconstruction was associated with an earlier return of motion...|$|E
30|$|The knee {{region was}} shaved and aseptically cleaned with an {{appropriate}} disinfection agent. The rabbits {{were covered with}} a sterile foil to keep them warm during surgery. Arthrotomy of the femorotibial joint was performed under aseptic conditions by an incision of the skin over the <b>ligamentum</b> <b>patellae</b> and an incision of the knee capsule. After dislocating the patella laterally, a chondral defect using a cordless screwdriver was drilled {{in the center of}} the trochlea. The defect was 4  mm in diameter, maximum 5  mm in depth and about 5  mm in the distance to the proximal trochlear ridge. Immediately after drilling the defect was rinsed with isotonic saline (0.9 %). Then the HA gel was pipetted into the defect and let to polymerize for 3  min. For the animals of group 3 the lyophilized 1.5 % hyaluronan thiomer matrix was placed into the chondral defect before it was filled up with HA gel. The defect of the untreated rabbits was rinsed before the knee capsule, and the skin region was sutured. The same closing procedure was performed in the treated rabbits. Aluminum Spray was used for wound closure. 30  min after surgery pain relief was reached by administrating Atipamezole (1.0  mg/kg b.w., i.m., Revertor®) to the animals.|$|E
