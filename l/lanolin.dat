5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with <b>lanolin</b> or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{consists}} of a waxy colloidal emulsion, a substance composed {{of a number of}} partially immiscible liquids and solids mixed together. It is usually made from ingredients including some or all of naphtha, <b>lanolin,</b> turpentine, wax (often Carnauba wax), gum arabic, ethylene glycol, and if required a colourant, such as carbon black or an azo dye (such as aniline yellow). It typically has a specific gravity of 0.8, is negligibly soluble in water, and is made of between 65 and 77% volatile substances—usually naphtha. The high amount of volatile substances means that the shoe polish will dry out and harden after application, while retaining its shine.|$|E
5|$|Among the locally {{produced}} yarns for Navajo textile, indiscriminate breeding from 1870-1890 {{caused a}} steady decline in wool quality. Increasing proportions of brittle kemp {{can be found}} in well-preserved examples from the period. In 1903, federal agents attempted to address the problem by introducing Rambouillet rams into the breeding population. The Rambouillet is a French breed that produces good meat and heavy, fine-wool fleeces. The Rambouillet stock were well adapted to the Southwestern climate, but their wool was less suitable to hand spinning. Short-stapled Rambouillet wool has a tight crimp, which makes hand spinning difficult. The higher <b>lanolin</b> content of its wool necessitated significantly more scouring with scarce water before it could be dyed effectively. From 1920 to 1940, when Rambouillet bloodlines dominated the tribe's stock, Navajo rugs have a characteristically curly wool and sometimes a knotted or lumpy appearance.|$|E
25|$|Handspinners are split, when {{spinning}} wool, as {{to whether}} it is better to spin it 'in the grease' (with <b>lanolin</b> still in) or after it has been washed. More traditional spinners are more willing to spin in the grease, as it is less work to wash the wool after it is in yarn form. Spinners who spin very fine yarn may also prefer to spin in the grease as it can allow them to spin finer yarns with more ease. Spinning in the grease covers the spinner's hands in <b>lanolin</b> and, thus, softens the spinner's hands.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is {{produced}} industrially by exposing 7-dehydrocholesterol to UVB light, followed by purification. The 7-dehydrocholesterol {{is a natural}} substance in fish organs, especially the liver, or in wool grease (<b>lanolin)</b> from sheep. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) {{is produced}} {{in a similar way}} using ergosterol from yeast or mushrooms as a starting material.|$|E
25|$|Spinning in {{the grease}} works best if the fleece is newly sheared. After several months, the <b>lanolin</b> becomes sticky, {{which makes the}} wool harder to spin using the short-draw technique, and almost {{impossible}} to spin using the long-draw technique. In general, spinners who use the long-draw technique do not spin in the grease.|$|E
25|$|Wool may be spun {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of <b>lanolin</b> may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause felting. When done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap.|$|E
25|$|The Aran jumper (Irish: Geansaí Árann) is a {{style of}} jumper that {{takes its name from}} the Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. A {{traditional}} Aran Jumper usually is off-white in colour, with cable patterns on the body and sleeves. Originally the jumpers were knitted using unscoured wool that retained its natural oils (<b>lanolin)</b> which made the garments water-resistant and meant they remained wearable even when wet.|$|E
25|$|<b>Lanolin</b> from sheep's wool {{is found}} in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common {{ingredient}} in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is {{synthesized}} {{in the skin}} after exposure to the sun, or consumed {{in the form of}} animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from <b>lanolin</b> in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.|$|E
500|$|In general, the fleece is light, soft, springy and open, {{with little}} <b>lanolin</b> (grease); {{there may be}} some kemp. In some sheep (particularly British Jacobs, which have denser fleeces), the black wool grows longer or shorter than the white wool. This is called [...] "quilted fleece", and is an {{undesirable}} trait.|$|E
500|$|<b>Lanolin,</b> a {{hydrophobic}} grease from wool-bearing {{animals such as}} sheep or goats, acts as both a waterproofing wax and a bonding agent, {{giving the}} shoe polish its greasy feel and texture. It prevents the naphtha from evaporating until the polish has been spread and buffed into a thin film on the leather surface. [...] An essential ingredient in shoe polish is a thickener; without this, the polish would be too runny, {{making it difficult to}} use. Gum arabic, a substance from two sub-Saharan species of the acacia tree, is commonly used to increase the viscosity of the product.|$|E

Applying <b>lanolin</b> to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued. [...] "My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment" [...] he recorded, [...] "frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body". Averaging around 5miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.|$|E

In The Simpsons episode [...] "Four Great Women and a Manicure" [...] (2009), the Queen escapes the dwarves after poisoning Snow White, only to be lynched by a mob of angry woodland creatures. In the U.S. Acres two-part cartoon [...] "Snow Wade and the 77 Dwarves", <b>Lanolin</b> appears as the Wicked Queen with a costume is based off the Disney version. In the Family Guy 2009 episode [...] "Road to the Multiverse", Herbert appears as the disguised Queen. The Muppet Show character Miss Piggy is the Queen in the 2010 parody comic book miniseries Muppet Snow White. Cassie Scerbo played the Evil Queen in the 2013 YouTube parody music video Cell Block Tango. The Queen also appears in Counting Scars, Oh My Disney's Halloween 2014 parody music video of OneRepublic's [...] "Counting Stars".|$|E
2500|$|... 9,10-Anthraquinone {{is used as}} a bird {{repellant}} on seeds, and as a {{gas generator}} in satellite balloons. It has also been mixed with <b>lanolin</b> and used as a wool spray to protect sheep flocks against kea attacks in New Zealand.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, an Aran jumper is {{made from}} undyed cream-coloured báinín (pronounced [...] "bawneen"), a yarn made from sheep's wool, {{sometimes}} [...] "black-sheep" [...] wool. They were originally made with unwashed wool that still contained natural sheep <b>lanolin,</b> making the garment water-repellent.|$|E
2500|$|The lack of hair {{leads to}} a {{reputation}} for being clean, for being easy to wash with a sponge, and for a natural lack of fleas or other parasites. They also do not cause typical allergic reactions to dog-sensitive humans because they lack the normal dog dander. [...] Despite this, the dog needs care, but in another way. The skin should be washed {{from time to time to}} remove dirt and prevent clogging of pores. Baby cleaners are a good choice provided that they do not contain <b>lanolin.</b> Some dogs are prone to have acne or at least blackheads. The skin sometimes becomes too dry and can then be treated with moisturizing cream. Again, baby lotion without <b>lanolin</b> is a good product choice to soften and moisturize cleansed skin. [...] The dogs themselves seem to prefer olive, vegetable or coconut oil, possibly because of the perfumes and other chemicals found in commercial moisturizing creams.|$|E
2500|$|Warmth: [...] In woollen garments, {{air pockets}} are created between the fibers that reduce {{the rate of}} heat transfer. This {{property}} combined with <b>Lanolin</b> (a hydrophobic grease present in wool fibers) allowing wool to keep you warm when wet. Yak wool is rich in Myristic acid, a type of hydrophobic fatty acid. Independently conducted tests on yak down suggest that it is warmer than Merino wool. Nonetheless, claims vary on how much warmer it is with values ranging between 10-40%.|$|E
2500|$|Such spinners {{generally}} {{buy their}} fibres pre-washed and carded, {{in the form}} of roving, sliver, or batts. This means less work for the spinners, as {{they do not have to}} wash out the <b>lanolin.</b> Spinners then have available predyed fibre, or blends of fibres, which are hard to create when the wool is still in the grease. As machine carders cannot card wool in the grease, pre-carded yarn generally is not spun in the grease. Some spinners use spray-on lanolin-like products to get the same feel of spinning in the grease with carded fibre.|$|E
2500|$|Philosopher Gary Steiner {{argues that}} it is not {{possible}} to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are [...] "deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, <b>lanolin,</b> lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|Alpaca fleece is {{the natural}} fiber {{harvested}} from an alpaca. It is light or heavy in weight, depending on how it is spun. It is a soft, durable, luxurious [...] and silky natural fiber. While similar to sheep’s wool, it is warmer, not prickly, and has no <b>lanolin,</b> which makes it hypoallergenic. Alpaca is naturally water-repellent and difficult to ignite. Huacaya, an alpaca that grows soft spongy fiber, has natural crimp, thus making a naturally elastic yarn well-suited for knitting. Suri has no crimp and thus is a better fit for woven goods. The designer Armani has used Suri alpaca to fashion men's and women's suits. Alpaca fleece is made into various products, from very simple and inexpensive garments made by the indigenous communities to sophisticated, industrially made and expensive products such as suits. In the United States, groups of smaller alpaca breeders have banded together to create [...] "fiber co-ops," [...] to make the manufacture of alpaca fiber products less expensive.|$|E
50|$|A typical high purity {{grade of}} <b>lanolin</b> is {{composed}} predominantly of long chain waxy esters (approximately 97% by weight) the remainder being <b>lanolin</b> alcohols, <b>lanolin</b> acids and <b>lanolin</b> hydrocarbons.|$|E
50|$|An {{estimated}} 8,000 to 20,000 {{different types}} of <b>lanolin</b> esters are present in <b>lanolin,</b> resulting from combinations between the 200 or so different <b>lanolin</b> acids and the 100 or so different <b>lanolin</b> alcohols identified so far.|$|E
50|$|Hydrolysis of <b>lanolin</b> yields <b>lanolin</b> {{alcohols}} and <b>lanolin</b> acids. <b>Lanolin</b> alcohols are a {{rich source}} of cholesterol (an important skin lipid) and are powerful water-in-oil emulsifiers; they have been used extensively in skin care products for over 100 years. Notably, approximately 40% of the acids derived from <b>lanolin</b> are alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs). The use of AHAs in skin care products has attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in recent years. Details of the AHA’s isolated from <b>lanolin</b> can be seen in the table below.|$|E
50|$|Some {{very high}} purity grades of <b>lanolin</b> surpass {{monograph}} requirements. New products obtained using complex purification techniques produce <b>lanolin</b> esters {{in their natural}} state, removing oxidative and environmental impurities resulting in white, odourless, hypoallergenic <b>lanolin.</b> These ultra-high purity grades of <b>lanolin</b> are ideally suited {{to the treatment of}} dermatological disorders such as eczema and on open wounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lanolin</b> (from Latin lāna, ‘wool’, and oleum, ‘oil’), {{also called}} wool wax or wool grease, is a wax {{secreted}} by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. <b>Lanolin</b> used by humans comes from domestic sheep breeds that are raised specifically for their wool. Historically, many pharmacopoeias {{have referred to}} <b>lanolin</b> as wool fat (adeps lanae); however, as <b>lanolin</b> lacks glycerides (glycerol esters), {{it is not a}} true fat. <b>Lanolin</b> primarily consists of sterol esters instead. Lanolin's waterproofing property aids sheep in shedding water from their coats. Certain breeds of sheep produce large amounts of <b>lanolin.</b> There is an inverse correlation between fiber diameter and wool wax content.|$|E

5000|$|Acetylated <b>lanolin</b> alcohol, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "sheep alcohol", <b>lanolin</b> alcohol or wool alcohol, is a non-drying organic compound produced from <b>lanolin,</b> the fat of wool shearings, {{which has been}} reacted with acetic acid and {{a small amount of}} lye. There are synthetic variants available; however, the animal-derived product has more anti-allergenic tendencies. Acetylated <b>lanolin</b> alcohol is used as an emollient, to soften skin, but is mildly comedogenic, with a rating of 0-2 out of 5. For this reason, those who are prone to whiteheads and blackheads should patch test before using on a large scale. Acetylated <b>lanolin</b> alcohol can also be inflammatory to those with wool or <b>lanolin</b> allergies, and should be avoided in such cases.|$|E
50|$|The Loaghtan's wool {{has a high}} {{coating of}} <b>lanolin</b> wax, also known as wool wax or wool grease. Warm weather makes the <b>lanolin</b> viscous, which aids shearing. Some {{specialty}} soap producers also use the <b>lanolin</b> as an ingredient in a mild soap.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lanolin</b> is a {{relatively}} common allergen and is often misunderstood as a wool allergy. However, allergy to a lanolin-containing product is difficult to pinpoint and often other products containing <b>lanolin</b> may be fine for use. Patch testing can be done if a <b>lanolin</b> allergy is suspected.|$|E
50|$|Lanolin’s complex {{composition}} of long chain esters, hydroxy esters, diesters, <b>lanolin</b> alcohols, and <b>lanolin</b> acids means {{in addition to}} it being a valuable product in its own right, {{it is also the}} starting point for the production of a whole spectrum of <b>lanolin</b> derivatives, which possess wide-ranging chemical and physical properties. The main derivatisation routes include hydrolysis, fractional solvent crystallisation, esterification, hydrogenation, and alkoxylation and quaternisation. <b>Lanolin</b> derivatives obtained from these processes are used widely in both high-value cosmetics and skin treatment products.|$|E
5000|$|Skin {{bioengineering}} {{studies have}} shown the durational effect of the emollient (skin smoothing) action produced by <b>lanolin</b> is very significant and lasts for many hours. <b>Lanolin</b> applied to the skin at 2mg/cm2 {{has been shown to}} reduce roughness by about 35% after one hour and 50% after two hours, with the overall effect lasting for considerably more than eight hours. <b>Lanolin</b> is also known to form semiocclusive (breathable) films on the skin. [...] When applied daily at around 4mg/cm2 for five consecutive days, the positive moisturising effects of <b>lanolin</b> were detectable until 72 hours after final application. <b>Lanolin</b> may achieve some of its moisturising effects by forming a secondary moisture reservoir within the skin.|$|E
50|$|Anhydrous liquid <b>lanolin,</b> {{combined}} with parabens, {{has been used}} in trials as artificial tears to treat dry eye.Anhydrous <b>lanolin</b> is also used as a lubricant for brass instrument tuning slides.|$|E
50|$|The wool is cleaned. At {{this point}} the fleece is full of <b>lanolin</b> and often {{contains}} extraneous vegetable matter, such as sticks, twigs, burrs and straw. These may all be removed, though <b>lanolin</b> may {{be left in the}} wool till after the spinning, a technique known as spinning 'in the grease'. Indeed, if the fabric is to be water repellent, <b>lanolin</b> is not removed at any stage.|$|E
50|$|The European Cosmetics Directive, {{introduced}} in July 1976, contained a stipulation that cosmetics which contained <b>lanolin</b> should be labelled to that effect. This ruling was challenged immediately, {{and in the}} early 1980s, it was overturned and removed from the directive. Despite only being in force {{for a short period of}} time, this ruling did harm both to the <b>lanolin</b> industry and to the reputation of <b>lanolin</b> in general. The Cosmetics Directive ruling only applied to the presence of <b>lanolin</b> in cosmetic products; it did not apply to the many hundreds of its different uses in dermatological products designed for the treatment of compromised skin conditions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Lanolin</b> and {{its many}} {{derivatives}} are used extensively {{in both the}} personal care (e.g., high value cosmetics, facial cosmetics, lip products) and health care sectors such as topical liniments. <b>Lanolin</b> {{is also found in}} lubricants, rust-preventive coatings, shoe polish, and other commercial products.|$|E
