The difference between radial and tangential shrinkage also varies from species to species.

50|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of wax types used in the lost wax casting process. Generally they fall into three main types, soft, hard and {{injection}} waxes. Injection waxes are made and intended to be used for injecting wax under pressure into rubber or other types of molds.

Their properties more often target good injection properties: flow, <b>low</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> pot life etc.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between adhesives and sealants is that sealants typically have lower strength and higher elongation than adhesives do. When sealants are used between substrates having different thermal coefficients of expansion or differing elongation under stress, {{they need to}} have adequate flexibility and elongation. Sealants generally contain inert filler material and are usually formulated with an elastomer to give the required flexibility and elongation. They usually have a paste consistency to allow filling of gaps between substrates. <b>Low</b> <b>shrinkage</b> after application is often required. Many adhesive technologies can be formulated into sealants.|$|E
5000|$|The alloys have {{relatively}} low softening temperatures, allowing casting of complicated shapes without need for finishing. The material properties immediately after casting {{are much better}} than those of conventional metals; usually, cast metals have worse properties than forged or wrought ones. The alloys are also malleable at low temperatures ( [...] for the earliest formulation), and can be molded. The low free volume also results in <b>low</b> <b>shrinkage</b> during cooling. For all of these reasons, Liquidmetal can be formed into complex shapes using processes similar to thermoplastics, which makes Liquidmetal a potential replacement for many applications where plastics would normally be used.|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were, first, to measure {{shrinkage}} induced by different methods of pulse-delay light curing and, second, to verify their influence on the marginal adaptation of class V restorations in enamel and dentin. Eight groups, comprising seven groups (n = 6) with different pulse-delay parameters and a control group, were compared for dynamic linear displacement and force by using a fine hybrid composite. Based on these results, the pulse-delay curing procedure with the <b>lowest</b> <b>shrinkage</b> force was chosen and tested against the control group with respect to marginal adaptation in class V restorations (n = 8) before and after simultaneous thermal and mechanical loading.

50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{pressures}} and temperatures required to die cast semi-solid metal the die material {{does not need to}} be as exotic. Often graphite or softer stainless steels may be used. Even non-ferrous dies can be used for one time shots. Because of this the process can be applied to rapid prototyping needs and mass production. This also allows for the casting of high melting point metals, such as tool steel and stellite, if a higher temperature die material is used. Other advantages include: easily automated, consistent, production rates are equal to or better than die casting rates, no air entrapment, <b>low</b> <b>shrinkage</b> rates, and a uniform microstructure.|$|E
50|$|The {{stiletto}} hilt was {{die cast}} using zinc aluminium alloy, which exhibited the desirable characteristics of sharp casting, <b>low</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> low cost and above all, minimal use of strategic war-priority metals. However, over {{time it was}} discovered that the zinc ions in this alloy have a tendency to leach out, leaving the casting extremely brittle. As a result, {{more than half of the}} few Raider stilettos still in existence today have very fine hilt cracks or entire portions of the hilt missing with pieces having simply flaked off; many more have replacement handles. This decay can be delayed to some extent by coating the hilt with petroleum jelly.|$|E
5000|$|Amorphous metal {{is usually}} an alloy {{rather than a}} pure metal.

The tests included in this work were: 28 -day oven dry density, compressive strength, shrinkage strain, and creep strain in compression. The test period for shrinkage and creep was extended to 364 days. It was concluded that using higher Porcelinite to binder ratios had always negative effect on shrinkage of HPLC.

40|$|Due to its low water/cement ratio, {{high-strength}} concrete has a {{more pronounced}} early-age autogenous shrinkage.

We also measured the compressive strength of hardened concrete mixtures, and studied the influence of lightweight aggregate and steel fiber content on the compressive strength.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pore {{structure}} of concrete made with slag-blended cement on shrinkage behavior of concrete {{when exposed to}} drying were presented in this paper. The investigated parameters were the length of curing (1 -day and 7 -day curing), slag and gypsum contents in mixtures. Pore structure analysis was studied by conducting mercury intrusion porosimetry and nitrogen gas adsorption technique tests. The results show that 65 % slag concrete with 7 -day curing exhibited the <b>lowest</b> <b>shrinkage</b> evolution compared to 0, 35, 50 % slag mixes. This is attributed to the highest pore radius where meniscus forms when drying in these concretes. It was found that addition of gypsum in slag mixes tend to reduce the nanopores (within the range from 4 to 20 nm pore size) and decrease the proportion of mesopores. The higher proportion of mesopores and the lower value of meniscus pore radius could explain the increase in drying shrinkage of concrete made with 65 % slag cement containing 0 % added gypsum...|$|R

In this work, supercritical drying of alginate hydrogel beads is demonstrated to {{be a very}} effective process for aerogels production. The process involves solvent exchange followed by supercritical extraction, which prevents the gel from collapsing, while reproducing an aerogel nanostructure that exactly mimics the original hydrogel. Ethanol and acetone were used as water exchange solvents. Using ethanol, the bead spherical shape and nanostructure were most closely maintained when supercritical drying was performed at 150 bar and 38 °C. In addition, the diameter of the dehydrated beads only decreases by 0. 6 % compared to the hydrated hydrogels.

The samples were pulverized, sieved, digested with mineral acids and characterized. Results showed that the clays are mainly kaolinitic with only occasional illite, and quartz as the main subsidiary non-clay mineral. The high plasticity index of the clays corresponds to the more transported clays of the tertiary- to –recent environment.

Three light-curing resin composites (SDR bulk-fill, Esthet X flow, and Esthet X HD) and one dual-curing material (Rebilda DC) were subjected to different irradiation protocols with identical energy density (27 J cm− 2) : high-intensity continuous light (HIC), low-intensity continuous light (LIC), soft-start (SS), and pulse-delay curing (PD). Axial shrinkage and shrinkage force of 1. 5 -mm-thick specimens were recorded in real time for 15 min using custom-made devices. Knoop hardness was determined {{at the end of}} the observation period. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences among the curing protocols for both Knoop hardness and axial shrinkage, irrespective of the composite material. Pulse-delay curing generated the significantly <b>lowest</b> <b>shrinkage</b> forces within the three light-curing materials SDR bulk-fill, Esthet X flow, and Esthet X HD. High-intensity continuous light created the significantly highest shrinkage forces within Esthet X HD and Rebilda DC, and caused significantly higher forces than LIC within Esthet X flow. In conclusion, both the composite material and the applied curing protocol control shrinkage force formation.
