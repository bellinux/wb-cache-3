50|$|It is an {{aggressive}} fish, even {{when compared to}} many damselfish, and will often harass similarly sized fish.

Despite its hardy nature care should be taken when placing one with larger predatory fish such as <b>lion</b> <b>fish,</b> and grouper which may eat it. As an adult, however, its aggressive nature will often protect it from any fish that cannot fit it in its mouth.|$|E
