Watts informs Black that a Group member, Olson, has been tasked with {{monitoring}} Butler since her release. Watts and Black travel to Butler's <b>last</b> <b>known</b> <b>address</b> and find Olson's long-dead body. They realize Butler had been filing her own surveillance reports in Olson's name. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce {{in the past}} tense. He later discovers that in every school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs of promise.|$|E

Police were initially unsure if this event was related to bombs in Seaside Park, New Jersey and Manhattan that had exploded the previous day. On September 19, police arrested Ahmad Khan Rahami, a 28-year-old Afghan-born naturalized U.S. citizen, for questioning in connection with all three incidents; the FBI considered Rahami, whose <b>last</b> <b>known</b> <b>address</b> was within [...] of the train station, to be armed and dangerous.|$|E

Some commentators took the view that such logistical issues should not deprive Singaporeans of their [...] "sacred right to vote".|$|R
2500|$|Every year on 19 April, {{which is}} Holocaust Remembrance Day in Poland, pupils and {{citizens}} of Lublin {{are asked to}} send letters addressed to Henio Zytomirski at 11th Kowalska Street, the <b>last</b> <b>known</b> <b>address</b> of Henio in Lublin. Thousands of letters were sent to Henio, including paintings, personal letters and exciting stories of 12- to 13-year-old children. At {{the entrance to the}} PKO Bank, the place where Henio's last picture was taken, a special mailbox is placed every year for sending the letters to Henio. Lublin postal Authorities have to deal with full sacks of letters which are sent back to senders with the post seal: [...] "Unknown Addressee". Later in the day, participants follow a walking tour by foot and visit the addresses where Henio had lived at: 3 Szewska Street, 11 Kowalska Street (in the Ghetto). The walk ends with a silent prayer {{at the foot of a}} street lamp, which is the last remnant of the pre-war Jewish town of Lublin serving as a memorial candle. In 2007 the passengers by the bank were asked to write letters to Henio on the spot. The response was extraordinary. The national Polish press dedicates a lot of reportages to this project. Since 2005 Henio Zytomirski has become an icon of the Holocaust, not only in Lublin but all over Poland. Today his life story is a part of the curriculum which is learnt in the general education system in Poland. School newspapers tell about him and try to understand the meaning of the Holocaust through his short life story.|$|E

50|$|On 5 August 1982 David Martin {{was caught}} while {{breaking}} into a private cinema in Portman Close, in the West End of London; he was disguised {{as a security guard}} but he escaped by shooting his way out, severely wounding a police officer. A month later he was arrested at his <b>last</b> <b>known</b> home <b>address</b> in Crawford Place off Edgware Road, while disguised as a woman, but during a struggle drew two handguns before being shot in the neck by an armed police officer. On 24 December 1982 he escaped from a cell at Marlborough Street Magistrates' Court, and went into hiding. The police were convinced that a Susan Stephens whom Martin had met before his arrest, and who had visited him in prison, was his girlfriend, so she was kept under surveillance. Police suspicions were reinforced when Martin telephoned Stephens several times, and they met to go to the cinema, and later for a meal, in the following weeks.|$|R

In 38 of these unresolved cases, the USCA requested the MCA’s assistance to locate the children with the help of Mexican law enforcement authorities,including Interpol and Mexico’s federal investigations agency, the Agencia Federal de Investigación (AFI).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{ascertain}} {{the outcome of}} pre-Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and ART patients defaulting from care and investigate reasons for defaulting. METHODS: Patients defaulting from HIV care in Chiradzulu between July 2004 and September 2007 were traced at <b>last</b> <b>known</b> home <b>address.</b> Deaths and moves were recorded, and patients found alive were interviewed. Defaulting was defined as missed last appointment by more than 1 month among patients of unknown vital status. RESULTS: A total of 1637 individuals were traced (54 %- 88 % of eligible), 981 pre-ART and 656 ART patients. Of 694 pre-ART patients found, 49 % had died (51 % of adults and 38 % of children), a median of 47 days after defaulting, and 14 % had moved away. Of 451 ART patients found, 54 % had died (54 % of adults and 50 % of children), a median of 52 days after defaulting, and 20 % had moved away. Overall, 221 patients were interviewed (90 % of those found alive), 42 % had worked outside the district in the previous year; 49 % of pre-ART and 19 % of ART patients had not disclosed their HIV status to other household members. Main reasons for defaulting were stigma (43 %), care dissatisfaction (34 %), improved health (28 %) and for ART discontinuation, poor understanding of disease or treatment (56 %) and drug side effects (42 %). CONCLUSION: This study in a rural African HIV programme reveals the dynamics related to health service access and use, and it provides information to correct programme mortality estimates for adults and children...|$|R

25|$|Adjustment {{of status}} (AOS) – Adjustment of status is {{for when the}} {{immigrant}} is in the United States and entered the U.S. legally. Except for immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, the immigrant must also be in legal status {{at the time of}} applying for adjustment of status. For immediate relatives and other relative categories whose visa numbers are current, adjustment of status can be filed for at the same time with the petition (step 1 above). Adjustment of status is submitted to USCIS via form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status. The USCIS conducts a series of background checks (including fingerprinting for FBI criminal background check and name checks) and makes a decision on the application. Once the adjustment of status application is accepted, the alien is allowed to stay in the United States even if the original period of authorized stay on the Form I-94 is expired, but he/she is generally not allowed to leave the country until the application is approved, or the application will be abandoned. If the alien has to leave the United States during this time, he/she can apply for travel documents at the USCIS with form I-131, also called Advance parole. If there is a potential risk that the applicant's work permit (visa) will expire or become invalid (laid off by the employer and visa sponsor) or the applicant wants to start working in the United States, while he/she is waiting for the decision about his/her application to change status, he/she can file form I-765, to get Employment Authorization Documents (also called EAD) and be able to continue or start working legally in the United States. In some cases, the applicant will be interviewed at a USCIS office, especially if it is a marriage-based adjustment from a K-1 visa, in which case both spouses (the US citizen and the applicant) will be interviewed by the USCIS. If the application is approved, the alien becomes an LPR, and the actual green card is mailed to the alien's <b>last</b> <b>known</b> mailing <b>address.</b>|$|R
