40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the possibility of any indication of misuse of discretionary funds in the budget, and to obtain empirical evidence on the factors of budget capability and political motives that affect the proportion of these funds before the <b>local</b> <b>election</b> in 2015. The {{study was conducted in}} 143 districts/cities in Indonesia in 2015 which implement the <b>local</b> <b>election</b> simultaneously. The results using t-test showed that there was no different proportion of discretionary funds before and ahead of the <b>local</b> <b>election</b> in 2015. This implies that there is no indication of misuse of grant and social aid before the <b>local</b> <b>election</b> in 2015. The results of multiple regression analysis showed that the fiscal capacity factor (fiscal space) and political factors affect the size of proportion of discretionary funds (grants and social aid) before the <b>local</b> <b>election</b> in 2015. The larger the local government fiscal space, the greater the allocation of its discretionary funds.

5|$|In the 1995 <b>local</b> <b>elections</b> the Progress Party {{regained the}} level of support seen at the 1987 elections.
