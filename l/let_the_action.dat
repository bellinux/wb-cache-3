50|$|Charlo {{became the}} {{mandatory}} challenger for the WBC middleweight title, with a stoppage win over an injured Heiland in round 4. At {{the start of}} the fight, it was clear that Heiland's left leg was injured. Charlo first dropped Heiland in round 2 with a left to the head. In round 4, Charlo landed another left hook to the head which dropped Heiland again. Heiland beat the count, but as he was getting up, he stumbled around due to the injury. Referee Benji Esteves stopped the fight immediately at 2:13 of the fourth round to ensure Heiland took no more punishment. Charlo spoke to Showtime's Jim Gray in the post fight interview, “Sometimes the injury can be a decoy. You never want to just jump in and think it’s part of his game plan. My coach Shields told me to stay behind my job like I did, continue to work and it’s gonna come.” The ringside doctor checked Heiland's leg before the fourth round but <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> continue. Heiland stated that his leg was okay before the fight an the injury occurred in the opening round. Charlo earned $350,000 compared to Heiland who had $200,000 purse. The fight drew an average 500,000 viewers and peaked at 542,000 viewers on Showtime.|$|E
40|$|Let S be the Stone {{space of}} a complete, non-atomic Boolean algebra. Let G be a countably {{infinite}} group of homeomorphisms of S. <b>Let</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of G on S have a free dense orbit. Then we prove that, on a generic subset of S, the orbit equivalence relation coming from this action can also be obtained as an action of the (abelian) Dyadic Group. For the special case where the complete Boolean algebra is the algebra of regular open subsets of the real numbers, this reduces to a theorem of Sullivan-Weiss-Wright. By applying our new dynamical results we improve on an earlier paper by constructing a family of monotone complete C*-algebras, {B(t) :t in T} with the following properties. First,T is large; it can be identified with the set of all subsets of the reals. Secondly each B(t) is a small C*-algebra,which is a monotone complete factor of Type III, is hyperfinite {{and is not a}} von Neumann algebra. Thirdly, when t is not equal to s, then B(s) is not isomorphic to B(t). In fact, B(s) and B(t) take different values in the classification semi-group for small monotone complete C*-algebras.

50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1928, he {{published}} his best-known children's book, Emil und die Detektive, illustrated by Walter Trier.

6000|$|Though Browning {{is often}} {{compared}} with Shakespeare, {{the reader will}} understand that he has very little of Shakespeare's dramatic talent. He cannot bring {{a group of people}} together and <b>let</b> <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> and words of his characters show us the comedy and tragedy of human life. Neither can the author be disinterested, satisfied, as Shakespeare was, with life itself, without drawing any moral conclusions. Browning has always a moral ready, and insists upon giving us his own views of life, which Shakespeare never does. His dramatic power lies in depicting what he himself calls the history of a soul. Sometimes, as in Paracelsus, he endeavors to trace the progress of the human spirit. More often he takes some dramatic moment in life, some crisis in the ceaseless struggle between good and evil, and describes with wonderful insight the hero's own thoughts and feelings; but he almost invariably tells us how, at such and such a point, the good or the evil in his hero must inevitably have triumphed. And generally, as in [...] "My Last Duchess," [...] the speaker adds a word here and there, aside from the story, which unconsciously shows the kind of man he is. It is this power of revealing the soul from within that causes Browning to fascinate those who study him long enough. His range is enormous, and brings all sorts and conditions of men under analysis. The musician in [...] "Abt Vogler," [...] the artist in [...] "Andrea del Sarto," [...] the early Christian in [...] "A Death in the Desert," [...] the Arab horseman in [...] "Muteykeh," [...] the sailor in [...] "Herve Kiel," [...] the mediæval knight in [...] "Childe Roland," [...] the Hebrew in [...] "Saul," [...] the Greek in [...] "Balaustion's Adventure," [...] the monster in [...] "Caliban," [...] the immortal dead in [...] "Karshish,"--all these and a hundred more histories of the soul show Browning's marvelous versatility. It is this great range of sympathy with many different types of life that constitutes Browning's chief likeness to Shakespeare, though otherwise there is no comparison between the two men.|$|R

In track theory this is called the “ion-kill 2 ̆ 2 cross section, for it is the effect produced by a single heavy ion and its delta rays.

Thus at low LET, response is dominated by the gamma-kill mode, so that the RBE approaches 1. The theory requires 4 radiosensitivity parameters for biological detectors, extracted from survival curves at several high LET bombardments passing through the grain count regime, and at high doses. Once these are known the systematic response of biological detectors to all high LET bombardments can be unfolded separating ion kill from gamma kill, predicting the response to a mixed radiation environment, and predicting low dose response even at the level of a single heavy ion.
