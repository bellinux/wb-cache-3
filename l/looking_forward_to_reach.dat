40|$|A presente tese tem por objetivo defender, sob a visão do direito civil-constitucional e da função promocional do direito, a inter-relação entre os direitos de posse, propriedade e do meio ambiente e a possibilidade de uma ponderação harmoniosa em caso de desequilíbrio entre esses direitos. Utiliza-se para tanto a dimensão analítica, empírica e normativa. A dimensão analítica tem por objetivo {{investigar}} os conceitos jurídicos envolvidos na pesquisa, especialmente em relação à propriedade e à sua função socioambiental. A relação entre tais conceitos sobressai através da análise da função socioambiental da propriedade, da posse enfatizando-se os aspectos da legislação ambiental. O direito fundamental ao meio ambiente é estudado como direito e dever de todos conforme disposto no art. 225 da Constituição de 1988, e, nesse ponto, diretamente eficaz nas relações interprivadas. Aborda-se, na dimensão empírica e normativa essencialmente aspectos práticos, com foco na jurisprudência, especialmente do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) e do Superior Tribunal de Justiça (STJ). A ponderação harmoniosa entre a propriedade, a posse e o meio ambiente, busca o equilíbrio na efetivação desses direitos, inclusive mediante a aplicação dos princípios do direito econômico. Por meio da ponderação, é possível alcançar, de forma mais eficiente do que o modelo tradicional de subsunção, uma resposta adequada e fundamentada para os casos difíceis, especialmente na efetivação e na restauração do equilíbrio entre a posse, a propriedade e o meio ambiente quando esses princípios, no caso concreto, colidem uns com os outros. Sobretudo, pretende-se concretizar os direitos fundamentais segundo exigências do pós-positivismo, por meio da aproximação entre o Direito e a Ética, com o fim de se alcançar a Justiça para o caso concreto. The present thesis {{has as its}} objective {{the defense}} of the relation between the rights to possession, to property and to environment and the possibility of a harmonic balance in the case of disequilibrium between those rights. This construction was done under the sway of civil- constitutional law. In the effort to reach the purpose of this work, it is employed the analytical, empirical and normative dimensions. The analytical dimension has the objective to investigate the juridical concepts involved in the research, especially in relation to the property and to its environmental function. The relation between the analyzed concepts appears trough the analysis of the environmental-social function of the possession, the property and the environmental legislation that reflect in this institutes. The fundamental right to the environment is studied as a right and a duty of everyone in obedience to the rule disposed in the article 225 of the Constitution of 1988, and, at this point, it is possible to initiate legal actions against the private owners, not only against the Estate. The normative and empirical dimension presents a practical approach focusing especially in the jurisprudence of the Brazilian federal Supreme Court and of the Superior Court of Appeal (STJ). It is accentuated the possibility of a harmonic balance between the rights to property, to possession and to environment and the necessity that those rights find a balance in their effectiveness, also through the principles of economic law. Through the balance of the normative principles in collision, it is possible to reach, more efficiently than in the traditional model of subsumption, an adequate and motivated answer to the hard cases, especially when considering the effectiveness or the restoration of the balance between the possession, the property and the environment. The objective is to concretize the fundamental rights, in conformity with the exigencies of the post-positivism trough the approximation between law and ethics, <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Justice in solving hard cases...|$|E

He uses a breathing apparatus, but his lungs are still capable of functioning for themselves. Despite approaching {{the end of his}} long life, he maintains the outward appearance of a young, healthy gentleman. He tries to keep up an optimistic attitude, and is often informal and even playful in his manner of address. He seems to have become senile in his old age though, at time behaving with the naivete of a child or mistaking common objects for something entirely different. While these tendencies are often received as endearing by his second advisor, Riven, it is a frequent source of frustration and concern for his first advisor, Postrophe. It appears he has a great fear of public speaking. He is <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> the end of his long life, but also seems to harbour regrets.|$|R

'In {{this happy}} frame of mind, Gabriel strode along, {{returning}} a short, sullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as {{now and then}} passed him, until he turned into the dark lane {{which led to the}} churchyard. Now, Gabriel had been <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>reaching</b> the dark lane, because it was, generally speaking, a nice, gloomy, mournful place, into which the townspeople did not much care to go, except in broad daylight, and when the sun was shining; consequently, he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry Christmas, in this very sanctuary which had been called Coffin Lane ever {{since the days of the}} old abbey, and the time of the shaven-headed monks. As Gabriel walked on, and the voice drew nearer, he found it proceeded from a small boy, who was hurrying along, to join one of the little parties in the old street, and who, partly to keep himself company, and partly to prepare himself for the occasion, was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs. So Gabriel waited until the boy came up, and then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times, just to teach him to modulate his voice. And as the boy hurried away with his hand to his head, singing quite a different sort of tune, Gabriel Grub chuckled very heartily to himself, and entered the churchyard, locking the gate behind him.|$|R
