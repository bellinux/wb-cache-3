5|$|After the season, Márquez and Jurietti {{departed}} Monaco for Spanish club Barcelona and Bordeaux respectively, {{and were}} replaced by Gaël Givet and Hugo Ibarra, the latter joining the club on loan. In the 2003–04 league season, Deschamps installed Evra as a vice-captain and he responded by appearing in 33 matches and providing four assists. Monaco spent six months from September to March in first place, but, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> season, conceded the top spot to Lyon as the season wore on. Evra made his UEFA Champions League debut on 17 September 2003 in the team's opening group stage match against PSV. Evra played the entire match in a 2–1 win. He appeared in all six group stage matches as Monaco finished in first place. For his performances {{in the first half}} of the 2003–04 season, Evra was linked with a 2004 winter move to English club Arsenal, Italian clubs Juventus and Milan, and Spanish club Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players would have had a persistent online world.|$|E

However, {{that was not the case}} as the second innings proved. The Karachi bowlers outshone the Islamabad bowlers with Muhammad Amir, Imad Wasim and Usama Mir each picking up three wickets. Islamabad were all out for a mere 82 runs, their lowest in the tournament and the second-lowest in the tournament's history.Hence, the {{defending}} champions were knocked out.|$|E

Other things that are touted as being improved are the visuals, the player customization (haircuts, accessories, etc.), several of the game modes (particularly MyCareer, which is marketed as a central feature), and the overall gameplay. Many aesthetical improvements are made as well, such as new animations, and redesigned menus. New animations include mouth guards, and photobombs.|$|E

[...] Despite this, McNutt felt that the episode portrayed Michael as [...] "a flawed, yet normal, man". He felt that the episode, like the sixth season episode [...] "Scott's Tots", illustrated that Michael was still [...] "searching for his identity despite being over 40." [...] He ultimately gave the episode a [...] "B+". Joel Keller of AOL's TV Squad praised Michael's maturity in the episode, saying [...] "even when we get an episode that didn't quite hit the mark, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> night's, the maturing of Michael still makes the episode interesting to watch." ...|$|E

[...] Yücel stated that [...] "Jaher" [...] is [...] "full of dark atmosphere {{that is at once}} soothing and nightmarish" [...] and called it [...] "arguably the best track" [...] on the album. [...] He called [...] "Politikil" [...] "a somewhat more rock & roll type of track" [...] with [...] "chugs and churns of overdriven synths and guitar-like tones, and a rocking rhythm" [...] that is [...] "sure to be a highlight when played live". [...] Yücel also said, [...] "Many will still chide the band for not returning to the sound of past successes <b>like</b> <b>Last</b> Rights or Too Dark Park, but it's this type of purist viewpoint that ultimately stagnates a band's progress." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{inspired}} {{performance by}} Bergkamp helped Arsenal win 0–4 at West Ham United {{in the first}} weekend of February. He, however missed the following match, away to Manchester United, due to suspension along with Petit; Keown was absent due to a hamstring injury. Arsenal conceded a first half penalty when Ray Parlour brought down Ronny Johnsen. Dwight Yorke missed, chipping the ball wide of the right-hand post, and was made to pay {{early in the second}} half as new signing Nwankwo Kanu's through ball found striker Anelka, who scored. Andy Cole equalised moments after – Arsenal's first goal conceded in two months, and with both teams spurring chances to win the match, it ended in a 1–1 draw. Three days after, Anelka scored his first career hat-trick against Leicester City. Bergkamp after the match felt Arsenal were now equipped to push on for a title challenge, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> season: [...] "It's all coming back. I feel it, for myself and for the team."

500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while we may be smaller, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> year, we will make sure that we are capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E
500|$|A solid backfield {{anchored}} by Zach Zwinak, {{a trio of}} established tight ends plus a promising newcomer, and a veteran offensive line highlighted the projected success offensively, while a new coordinator (John Butler), a [...] "borderline All-American" [...] linebacker (Glenn Carson), and lots of potential both on the defensive line and in the secondary, the latter of which was [...] "dramatically improved", highlighted projected progress defensively. Also, a quarterback competition between Christian Hackenberg and Tyler Ferguson brewed, which provided intrigue entering the season. For Penn State to achieve success, they needed to avoid injuries that would hinder their already depleted depth due to NCAA sanctions. SBNation.com asserted, [...] "If either Hackenberg or Ferguson gets hurt, {{and the other one}} stinks ... if either Zach Zwinak or Bill Belton (who missed four games last year) gets hurt ... if basically any linemen get hurt (and linemen often get hurt) ... this house of cards comes tumbling down." [...] ESPN.com reporter Josh Moyer wrote, [...] "In short, <b>like</b> <b>last</b> year, PSU {{is a bit of a}} wild card. If it receives strong efforts from its quarterback and the front seven, it should surpass last year's record. If it doesn't, it might be fortunate to get to seven wins." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, but it certainly didn't keep me {{on the edge of my}} seat waiting for the next crazy twist <b>like</b> <b>last</b> week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E
