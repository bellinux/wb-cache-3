5000|$|A second Diorama {{building}} in Regent's Park in London was opened by {{an association of}} Englishmen (having a contract to purchase Daguerre's tableaux) in 1823, {{a year after the}} debut of Daguerre's Paris original. The building which exhibited the diorama was designed by Augustus Charles Pugin, father of the notable English architect and designer Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin. The show was a popular sensation, and spawned immediate imitations. British artists like Clarkson Stanfield and David Roberts produced ever-more elaborate (moving) dioramas through the 1830s; sound effects and even living performers were added. Some [...] "typical diorama effects included moonlit nights, winter snow turning into a summer meadow, rainbows after a storm, illuminated fountains," [...] waterfalls, thunder and <b>lightning,</b> and <b>ringing</b> bells. A diorama painted by Daguerre is currently housed in the church of the French town Bry-sur-Marne, where he lived and died.|$|R

The basic form and {{proportions}} of the Blitz logo has remained unchanged since the 1970 version, which made the lightning tails shorter so that the logo could fit proportionately within a yellow square, meaning it could be displayed next to the 'blue square' General Motors logo. In the mid 1970s, the Vauxhall [...] "Griffin" [...] logo was, in turn, resized and displayed within a corresponding red square, so that all three logos could be displayed together, thus signifying the unified GM Europe.|$|R
5000|$|Imra briefly {{rejoined the}} Legion again in 2987 when Universo {{took control of}} the Earth and hypnotized and imprisoned many heroes, {{including}} her. Imra's powerful mind broke free and eventually broke Universo's hold over Earth and forced him unconscious. It was then that she realized how much the Legion was in her blood, and she rejoined, this time without Garth, who was enjoying life as a father and househusband. However, during the [...] "Five Year Gap", Earth's government became hostile to the Legion, and Garth became incapacitated from the Validus plague which ravaged his native Winath. Disillusioned by the government and feeling needed more at home, Imra resigned from the Legion for the last time in 2990. Returning to Winath, she and Garth took over running a Winathian <b>Lightning</b> <b>Ring</b> plantation, which became quite prosperous. Using their new-found wealth, Imra and Garth replaced their super-heroism with simple but necessary helping of others, feeding a galaxy suffering more from hunger than from super-villains. When the Legion re-formed in 2994, the Ranzzes helped them out, but did not rejoin. Instead, they enlarged their family with the birth of daughters Dacey & Dorritt, who inherited Imra's telepathic abilities.|$|E

Haakon calls a meeting during a lull in the fighting, and says that he feels that the tide of the battle is going against his allies and him. Haakon then goes to an island called Primsigned, north of Hjórunga Bay. On the island, Haakon falls to his knees, and, while looking northward, prays to what is {{described}} as his patron goddess, Þorgerðr Hǫlgabrúðr. According to the saga, Þorgerðr repeatedly refuses his offers, but finally accepts the blót of his 7-year-old son. Haakon's slave, Skopti, slaughters the boy.Haakon returns to his fleet and presses his men to engage in an attack, and commends his men to ("Þorgerðr" [...] is here anglicized as [...] "Thorgerd"):Press the attack all the more vigorously, because I have invoked for victory both the sisters, Thorgerd and Irpa.Haakon enters his ship, the fleet rows forward for the attack, and battle ensues.

40|$|The author (physicist) has {{observed}} the very strange,beautiful and frightening Lightning Ball (LB). He has never forgotten this phenomenon. During his working life {{he could not}} devote himself {{to the problem of}} LB-formation. Only two years ago as he has been reading different unbelievable models of LB-formation, he decided to work on this problem. By studying the literature and the crucial points of his observation the author succeeded in creating a completely new model of Lightning Ball(LB) and Ball Lightning(BL) -formation based on the symmetry breaking of the hydrodynamic vortex ring. This agrees fully with the observation and overcomes the shortcomings of current models of LB formation. This model provides answers to the questions: Why are LBs so rarely observed,why do BLs in rare cases have such a high energy and how can we generate LB in the laboratory? Moreover the author differentiates between LB and BL, the latter having a high energy and occuring in 5 % of the observations. Keywords: ball <b>lightning,</b> hydrodynamic vortex <b>ring,</b> symmetry breaking, electroluminescence, triboelectrification...|$|R
50|$|Auditory verbal agnosia is the {{inability}} to distinguish phonemes. In some patients with unilateral auditory verbal agnosia, {{there is evidence that}} the ability to acoustically process speech signals is affected at the prephonemic level, preventing the conversion of these signals into phonemes. There are two predominate hypotheses that address what happens within the language center of the brain in people that have AVA. One of the hypotheses is that an early stage of auditory analysis is impaired. The fact that AVA patients have the ability to read shows that both the semantic system and the speech output lexicon are intact. The second hypotheses suggests that there is either a complete or partial disconnection of the auditory input lexicon from the semantic system. This would suggest that entries in the lexicon can still be activated but they cannot go on to cause subsequent semantic activation. In relation to these two different hypotheses, researchers in one study differentiated between two different types of AVA. According to this study, one form of AVA is a deficit at the prephonemic level and is related to {{the inability}} to comprehend rapid changes in sound. This form of AVA is associated with bilateral temporal lobe lesions. The second type of AVA that the study discusses is a deficit in linguistic discrimination that does not adhere to a prephonemic patter. This form is associated with left unilateral temporal lobe lesions and may even be considered a form of Wernicke's aphasia. Often individuals diagnosed with auditory verbal agnosia are also incapable of discriminating between non-verbal sounds as well as speech. The underlying problem seems to be temporal in that understanding speech requires the discrimination between specific sounds which are closely spaced in time. Note that this is not unique to speech; studies using non-speech sounds closely spaced in time (dog bark, phone <b>ring,</b> <b>lightning,</b> etc.) have shown that those with auditory verbal agnosia are unable to discriminate between those sounds in the majority of cases, though a few putative examples of speech-specific impairment have been documented in the literature.|$|R
