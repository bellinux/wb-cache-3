5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the new command centre was a large liquid crystal display which displayed information regarding the air conditioning unit and sound system. Buyers could opt for a premium sound package, standard on the Fairmont Ghia, which included a full-colour screen. Ventilation outlets were <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of previous models, resulting in a cabin that could be more effectively and efficiently heated or cooled. Another change was the headlamp switch, which was now located {{on the end of}} the turn signal stalk for easier reach.|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, {{about twice the}} spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E

5|$|M. l. edouardi, like M. l. leucopterus, have {{black-and-white}} coloured males, and {{are found}} only on Barrow Island, also off the western coast of Australia. Birds of this subspecies are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of M. l. leucopterus {{but have a}} shorter tail. The female has a more cinnamon tinge to her plumage than the grey-brown {{of the other two}} subspecies. It was described by A.J. Campbell in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II {{retains the}} {{tandem landing gear}} layout of the first-generation Harriers, {{although}} each outrigger landing gear leg was moved from the wingtip to mid-span for a tighter turning radius when taxiing. The engine intakes are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of the first-generation Harrier, and have a revised inlet. On {{the underside of the}} fuselage, McDonnell Douglas added lift-improvement devices, which capture the reflected engine exhaust when close to the ground, giving the equivalent of up to 1,200lb (544kg) of extra lift.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in the western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about to order the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E
5|$|At {{this period}} the Llanbadarn {{community}} {{was dominated by}} Sulien (1011–91) and his remarkable family. Around 1055 Sulien, who {{was born into a}} family educated for many generations in the clas monastic school or college of Llanbadarn Fawr, returned there after five years study in Scotland and ten years study in Ireland (according to his son and biographer). After this time Llanbadarn Fawr became possibly the foremost place of learning in Wales. Sulien went on to be known as Sulien the Wise. He became the abbot of Llanbadarn Fawr and served as Bishop of St David's twice. Under his abbacy Llanbadarn Fawr's monastic library grew in size and importance; reputedly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of Canterbury Cathedral and York Minster.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{have a large}} bill, {{which is}} kept sharp by rasping the two mandibles {{together}} when resting. The bill is complemented by a large muscular tongue which helps manipulate seeds inside the bill {{so that they can}} be de-husked before eating. During the de-husking, the lower mandible applies the pressure, the tongue holds the seed in place and the upper mandible acts as an anvil. The eye region of the skull is reinforced to support muscles which move the mandibles sideways. The bills of male cockatoos are generally slightly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of their female counterparts, but this size difference is quite marked in the palm cockatoo.|$|E
30|$|Since {{the tidal}} {{magnetic}} signals at {{the period of}} 12 h are dominated by the semidiurnal M 2 tide, which is known to generate the largest magnetic fields among all tidal constituents (Kuvshinov 2008), {{it is no surprise}} that the tidal signals at a period of 12 h, both at the sea level and sea floor (cf. bottom plots of Figs.  6, 7, 8, 9, 10), have <b>larger</b> amplitudes <b>than</b> <b>those</b> at the period of 24 h (cf. bottom plots of Figs. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15). Further, the Sq signals at the 24 -h period have <b>larger</b> amplitudes <b>than</b> <b>those</b> at the 12 -h period.|$|R

50|$|The broad-footed mole can be {{distinguished}} from other species of Scapanus by its dark brown to silvery fur, and 40-44 unevenly spaced unicuspid teeth. Adults range from 14 to 18 cm in total length on average, with males slightly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> females. Populations in more humid environments also tend to have <b>larger</b> individuals <b>than</b> <b>those</b> from southern, drier areas.|$|R
5|$|Development of {{the game}} started in June 1998, {{directly}} {{after the release of}} its predecessor. Several new features were cut from the game due to time constraints and limitations of the Nintendo 64 hardware. Banjo-Tooie features levels that are significantly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of its predecessor and requires the player to complete various challenges such as solving puzzles, collecting items, and defeating bosses. It also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in several minigames. Upon release, the game sold more than three million copies and received critical acclaim from video game critics. The game is also included in the Rare Replay video game compilation, released for the Xbox One in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of different groups portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. albirictus) are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E
5000|$|The law {{was criticized}} as [...] "rushed through" [...] {{by the state}} {{legislature}} without consideration of whether it would criminalize police and other law enforcement officers who carry firearms with magazines with a <b>larger</b> capacity <b>than</b> <b>those</b> allowed for civilians.|$|R
50|$|The female carries {{eggs in a}} brood pouch on its ventral side. G. lacustris {{in higher}} {{elevations}} {{were more likely to}} have fewer but <b>larger</b> eggs <b>than</b> <b>those</b> living at lower elevations. G. lacustris undergoes several molts and juveniles resemble the adult.|$|R
5000|$|Very {{large numbers}} often occur in {{fields such as}} mathematics, cosmology, cryptography, and {{statistical}} mechanics. Sometimes people refer to numbers as being [...] "astronomically large".

5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} (Galeus melastomus) is {{a species of}} catshark, {{and part of the}} family Scyliorhinidae, common in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean from Iceland to Senegal, including the Mediterranean Sea. It is typically found over the continental slope at depths of , on or near muddy bottoms. The youngest sharks generally inhabit shallower water than the older juveniles and adults. This slim-bodied species is characterized by the black interior of its mouth, a marbled pattern of pale-edged brownish saddles or blotches along its back and tail, and a prominent saw-toothed crest of enlarged dermal denticles along the upper edge of its caudal fin. It reaches lengths of , with sharks in the Atlantic growing <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|A {{nitrogen}} atom {{has seven}} electrons. In the ground state, they {{are arranged in}} the electron configuration 1s2s2p2p2p. It therefore has five valence electrons in the 2s and 2p orbitals, three of which (the p-electrons) are unpaired. It {{has one of the}} highest electronegativities among the elements (3.04 on the Pauling scale), exceeded only by chlorine (3.16), oxygen (3.44), and fluorine (3.98). Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 71pm is smaller than those of boron (84pm) and carbon (76pm), while it is <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of oxygen (66pm) and fluorine (57pm). The nitride anion, N3−, is much larger at 146pm, similar to that of the oxide (O2−: 140pm) and fluoride (F−: 133pm) anions. The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are 1.402, 2.856, and 4.577MJ·mol−1, and the sum of the fourth and fifth is 16.920MJ·mol−1. Due to these very high figures, nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Experiments {{have shown}} that when more pollen {{is applied to the}} stigma, as well as the fruit {{containing}} more seeds and being larger (the xenia effect mentioned above), the germination of the seeds is also faster and more likely, and the seedlings are larger. Various combinations of mineral nutrients and light have a significant effect during the various stages of plant growth. These effects vary significantly between the different species of Cucurbita. A type of stored phosphorus called phytate forms in seed tissues as spherical crystalline intrusions in protein bodies called globoids. Along with other nutrients, phytate is used completely during seedling growth. Heavy metal contamination, including cadmium, has a significant negative impact on plant growth. Cucurbita plants grown in the spring tend to grow <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> grown in the autumn.|$|E

50|$|Mechanical mods and {{variable}} devices use <b>larger</b> batteries <b>than</b> <b>those</b> found in previous generations. Common battery sizes used are 18350, 18490, 18500 and 18650. The battery is often removable, {{so it can}} be changed when depleted. The battery must be removed and charged externally.|$|R
5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{differs from}} species of Fomitiporia in two key respects. Its spores are less dextrinoid {{than those of}} the genus and their shape is atypical. Other than this, it is typical of the genus, {{according}} to the original description. Five species of Fomitiporia, F.bannaensis, F.pseudopunctata, F.sonorae, F.sublaevigata and F.tenuis, share with P.ellipsoideus the resupinate fruit bodies and the setae in the hymenium. Despite this, all of them but P.ellipsoideus have straight hymenial setae, and all of them have spores that are spherical or almost spherical, which is much more typical of the genus. F.uncinata (formerly Phellinus uncinatus) has hooked hymenial setae, and the spores are, as with P.ellipsoideus, thick-walled and dextrinoid. The species can be differentiated by the fact the spores are spherical or nearly so, and somewhat <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of P.ellipsoideus, measuring 5.5 to 7 by 5 to 6.5μm. The species is also known only from tropical America, where it grows on bamboo.|$|E
5|$|These drab martins {{can only}} be {{confused}} with each other, or with sand martins of the genus Riparia. Even the smaller Ptyonoprogne species are slightly larger and more robust than the sand martin and brown-throated sand martin, and have the white tail spots which are absent from the Riparia martins. Where the ranges of Ptyonoprogne species overlap, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts, than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> of both its relatives. In the east of its range, the rock martin always has lighter, more contrasted underparts than the dusky crag martin.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and sit up straight with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are <b>larger</b> <b>than</b> <b>those</b> on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E
5000|$|Hore's {{locks on}} the Avon totalled six, with {{slightly}} smaller dimensions <b>than</b> <b>those</b> on the Kennet.
