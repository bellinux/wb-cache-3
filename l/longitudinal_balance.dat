50|$|Large {{sideways}} {{extensions of}} a chined forebody {{can have a}} significant effect on aircraft lift, drag, <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> and directional stability.|$|E
50|$|A {{longitudinal}} stabilizer is used {{to maintain}} the aircraft in <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance,</b> or trim: it exerts a vertical force at a distance so that the summation of pitch moments about {{the center of gravity}} is zero. The vertical force exerted by the stabilizer to this effect varies with flight conditions, in particular according to the aircraft lift coefficient and wing flaps deflection which both affect the position of the center of lift, and with the position of the aircraft center of gravity (which changes with aircraft loading). Transonic flight makes special demands on horizontal stabilizers, since the crossing of the sound barrier is associated with a sudden move aft of the center of lift.|$|E
40|$|The {{aircraft}} loading {{problem is a}} real-world combinatorial optimisation problem highly constrained. Indeed, loading the aircraft so the gross weight {{is less than the}} maximum allowable is not enough. This weight must be distributed to keep the centre of gravity (CG) within specified limits. Balance control refers to the location of the CG. Both lateral and <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balances</b> are important in order to minimize fuel consumption and to satisfy stability and safety requirements. Moreover, an aircraft has usually several cargo compartments with specific contours and structural limitations such as floor loading, combined load limits and cumulative load limitations. The topic of this talk is the description of a mixed integer linear program for the problem of loading a set of Unit Loading Devices (ULDs) and bulk into an aircraft. An ULD can be a container or a pallet and is characterised by the type, contour, weight and height. Experimental results for real data sets show that the model achieves better balanced solutions in only a few seconds compared to the solution obtained by load masters...|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{center of}} gravity {{calculations}} are only performed along a single axis from the zero point of the reference datum that represents the longitudinal axis of the aircraft (to calculate fore-to-aft balance). Some helicopter types utilize lateral CG limits as well as longitudinal limits. Operation of such helicopters requires calculating CG along two axes: one calculation for <b>longitudinal</b> CG (fore-to-aft <b>balance)</b> and another calculation for lateral CG (left-to-right balance).|$|R
5000|$|The mid-upper (dorsal or top) turret was an FN-50 {{on early}} {{examples}} {{and the very}} similar FN-150 with improved sights and controls on later examples. On all but the earliest examples this turret {{was surrounded by a}} coaming which provided a track for a cam operated interruptor device which prevented the gunner from shooting the tail of his own aircraft. The Mk. VII and late Mk. X Lancasters used the heavier, electrically-controlled Martin 250 CE 23A turret equipped with two [...]50 inch machine guns which was mounted further forward to preserve the aircraft's <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance,</b> and because it had an internal mechanism to prevent firing on the aircraft itself, it did not require a coaming. Other experimental turrets were tried out, including the FN-79 and the Boulton-Paul Type H barbette system.|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} made of a model wing having an aspect ratio of 3 and a tapered plan form with a {{straight}} trailing edge. The model had the Clark Y airfoil section throughout it's entire span and had no washout, depending on a trailing-edge flap for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> and control. The flap had a constant chord and was divided into four equal portions along the span. The tests were made with the entire flap deflected to obtain longitudinal control and balance, and also with the inner portions deflected alone, and with the outer portions deflected alone. It {{was found that the}} simple wing with no washout or change of basic section along the span has aerodynamic characteristics well suited for use on tailless airplanes.

It was presented mathematical description for <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> of the airplane for inverted flight, in particular, the pitching moment coefficient plane without power for horizontal rudder (Cmbu), {{as well as the}} same force on the rudder horizontal (PHo). An analysis was conducted for gusts acting on the plane flying in an inverted position in relation to the flight envelope. It has also been analysed the horizontal tail load, acting on the inverted fly and caused by both gusts and brutal control. In conclusions, the comments on the aerodynamics of wing in flight inverted for the selected airfoil are presented. The focus is on static analysis of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> of the airplane under normal inverted flight.

40|$|Double {{ionization}} of He by 3. 6 MeV u(- 1) Au 53 + {{impact is}} investigated in a kinematically complete experiment using an integrated multi-electron recoil-ion momentum spectrometer (reaction microscope). Surprisingly, the final-state {{correlation between the}} recoiling He 2 + target ion momentum and the momenta of both emitted electrons {{is found to be}} the strongest among the various two-body correlations. On this basis it is demonstrated that the four-body momentum balance can be reduced to a good approximation to an effective three- particle problem by considering the centre-of-mass motion of the two electrons instead of their individual momenta. Then, all essential dynamical features observed for single ionization earlier, like for example a strong forward-backward asymmetry in the <b>longitudinal</b> momentum <b>balance</b> resulting from the final- state interaction with the projectile, are naturally rediscovered. Moreover, important conclusions on the properties of the TS- 2 double ionization mechanism are drawn...|$|R

40|$|An enthalpy-balance fuel-grain {{regression}} model is presented. The {{regression model}}, {{based on the}} longitudinally averaged fuel recession rates, is shown to accurately predict the chamber pressure, thrust and specific impulse performance of small and medium scale hybrid rocket motors. The key to the model predictions is the <b>longitudinal</b> enthalpy <b>balance</b> between the fuel grain heat of ablation and the convective heat transfer from the flame zone to the model surface. Convective heat transfer {{is related to the}} surface skin friction using the Reynolds analogy for turbulent flow. Simple flat plate models are used to predict the longitudinally averaged skin friction coefficient. Chemical properties of the combustion products were evaluated using the NASA Computer Equilibrium with Applications (CEA) Combustion code. Model predictions for a nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and hydroxyl-terminated poly butadiene (HTPB) motor are compared to data from a small-scale test firing with a 4 - inch diameter motor.

40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis for}} two rheological behaviors of biological or model membranes is performed. The membrane considered is symmetrical, incompressible, and uncharged. No account is taken of mechanical anisotropy. The two fluids {{adjacent to the}} membrane are Newtonian viscous fluids. Two viscoelastic behaviors of the membrane phase are studied (1) the Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic "solid" model and (2) the Maxwell viscoelastic "liquid" model. The mechanical boundary conditions on both faces of the membrane are the transversal momentum balance (Laplace condition) and the <b>longitudinal</b> momentum <b>balance</b> (Marangoni-Levich condition). The van der Waals attraction forces between the two faces of the membrane are taken into account. For the symmetrical systems considered, the two modes of wavy perturbations of the membrane are uncoupled: the in-phase motion of both surfaces (stretching mode) and the 180 ° out-of-phase motion (squeezing mode). The dispersion relation of both modes is solved analytically for the two models, {{in the limit of}} long-wavelength perturbations. Comparison with examples of biological membranes instabilities is performed. © 1982. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Low-speed wind-tunnel {{tests of}} a l/ 8 scale {{model of the}} Republic XP- 91 {{airplane}} were made to determine its low-speed characteristics and {{the relative merits of}} a vee and a conventional tail on the model. The results of the tests showed that for the same amount of longitudinal and directional stability the conventional tail gave less roll due to sideslip than did the vee tail. The directional stability of the model was considered inadequate for both the vee and conventional tails; however, increasing the area and aspect ratio of the conventional vertical tail provided adequate directional stability. It was possible with negative wing dihedral and open main landing gear doors to reduce the excessive roll due to sideslip for the landing configuration (flaps and gear down) to a more reasonable value commensurate with the aileron power.

40|$|General {{equations}} of ice dynamics are re-examined, using scale analysis, {{in order}} to derive a simplified thermomechanically coupled model for ice flow and heat transfer in ice caps filling volcanic craters. Relatively large aspect ratios between crater depths and diameters, low surface temperatures and intense volcanic heating are the principal characteristics of such craters. The conventional boundary-layer (shallow-ice) approximation is revised to account for these conditions and, in addition, the variable density of the snow, firn and bubbly ice. Large crater depths and intense bottom melting result in low <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> velocities, controlled by both shear and longitudinal stresses, and hence small surface slopes. In such situations ice can be assumed to be linearly viscous. A flowline model of the glacier dynamics is developed using this assumption. Explicit predictive formulas for ice-particle trajectories and age—depth relations, thus obtained, suggest that the age of ice {{at the bottom of}} glaciers in volcanic craters on Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia, may reach hundreds or thousands of years. Ice cores from these glaciers represent unique climatic and volcanic archives...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of tests conducted in the N. A. C. A. full-scale wind tunnel on a Fairchild F- 22 airplane equipped with a special wing having split trailing-edge flaps. The flaps extended over the outer 90 percent of the wing span, and were of the fixed-hinge type having a width equal to 20 percent of the wing chord. The results show that with a flap setting of 59 degrees the maximum lift of the wing was increased 42 percent, and that the flaps increased the range of available gliding angles from 2. 7 degrees to 7. 0 degrees. Deflection of the split flaps did not increase the stalling angle or seriously affect the <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> of the airplane. With flaps down the landing speed of the airplane is decreased, but the calculated climb and level-flight performance is inferior to that with the normal wing. Calculations indicate that the take-off distance required to clear an obstacle 100 feet high is not affected by flap settings from 0 degrees to 20 degrees but is greatly increased by larger flap angles...|$|E

In this study, the contribution of biologically induced phosphate precipitation to the total removal of phosphate was investigated in full-scale AGS installations in Utrecht and Garmerwolde, the Netherlands. A <b>longitudinal</b> phosphate <b>balance</b> showed that under current operating conditions, phosphate does not accumulate noticeably in mature full-scale AGS systems. The total phosphate content of granule fractions, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images coupled with energy dispersive X-rays (EDX) and the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses on reactor granules showed no substantial phosphate crystals in the granules. The X-ray diffractions (XRD) revealed the presence of quartz crystals (SiO 4) and, at some moments in time, different types of other minerals (e. g., potassium struvite, dolomite, magnesium calcite, brushite). Other XRD measurements however, showed no crystals at all besides quartz. It is suggested that a dynamic precipitation - dissolution process occurs in full-scale AGS systems within each process cycles or over multiple cycles.

40|$|To the authors' knowledge, {{the effect}} of hoof balance {{alteration}} on exercise capacity or performance has not been investigated. With the aim of evaluating the relationships between longitudinal front hoof balance and exercise capacity (lactate vs. speed relationship, run time and stride characteristics), two experiments were undertaken. In the first test the horses, left unshod, performed an incremental speed test in which parameters chosen to evaluate exercise capacity were related to hoof <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance.</b> In {{the second part of}} the study the same group of horses had the length of the toe altered (decreased and increased) with the application of shoes, while the angle of the foot and the height of the foot from the ground remained the same. The relative change in exercise capacity due to the alteration of <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> was observed. In the unshod experiment, lactate level at the speed of 10 ms- 1 (5. 0 ± 2. 0 mmoll- 1) was significantly associated with the angles DC° (angle described by the dorsal cortex with respect to the ground; 50. 0 ± 3. 2 °) and PC° (angle described by the palmar cortex with respect to the ground; 29. 6 ± 2. 9 °), while run time (14. 07 ± 1. 44 min) was associated with breakover indices (Breakover index 1 0. 33 ± 0. 03; Breakover index 2 0. 30 ± 0. 04 – all values mean ± standard deviation (SD)) (breakover indices were created to express the distance between the point of the toe and the point of the third phalanx relative to the length of the palmar cortex or relative to the distance between the point of the third phalanx and the centre of rotation of the distal interphalangeal joint). These associations have to be judged cautiously because the influence of hoof balance on exercise capacity could be biased by other physiological factors and because hoof balance parameters themselves could reflect the conformation of other anatomical structures far from the phalanges. The selective alteration of front hoof balance in {{the second part of the}} study produced a significant difference in blood lactate level only at 6 ms- 1 (mean ± SD: La 6 ?m?s- 1 0. 32 ± 0. 39 mmoll- 1), with this benefit in terms of lactate level being associated with an increase in stride length (mean ± SD: ΔSL 6 ms- 1 0. 01 ± 0. 05 m; ΔSL 10 ms- 1 0. 112 ± 0. 218 m). In conclusion, while higher exercise capacity seemed to be associated with lower DC°, PC° and breakover indices, decreasing the toe length without altering the foot angle was beneficial only in terms of lactate level at the speed of 6 ms- 1 for horses with DC° greater than 45 °; this benefit was accompanied by a slight lengthening of the stride at both 6 and 10 ms-...|$|E
40|$|It is not {{unknown that}} the {{evolution}} of firm theories has been developed along a path paved by an increasing awareness of the organizational structure importance. From the early “neoclassical” conceptualizations that intended the firm as a rational actor whose aim is to produce that amount of output, given the inputs at its disposal and in accordance to technological or environmental constraints, which maximizes the revenue (see Boulding, 1942 for a past mid century {{state of the art}} discussion) to the knowledge based theory of the firm (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka & Toyama, 2005), which recognizes in the firm a knnowledge creating entity, with specific organizational capabilities (Teece, 1996; Teece & Pisano, 1998) that allow to sustaine competitive advantages. Tracing back a map of the theory of the firm evolution, taking into account the several perspectives adopted in the history of thought, would take the length of many books. Because of that a more fruitful strategy is circumscribing the focus of the description of the literature evolution to one flow connected to a crucial question about the nature of firm’s behaviour and about the determinants of competitive advantages. In so doing I adopt a perspective that allows me to consider the organizational structure of the firm as an element according to which the different theories can be discriminated. The approach adopted starts by considering the drawbacks of the standard neoclassical theory of the firm. Discussing the most influential theoretical approaches I end up with a close examination of the knowledge based perspective of the firm. Within this perspective the firm is considered as a knowledge creating entity that produce and mange knowledge (Nonaka, Toyama, & Nagata, 2000; Nonaka & Toyama, 2005). In a knowledge intensive organization, knowledge is clearly embedded for the most part in the human capital of the individuals that compose such an organization. In a knowledge based organization, the management, in order to cope with knowledge intensive productions, ought to develop and accumulate capabilities that shape the organizational forms in a way that relies on “cross-functional processes, extensive delayering and empowerment” (Foss 2005, p. 12). This mechanism contributes to determine the absorptive capacity of the firm towards specific technologies and, in so doing, it also shape the technological trajectories along which the firm moves. After having recognized the growing importance of the firm’s organizational structure in the theoretical literature concerning the firm theory, the subsequent point of the analysis is that of providing an overview of the changes that have been occurred at micro level to the firm’s organization of production. The economic actors have to deal with challenges posed by processes of internationalisation and globalization, increased and increasing competitive pressure of less developed countries on low value added production activities, changes in technologies and increased environmental turbulence and volatility. As a consequence, it has been widely recognized that the main organizational models of production that fitted well in the 20 th century are now partially inadequate and processes aiming to reorganize production activities have been widespread across several economies in recent years. Recently, the emergence of a “new” form of production organization has been proposed both by scholars, practitioners and institutions: the most prominent characteristic of such a model is its recognition of the importance of employees commitment and involvement. As a consequence it is characterized by a strong accent on the human resource management and on those practices that aim to widen the autonomy and responsibility of the workers as well as increasing their commitment to the organization (Osterman, 1994; 2000; Lynch, 2007). This “model” of production organization is by many defined as High Performance Work System (HPWS). Despite the increasing diffusion of workplace practices that may be inscribed within the concept of HPWS in western countries’ companies, it is an hazard, to some extent, to speak about the emergence of a “new organizational paradigm”. The discussion about organizational changes and the diffusion of HPWP the focus cannot abstract from a discussion about the industrial relations systems, with a particular accent on the employment relationships, because of their relevance, {{in the same way as}} production organization, in determining two major outcomes of the firm: innovation and economic performances. The argument is treated starting from the issue of the Social Dialogue at macro level, both in an European perspective and Italian perspective. The model of interaction between the social parties has repercussions, at micro level, on the employment relationships, that is to say on the relations between union delegates and management or workers and management. Finding economic and social policies capable of sustaining growth and employment within a knowledge based scenario is likely to constitute the major challenge for the next generation of social pacts, which are the main social dialogue outcomes. As Acocella and Leoni (2007) put forward the social pacts may constitute an instrument to trade wage moderation for high intensity in ICT, organizational and human capital investments. Empirical evidence, especially focused on the micro level, about the positive relation between economic growth and new organizational designs coupled with ICT adoption and non adversarial industrial relations is growing. Partnership among social parties may become an instrument to enhance firm competitiveness. The outcome of the discussion is the integration of organizational changes and industrial relations elements within a unified framework: the HPWS. Such a choice may help in disentangling the potential existence of complementarities between these two aspects of the firm internal structure on economic and innovative performance. With the third chapter starts the more original part of the thesis. The data utilized in order to disentangle the relations between HPWS practices, innovation and economic performance refer to the manufacturing firms of the Reggio Emilia province with more than 50 employees. The data have been collected through face to face interviews both to management (199 respondents) and to union representatives (181 respondents). Coupled with the cross section datasets a further data source is constituted by <b>longitudinal</b> <b>balance</b> sheets (1994 - 2004). Collecting reliable data that in turn provide reliable results needs always a great effort to which are connected uncertain results. Data at micro level are often subjected to a trade off: the wider is the geographical context to which the population surveyed belong the lesser is the amount of information usually collected (low level of resolution); the narrower is the focus on specific geographical context, the higher is the amount of information usually collected (high level of resolution). For the Italian case the evidence about the diffusion of HPWP and their effects on firm performances is still scanty and usually limited to local level studies (Cristini, et al., 2003). The thesis is also devoted to the deepening of an argument of particular interest: the existence of complementarities between the HPWS practices. It has been widely shown by empirical evidence that when HPWP are adopted in bundles they are more likely to impact on firm’s performances than when adopted in isolation (Ichniowski, Prennushi, Shaw, 1997). Is it true also for the local production system of Reggio Emilia? The empirical analysis has the precise aim of providing evidence on the relations between the HPWS dimensions and the innovative and economic performances of the firm. As far as the first line of analysis is concerned it must to be stressed the fundamental role that innovation plays in the economy (Geroski & Machin, 1993; Stoneman & Kwoon 1994, 1996; OECD, 2005; EC, 2002). On this point the evidence goes from the traditional innovations, usually approximated by R&D investment expenditure or number of patents, to the introduction and adoption of ICT, in the recent years (Brynjolfsson & Hitt, 2000). If innovation is important then it is critical to analyse its determinants. In this work it is hypothesised that organizational changes and firm level industrial relations/employment relations aspects that can be put under the heading of HPWS, influence the propensity to innovate in product, process and quality of the firm. The general argument may goes as follow: changes in production management and work organization reconfigure the absorptive capacity of the firm towards specific technologies and, in so doing, they shape the technological trajectories along which the firm moves; cooperative industrial relations may lead to smother adoption of innovations, because not contrasted by unions. From the first empirical chapter emerges that the different types of innovations seem to respond in different ways to the HPWS variables. The underlying processes of product, process and quality innovations are likely to answer to different firm’s strategies and needs. Nevertheless, it is possible to extract some general results in terms of the most influencing HPWS factors on innovative performance. The main three aspects are training coverage, employees involvement and the diffusion of bonuses. These variables show persistent and significant relations with all the three innovation types. The same do the components having such variables at their inside. In sum the aspects of the HPWS influence the propensity to innovate of the firm. At the same time, emerges a quite neat (although not always strong) evidence of complementarities presence between HPWS practices. In terns of the complementarity issue it can be said that some specific complementarities exist. Training activities, when adopted and managed in bundles, are related to the propensity to innovate. Having a sound skill base may be an element that enhances the firm’s capacity to innovate. It may enhance both the capacity to absorbe exogenous innovation and the capacity to endogenously develop innovations. The presence and diffusion of bonuses and the employees involvement also spur innovative propensity. The former because of their incentive nature and the latter because direct workers participation may increase workers commitment to the organizationa and thus their willingness to support and suggest inovations. The other line of analysis provides results on the relation between HPWS and economic performances of the firm. There have been a bulk of international empirical studies on the relation between organizational changes and economic performance (Black & Lynch 2001; Zwick 2004; Janod & Saint-Martin 2004; Huselid 1995; Huselid & Becker 1996; Cappelli & Neumark 2001), while the works aiming to capture the relations between economic performance and unions or industrial relations aspects are quite scant (Addison & Belfield, 2001; Pencavel, 2003; Machin & Stewart, 1990; Addison, 2005). In the empirical analysis the integration of the two main areas of the HPWS represent a scarcely exploited approach in the panorama of both national and international empirical studies. As remarked by Addison “although most analysis of workers representation and employee involvement/high performance work practices have been conducted in isolation – while sometimes including the other as controls – research is beginning to consider their interactions” (Addison, 2005, p. 407). The analysis conducted exploiting temporal lags between dependent and covariates, possibility given by the merger of cross section and panel data, provides evidence in favour of the existence of HPWS practices impact on firm’s economic performance, differently measured. Although it does not seem to emerge robust evidence on the existence of complementarities among HPWS aspects on performances there is evidence of a general positive influence of the single practices. The results are quite sensible to the time lags, inducing to hypothesize that time varying heterogeneity is an important factor in determining the impact of organizational changes on economic performance. The implications of the analysis can be of help both to management and local level policy makers. Although the results are not simply extendible to other local production systems it may be argued that for contexts similar to the Reggio Emilia province, characterized by the presence of small and medium enterprises organized in districts and by a deep rooted unionism, with strong supporting institutions, the results and the implications here obtained can also fit well. However, a hope for future researches on the subject treated in the present work is that of collecting good quality information over wider geographical areas, possibly at national level, and repeated in time. Only in this way it is possible to solve the Gordian knot about the linkages between innovation, performance, high performance work practices and industrial relations...|$|E
40|$|Commercial heavy vehicles, unlike {{passenger}} vehicles, display huge {{variation in}} parameters such as vehicle mass. Coupled with lower actuation authorities (engine and brake capabilities), these variations can induce actuator saturation even in moderately demanding maneuvers, presenting {{challenge to the}} task of maintaining string stability in a platoon formation of heavy trucks. A new control scheme is proposed to put on-line bounds, or artificial saturation, on command signals via parameter estimation such that all members in a platoon can follow the reference commands without saturating actuators, thereby, maintaining string stability. This work also demonstrates two methods for obtaining an estimate of road grade using a Global Positioning System (GPS) system on a ground vehicle. In the first method, two antennae are used to directly measure the attitude of the vehicle in the pitch plane; in the second method, the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity at a single antenna is used to estimate road grade. The resulting grade measurements are then used together with engine torque information to produce estimates of mass, rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag from a simple <b>longitudinal</b> force <b>balance.</b> The resulting mass estimation consistently converged to within 2 % of the true vehicle mass.

40|$|Using Monte Carlo {{generators}} of the PYTHIA {{model for}} hadron-hadron collisions and a multi-phase transport (AMPT) model for nucleus-nucleus collisions, the longitudinal boost-invariance of charge balance function and its transverse momentum dependence are carefully studied. It {{shows that the}} charge balance function is boost-invariant in both p+ p and Au+Au collisions in these two models, consistent with experimental data. The balance function properly scaled by {{the width of the}} pseudorapidity window is independent of the position or the size of the window and is corresponding to the balance function of the whole pseudorapidity range. This <b>longitudinal</b> property of <b>balance</b> function also holds for particles in small transverse momentum ranges in the PYTHIA and the AMPT default models, but is violated in the AMPT with string melting. The physical origin of the results are discussed. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Using a <b>balanced</b> <b>longitudinal</b> {{data set}} on Italian {{manufacturing}} firms born in 1996 and active in 2000, we analyse the firm size dynamics. The {{aim is to}} assess the presence of non-linearities and/or discontinuities in the growth behaviour generated by the employment protection legislation (EPL), which is much stricter for firms with more than 15 employees (“articolo 18 Statuto dei Lavoratori”). Local regression estimates suggest that firms with an initial size close to 15 employees are more reluctant to grow. Furthermore, conditional density estimates show that firms close to the 15 employees threshold {{are more likely to}} move backward than upward with respect to this threshold. We interpret these results as a necessary but not sufficient evidence of a negative effect of the EPL. Indeed, they could also be consistent with optimal choices of growth behaviour regardless the strictness of EPL.

40|$|Background: Experimental studies {{including}} <b>longitudinal</b> nitrogen <b>balance</b> studies {{could provide}} insight into protein metabolism in pregnancy. Objective: Our aim {{was to determine the}} development of nitrogen balance during pregnancy compared with nitrogen balance before pregnancy in women consuming imposed constant diets. We also tracked changes in muscle mass and lean body mass by measuring urinary 3 -methylhistidine (3 -MeH) and urinary creatinine. Design: Nitrogen balance was determined over 8 d in 12 healthy Dutch women before pregnancy and at weeks 12, 23, and 34 of gestation. Complete daily diets were supplied during each balance period so that each subject's energy, protein, and macronutrient intakes were similar in amount and composition in all 4 balance periods. Results: Throughout pregnancy there was no significant change in loss of nitrogen in feces and therefore no change in protein digestibility. The amount of nitrogen excreted in urine in late pregnancy (11. 0 ± 1. 4 g/d) was significantly (P < 0. 01) less than in early pregnancy (12. 6 ± 1. 3 g/d). Nitrogen retention increased toward term, even though energy balance became progressively negative. The difference between the first (- 0. 4 ± 1. 7 g N/d) and third (1. 2 ± 1. 6 g N/d) trimester was significant (P < 0. 05). No differences were found in either 3 -MeH or creatinine excretion between trimesters. Conclusions: These urinary nitrogen excretion and nitrogen retention data show that when the dietary supply remains constant, nitrogen balance increases toward the end of pregnancy, suggesting a more efficient use of dietary protein later in pregnancy. Urinary 3 -MeH and creatinine excretion indicated no change in protein metabolism...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the impact of corporate research and development (R&D) activities on firm performance. To this end, the stochastic frontier technique is used on a unique <b>balanced</b> <b>longitudinal</b> dataset comparing top global software enterprises over the period 2005 - 2010. The software companies is divided into system software companies, application software companies and service software companies according to the types of product or service of software companies. In this framework, this study analyzes the effect of R&D, capital and employment on sales, and quantifies technical inefficiency of individual firms. The results of this study suggest that there are two ways in which R&D can influence the system software enterprise, one is to promote the frontier production function boundary forward, namely, to complete technological progress to improve the productivity of enterprise; another one is to improve the technical efficiency of enterprise and reduce waste. With respect to the application software enterprises, R&D can only improve productivity through technological progress; the effect of R&D on software service companies is not significant...|$|R
40|$|The charged {{particles}} storage capacity of microtraps (micro-Penning-Malmberg traps) with large length to radius aspect ratios and radii {{of the order}} of tens of microns was explored. Simulation studies of the motions of {{charged particles}} were conducted with particle-in-cell WARP code and the Charged Particle Optics (CPO) program. The new design of the trap consisted of an array of microtraps with substantially lower end electrodes potential than conventional Penning-Malmberg traps, which makes this trap quite portable. It was computationally shown that each microtrap with 50 micron radius stored positrons with a density (1. 6 x 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3) even higher than that in conventional Penning-Malmberg traps (about 10 ^ 11 cm^- 3) while the confinement voltage was only 10 V. It was presented in this work how to evaluate and lower the numerical noise by controlling the modeling parameters so the simulated plasma can evolve toward computational equilibrium. The local equilibrium distribution, where <b>longitudinal</b> force <b>balance</b> is satisfied along each magnetic field line, was attained in time scales of the simulation for plasmas initialized with a uniform density and Boltzmann energy distribution. The charge clouds developed the expected radial soft edge density distribution and rigid rotation evolved to some extent. To reach global equilibrium (i. e. rigid rotation) longer runs are required. The plasma confinement time and its thermalization were independent of the length. The length-dependency, reported in experiments, is due to fabrication and field errors. Computationally, more than one hundred million positrons were trapped in one microtrap with 50 micron radius and 10 cm length immersed in a 7 T uniform, axial magnetic field, and the density scaled as r^- 2 down to 3 micron. Larger densities were trapped with higher barrier potentials...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{global warming}} has greatly reduced {{the area of}} {{perennial}} sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, caused mountain glaciers to retreat and allowed major ice streams draining the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets to approach and even exceed surge velocities. This has brought new urgency to the concept that large ice sheets, past, present, and future, may {{have the capacity to}} self-destruct causing rapid and permanent changes in global climate and sea level. This possibility has focused attention on these ice streams, beginning with Jakobshavn Isbrae, long the world‘s fastest ice stream and discharging seven percent of Greenland ice, a discharge rate that has now doubled following catastrophic disintegration of its buttressing ice shelf in Jakobshavn Isfjord in 1997. A geometrical solution to the <b>longitudinal</b> force <b>balance</b> was combined with a simple mass balance to obtain two solutions to the resulting force-and-mass balance from 1986 to 2006. The two solutions are obtained using two approaches to quantify the loss of buttressing. The best match to changes in surface elevations and velocities along the ice stream, especially the rapidly lowering surface during this timespan, is provided by the solution that has the strongest reduction of ice-bed coupling up the ice stream, quantified by a rapid increase in the ―floating fraction‖ of ice. This pattern seems to be repeating for other Greenland and Antarctic ice streams. If rapid surface lowering and ice discharge spreads to all major ice streams and lasts for centuries, even accelerating over time, selfdestruction of these two remaining ice sheets seems inevitable. Without the high albedo of ice sheets, global warming would increase until a new global equilibrium with the new boundary conditions was established. The other possibility is the observed rapid ice thinning and discharge may be transient and lead to a new stable equilibrium that keeps these ice sheets largely intact with no significant change in global climate and sea level. Our results from Jakobshavn Isbrae were unable to determine which scenario is most likely, but time will tell, probably over the next few decades as observational data accumulate and our modeling capability improves...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Materials Science and Engineering Program, Washington State UniversityConventionally, non-neutral {{antimatter}} {{is stored}} using a Penning-Malmberg trap, a single tube with aspect ratios {{being of the}} order of less than 10 : 1. Parallel microtubes with aspect ratios of 1000 : 1 have the potential to store many orders of magnitude more with substantially lower end electrode potential than conventional traps. In this study, the charged particles storage capacity of these microtraps (micro-Penning-Malmberg traps) with radii {{of the order of}} tens of microns was explored. Simulation studies of the motions of charged particles were conducted with particle-in-cell plasma code WARP and the Charged Particle Optics (CPO) program. It was presented how to evaluate and lower the numerical noise by controlling the modeling parameters so the simulated plasma evolves toward computational equilibrium. The local equilibrium distribution, where <b>longitudinal</b> force <b>balance</b> is satisfied along each magnetic field line, was attained in 10 μs for plasmas initialized with a uniform density and Boltzmann energy distribution. To reach global equilibrium longer runs were performed using a fast particle mover code. Charge clouds developed the expected radial density distribution (that of a soft edge) and rigid rotation evolved to some extent. The plasma confinement time and its thermalization were independent of the length showing the length-dependency, reported in experiments, is due to fabrication and field asymmetries. Simulation demonstrated each microtrap with 50 µm radius immersed in a 7 T magnetic field could store positrons indefinitely with a density of 1. 6 × 1011 cm- 3 while the confinement voltage was only 10 V. For microtraps with radii between 100 μm and 3 μm, the particle density scaled as radius- 2. Plasma confinement time was also independent of trap length. A unique approach for the fabrication of long-aspect ratio microtubes was presented for 100 μm microtraps. Standard processes such as photolithography, deep reactive ion etching, sputtering and thermo-compression bonding were all used; however, unique methods of these processes were developed to overcome many engineering challenges and realize successful trapping. Positron losses occur in experimentation by trap imperfections such as misalignment of microtraps, asymmetries, and physical imperfections on the surfaces. This study described the fabrication issues encountered and addressed geometry errors and asymmetries. Department of Materials Science, Washington State Universit...|$|R
