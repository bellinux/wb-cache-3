40|$|Labour may impose severe pain, yet women {{experience}} {{the intensity of}} pain differently. The severity of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> is frequently underestimated by women, midwives and clinicians. Pain assessment is considered the key to <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> measurement and a standardised instrument can assist with adequate management of <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> Although a variety of pain assessment/measurement tools were found by a search conducted between 2000 and 2010, the tool charts are detailed and require time to complete, they do not cover all aspects of labour, and they avoid quantifying and documentation of <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> Developing a new multidimensional <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> assessment instrument could assist midwives and clinicians with <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> control.

Six steps of Blackburn and Waite (2006 : 134) guided development of the instrument that measures pain during the first stage of labour. This exploratory sequential mixed method study, using a qualitative and quantitative research design, described the development process of the new instrument. Four focus groups with four to six members comprising midwifery lecturers, midwives working in the private and public hospitals, midwives in private practice and obstetricians were conducted to develop the instrument. The instrument was thereafter given in two Delphi technique rounds to the most senior persons teaching Midwifery at all South African universities to verify the content and structure of the instrument. Data analysis of the focus groups followed the steps of data reduction, data display and verification as proposed by Miles and Huberman (1994 : 428 – 444) and the mean ratings of the Likert scale as determined by the university was presented in tables. The trustworthiness and validity and reliability (truth value) of the instrument were supported by using multiple types of data to develop the instrument.

A descriptive and exploratory approach was used to describe, evaluate, observe, explore and assemble new knowledge on assessment and measurement of pain during the first stage of labour. Development of the instrument was addressed in the literature chapter. The research was conducted in three phases, combining qualitative and quantitative research. During phase one, the instrument was refined in two stages. Focus group interviews were conducted with members regarded as knowledgeable in the field of normal labour who evaluated the face and content validity of the instrument. The most senior people teaching Midwifery at all South African universities evaluated the face and content validity of the instrument with an open-ended questionnaire thereafter, using the Delphi technique. The analysis of the first Delphi round was compared to the focus group analysis. The instrument was altered and submitted to the Delphi experts in a second open-ended questionnaire to confirm the alterations. During phase two, the altered instrument was tested in private and provincial hospitals. Testing of the altered <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> assessment instrument on patients in active labour yielded quantitative data. A statistician at the University of Johannesburg was consulted to assist with tabulation, frequencies and statistical tests needed. The midwives from the private and provincial hospitals also completed the second Delphi open-ended questionnaire. A Likert scale was included in the second Delphi instrument as midwives have less time available to complete questionnaires. The qualitative analysis of their responses was compared to those of the second Delphi round experts to avoid an inflated estimate of validity that might have been brought forth by the very small second Delphi round sample. The instrument was finally altered and, during phase three, guidelines were developed on how to implement the <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> assessment instrument in nursing practice. The experts concluded the instrument as a simple tool that can measure and assist with <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> control, assess the progress of labour and the patient’s condition, assist with training, guide inexperienced midwives in pain assessment and serve as a research tool. The <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> assessment instrument can be a valuable tool in assisting clinicians and midwives with <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> control during the first stage of labour and initiate standards for pain measurement.

40|$|Abstract Background A cross-national {{comparison}} of Belgian and Dutch childbearing women {{allows us to}} gain insight into {{the relative importance of}} pain acceptance and personal control in pain relief in 2 maternity care models. Although Belgium and the Netherlands are neighbouring countries sharing the same language, political system and geography, they are characterised by a different organisation of health care, particularly in maternity care. In Belgium the medical risks of childbirth are emphasised but neutralised by a strong belief in the merits of the medical model. <b>Labour</b> <b>pain</b> is perceived as a needless inconvenience easily resolved by means of pain medication. In the Netherlands the midwifery model of care defines childbirth as a normal physiological process and family event. <b>Labour</b> <b>pain</b> is perceived as an ally in the birth process. Methods Women were {{invited to participate in the}} study by independent midwives and obstetricians during antenatal visits in 2004 - 2005. Two questionnaires were filled out by 611 women, one at 30 weeks of pregnancy and one within the first 2 weeks after childbirth either at home or in a hospital. However, only women having a hospital birth without obstetric intervention (N = 327) were included in this analysis. A logistic regression analysis has been performed. Results <b>Labour</b> <b>pain</b> acceptance and personal control in pain relief render pain medication use during labour less likely, especially if they occur together. Apart from this general result, we also find large country differences. Dutch women with a normal hospital birth are six times less likely to use <b>pain</b> medication during <b>labour,</b> compared to their Belgian counterparts. This country difference cannot be explained by <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> acceptance, since - in contrast to our working hypothesis - Dutch and Belgian women giving birth in a hospital setting are characterised by a similar <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> acceptance. Our findings suggest that personal control in pain relief can partially explain the country differences in coping with <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> For Dutch women we find that the use of pain medication is lowest if women experience control over the reception of pain medication and have a positive attitude towards <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> In Belgium however, not personal control over the use of pain relief predicts the use of pain medication, but negative attitudes towards labour. Conclusions Apart from individual level determinants, such as length of <b>labour</b> or <b>pain</b> acceptance, our findings suggest that the maternity care context is of major importance in the study of the management of <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> The pain medication use in Belgian hospital maternity care is high and is very sensitive to negative attitudes towards <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> In the Netherlands, on the contrary, pain medication use is already low. This can partially be explained by a low degree of personal control in pain relief, especially when co-occurring with positive pain attitudes. </p...|$|R
60|$|The {{news was}} {{imparted}} with a circumspection recalling the ceremonial {{usage of the}} Sublime Porte by the second female infirmarian to the junior medical officer in residence, who in his turn announced to the delegation that an heir had been born, When he had betaken himself to the women's apartment to assist at the prescribed ceremony of the afterbirth {{in the presence of}} the secretary of state for domestic affairs and the members of the privy council, silent in unanimous exhaustion and approbation the delegates, chafing under the length and solemnity of their vigil and hoping that the joyful occurrence would palliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and obstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of tongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring to urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the display of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among tempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively eviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean section, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form, with respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs Murder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate Bushe which secured the acquittal of the wrongfully accused, the rights of primogeniture and king's bounty touching twins and triplets, miscarriages and infanticides, simulated or dissimulated, the acardiac foetus in foetu and aprosopia due to a congestion, the agnathia of certain chinless Chinamen (cited by Mr Candidate Mulligan) in consequence of defective reunion of the maxillary knobs along the medial line so that (as he said) one ear could hear what the other spoke, the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep, the prolongation of <b>labour</b> <b>pains</b> in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein, the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid (as exemplified in the actual case) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix, artificial insemination by means of syringes, involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause, the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape, that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers Sturzgeburt, the recorded instances of multiseminal, twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents--in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations. The gravest problems of obstetrics and forensic medicine were examined with as much animation as the most popular beliefs on the state of pregnancy such as the forbidding to a gravid woman to step over a countrystile lest, by her movement, the navelcord should strangle her creature and the injunction upon her in the event of a yearning, ardently and ineffectually entertained, to place her hand against that part of her person which long usage has consecrated as the seat of castigation. The abnormalities of harelip, breastmole, supernumerary digits, negro's inkle, strawberry mark and portwine stain were alleged by one as a prima facie and natural hypothetical explanation of those swineheaded (the case of Madame Grissel Steevens was not forgotten) or doghaired infants occasionally born. The hypothesis of a plasmic memory, advanced by the Caledonian envoy and worthy of the metaphysical traditions of the land he stood for, envisaged in such cases an arrest of embryonic development at some stage antecedent to the human. An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views, with such heat as almost carried conviction, the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes, his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his words was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had been evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of pleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as the supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously, a heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr Candidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created in the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty by mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant submittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he delivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Labour</b> <b>pain</b> is a {{major concern}} for women, their {{partners}} and maternity health care professionals. However, little is known about Dutch midwives' perceptions of working with women experiencing <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} explore midwives' perceptions of supporting women in dealing with <b>pain</b> during <b>labour.</b> METHODS: We conducted a qualitative focus group study with four focus groups, including a total of 23 midwives from 23 midwifery practices across the country. Purposive sampling was used to select the practices. The constant comparison method of Glaser and Straus (1967, ren. 1995) was used to gain an understanding of midwives' perceptions regarding <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> management. RESULTS: We found two main themes. The first theme concerned the midwives' experienced professional role conflict, which was reflected in their approach of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> management along a spectrum from "working with pain" to a "pain relief" approach. The second theme identified situational factors, including time constraints; discontinuity of care; role of the partner; and various cultural influences, that altered the context in which care was provided and how midwives saw their professional role. CONCLUSION: Midwives felt challenged by the need to balance their professional attitude towards normal birth and <b>labour</b> <b>pain,</b> which favours working with pain, with the shift in society towards a wider acceptance of pharmacological <b>pain</b> management during <b>labour.</b> This shift compelled them to redefine their professional identity...|$|R
30|$|Studies {{related to}} women’s memory of labour and {{delivery}} have generally {{concluded that there}} is significant individual variation in women’s recollection of <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> Studies related to women’s memory of labour and birth have generally concluded that women’s recall of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> significantly depends on individual variations. In one of these studies, Waldenström et al. (2003) reported that over time, many women remember <b>labour</b> and birth <b>pain</b> as being less severe than they originally recalled. Another study conducted in 1383 women who provided complete data up to 5  years after the birth showed that memory of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> declines during the observation period but not in women with a negative overall experience of childbirth (Waldenstrom and Schytt 2009). Our results {{are similar to the}} ones in the literature. Women reported significantly lower pain score in the postpartum period (12  h after the birth) according to <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> in our study. These findings suggest that women tend to reduce their rating of the pain over time. Therefore, preparing women psychologically and socially for childbirth could help most of them how their memory of labour and birth are shaped.|$|R

Its intensity varied considerably and was related to parity and the duration of the first stage of labour reflecting underlying differences in levels of noxious stimulation. Other obstetric and pharmacological factors which might affect noxious stimulation were not significantly related to pain scores. Induction was related to higher,and complications of pregnancy, to lower levels of pain attributable to psychological modulation. The desirability of pregnancy, positive and accurate expectations of birth, ante-natal training and the welcomed presence of the husband at the birth were associated with significantly lower levels of <b>labour</b> <b>pain,</b> particularly of non-sensory pain. A few subjects had very minimal previous experience of pain. These subjects had the lowest levels of pain in childbirth, perhaps because they were relatively insensitive to noxious stimulation. Subjects whose previous experience of pain had been extensive had significantly lower levels of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> than subjects whose previous pain experience had been more limited. Subjects who had extensive experience of pain used a larger number of strategies to cope with that pain than subjects whose experience had been more moderate.

The {{aim of this study}} was to inquire into women’s perceptions and experience of <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> and how women cope with pain. Using the narrative inquiry methodology, five low risk pregnant Ghanaian women; two nulliparous and three multiparas were purposefully selected. Tape-recorded conversations, writing of field notes and journals were used as the main source of data collection before delivery and within one week after delivery. The women’s perception of pain before and after delivery was used to construct narrative accounts from which the findings of the study were generated. To ensure credibility of each narrative account, the interim narrative accounts constructed by the researcher were sent to the women to read and respond to. The findings revealed that before the labour experience, women perceived labour as a painful experience expected to be endured. Antenatal education on <b>labour</b> <b>pain</b> management was inadequate. Additionally use of pain relief methods was lacking although women expressed need for pain relief. Furthermore the findings revealed inadequate physical and emotional support for women in labour to help cope with <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> In conclusion the researcher recommends that midwives in consultation with clients adopt a more active method of assessing <b>labour</b> <b>pain.</b> Also antenatal education on pain relief options must be provided.
