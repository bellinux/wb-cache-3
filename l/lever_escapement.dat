25|$|Such springs were {{essential}} in modern watches with a detached <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> {{because they can}} be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached verge escapement. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Two other makers {{also made}} {{precision}} watches with the detached escapement: Josiah Emery and John Brockbank. Both were friends of Arnold, and both employed the highly skilled workman and escapement maker Thomas Earnshaw. Josiah Emery used, with Arnold's permission, an earlier form of his compensation balance and helical balance spring, {{in conjunction with}} the detached <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> of Thomas Mudge. John Brockbank employed Earnshaw to make his pattern of chronometer, but with Brockbank's design of compensation balance.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>lever</b> <b>escapements</b> lacked draw (indeed some makers {{considered}} it injurious {{as a cause}} of extra friction in unlocking); as a result a jolt could result in the escapement unlocking.|$|R
50|$|Mechanical watches {{today are}} mostly sold to buyers who value {{craftsmanship}} and aesthetics over very accurate timing. Most tourbillons use standard Swiss <b>lever</b> <b>escapements,</b> but some have a detent escapement.|$|R
5000|$|Jewel bearings, {{introduced}} in England in 1702 by the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, also came into use for quality watches during this period. Watches {{of this period}} are characterised by their thinness. New innovations, such as the cylinder and <b>lever</b> <b>escapements,</b> allowed watches to become much thinner than they had previously been. This caused a change in style. The thick pocketwatches based on the verge movement went out of fashion and were only worn by the poor, and were derisively referred to as [...] "onions" [...] and [...] "turnips".|$|R
50|$|Invented around 1974 and {{patented}} in 1980 by English watchmaker George Daniels, the Co-axial escapement is {{a modification}} of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> with some features of the detent escapement. Considered {{by some to be}} one of the most significant horological advancements since the invention of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> the co-axial escapement functions with a system of 3 pallets that separates the locking function from the impulse, avoiding the sliding friction of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement.</b> This makes lubrication of the pallets unnecessary and thereby eliminates one of the shortcomings of the traditional <b>lever</b> <b>escapement.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> {{was invented}} by British clockmaker Thomas Mudge around 1755, and {{improved}} by Abraham-Louis Breguet (1787), Peter Litherland (1791), Edward Massey (1800), and its modern ("table roller") form was developed by George Savage in the early 1800s. [...] Since about 1900 virtually every mechanical watch, alarm clock and other portable timepiece has used the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement.</b>|$|E

This rotates the verge 8 which pulls down the front pawl 9, releasing the first matrix in the magazine channel. The rotation of the verge also raises rear pawl 8 to hold the second matrix.|$|R
5000|$|By 1840 Wornum had {{improved}} his grand actions {{by adding a}} sustaining spring tying the hammer butt and {{the short end of}} the crank lever, intended to improve repetition and [...] "assist in the forte," [...] but eventually abandoned the inverted construction due to its inconvenient form and turned his attention instead to manufacturing [...] "overstruck" [...] or downstriking horizontal pianos, where the hammers are located above the strings. In 1842 he patented the application of mobile hammer return springs to downstriking actions for grands and squares, and included claims for a new disposition of the crank <b>lever</b> and <b>escapement,</b> as well as a method of operating the damper in uprights with a leather strip attached either to the hammer butt or to a wire fixed in the key.|$|R
5000|$|In early {{watches the}} pallet fork and the lever were made as {{separate}} components and joined together. In later watches {{they were made}} as a single component {{as shown in the}} picture. The combined component is often referred to simply as the [...] "lever". In a straight line Swiss <b>lever</b> type <b>escapement,</b> the <b>lever</b> is shaped like a 'T' or an anchor, which gives this escapement its alternative name of anchor <b>escapement.</b> The <b>lever</b> is pivoted in the center; in operation it rocks back and forth. [...] On the arms of the 'T' are angled surfaces called pallets which alternately engage the teeth of the escapement's escape wheel. The central shaft of the lever ends in a fork, which gives pushes to the balance wheel's impulse pin, which is set off center in a disk on the balance wheel's shaft. To reduce friction, the pallets are made of precisely shaped pieces of ruby jewel. The pallet which the teeth first contact is called the entry pallet, while the other one is called the exit pallet.|$|R

50|$|In the 18th {{century the}} {{original}} verge escapement, which required a fusee, was gradually replaced in better French watches with the cylinder escapement, and in British watches with the duplex escapement. Then in the 19th century both were superseded by the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> {{which has been}} used almost exclusively ever since. A cheaper version of the lever, the pin <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> patented in 1867 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in inexpensive watches until the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Breguet's most {{remarkable}} piece anticipated the wristwatch by a century; he designed this, {{together with his}} friend John Arnold, for Caroline Bonaparte, Queen of Naples, in 1810. Many honours recognised his enormous contribution to horology. Each watch from his workshops demonstrated the latest horological improvements in an original movement, mostly fitted with <b>lever</b> or ruby-cylinder <b>escapements</b> that he perfected. Breguet took refuge in Switzerland from {{the excesses of the}} French Revolution. He returned to Paris overflowing with the ideas that produced the Breguet balance-spring, his first carriage clock (sold to House of Bonaparte), the sympathique clock and its dependent watch, the tact watch, and finally the tourbillon, patented in 1801.|$|R
50|$|In 1856 A. N. Wornum {{patented}} {{improvements to}} downstriking actions with a spring {{to keep the}} crank lever in constant contact with the key, {{as well as a}} new arrangement for the regulating button to allow easier adjustment and a method for improving repetition with a spring, and in 1862 patented further improvements with the aim of rendering the action very compact by moving the dampers below the hammers and operating them by projections attached at the far ends of the <b>escapement</b> <b>levers.</b> He also claimed a pivoting stand for square pianos {{in order for them to}} swing up and out of the way when not in use.|$|R
5000|$|In the 20th century William Hamilton Shortt {{invented a}} free {{pendulum}} clock, patented in September 1921 and manufactured by the Synchronome Company, with an accuracy of one hundredth {{of a second}} a day. In this system the timekeeping [...] "master" [...] pendulum, whose rod is made from a special steel alloy with 36% nickel called Invar whose length changes very little with temperature, swings as free of external influence as possible sealed in a vacuum chamber and does no work. It is in mechanical contact with its escapement for {{only a fraction of}} a second every 30 seconds. A secondary [...] "slave" [...] pendulum turns a ratchet, which triggers an electromagnet slightly less than every thirty seconds. This electromagnet releases a gravity <b>lever</b> onto the <b>escapement</b> above the master pendulum. A fraction of a second later (but exactly every 30 seconds), the motion of the master pendulum releases the gravity lever to fall farther. In the process, the gravity lever gives a tiny impulse to the master pendulum, which keeps that pendulum swinging. The gravity lever falls onto a pair of contacts, completing a circuit that does several things: ...|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Mudge (1715 [...] - [...] 14 November 1794 London) was an English horologist {{who invented}} the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> the {{greatest}} single improvement ever applied to pocket watches.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, {{after the}} {{successful}} development of Calibre 2500, Omega made history by introducing the first mass-produced watch incorporating the coaxial escapement â€” invented by English watchmaker George Daniels. Considered {{by many to}} be one of the more significant horological advances since the invention of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> the coaxial escapement functions with virtually no lubrication, thereby eliminating one of the shortcomings of the traditional <b>lever</b> <b>escapement.</b> Through using radial friction instead of sliding friction at the impulse surfaces the coaxial escapement significantly reduces friction, theoretically resulting in longer service intervals and greater accuracy over time.|$|E
50|$|Between 1730 and 1738, Graham had as an {{apprentice}} Thomas Mudge, {{who went on to}} be an eminent watchmaker in his own right, and invented the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> an important development for pocket watches.|$|E
50|$|A jeweled {{watch with}} a <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> should contain at least 7 jewels. The seven jewels are; 2 hole jewels and 2 cap jewels for the pivots {{of the balance}} wheel staff (arbor), one impulse (roller) jewel, and 2 pallet jewels.|$|E
50|$|Such springs were {{essential}} in modern watches with a detached <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> {{because they can}} be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached verge escapement. It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Around 1755, if not earlier, Mudge {{invented the}} {{detached}} <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> which he first {{applied to a}} clock, but which, in watches, can be considered the greatest single improvement ever applied to them, and which remains a feature in almost every pocket timekeeper made {{up to and including}} the present day.|$|E
50|$|A cheaper, less {{accurate}} {{version of}} the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> is used in alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the late 1970s, cheap watches, called the Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet escapement after Georges Frederic Roskopf, who invented it in 1867. It functions similarly to the lever, except that the lever pallet jewels are replaced by vertical metal pins. In a <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> the pallets have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which must be carefully adjusted to the correct angles. In the pin pallet escapement, these two faces are designed {{into the shape of}} the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating complicated adjustments. The pins are located symmetrically on the lever, making beat adjustment simpler. Watches that used these escapements were called pin lever watches, and have been superseded by cheap quartz watches.|$|E
50|$|The pin pallet {{escapement}} {{was widely}} used as it had many {{of the advantages of}} the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> but was easier to manufacture. The pallets in a traditional <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> have two angled faces, the locking face and the impulse face, which engage the escape wheel teeth. They must be adjusted to precisely correct angles for the escapement to function. In the {{pin pallet escapement}} these faces are designed into the shape of the escape wheel teeth instead, eliminating the need for costly adjustments. However, the metal pins used instead of pallets have much higher friction than jewelled pallets, and combined with the looser manufacturing tolerances this made pin pallet timepieces less accurate. The metal pins also wear more quickly. Pin pallet timepieces are usually too cheap to justify repairing, and are usually thrown away when they break down or wear out.|$|E
50|$|The {{reliability}} of the modern <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> depends upon draw; the pallets are angled so that the escape wheel must recoil a small amount during the unlocking. The draw holds the lever against the banking pins during the detached portion of the operating cycle. Draw angle is typically about 11-15 degrees to the radial.|$|E
5000|$|A Roskopf, pin-lever, or pin-pallet {{escapement}} is an inexpensive, less accurate {{version of}} the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> used in mechanical alarm clocks, kitchen timers, mantel clocks and, until the 1970s, cheap watches now known as pin lever watches. It was patented by German watchmaker Georges Frederic Roskopf in 1867, suggested to Roskopf by Jules Grossmann.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{escapement}} had disadvantages which limited {{its use in}} watches: it was {{fragile and}} required skilled maintenance; it was not self-starting, so if the watch was jarred in use so the balance wheel stopped, it would not start up again; and it was harder to manufacture in volume. Therefore, the self-starting <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> became dominant in watches.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> {{invented by}} Thomas Mudge in 1750, {{has been used}} in the vast {{majority}} of watches since the 19th century. Its advantages are (1) it is a [...] "detached" [...] escapement; unlike the cylinder or duplex escapements the balance wheel is only in contact with the lever during the short impulse period when it swings through its centre position and swings freely the rest of its cycle, increasing accuracy, and (2) it is a self-starting escapement, so if the watch is shaken so that the balance wheel stops, it will automatically start again. The original form was the rack <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> in which the lever and the balance wheel were always in contact via a gear rack on the lever. Later, it was realized that all the teeth from the gears could be removed except one, and this created the detached <b>lever</b> <b>escapement.</b> British watchmakers used the English detached lever, in which the lever was at right angles to the balance wheel. Later Swiss and American manufacturers used the inline lever, in which the lever is inline between the balance wheel and the escape wheel; this is the form used in modern watches. In 1867 Georges Frederic Roskopf invented an inexpensive, less accurate form called the Roskopf or pin-pallet escapement, which was used in cheap [...] "dollar watches" [...] in the early 20th century and is still used in cheap alarm clocks and kitchen timers.|$|E
50|$|Peter Litherland (1756-1805) was a British watchmaker and inventor. He {{was born}} in Warrington and later moved to Liverpool, which was then {{the centre of the}} watchmaking trade. In 1791 he {{patented}} the rack <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> for watches, which was more accurate than the commonly used verge escapement. One of his watches is in display in the World Museum Liverpool.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} is that this enables both impulses to occur on or around the centre line, with disengaging friction in both directions. Because of this, the coaxial escapement should in theory perform effectively without lubrication.This mode of impulse is in theory superior to the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement,</b> which has engaging friction on the entry pallet. For long this was recognized as a disturbing influence on the isochronism of the balance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pallet fork}} is a {{component}} of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> of a mechanical watch. The pallet fork and the lever form one component that sits between the escape wheel and the balance wheel. Its purpose is to lock the escape wheel, and release it one tooth at a time at each swing of the balance wheel, and also give the balance wheel small pushes to keep it going.|$|E
50|$|From about 1860, key winding was {{replaced}} by keyless winding, where the watch was wound by turning the crown. The pin pallet escapement, an inexpensive version of the <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> invented in 1876 by Georges Frederic Roskopf was used in cheap mass-produced watches, which allowed ordinary workers to own a watch for the first time; other cheap watches used a simplified version of the duplex escapement, developed by Daniel Buck in the 1870s.|$|E
50|$|The duplex watch {{escapement}} {{was invented}} by Robert Hooke around 1700, improved by Jean Baptiste Dutertre and Pierre Le Roy, and put in final form by Thomas Tyrer, who patented it in 1782.The early forms had two escape wheels. The duplex escapement was difficult to make but achieved much higher accuracy than the cylinder escapement, and could equal that of the (early) <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> and when carefully made was {{almost as good as}} a detent escapement.|$|E
50|$|Two other makers {{also made}} {{precision}} watches with the detached escapement: Josiah Emery and John Brockbank. Both were friends of Arnold, and both employed the highly skilled workman and escapement maker Thomas Earnshaw. Josiah Emery used, with Arnold's permission, an earlier form of his compensation balance and helical balance spring, {{in conjunction with}} the detached <b>lever</b> <b>escapement</b> of Thomas Mudge. John Brockbank employed Earnshaw to make his pattern of chronometer, but with Brockbank's design of compensation balance.|$|E
