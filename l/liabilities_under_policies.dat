50|$|Maloney's {{initiative}} to implement firearm liability insurance has been met with widespread criticism from pro-gun advocates.

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the present value}} of state pension <b>liabilities</b> <b>under</b> existing <b>policies,</b> and separately <b>under</b> <b>policy</b> changes that would affect pension payouts including cost of living adjustments (COLAs), retirement ages, and buyout schedules for early retirement. Liabilities if plans were frozen as of June 2009 would be $ 3. 2 trillion if capitalized using taxable municipal curves, which credit states for a possibility of default in the same states of the world as general obligation debt, and $ 4. 4 trillion using the Treasury curve. Under the typical actuarial method of recognizing future service and wage increases, liabilities are $ 3. 6 trillion and $ 5. 2 trillion using municipal curves and Treasury curves respectively. Compared to $ 1. 8 trillion in pension fund assets, the baseline level of unfunded liabilities is therefore around $ 3 trillion under Treasury rates. A one percentage point reduction in COLAs would reduce total liabilities by 9 ‐ 11 %, implementing actuarially fair early retirement could reduce them by 2 ‐ 5 %, and raising the retirement age by one year would reduce them by 2 ‐ 4 %. Even relatively dramatic policy changes, such as the elimination of COLAs or the implementation of Social Security retirement age parameters, would leave liabilities around $ 1. 5 trillion more than plan assets under Treasury discounting. This suggests that taxpayers will bear the lion's share of the costs associated with the legacy liabilities of state DB pension plans. ...|$|R

5000|$|Liability {{insurance}} {{is designed to}} offer specific protection against third-party insurance claims, i.e., payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to someone suffering loss {{who is not a}} party to the insurance contract. In general, damage caused intentionally as well as contractual liability are not covered <b>under</b> <b>liability</b> insurance <b>policies.</b> When a claim is made, the insurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured. The legal costs of a defence normally do not affect policy limits unless the policy expressly states otherwise; this default rule is useful because defence costs tend to soar when cases go to trial. In many cases, the defense portion of the policy is actually more valuable than the insurance, as in complicated cases, the cost of defending the case might be more than the amount being claimed, especially in so-called [...] "nuisance" [...] cases where there is no liability but the case has to be defended anyway.|$|R

5000|$|The Marine Insurance Act includes, as a schedule, a {{standard}} policy (known as the [...] "SG form"), which parties were {{at liberty to}} use if they wished. Because each term in the policy had been tested through at least two centuries of judicial precedent, the policy was extremely thorough. However, it was also expressed in rather archaic terms. In 1991, the London market produced a new standard policy wording known as the MAR 91 form using the Institute Clauses. The MAR form is simply a general statement of insurance; the Institute Clauses are used to set out the detail of the insurance cover. In practice, the policy document usually consists of the MAR form used as a cover, with the Clauses stapled to the inside. Typically, each clause will be stamped, with the stamp overlapping both onto the inside cover and to other clauses; this practice is used to avoid the substitution or removal of clauses.because marine insurance is typically underwritten on a subscription basis, the MAR form begins: We, the Underwriters, agree to bind ourselves each for his own part and not one for another .... In legal terms, <b>liability</b> <b>under</b> the <b>policy</b> is several and not joint, i.e., the underwriters are all liable together, but only for their share or proportion of the risk. If one underwriter should default, the remainder are not liable to pick {{his share of the}} claim. Typically, marine insurance is split between the vessels and the cargo. Insurance of the vessels is generally known as [...] "Hull and Machinery" [...] (H&M). A more restricted form of cover is [...] "Total Loss Only" [...] (TLO), generally used as a reinsurance, which only covers the total loss of the vessel and not any partial loss. Cover may be on either a [...] "voyage" [...] or [...] "time" [...] basis. The [...] "voyage" [...] basis covers transit between the ports set out in the policy; the [...] "time" [...] basis covers a period, typically one year, and is more common.|$|R
