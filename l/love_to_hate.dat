25|$|Some manga are {{completely}} drawn in the bishonen style, such as Saint Seiya. Bishōnen manga are generally shōjo manga (girls' comics) or yaoi (girls' comics focused on homosexual relationships between beautiful boys), however shōnen manga (boy's comics) may use casts of bishōnen characters for crossover appeal to female readers. Mainstream shounen and seinen fare also often uses such characters as rivals for a traditional masculine protagonist, {{with some degree}} of comic relief, or for the blander everyman, whether as the embodiment of his insecurities in a grittier realism, or as a more lighthearted constant reminder of his less than advantageous social status and the constraints thereof. Comics for younger boys tend to use arrogant bishounen {{in the role of the}} recurring minor rivals readers <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hate,</b> though their effeminate good looks there will often appear older, bigger, stronger, and thus in fact more masculine than the commonly shorter and less mature protagonists.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{reactions from}} critics.

It would be a different show if there weren't characters like Terri or Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), otherwise you'd be at Disneyland. It would be the happiest place on Earth." [...] Gilsig {{does not know how}} long her character will feature in the series, and has explained [...] "When Terri was created, she was created obviously to be an obstacle between Emma and Will.

500|$|Josh Mapes of The Biography Channel listed {{her in the}} {{category}} [...] "10 Primetime Stars We Love to Hate". He said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain.

From tongue lashings to catfights, underhanded tricks to boldface lies, the characters we <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> have each brought a fair share of great moments to primetime soaps. While Larry Hagman played the bad guy on Dallas, Donna Mills played bad girl on its spin-off, Knots Landing. Unapologetically going after what she wanted, Mills' character engaged in affairs with two of the husbands on the Knots Landing cul-de-sac. But, like most vixens on primetime soaps, she was only out for money, not love." [...] Steve Eighinger of the Quincy Newspapers listed Abby as the third-most memorable TV character in an article he wrote for the Quincy Herald-Whig. He said, [...] "No one, absolutely no one, rocked eye shadow and the messy-hair look like Abby Ewing, who was this marvelous combination of vixen and corporate sleuth.

No points for current wife Rebecca, ten for naming Lynn, Gail, or Christina Alessi, and 1,400 points for remembering first wife, plumber Terry [...] Yes, Paul's been around the block." [...] They also branded him as the reason Neighbours, in their opinion was good viewing in the 2000s adding: [...] "It's his cackling soap villain role that we <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> him for: his return in 2004, torching Lassiter's and befriending Dylan, marked the start of Neighbours getting awesome in the mid-noughties.

And that's not all: fraud, blackmail, murder; there is no level to which Paul wouldn't have sunk. Yet, the infamous bad boy of Erinsborough, has, thankfully, turned over a new leaf." ...|$|E

While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree on her belly) really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all worth it to realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally love how Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion.

500|$|Steiger {{was one of}} Hollywood's most {{respected}} character actors; Hutchinson described him as [...] "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars". Yet for Hutchinson, Steiger remained [...] "out of sympathy with Hollywood" [...] during his career, believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older. Steiger was an [...] "effusive talent" [...] according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times, and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters. After On the Waterfront (1954), Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains, and grew increasingly frustrated playing the [...] "Mafia heavy or a near-psychopath" [...] during the 1970s, roles which he could play menacingly, but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent. Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as [...] "the Screen's No.1 Bad Man", while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as [...] "the man you would <b>love</b> <b>to</b> <b>hate</b> {{if you had the}} coverage". A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an [...] "angry, hot-tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents, [...] works best only at emotional white heat", and remarked that he found it [...] "stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life". Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he [...] "often seems to take over a picture even when he isn't in the lead". The journal Films and Filming, surveying his career in 1971, noted that his talent [...] "developed steadily through films good and bad", and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded, citing a 1956 interview where he said [...] "I pity the player who can't keep his feet on the ground. It's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still." ...|$|E
