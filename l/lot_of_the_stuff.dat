There’s MiniDV, there’s 3200 black-and-white stills, there’s digital stills, some of them emailed on the day they were taken from as far off as Greenland. There was three or four different types of animation. One of the animators is from New Zealand and emailed me his work. There’s JPEG stuff." ...|$|E

[...] "After they got rid of us, they brought on Chris Columbus", Murphy stated. [...] "Then I heard they did tests of apes skiing, which didn't make much sense." [...] Stan Winston was still working on the makeup designs. Columbus brought Sam Hamm, his co-writer on an unproduced Fantastic Four script, to write the screenplay. [...] "We tried to do a story that was simultaneously a homage to the elements we liked from the five films, and would also incorporate {{a lot of material}} [...] that had been jettisoned from the earlier production," [...] Hamm continued. [...] "The first half of the script bore little resemblance to the book, but a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> in the second half comes directly from it, or directly inspired by it." ...|$|E

500|$|Weiland's lyrics were {{unique to}} {{previous}} albums, {{which had been}} solely focused on himself and his drug addictions. He studied lyricists {{to learn how to}} write differently. [...] " [...] the '90s, I was so overwhelmed with my heroin addiction, and so a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> was just from my point of view. Now, I tend {{to look at some of}} the greats like Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. I look at their storytelling [...] I try to tell stories. Every song doesn't have to be narcissistically written about how I feel on that day." [...] Stone Temple Pilots became the third album Weiland had ever recorded sober, after Velvet Revolver's Libertad and Stone Temple Pilot's first album, Core. Weiland was also influenced by his ex-wife, Mary Forsberg, about whom he specifically wrote on [...] "Cinnamon". Weiland's inspiration for [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] came from the music itself. He explained his lyrics succinctly: [...] "When I first heard , it sounded intergalactic." [...] Critics and interviewers of the band noticed that Weiland's vocalizations were drawn from David Bowie.|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with reporters on August 21, 2012, Daniels {{announced}} that this would be the final season of the series. Daniels said, [...] "This year feels like the last chance to really go out together and make an artistic ending for the show that pays off a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> that matters most to fans." [...] Daniels also said all the questions would be answered, such as who was behind the documentary, and why they had been filming it for so long, as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler. A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Pete Miller (Jake Lacy). According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine, the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers; he noted that [...] "the triangle [...] has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room, which tells me even they don't know at this point which guy Erin will choose." [...] Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input, as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin's characterization.|$|E
500|$|Soviet Strike {{received}} criticism {{regarding the}} player's limited {{view of his}} surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it. To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team {{did not wish to}} alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and [...] "a lot more visual and audible clues". Producer Kosaka explained: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> we couldn't fit in [...] is going in this one". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among other new additions, as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more [...] "pulse pounding" [...] music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman. This latter shoot also employed a live tiger.|$|E

It is my narrative, and my voice and my songs. I started off giving Richard a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> songs, 60 or 60-plus - he had the editorship." ...|$|R
5000|$|As for <b>the</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 41 stories, Lane, in an {{interview}} given for the 2005 DVD edition of Shattered Glass, said, [...] "In fact, I'd bet <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> in those other 14 is fake too. ... It's not like we're vouching for those 14, that they're true. They're probably not either." [...] Rolling Stone, George, and Harper's also re-examined his contributions. Rolling Stone and Harper's found the material generally accurate yet maintained they {{had no way of}} verifying information because Glass had cited anonymous sources. George discovered that at least three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stories Glass wrote for it contained fabrications. Specifically, Glass fabricated quotations in a profile piece and apologized to the article's subject, Vernon Jordan, an adviser to then-President Bill Clinton. A court filing for Glass's application to the California bar gave an updated count on his journalism career: 36 of his stories at The New Republic were said to be fabricated in part or in whole, along with three articles for George, two articles for Rolling Stone, and one for Policy Review.|$|R

500|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this voice like you're entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you don't think that's going to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "There's no disclaimer on [...] at all, because it's two heterosexual men, and they're making fun of heterosexuality... because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellen's coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] " [...] is so gay it's excluding a large part of our society. A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> on it is somewhat of an inside joke. It's one thing to have a gay lead character, but it's another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E
2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is no way that I could ever play again a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|E

This guy was {{like some kind of}} savant or genius or something, But they had some kind of real big comedic influence on me, like I liked those cartoons, I think that was my first real big comedy influence, was a rabbit." ...|$|E

I mean, all the bands say they try to make the strongest album, but this time, I think we will really do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|There were {{positive}} reviews of Campus. Rob Clyne wrote for Sabotage Times that: [...] "The overall picture of Campus isn't yet a clear one. At times it {{feels a little}} like a few sketches have been slung together, especially as a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jonty <b>stuff</b> comes out of nowhere. But these are only small gripes - Campus is hugely original, some may say it is genre defining. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but this is pure entertainment which doesn't need to fall under a specific category." ...|$|R
2500|$|You, Me, and Everyone We Know's music {{falls under}} the rock and pop genres. [...] The band's {{influences}} include Joe Cocker, Andrew W.K., and Schuylar Croom, lead vocalist of the band He Is Legend. They have also been compared to others such as The Format, fun. and Panic! at the Disco. [...] Of the band's lyrics and music, Liebsch has said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> {{is a mix of}} what sits {{in the back of your}} head", and, [...] "Most of the songs are more cautionary tales than anything else.

He also backed {{an amendment to the}} state constitution to define marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman while also providing by statute [...] "basic civil rights and appropriate benefits to same-sex couples and other nontraditional relationships." [...] Romney quickly joined legislators in attempting to satisfy the Goodridge decision by creating civil unions for same-sex couples. His views were recognized as an attempt to establish his record on a controversial issue while planning to run for the Republican nomination for president. Former Governor Weld took credit for laying the groundwork for the decision: [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> we did foreshadowed the opinion."

2500|$|Although ostensibly over-seeing the {{animated}} Turtles projects through Mirage, Laird had minimal hands-on {{involvement in the}} development of the original animated series, and even less with [...] series. One of the unique products of this series, female turtle Venus, is notorious for becoming one of the additions to the franchise that Laird most despises. However, he took a more active role in the next TMNT animated venture, acting as [...] "a consultant, and... working with the guy I consider the head writer, Lloyd Goldfine." [...] In this role, he says [...] "rom the get-go I've been looking at everything, from day one. Story premises, outlines, the full scripts and the sketching and designing of characters and settings. I've been doing a little drawing myself. Lots of suggestions. I've seen a few of the episodes, and it's neat to see a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I've worked on." [...] While final preparations were underway, he relaunched the official comics canon of the franchise with [...] "Volume Four" [...] (the third published by Mirage Studios), with artwork supplied by fellow TMNT writer, friend, and Rat King creator Jim Lawson. When the new series proved a success, Laird relaunched Tales of the TMNT to accompany the fourth volume.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most {{significant}} storylines surrounding the couples union was <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> John Paul and Craigs affair being revealed to other characters within the series, particularly Craigs girlfriend (Sarah). [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aftermath <b>stuff</b> is really good," [...] Burnet cited. [...] "We changed a hell <b>of</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it. It came out initially script stage and its {{in the same}} week as another major storyline so we went and spoke to producers and manipulated the scripts slightly with the director, Nigel Keane, and the consequence was a fantastic four episodes to end it on, I think. Something real." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the August 1991 Guitar World interview, May {{spoke about}} <b>the</b> mixing <b>of</b> song. [...] "For some reason, 'I Can't Live with You' was almost {{impossible}} to mix. It {{was one of those things}} where you put all the faders up and it sounds pretty good, and you think, 'We'll work on this for a couple of hours.' Then it gets worse and worse and worse. We kept going back to the rough mix. It's got an atmosphere to it. I think it sounds so special because we kept a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demo <b>stuff</b> on it.

2500|$|Bates said {{on using}} themes and motifs in the score, [...] "Very few {{movies that are}} made these days are fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold {{identifiable}} themes. Even {{with the majority of}} the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally." [...] He felt that Guardians of the Galaxy did not fit this model, and [...] "unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters" [...] that appear in it. Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as [...] "the most rewarding aspect of stepping into a movie like this". Gunn asked for [...] "something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember", and Bates came up with the theme by [...] "noodling" [...] on an electric guitar. The villain Ronan's theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme. His presence is generally represented with tones [...] "chock full of low-brass" [...] and synths. Bates has [...] "some spongy synthesizers pulsing through" [...] the motif for Groot, which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the [...] "frenetic working process" [...] on the film.|$|E

[...] He had so little money that he lived like [...] "a subway rat, pale and frail, trying hard to believe in" [...] the novel he was writing. He later said, [...] "A <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> I came up with was pretty fearsome, facing some personal devils head-on. I couldn't distinguish between the world and the book. At one point, I was so stressed out, I passed out in Penn Station." [...] As he told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer after the book's publication, [...] "It's all a matter of trust. You're {{right in the middle of}} this story. [...] You don't know the end of it. It's this preposterous tale about these preposterous people, and you don't know what's going to happen next, and you're tired of eating chicken livers and fettuccine, and you're alone in this little square concrete apartment, there's no air or earth, and pretty soon it was hard for me to distinguish what was going on in my head and what was going on on the outside."

They lit a stinking fire on a kind of lava slab there was before me, and brought in a lot of gory muck--the worst parts of what they were feasting on outside, the Beasts-- and burnt it all in my honour.

It's extraordinary the different ways different people have of showing respect. If I'd had a hatchet handy I'd have gone for the lot of them--they made me feel that wild. All this time I sat as stiff as company, not knowing anything better to do. And at last, when nightfall came, and the wattle joss-house place got a bit too shadowy for their taste--all these here savages are afraid of the dark, you know--and I started a sort of 'Moo' noise, they built big bonfires outside and left me alone in peace in the darkness of my hut, free to unscrew my windows a bit and think things over, and feel just as bad as I liked.
