40|$|Recommendations on {{backpack}} <b>loading</b> <b>advice</b> {{restricting the}} load to 10 % {{of body weight}} and carrying the load high on the spine. The effects of increasing load (0 %- 5 %- 10 %- 15 % of body weight) and changing {{the placement of the}} load on the spine, thoracic vs. lumbar placement, during standing and gait were analysed in 20 college-aged students by studying physiological, biomechanical and subjective data. Significant changes were: (1) increased thorax flexion; (2) reduced activity of M. erector spinae vs. increased activation of abdominals; (3) increased heart rate and Borg scores for the heaviest loads. A trend towards increased spinal flexion, reduced pelvic anteversion and rectus abdominis muscle activity was observed for the lumbar placement. The subjective scores indicate a preference for the lumbar placement. These findings suggest that carrying loads of 10 % of body weight and above should be avoided, since these loads induce significant changes in electromyography, kinematics and subjective scores. Conclusions on the benefits of the thoracic placement for backpack loads could not be drawn based on the parameter set studied. status: publishe...|$|E

In her early career as a regular on the Smothers Brothers variety show of the late-1960s, French portrayed a {{somewhat}} spaced-out or ditzy hippie named Goldie O'Keefe. The character was originally introduced, in an ostensible studio-audience interview segment, as Goldie Keif; both [...] "Goldie" [...] and [...] "Keif" [...] were slang terms for marijuana at the time. Reportedly, the slight name change to O'Keefe when she became a semi-regular was at the television network's insistence. Her segment of the show was called [...] "Share a Little Tea with Goldie." [...] At the time, [...] "sharing tea" [...] was a popular euphemism for getting high on marijuana. Following suit, her segment consisted largely of [...] "helpful" [...] household <b>advice</b> <b>loaded</b> with sex and drug-related double-entendres.|$|R
40|$|Thermo King as a {{supplier}} of {{mobile refrigeration equipment}} is interested in {{more information about the}} airflow distribution inside a refrigerated trailer in various loading conditions to optimise the performance of the refrigeration units. A more efficient way and/or more uniform way of keeping the internal environment inside the refrigerated box at the required conditions will increase the quality of the cargo as well as causing less damage to the environment. The objective of this project is to develop a testing environment that makes it possible to conduct airflow tests for the purpose of learning more about the internal airflow of a trailer. This test environment will be {{in the form of an}} hydraulic transparent test rig representing a scaled model o f a refrigeration system. The test environment must be able to simulate multiple unit configurations in the form of different airflow volumes, and different configurations of air inlet and outlet positions. Different cargo configurations inside the trailer will be used to simulate different types of <b>loads.</b> Secondly, <b>advice</b> and recommendations on the improvement of airflow as well as ideas for further research will be discussed. It is recommended that the project be continued by future researchers to obtain more extensive results from the simulation environment developed and created during this project. Real flow investigation and improvement in airflow distribution should be developed and tested to enable Thermo King to make a more efficient, competitive and more environmentally friendly refrigeration unit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn a fire, {{the thermal}} stress upon window glass {{caused by a}} {{temperature}} difference between exposed and shaded areas is the key factor contributing to glass fracture. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effects of different shaded conditions on the glass when it is exposed to fire. Eleven different shading cases were simulated using finite element method (FEM) software, called EASY, which was developed by the authors and verified accurately by theory. The glass surface temperatures, stress field, the time and location of crack initiation and crack propagation were presented. It was found that the center shaded case is a safer way to protect the glass from cracking and the four corners shaded case has greater probability of cracking. The stress and fracture models for shading glass can be applied in predicting the probability of crack initiation, the distribution variation of temperatures and the stress time history under certain thermal <b>loads.</b> Furthermore, practical <b>advice</b> to optimize the window installation design or ways of shading to protect the glass from falling out in a fire can be obtained from the results...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) retrofitting of RC structures against blast loading is {{an emerging}} research area of major significance. Currently, several guidelines {{are available for}} the FRP retrofitting of RC structures against monotonic and seismic <b>loads.</b> However, no <b>advice</b> is provided from these guidelines for the retrofit RC structures against blast loading. This paper formulates a layered model that allows for both FRP strengthening and the consideration of strain rate effects on the blast resistant capacity of flexural structural members. The layered model is incorporated into a single degree of freedom model for dynamic analyses and it is validated with blast tests. The validated model is then used in a parametric study which investigates the changes in strength, ductility and energy absorption capacities of flexural FRP strengthened members under blast loads. It is found that the capacity of a flexural member to resist a blast load can be increased greatly {{with the use of}} compressive face plating with the ductility of the flexural member being the key factor.
