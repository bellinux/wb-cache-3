5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{can only be}} made in the presence of confirmed <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> (types A and C) or a portosystemic shunt (type B), as its symptoms are similar to those encountered in other encephalopathies. To make the distinction, abnormal liver function tests and/or ultrasound suggesting <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> are required, and ideally liver biopsy. The symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy may also arise from other conditions, such as cerebral haemorrhage and seizures (both of which are more common in chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease).</b> A CT scan of the brain may be required to exclude haemorrhage, and if seizure activity is suspected an electroencephalograph (EEG) study may be performed. Rarer mimics of encephalopathy are meningitis, encephalitis, Wernicke's encephalopathy and Wilson's disease; these may be suspected on clinical grounds and confirmed with investigations.|$|E
5|$|After {{struggling}} with the rare <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> primary sclerosing cholangitis for several months, Payton died on November 1, 1999, aged 45, from cholangiocarcinoma. His legacy includes the Walter Payton Award, the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, and a heightened {{awareness of the need}} for organ donations.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or hepatitis C), alcoholic <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. hepatitis C infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} research on the association between Helicobacter infection and <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> mostly the influence of Helicobacter on <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> The prevalence and bacteriology of Helicobacter during the development of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> the mechanism by which Helicobacter causes <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> and the diagnosis of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> are reviewed. So far consensus has been reached that three species of Helicobacter are associated with human <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> namely H. pylori, H. heilmanni, and H. cinaedi. H. pylori has been studied most extensively, {{but there is little}} research on the latter two. H. hepaticus is a new type of H. pylori.

40|$|Chronic <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> in {{children}} represent a rising problem with significant effects on public health. In fact, several pediatric <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> are precursors of adult chronic hepatopathies, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> {{in children}} is unknown. In the USA, every year, 15, 000 children are hospitalized for <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> but these disorders {{continue to be}} under-recognized or diagnosed late. The main reason {{is due to the}} frequent absence of symptoms {{in the vast majority of}} <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> especially in the early stages. In the last few decades several advances have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> permitting the discovery of new therapeutic targets to treat <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> thus improving the natural history of these disorders.

40|$|In recent years, gut microecology has {{attracted}} increasing attention {{because of its}} {{close relationship with the}} development and progression of various <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> and associated complications. The impairment of liver function can disturb gut microecology, whereas the imbalance in gut microecology in turn promotes the aggravation of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> This paper reviews the relationship between gut microecology and various <b>liver</b> <b>diseases,</b> and discusses the role of modulating gut microecology in the treatment of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> A new idea is provided for the prevention and treatment of <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> based on the modulation of gut microecology...|$|R
5|$|Conditions {{and risk}} factors that {{predispose}} to pneumonia include smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chronic kidney disease, and <b>liver</b> <b>disease.</b> The use of acid-suppressing medications—such as proton-pump inhibitors or H2 blockers—is {{associated with an}} increased risk of pneumonia. The risk is also increased in old age.|$|E
5|$|In a small {{proportion}} of cases, the encephalopathy is caused directly by liver failure; this is more likely in acute liver failure. More commonly, especially in chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease,</b> hepatic encephalopathy is triggered by an additional cause, and identifying these triggers can be important to treat the episode effectively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Liver</b> <b>disease</b> {{may present}} itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
40|$|Knowing how {{to prevent}} and treat {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) earlier is essential to improving outcomes.

5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{can occur}} in those with acute or chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease.</b> Episodes can be triggered by infections, GI bleeding, constipation, electrolyte problems, or certain medications. The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the build up of ammonia in the blood, a substance that is normally removed by the liver. The diagnosis is typically made after ruling out other potential causes. It may be supported by blood ammonia levels, an electroencephalogram, or a CT scan of the brain.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{may also}} occur after {{the creation of}} a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E

5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This {{has been shown to be}} incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease</b> are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease.</b> The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a greater likelihood of complications and death.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{an effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical treatment or in those with advanced chronic <b>liver</b> <b>disease.</b> Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the levels of total (TSA) and free (FSA) sialic acid in acute and chronic <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> Materials and Methods. The serum TSA and FSA levels were determined in 278 patients suffering from acute and chronic <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> of different etiologies. TSA was estimated by enzymatic method and FSA by the thiobarbituric method modified by Skoza and Mohos. Results. There were no significant differences in the serum TSA concentration between <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> of different etiologies, although in most of the <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> the mean TSA level was significantly lower than that in the control group. In contrast to TSA, the concentration of FSA appears to differ between <b>liver</b> <b>diseases.</b> In toxic hepatitis it was higher than that in nonalcoholic cirrhosis. However, neither of them differs between alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis or between liver tumors and tumors with cirrhosis. Conclusions. We conclude that the changes in concentrations of TSA and FSA during the same <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> indicate significant disturbances in sialylation of serum glycoproteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} and perfection {{of the assessment}} system for chronic <b>liver</b> <b>diseases</b> have a guiding significance for clinical diagnosis and treatment.
