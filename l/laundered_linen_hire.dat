The washing machine, detergents, other chemical additives {{and the water}} supply were eliminated {{as the source of}} contamination. It was found that the linen introduced into the washing machine had a high B. cereus spore content and that this was still present after the wash process. The spores were not killed by either the heat disinfection stage of the wash or the addition of chemical disinfectants and were not removed by the dilution in the process. The multiplication of B. cereus was thought to have occurred on used, damp linen stored in plastic bags, particularly when ambient temperatures were high. An increase in the water flow through the washing machine was the only measure associated with a decrease in B. cereus on <b>laundered</b> <b>linen...</b>|$|R

25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{ran from}} 25 May to 2 July at locations in Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Majorca. Chesterfield F.C.'s Saltergate stood in for Wembley Stadium, the Baseball Ground, Carrow Road, and Bloomfield Road. Saltergate {{was chosen because}} it had not undergone any significant structural modifications since the 1970s, though some repainting work {{was done by the}} production team to differentiate the grounds from each other. The car park outside Elland Road was dressed to look like the Leeds training ground (until the move to the training facilities at Thorp Arch in the early 1990s, Leeds United's training ground was indeed located right next to the stadium). Other locations used in Leeds include Headingley Stadium, the former site of Cookridge Hospital, and a <b>linen</b> <b>hire</b> firm in Armley. The recreations of the television interviews (based on those conducted on the regional news show Calendar) were filmed at the same location as the originals, these being the Yorkshire Television Studios in Kirkstall Road, Leeds. Further exteriors scenes were shot in Armley, Beeston and Adel. The training ground used by Derby County was the quarry football pitch which is nearby to the Elland Road Stadium.|$|R

If you read the Ladybird book “Florence Nightingale” 2 {{you will not}} {{discover}} that she was the first woman to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society. In looking around for an area of research I was intrigued to discover that Florence Nightingale, who I always thought of as the “lady with the lamp”, was a competent Mathematician who created her own type of statistical diagram which she used to save thousands of soldiers from needless death. Florence Nightingale headed a group of 38 nurses who went to clean up the hospitals for the British soldiers in the Crimea in 1854. She found that most of the deaths were due to diseases which could be prevented by basic hygiene, such as typhus and cholera. Her improvements were simple but they had an enormous effect: “She and her nurses washed and bathed the soldiers, <b>laundered</b> their <b>linens,</b> gave them clean beds to lie in, and fed them” 3. When she returned to Britain she made a detailed report to the Government setting out what conditions were like and {{what needed to be done}} to reduce deaths in the hospitals. Nothing was done, so she tried again, making another statistical report and included in it three new statistical diagrams to make data collated by William Farr more accessible to people who could not get their minds around tables of figures. These were her polar area diagrams or rose diagrams, sometimes also known as ‘coxcombs’. The first showed how many men had died over the two years 1854 - 5, the second showed what proportions of men had died from wounds in battle, from disease and from other causes, the third showed how the number of deaths had decreased once “sanitary improvements” 4 had been introduced. I decided I would try to recreate the second of these diagrams which is the most complicated and the most shocking. It is called “Diagram of the causes of mortality in the army in the east”.

40|$|Housekeeping Department {{as one of}} {{the partial}} of a hotel has to keep the {{services}} to the hotel guest. The writer found out that Housekeeping Department has the important role in supporting the hotel operational. This final project report has two main goals, they are to find out what Housekeeping Department's job and how they work on handling their duties in Comfort Inn Hotel Solo. This final project report belongs to descriptive method. To get the data, the writer uses some methods. They are observation, interview, and library study. From the analysis, the writer concludes the job of 5 section on the Housekeeping Department at Comfort Inn Hotel Solo are Executive housekeeper, Room Section, Public Area Section, Linen Section, and Laundry Section. Executive Housekeeper has job in planning work schedules and coordinating all activities of the staff. Room Section is divided into 2 parts, first Room Boy that has duties in keeping guest room clean and also completing the additional needs, and second is Room Supervisor that has duty in controlling the work of Room Boy. Public Area Section is also divided into two parts, Houseman that has job in keeping public area clean, and the public Area Supervisor that has duty in controlling the work of the Houseman. Meanwhile, the duty of linen Section is distributing linen for each room. Finally, Laundry Section has job in providing the equipment and inspecting the operational works for <b>linen</b> <b>laundering</b> and it saving. Whereas, the housekeepers do their jobs can be done through the following ways: Executive Housekeeper gives brief instruction to the Housekeeper Supervisor at the beginning of work hours before the staff work and checks the staff every three hours. Room Section is responsible in keeping sanitation and providing the room need, so that Room Boy cleans the bathroom then checks it everyday. Besides, Room Supervisor controlling the work of Room Boy by leading and then checking the work of the Room Boy every one hour. In the other hand, Public Area Supervisor is leading the work of the Houseman to keep public area clean. While, Linen Section distributes the linen to the rooms after getting list from the Room supervisor. Finally, Laundry Supervisor leads Laundry Section.
