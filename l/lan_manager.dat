Thus, any compromise of the user's password automatically leads to access to that data. Windows can store versions of user account passphrases with reversible encryption, though {{this is no longer}} default behaviour; it can also be configured to store (and will by default on the original version of Windows XP and lower) <b>Lan</b> <b>Manager</b> hashes of the local user account passphrases, which can be attacked and broken easily. It also stores local user account passphrases as NTLM hashes, which can be fairly easily attacked using [...] "rainbow tables" [...] if the passwords are weak (Windows Vista and later versions don't allow weak passwords by default). To mitigate the threat of trivial brute-force attacks on local passphrases, older versions of Windows need to be configured (using the Security Settings portion of Group Policy) to never store LM hashes, and of course, to not enable Autologon (which stores plaintext passphrases in the registry). Further, using local user account passphrases over 14 characters long prevents Windows from storing an LM hash in the SAM – and has the added benefit of making brute-force attacks against the NTLM hash harder.|$|E

40|$|WLANs (Wireless LANs) are a {{cost-effective}} solution for impossible or hard-to-wire locations. WLANs are gaining popularity {{because they are}} easy to deploy and provide ubiquitous access to enterprise resources from anywhere in the campus. However, Enterprises and Campuses must become fully aware of the security and management implications of adding wireless technologies to their network. Organizations must tightly integrate wireless LANs with wired <b>LANs.</b> Network <b>managers</b> are reluctant or unwilling to deploy wireless LANs unless those LANs provide the type of security, manageability, and scalability offered by wired LANs. Since wireless LANs broadcast data over the air using radio waves, virtually any wireless LAN client in the area served by the data transmitter can access that data. It is impossible to direct a wireless LAN transmission to only one, intended recipient. So data privacy and security becomes a real concern. This article explains how a campus-wide WLAN solution can have tight security by providing dynamic, per-user, per-session WEP, and by deploying other security features like "Mutua...|$|R
