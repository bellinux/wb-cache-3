25|$|Panesar, {{along with}} Swann, was {{selected}} for the first Test of the 2009 Ashes series, held at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, as England opted to utilise two spinners. On a pitch which was expected to turn, his bowling appeared unthreatening, only taking one wicket in 35 overs. He did make a contribution with the bat as he and James Anderson blocked out the final 11½ overs of the match, denying Australia their final wicket and salvaging a draw for England. In view of his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration,</b> Panesar was dropped {{for the remainder of}} the series, not appearing again in the Test team until 25 January 2012.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the third}} day, Australia batted poorly and lost wickets {{regularly}} to shots {{more suited to}} one-day cricket. Jones made 56, but when bad light ended play two hours early, the side was 164 for seven wickets, 62 runs short of the follow-on. In tense cricket on the fourth morning, they failed to reach that figure by 12 runs, and Gatting enforced the follow-on. With the pitch getting slower and easier, Marsh and Boon put up a first-wicket partnership of 162 and after Marsh went for 56, Boon batted on and on across the final day, eventually reaching 184 not out, his then-highest Test score, as Australia got to 328 for two to save the match. They were helped {{by the loss of}} more play to bad light (when Gatting recalled fast bowler Dilley to the attack), injuries to both Dilley and Foster and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> among the other England bowlers.|$|E
25|$|Visibility may be poor, {{because of}} sediments or algae {{in the water}} and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> light <b>penetration.</b> This means that survey {{techniques}} that work well on land (such as triangulation), generally can not be used effectively under water.|$|R
40|$|Welding defects {{detection}} and classification {{is very important}} to guarantee the welding quality. Over the last 30 years, there has been a large amount of research attempting to develop an automatic (or semiautomatic) system for the {{detection and}} classification of weld defects in continuous welds using radiography. In this paper, we describe an automatic system for classification of welding defects from radiographic images and compare with KNN and SVM classifiers. We classify and recognize the linear defects such as <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetrations,</b> incomplete fusion and external undercut. Experimental results have shown the classification method is useful for the lengthy defects and obtained through our method is better than the two classifiers methods...|$|R

An FRC is a magnetized plasma configuration notable for its closed field lines, high Beta and <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>penetrations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|He was a spin bowler, bowling leg breaks. He {{never quite}} {{lived up to}} early {{expectations}} of being the next great Australian leg spin bowler, taking 53 wickets {{at an average of}} [...] 38.07. He made his Test debut against England in the Fifth Test of the 1970-71 Ashes series after taking 6/69 and hitting 55 not out in the New South Wales match against the tourists, but did little and was dropped. Recalled for the vital Seventh Test on the spinning SCG pitch he took 3/48 and 3/96, but it was not enough to win the game and save The Ashes. He did however have some success with the bat averaging 25.76 and being called upon to open the batting in the second innings of the Centenary Test. One statistic that O'Keeffe himself uses to demonstrate his <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> with the ball is that he is the bowler with the highest percentage of wickets out 'caught' in the history of Test match cricket (44 out of 53 wickets, 84%) This is typical of his commentating style of making fun of his bowling abilities. He often talks of an incident during the 1972 Australian tour of England, when he appealed against a batsman for leg before wicket, and the umpire turned him down, saying that the ball was [...] "doing too much", meaning that the ball was spinning so much that it would have turned away from the stumps. O'Keeffe said that the umpire's comment was a sarcastic jibe at his inability to spin the ball, something he likes to mock himself about.|$|E

40|$|An intense {{activity}} of enzymes which actively {{participate in the}} renin-angiotensinaldosterone system was shown in extravillous trophoblast cells which {{are involved in the}} performing of spiral arteries into uteroplacental vessels. The hydrolase activity in villous trophoblast underwent important variations, but it was constant in cells of the extravillous trophoblast. Activity of lysosomal hydrolases, of leucine aminopeptidase and N-acetyl glucosaminidase type, was markedly positive in X-cells, while negative in the villous trophoblast. Beta glucuronidase activity has shown moderate activity in cells of extravillous trophoblast, while in villous trophoblast it was weakly emphasized or negative. Intense {{activity of}} prostaglandin E 2 dehydrogenase in the way of strongly emphasized microsomal reaction was noted exclusively in extravillous cells of basal plate, especially in perivascular cell groupings. Within all examined enzymes activities, only the membranous activity of alkaline phosphatase was of the same intensity in cells <b>of</b> extravillous trophoblast. <b>Lacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> these cells into the spiral arteries wall in EPH-gestosis, which also means loss of their close contact with the blood of a pregnant, implicates the practical meaning of these observations...|$|R

30|$|The <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> {{increased}} <b>penetration</b> into lesional atopic skin has two practical implications: Most importantly, it yields increased {{confidence in}} the biosafety of the particle as {{there will be no}} increased contact with viable tissue, at least under the conditions tested here. Such increased penetration into diseased skin is always of concern for nanoparticles [9]. On the other hand, it also means that such an increased penetration cannot be used as a “targeted delivery system” simply by having carrier and the loaded drug preferentially penetrating into lesional skin but not into the adjacent, healthy skin. However, as the <b>penetration</b> enhancement effect <b>of</b> CMS on loaded drugs does not seem to depend on the <b>penetration</b> <b>of</b> the particles themselves [8], it remains to be investigated whether there is an effect of such a barrier alteration on the rate <b>of</b> <b>penetration</b> enhancement by CMS.|$|R
