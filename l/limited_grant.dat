40|$|In {{the modern}} era, we have almost {{completely}} {{lost track of}} the relationship that the Framers of the United States Constitution perceived between the structure of our federal system and the protection of popular rights. At least two obvious components of this confusion persist. First, as we have come to think of rights almost exclusively in terms of the claims of individuals against the government, we have lost the ability to hear the Framers 2 ̆ 7 voices referring to rights held by the people in their collective capacity, including the rights of the people within each of the sovereign states to be free from undue federal intrusion on their power of self-governance. Second, our familiarity with the modern judiciary 2 ̆ 7 s reliance upon specific textual rights provisions as trumps against otherwise valid claims of legislative authority has blinded us to the fact that claims based on lack of governmental authority are also individual rights claims. Most Americans, and even many legal thinkers, find it difficult to fathom that the Framers of the unamended Constitution saw this <b>limited</b> <b>grant</b> of authority as an adequate alternative to a comprehensive statement of rights in a declaration or bill of rights. These modern tendencies of thought have been powerfully reinforced by the reality that the Framers 2 ̆ 7 expectations of significantly limited federal authority have been largely swept aside in the twentieth century. This expansion of federal power may have been inevitable, in which case the Framers were wrong in assuming that the <b>limited</b> <b>grant</b> of authority would be a sufficient means for securing a wide range of rights in our system of fundamental law. In this article, the author argues that even if this were true, however, it does not warrant the modern tendency to denigrate their position as disingenuous or obviously implausible, let alone to refuse to acknowledge their argument for limited federal authority as its own distinctive form of rights discourse...|$|E

40|$|The {{last decade}} has seen {{increased}} competition amongst voluntary organisations.

Voluntary organisations compete not only for limited numbers of volunteers but also for <b>limited</b> <b>grant</b> funding made available at local, state and federal government levels. Increased competition has placed pressure on organisations to take a more commercial approach to the management of their organisations and to adopt what have been previously considered ‘for profit’ business practices such as marketing. This empirical study uses neo-institutional theory as the basis for investigating the marketing of nonprofit organisations, focusing on the ‘Bushcare’ program in NSW. It uses the neo-institutional concept of "mimetic isomorphism" to examine the extent to which competitive pressures are forcing nonprofit environmental volunteering organisations to copy each other and grow more homogenous in terms of their marketing strategies. The managerial implications are apparent when organisations are faced with the challenge of attracting new volunteers, since from an institutional perspective, the most commonly accepted practices are not necessarily the most efficient...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose an intuitionistic fuzzy {{technique}} for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) multi-criteria decision making method for the selection of start-up businesses in a government venture capital (GVC) scheme. Most GVC funded start-ups fail or underperform compared to those funded by private VCs due to a number of reasons including lack of transparency and unfairness in the selection process. By its design, the proposed method is able to increase transparency and reduce the influence of bias in GVC start-up selection processes. The proposed method also models uncertainty in the selection criteria using fuzzy set theory that mirrors the natural human decision-making process. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed method first presents a set of criteria relevant to the selection of early stage but high-potential start-ups in a GVC financing scheme. These criteria are then analyzed using the TOPSIS method in an intuitionistic fuzzy environment. The intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging Operator is used to aggregate ratings of decision makers. A numerical example of how the proposed method could be used in GVC start-up candidate selection in a highly competitive GVC scheme is provided. Findings – The methodology adopted increases fairness and transparency in the selection of start-up businesses for fund support in a government-run VC scheme. The criteria set proposed is ideal for selecting start-up businesses in a government controlled VC scheme. The decision-making framework demonstrates how uncertainty in the selection criteria are efficiently modelled with the TOPSIS method. Practical implications – As GVC schemes increase around the world, and concerns about failure and underperformance of GVC funded start-ups increase, the proposed method could help bring formalism and ensure the selection of start-ups with high potential for success. Originality/value – The framework designs relevant sets of criteria for a selection problem, demonstrates the use of extended TOPSIS method in intuitionistic fuzzy sets and apply the proposed method in an area that has not been considered before. Additionally, it demonstrates how intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS could be carried out in a real decision-making application setting. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing <b>Limited.</b> <b>Grant</b> Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR P 103 / 15 / 06700 S]; project NPU I Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [MSMT- 7778 / 2014]; European Regional Development Fund under the Project CEBIA-Tech [CZ. 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 03. 0089]; Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University [IGA/FAI/ 2015 / 054...|$|E

40|$|The {{so-called}} “Vesting Clause” of Article II of the Constitution, {{which provides}} that “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America,” stands in apparent {{contrast with the}} Article I Vesting Clause, which provides that “All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States.... ” This textual difference, usually bolstered with historical materials, has long undergirded {{the claim that the}} Article II Vesting Clause implicitly grants the President an array of residual powers not specified in the remainder of Article II. This argument, which we call the “Vesting Clause Thesis,” was famously advanced by Alexander Hamilton in his first Pacificus essay defending President Washington’s 1793 Neutrality Proclamation. In recent years, the Vesting Clause Thesis has gained newfound popularity. White House officials were apparently prepared to deploy the argument in support of the Bush Administration’s authority to use military force against Iraq had not Congress expressly granted such authority. And Professors Saikrishna Prakash and Michael Ramsey recently defended the Vesting Clause Thesis at length in an important article in the Yale Law Journal. The Thesis also has received recent support from Professor Phillip Trimble, and qualified support from Professor H. Jefferson Powell. This Article critiques the Vesting Clause Thesis on both textual and historical grounds. As for text, the difference in wording between the Article I and Article II Vesting Clauses can be explained on a number of other plausible grounds and need not be read as distinguishing between a <b>limited</b> <b>grant</b> of legislative powers and a plenary grant of executive power. As for history, the narrative that is offered by proponents of the Vesting Clause Thesis has two central features. First, it presents a story of continuity, whereby European political theory is carried forward, relatively unblemished, into American constitutional design and practice. Second, the narrative relies on what could be called “executive power essentialism” – the proposition that the Founders had in mind, and intended the Constitution to reflect, a conception of what is “naturally” or “essentially” within executive power. We argue that this historical narrative is wrong on both counts. Among other things, the narrative fails to take account of complexity within eighteenth century political theory, the experience of state constitutionalism before 1787, and the self-conscious rejection by the Founders of the British model of government. The narrative also understates {{the degree to which the}} constitutional Founders were functionalists, willing to deviate from pure political theory and essentialist categories in order to design an effective government...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{sustainability}} measurement and scoring system for assessing the efforts of organizations at meeting sustainability targets. Using technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) as the basic framework, the proposed method incorporates all three sustainability dimensions – economic, environmental and social – to establish a threshold below which an organization is considered to have failed a sustainability test. In Addition, an introduction of a time-independent threshold enables a clearer comparison of performance of organizations over time. The proposed method includes plots for visualizing the sustainability performance of organizations under review. Design/methodology/approach – The proposed method first assigns target values to a hypothetical organization. TOPSIS is then used to generate composite scores in which the score of the hypothetical organization is set as the threshold below which organizations are deemed to have failed a sustainability test. Using the square of the closeness coefficient of TOPSIS, the final composite score is decomposed into three components to reflect the contribution of the three dimensions of sustainability to serve as a guide to determining which dimension to focus on for improvement. A relative comparison score is then proposed to track the performance of organizations over time. Findings – The proposed method with its ability to set a threshold is able to determine organizations that have passed a sustainability test from those that have failed. The tracking of organizational performance over time also serves to highlight progress being made by organizations to meet an agreed sustainability target. Results from the application of the proposed method for evaluating sustainability of banks under the three dimensions of sustainability highlight its practical applicability. The proposed method can also be applied to a wide range of comparison problems including make-or-by decisions and award selection. Practical implications – As most industries and organizations become conscious of the pressure to adopt sustainable practices, the proposed measuring system would help identify those that are meeting sustainability targets as well as to track their progress over time. Originality/value – Most sustainability measurement indicators rarely have thresholds to determine whether an organization has met or failed to meet a sustainability test other than ranking them from top to bottom. The proposed method provides a threshold as well as a procedure for tracking the sustainability performance of organizations over time. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing <b>Limited.</b> <b>Grant</b> Agency of the Czech Republic [GACR P 103 / 15 / 06700 S]; research project NPU I by Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [MSMT- 7778 / 2014]; European Regional Development Fund under the Project CEBIA-Tech [CZ. 1. 05 / 2. 1. 00 / 03. 0089]; Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University [IGA/FAI/ 2015 / 054...|$|E
