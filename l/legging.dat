5|$|Many early Northern sports {{players were}} {{working class and}} needed to miss work to play, with their teams {{compensating}} them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, {{and led to the}} schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret <b>legging,</b> although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the amount}} of traffic and the slow process of <b>legging,</b> the Harecastle Tunnel was {{becoming}} a major bottleneck on the canal. It was decided to commission a second tunnel to be built by Thomas Telford. Due to advances in engineering, it took just three years to build, and was completed in 1827. It had a towpath so that horses could pull the boats through the tunnel. After its construction it was used in conjunction with the Brindley tunnel, with each tunnel taking traffic in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Diamondbacks led {{off what}} would {{ultimately}} be a 6–5 victory on July 21 over the visiting Nationals with back-to-back-to-back home runs off Scherzer, {{the first time}} in Nationals history that an opponent had blasted three consecutive home runs in a game and the first time it had happened to Scherzer. The Nationals rallied to win the second game of the series behind a revamped pitch arsenal from starter Roark, who befuddled Diamondbacks batters by ditching his four-seam fastball and mixing in a heavier-than-usual dose of curveballs. Facing rookie starting pitcher Anthony Banda in his major league debut, Harper crushed a 467-foot home run onto the Chase Field concourse in right-center field — the longest home run of his career to that point — to extend his hitting streak to a career-best 15 games. Heisey suffered a groin injury while <b>legging</b> out a pivotal triple in the 4–3 contest and was placed on the 10-day disabled list. Left fielder Ryan Raburn was also assigned to the bereavement list, taking leave to attend his grandfather's funeral. Washington recalled catcher Pedro Severino and selected the contract of outfield prospect Andrew Stevenson to take Heisey and Raburn's roster spots. Stevenson made his major league debut in the July 23 rubber game, being inserted mid-game to replace Wilmer Difo in left field and going 0-for-2 at the plate. The Nationals won 6–2, but Strasburg exited the game just two innings into his start with forearm tightness, with Blanton picking up the win in relief. The Nationals announced July 25 that Strasburg had been treated for a nerve impingement. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list, with top pitching prospect Erick Fedde tabbed to make a spot start in his place. Raburn was transferred from the bereavement list to the disabled list with a trapezius strain on July 26. The Nationals recalled Solis to give them an extra reliever the next day, bringing the bullpen up to a total of five left-handed relievers. First base coach Davey Lopes returned the same day after an extended leave of absence.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} ferret <b>legging</b> is disputed. The sport {{seems to have}} become popular among coal miners in Yorkshire, England, in the 1970s, though some Scots claim it gained {{popularity}} in Scotland. According to Marlene Blackburn of the Richmond Ferret Rescue League, ferret <b>legging</b> originated in public houses [...] "where patrons would bet on who could keep a ferret in his pants the longest." [...] The sport may alternatively have originated during the time when only the relatively wealthy in England were allowed to keep ferrets used for hunting, forcing the animal poachers to hide their illicit ferrets in their trousers to avoid detection by gamekeepers. This was also done by poachers and hunters to keep the animals warm in the cold weather.|$|E

[...] The belt that holds on a pair of the chaps may be the same color of leather or of a contrasting color, sometimes is fringed in the back for show, but usually not on a working outfit. [...] Decorative leather designs or fancy stitching may be added {{along the edge}} of bottom of the leg or to the belt, and even sterling silver pieces may be used for buckles, and on round decorative metal conchos placed to cover the lacing on the back of the belt, or occasionally even at the bottom of the <b>legging,</b> by the heel.|$|E

2500|$|Armitas are {{an early}} style of chaps, {{developed}} by the Spanish in colonial Mexico and became associated with the [...] "buckaroos" [...] or vaqueros of the Great Basin area {{of what is now}} the United States. [...] They are a short <b>legging</b> with completely closed legs that have to be put on {{in a manner similar to}} pants. [...] They are sometimes a bit longer than chinks, but still stopping above the top of the boot, fringed on the sides and on the bottom to reach the boot tops, attached by a fringed belt.|$|E
2500|$|The Golden Valley Light Railway (GVLR) passes {{less than}} [...] North of the tunnel's Eastern Portal.

2500|$|Most chaps, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Armitas (which have no metal parts), usually have a small metal buckle in front to attach around the waist, and have lacing {{on the back of the}} belt area to allow adjustment in size.

[...] The sides of some designs, particularly the batwing style, either have straps and relatively small metal buckles or snaps to attach the <b>legging</b> around the rider's leg. [...] Other styles, particularly shotguns, usually use full-length heavy-duty metal zippers. [...] Some historic styles of riding chaps used a single break-away leather string or lace instead of a front buckle. The original purpose was to break away if a rider's chaps' belt somehow became hooked over the saddle horn.|$|E

2500|$|Shotgun chaps, {{sometimes}} called [...] "stovepipes", were {{so named because}} the legs are straight and narrow. [...] They were the earliest design used by Texas cowboys, in wide use by the late 1870s. Each leg is cut from {{a single piece of}} leather. Their fit is snug, [...] wrapping completely around the leg. [...] They have full-length zippers running along the outside of the leg from the thigh to just above the ankle. The edge of each <b>legging</b> is usually fringed and the bottom is sometimes cut with an arch or flare that allows a smooth fit over the arch of a boot. Shotguns do not flap around the way the batwing design can, and they are also better at trapping body heat, an advantage in windy, snowy or cold conditions, though unpleasant in very hot or humid weather. Shotgun chaps are more common on ranches in the northwest, Rocky Mountains and northern plains states, as well as Canada, and are the design most commonly seen in horse show competition for western riders, especially western equitation. English riders who wear full-length chaps also usually wear a shotgun style, sometimes without fringe.|$|E
2500|$|Writers at GamesRadar {{have stated}} that, as Sonic Adventure {{was one of}} the first sixth {{generation}} console games, [...] "the gaming world was changed forever" [...] despite the presence of some glitches. Travis Fahs of IGN asserted in 2010 that it is still remembered as the most impressive Sonic game from after the Genesis era and that, despite Sega's efforts, no post-Dreamcast Sonic game has achieved similar success. Taylor Cocke of Joystiq has stated that the original Sonic the Hedgehog and Adventure both succeeded and innovated in gaming—among 2D and 3D games, respectively—by feeling [...] "good to play" [...] and making effective use of linear level design. In 2009, GamePro listed the game as the seventh-best platformer of all time, asserting that while it had not aged well in certain respects, its core gameplay remained among the best of the series. According to game journalists Rusel DeMaria and Johnny L. Wilson, Sonic Adventure [...] "wasn't a strong enough title" [...] and [...] "failed to catch on with players in nearly the way that Mario 64 had done," [...] "though it had many fascinating features, including the use of the Tamagotchi-like memory card to incubate eggs for little pet creatures" [...] and [...] "some good action segments." [...] In a 2006 retrospective, Retro Gamers Sean Smith noted that while Adventure had its problems, it [...] "still looks luscious and plays extremely well." [...] Writing in 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die, Kieth Stuart described Adventure as [...] "Sonic Team's flawed masterpiece", praising its [...] "vast, twisting environments" [...] and noting [...] "From driving bumper karts in Twinkle Park to <b>legging</b> it down the side of a skyscraper in Speed Highway, the game brilliantly captures traditional Sonic elements." ...|$|E
