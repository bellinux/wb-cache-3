50|$|A {{firewood}} processor is {{a machine}} designed {{to cut and}} split firewood with minimal manual handling of the logs. There are typically four main parts of the machine, each dedicated to a separate function. Processing begins with a <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> - a pile of logs that have been de-limbed and cut to an appropriate length, generally 10 - 12 ft. Popular brands include Wood Beaver, DYNA, Multitek and Blockbuster. Many individuals use processors commercially and also privately as a hobby. Others choose to rent them {{as an alternative to}} purchasing.|$|E

50|$|Barricading {{himself in}} the house, Roberts ignored both his wounds and the Regulators' gunshots, and armed himself with a single-shot Springfield rifle. The stymied Regulators tended to their wounded and implored Roberts to surrender. Frustrated that none of his men were willing to {{approach}} the house, Dick Brewer circled around the main house, took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where Roberts had fortified himself. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the <b>log</b> <b>pile,</b> sighted in and fired when Brewer raised his head, striking the cowboy {{in the eye and}} killing him. The Regulators, demoralized by their casualties, retreated and then left town immediately after sending a doctor to check on Roberts.

Stunned {{by the turn of}} events, the Regulators tended to their wounded and tried to get Roberts to come out. Frustrated that none of his men dared to approach the fortified adversary, Brewer circled around the main house, and took cover behind some stacked logs and opened fire on the room where the wounded man was lying prone on a mattress in front of the barricaded doorway. Roberts, seeing the cloud of gun smoke from the <b>log</b> <b>pile,</b> opened fire when Brewer put his head up again, striking the cowboy in the eye.

50|$|Many {{mountain}} bike riders prefer singletrack over {{other types of}} trails, as singletrack is usually designed specifically for the sport, and therefore can have elements which highlight features of the sport (whereas other trail types will usually be more straight, and not exhibit as many hills and other special features). Some singletrack includes TTF's (technical trail features) designed to challenge riders, such as <b>log</b> <b>piles,</b> <b>log</b> rides, skinnies, rock gardens, gap jumps, and wall-rides.|$|R

An opera-tional model grapple was designed and tested to validate grabbing forces of the mathematical models while grab-bing logs from five alternative diameter classes under two different working conditions. The working conditions and log sizes affected the grabbing forces significantly. Vali-dation results suggest that the mathematical models de-veloped can be used to estimate the grabbing forces re-quired in the design process of log grapples.

When they go inside, they find themselves coming face to face against a bizarre machine designed to turn trees into toothpicks. They also make artificial logs. They find a room with furniture made of wood. The furniture then goes on a truck. The gophers get a rubber pipe and one of the gophers breathes into the pipe and turns green. The truck then leaves the factory. The gas is left all on the street providing evidence for the gophers to find out where the truck went. The truck then runs out of gas and one of the men says [...] "Are you sure you filled up before we left?" [...] The other says [...] "Yeah, I'm sure we filled up before we left."

5000|$|Led {{by their}} captain (Sessue Hayakawa), the pirates storm the island. The family manages a brave defense but are sorely pressed. Their {{defenses}} include pits with a tiger in one pit, rock piles, a <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> and coconut bombs (hollowed out coconuts filled with gunpowder with a fuse), {{all of which}} cause problems for the attacking pirates. When the pirate leader waves a white flag the family imagines they have routed the pirates, but the pirates instead are sneaking {{around the back of}} the fort. Francis' much-maligned [...] "pirate alarm" [...] is the only thing that warns them of the surprise attack. They begin defending the fortress but are soon down to only a few shots with their muskets. At this critical moment, a ship appears on the horizon captained by Roberta's grandfather (Cecil Parker) and fires its cannons while the retreating pirates are trying to make a desperate escape. The cannon fire hits the pirate ship while the family rejoices. Father, Mother and Francis choose to remain on the island with Duke, Turk, and Francis' collection of animals while the Captain notes that Father will likely be recommended as Governor of the new colony. As for the rest of the family, Ernst chooses to return to Europe with the rescuers in order to enroll in a university to continue his studies while Fritz and Roberta plan to marry and make New Switzerland their home.|$|E
40|$|Fungal stain {{in value}} added {{hardwood}} {{has resulted in}} the loss {{of millions of dollars in}} downgraded timber over the past few years in Victoria (Vinden 1994). The causes of fungal stain in Victorian hardwoods, particularly Eucalyptus regnans and Eucalyptus delegatensis, were determined at J. L. Gould Sawmill in Alexandra, Victoria. Systematic sampling of the logs in the <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> under sprinklers revealed a complex ecological niche of fungi, many of which are capable of causing stain. Further studies on logs with incipient decay identified Penicillium glabra as the fungus potentially responsible for the yellow stain and Ophiostoma sp. as the fungus potentially responsible for the black stain. A mill audit pinpointed areas in the processing procedure in need of improvement. Log storage times must be radically reduced and storage facilities must be improved to provide an environment that does not encourage fungal growth. A study concentrating on the moisture content of logs in the <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> also revealed the need for an improved water sprinkling system.

30|$|Research {{projects}} {{using the}} LCA approach {{have already been}} undertaken to investigate the reductive effect on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to use of wood. In prior research that has focused on civil engineering in particular, Kayo et al. [6] compared the life cycle GHG emissions of construction methods used as countermeasures against liquefaction of the ground, namely the sand compaction pile method, the cement deep mixing method, and the <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> method. Noda et al. [7] and Kayo et al. [8] compared the life cycle balance of CO 2 and economic effectiveness of check dams made of concrete, steel, and wood. All of these previous studies confirmed the GHG or CO 2 emission reducing effect of using wood {{as a substitute for}} other materials.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the capabilities of the Impedance Log method in profiling the geometry of a pile along its length. The main idea of this method is to introduce a transient stress wave into the pile and then utilize the reflected signals to obtain the impedance profile of the pile. Any anomaly, which results in changes in impedance, would be detected by this method. In this study, four model piles with plan defects of weak zone or neck were constructed and tested using Seismic Echo, Impulse Response, and Impedance <b>Log</b> <b>pile</b> integrity nondestructive testing methods. Results of these tests show that interpretation of signals using the Impedance Log method is more straightforward than the other two methods. It is concluded that the Impedance Log technique is a tool with high potential for evaluating the integrity of piles...|$|E

30|$|Investigation of the {{effectiveness}} of replacing other materials with timber in alleviating global warming requires the concept of life cycle assessment (LCA), which takes into account the environmental burden of a product throughout its entire life cycle, from resource extraction through product manufacture and use to disposal. Various studies using the LCA method have already been carried out with respect to the reduction in life cycle CO 2 emissions achieved through the use of timber. Previous studies of structures other than check dams include Jönsson et al.’s [5] evaluation of the life cycle CO 2 emissions and other environmental effects of linoleum, vinyl, and wood as flooring materials. Börjesson and Gustavsson [6] compared the life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of wooden and concrete building construction. Petersen and Solberg [7] compared the life cycle energy consumption, GHG emissions, and cost of the use of laminated wood and steel in the construction of Oslo airport. Kayo et al. [8] compared the life cycle of GHG emissions from a sand compaction pile, cement deep mixing, and a <b>log</b> <b>pile,</b> which are used as measures against soil liquefaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{value to}} fauna of dead fallen wood or coarse woody debris (CWD) in Australian forest {{ecosystems}} is well established. Reptiles use logs for shelter, to lay eggs and as basking sites, while mammals may use logs for shelter or for nesting (Bell 2004, Grove and Meggs 2003, Lindenmayer et al. 2002). Mac Nally (2006) has also demonstrated {{the reliance on}} CWD of certain bird species. Consideration of CWD is therefore important for forest restoration. However, there is only limited information to guide decisions on the quality, condition or configuration of CWD in practical habitat reconstruction activities (Mac Nally et al. 2001). The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the response of selected faunal groups to varying quantities of CWD, routinely returned as piles of logs (Brennan et al. 2005), in the restoration of a jarrah forest ecosystem following bauxite mining in the south-west Western Australia. In particular, do increasing densities of log piles in mines sites simply provide more habitat, or do the shorter distances between <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> habitats resulting from higher densitities facilitate animal movement (Lindenmayer et al. 2002) and therefore the rate of recolonisation...|$|E
30|$|We {{compared}} the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from a <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> (LP) to those from a sand compaction pile (SCP) and from cement deep mixing (CDM) as measures against soil liquefaction, assuming that forest and waste management scenarios influence the GHG (CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O) balance of wood. We found little {{difference between the}} LP and SCP methods with respect to GHG emissions from fossil fuel and limestone consumption. However, GHG emissions from the CDM method were seven times higher than emissions from the LP method. In the GHG balance of wood, when the percentage of CH 4 emissions from carbon in underground wood was lower than 3.3 %, permanent storage in the log achieved greater reductions in GHG emissions than using the waste log as fuel in place of coal or heavy oil. In order to obtain reductions in GHG emissions by replacing SCPs or CDM with LPs, sustainable forest management with reforestation and prevention of CH 4 emissions from the underground log are essential. Using reforestation, permanent storage of the log, no CH 4 emission from the log, and using logging residues instead of coal, the LP can achieve reductions in GHG emissions of 121 tonnes of CO 2 per 100 m 2 of improvement area by replacing CDM.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Wood drying is one {{of various}} stages in the {{carbonization}} process, therefore proper monitoring is key to improving yield and obtaining quality charcoal. Prior to being subjected to carbonization by charcoal production plants and once trees have been felled, <b>logs</b> are <b>piled</b> up by the roadside or close to carbonization furnaces and left air drying for 90 days until an optimal 30 % moisture content is reached. This work aims to evaluate air drying of logs from an Eucalyptus urophylla clone for carbonization use, analyzing moisture reduction over time and also the influence of log diameter and bark. Logs with and without bark were used, 6. 0 cm to 21. 0 cm in diameter, 3. 60 m in length, with average basic density of 0. 496 g/cm 3, obtained from a commercial stand of Eucalyptus urophylla at age 8 years. Air drying <b>log</b> <b>piles</b> were arranged outdoors in Paraopeba, Minas Gerais State, Brazil and monitoring consisted of periodic log weighing {{for a period of}} 80 days. At the end of the experiment, higher rates of moisture loss were observed in the three initial weeks. Moisture in logs without bark (54 %) and with bark (50 %) was close after 80 drying days, with a higher level of moisture reduction being observed for logs without bark. Bark influence on moisture loss was more pronounced in the first three weeks. Moisture reduction varied in intensity as a function of log diameter. After 80 days, the highest level of moisture reduction was observed in logs without bark: 65 % for logs larger in diameter and 80 % for logs smaller in diameter. As regards logs with bark, results were 56 % and 75 % respectively. Key words: Charcoal, <b>log</b> <b>piles,</b> moisture content...|$|R
30|$|Due {{to these}} earthquakes, much damage was {{triggered}} by ground liquefaction that occurred in Kumamoto City and surrounding area of the Kumamoto Prefecture, such as rupturing and cracking of the ground surface and ground subsidence {{which resulted in the}} settlement of buildings and residential houses. In many major previous earthquakes, the resulting liquefaction often caused damage through differential settlement which eventually led to permanent tilting of buildings and structural damage as seen in the 2011 Great East Japan earthquake disaster. Massive liquefaction-induced damage appeared in the city of Urayasu, where more than 9000 residential houses were affected. This major catastrophe leads to an awareness and the importance of safe housing design, particularly against liquefaction. As a result, research related to liquefaction countermeasures became more intensified. Currently, many companies and research institutes are working on developing liquefaction countermeasure for buildings and for residential houses. Several researches and studies have been conducted related to the impact of liquefaction on residential houses during earthquakes, such as the 2010 – 2011 Christchurch earthquakes (Cubrinovski et al. 2012), the 2011 Tohoku Pacific earthquake (Tokimatsu & Katsumata 2012) and the much earlier study of the 1990 Luzon earthquake (Tokimatsu et al. 1994). Various liquefaction countermeasure methods had been proposed, for example, implementing shallow ground improvement (Tani et al. 2015), using a sandy soil layer (Koseki et al. 2015), installing sheet-pile walls around the housing foundations (Rasouli et al. 2015) and by using <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> under foundations (Yoshida et al. 2012).|$|E
40|$|Compared {{to natural}} forests, coarse woody debris (CWD) is {{typically}} scarce in restored forests {{due to the}} long {{time it takes to}} develop naturally. In post-mining restored forests in the Jarrah forest of south western Australia, CWD is returned at densities of one <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> per hectare. We tested the adequacy of these densities for meeting the micro-habitat requirements of Napoleon's skink (Egernia napoleonis), a species rarely found within restored sites. Home range size and overlap, and micro-habitat densities used by skinks, were measured by radio-tracking 12 individuals in natural, unmined forest. Napoleon's skinks had small home ranges (0. 08 ± 0. 02 ha), based on 8 individuals with sufficient fixes. All skinks overlapped in home ranges, with average overlaps of 43. 5 ± 8. 6 %. Ten of the 12 skinks shared micro-habitats and 4 shared them simultaneously, which indicates some social tolerance. This will influence as to how many micro-habitats are required. Micro-habitats were used at high densities: logs at 49. 2 ± 8. 8 ha - 1 and woody debris piles at 12. 4 ± 4. 8 ha - 1. Based on these densities, it is recommended that CWD is returned to restored forests at densities of 60 ha - 1, which should provide sufficient micro-habitats for multiple skinks. Due to the infeasibility of returning such CWD densities across large areas of restored forest, CWD could be preferentially returned as patches, large enough for numerous home ranges, adjacent to unmined forest, or as corridors between unmined forest. These recommendations for returning micro-habitats should be tested for effectiveness in encouraging recolonization of restored forest by Napoleon's skink and other species...|$|E
40|$|Restoration, {{through its}} {{potential}} to reduce {{the negative effects of}} habitat fragmentation, is becoming increasingly important in saving global biodiversity. However, evidence is increasing that passive faunal recolonization of restored areas may take centuries for some species, subsequently reducing, or negating, any restoration benefits for those species. Reptiles have been identified as typically the slowest vertebrate group to recolonize restored areas due to their low vagility and, often, specific thermal and microhabitat requirements, but relatively few studies have examined their recolonization of restored areas. We examined reptile recolonization patterns in pits restored after bauxite mining in eucalypt forests in south-western Australia to identify filters that slow, or prevent, reptile return and identify practices that reduce the effect of these filters. Three species, the skinks Cryptoblepharus buchananii and Egernia napoleonis and the gecko Christinus marmoratus were slow, or failed, to recolonize restored mine-pits. All rely on slow developing microhabitats (e. g. coarse woody debris and tree hollows) for shelter so the absence, or scarcity, of these microhabitats in restored forest is likely the unidirectional filter slowing their recolonization. Our work on E. napoleonis suggest that coarse woody debris densities need to be much higher (~ 50 logs ha- 1) than current restoration prescriptions (1 <b>log</b> <b>pile</b> ha- 1) to accelerate recolonization by that species. Another skink, Morethia obscura, was common in unmined forest and rapidly recolonized restored areas but disappeared as restored areas matured. Thinning and burning was an effective management strategy to facilitate recolonization by this species but its effects were short-term (< 7 years), indicating that overdense vegetation structure is a dynamic filter that influences recolonization by this species, probably due to thermal requirements. Our study shows active management of restored areas to facilitate and accelerate faunal recolonization is required for some species, to maximise biodiversity benefits from restoration. Provision of coarse woody debris and planting species at densities that will approximate the structure of reference communities are two strategies likely to facilitate faunal recolonization in many forested ecosystems. Techniques to accelerate the formation of slow-developing microhabitats are poorly developed and are an important area for future research...|$|E

50|$|A {{mountain}} bike or mountain bicycle (abbreviated Mtn Bike or MTB) is a bicycle designed for off-road cycling. Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes, but incorporate features {{designed to enhance}} durability and performance in rough terrain. These typically include a front or full suspension, large knobby tires, more durable wheels, more powerful brakes, and lower gear ratios for climbing steep grades. Mountain bikes are typically ridden on mountain trails, singletrack, fire roads, and other unpaved surfaces. This type of terrain commonly has rocks, roots, loose dirt, and steep grades. Many trails have additional TTF's (Technical Trail Features) such as <b>log</b> <b>piles,</b> <b>log</b> rides, rock gardens, skinnies, gap jumps, and wall-rides. Mountain bikes are built to handle these types of terrain and features. The heavy-duty construction combined with stronger rims and wider tires has also made this style of bicycle popular with urban riders and couriers who must navigate through potholes and over curbs.|$|R
